{"text":"We came starving and left stuffed.  Always loved and still adore their calamari. Add the breadsticks and chicken/gnocchi soup...couldn't even finish my main course.  What we 'took' for dinner will probably be for brunch tomorrow.  

Jerry our server was amazing! He was the only one in our section so I can't say service was speedy, but he was always smiling and gracious with each party even though I could see 1 party getting anxious.  The fact that he kept his composure, professionalism, and remained gracious - I commend that kind of service. Kudos, Jerry! 

OG management, perhaps improve scheduling during the lunch rush?"}
{"text":"My favorite location, Summerlin right across from Red Rock Resort.  Olive Garden's food is good, but the tiramisu dessert is the reason why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I am with my basketball team and we go to this Olive Garden. The waitress Melissa sits us down and tells us our meal plan. She follows that up with \"my manager was nice enough to let you guys have soft drinks, so don't suck them down because I will not be refilling them quickly.\" I ordered Peach Bellini Tea and didn't receive a gosh darn peach. Salad was good though. 2 stars and that's generous."}
{"text":"I came here with my basketball team. Stellar service! Lots of refills and breadsticks. 10/10 would come back"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here today, the food was great and the service was great. I just don't like spending $50 on two meals I can make and serve myself .. Which I am the one who went there to pay, I just feel it's a little bit over priced, as most restaurants ... But over all the waitress made it well worth our visit, she had a light lovely personality !"}
{"text":"Prices & food is alright. Was in recently & they've discontinued the italian wedding soup & italian sodas & we used to order those items each time we visited the restaurant. This place is seriously showing its age lately & is honestly in need of a good deep down cleaning, fresh paint & new carpets, tables & chairs. This restaurant is in the exact same condition but worse as it was the first time I ate here 20 years ago. Come on Olive Garden - how much money have you made at this location & won't pay for 1 pail of paint?!."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say that I love our local Olive Garden in Rochester, MN.  I love Olive Garden's menu, so we dine out at the chain somewhat regularly.  We went to this particular restaurant yesterday for a dinner with an elderly relative.  I suppose when we walked in, they profiled us and didn't feel we merited any kind of special or polite treatment.  We were led to the most cramped, dingy and dark booth I had ever seen in an Olive Garden restaurant, where the lighting was so bad, we couldn't even see our menus.  Our server was Sergio, and he was just going through the motions--quite badly.  He didn't smile once, or come back and ask us how we were doing.  He brought the salad, and then we didn't see him for a half hour or more.  Then he came and picked up our salad plates before he served our entrees and actually left the dirty salad plates on the tray beside our cramped dungeon-like table for a long time.  To top everything off, the family behind us were the rudest, most uncouth trash I have heard or seen in some time--they need their own reality show on some trashy network.  Their 2 or 3 year old brat was allowed to screech inhumanly for their whole meal, which unfortunately overlapped ours.  When we finally got our food, it was hot (unbelievably) and tasty, but everything else about the visit was a complete and total fail.  I would be surprised to imagine that the Olive Garden franchise can condone this kind of service and atmosphere.  Luckily I was just traveling through and don't have to ever eat at this hellhole again."}
{"text":"Very good the food amazing facility very clean!! Serves awesome! Id come back again!!
Just wish there was one in the downtown I think it would do very well!!"}
{"text":"I had a real good experience here.  being from hawaii we got no olive gardens  I have to say hands down excelent customer service and great food selection  I opted for soup as a starter and they do refills on it.  shared the tour of Italy with the wife ,  they even seperated it for us, big thumbs up for that.  great deserts too."}
{"text":"Having been to Olive Garden numerous times in the past, and always having decent experiences, I expected the afternoon family meal on November 16th to go no different.....but I soon realized just how wrong I was. Walking thru the restqurant, it was hard to not notice how dirty the floors were. Even our table had spaghetti left from the previous table occupiers.  We  sat at our table for over 10 minutes before our server came to as our drink order. Our server started by mentioning this was her first day (that should have been my first clue). Our server even had trouble mentioning the names of the various food names correctly... (should have been clue number two). We ordered drinks, received them and then placed our food order. We wanted a appetizer...three choice sampler,  and then we all ordered fettuccine alfredo....two with chicken and one plain, two with salad and one with the pasta fagioli. We also ordered a child's spaghetti.....
 We received our two orders of fettuccine with chicken ...and the child's spaghetti ...then the appetizer. The plain fettuccine was forgotten...and long with the soup. Having had the pasta fagioli every time I visit Olive Garden, this soup tasted bitter and watered down. 
After our meal,  we ordered 3 raspberry dolcinis. ..that were brought to us with forks...which barely fit in the small cup the dessert is served in...normally they would have come with a spoon, but the server told us she was instructed to serve them with a fork. We requested spoons, since eating them with a fork was a bit much.
Having eaten at Olive Garden countless times before, it will be hard to come back and spend another $81.24..(check # 67514) .minus tip for thus type of meal. There are too many options, and restaurants that go above and beyond to provide exceptional service."}
{"text":"I don't recommend. The food was disgusting and service was very slow."}
{"text":"2.5 stars really

Pros:
+Food is decent and you're pretty much guaranteed the same flavor/quality/choice as always.
+Tiramisu is really delicious

Cons:
-Waitstaff and bartenders are pretty bothered by customers, even during non-busy periods (like mid-afteroon, 3pm, on a weekday)
-One of the managers has no class, lecturing an employee less than 7 feet from out table (and at levels easily within ear-shot). That should never happen.
-Just hits the bare minimums for average, but doesn't really feel like it should get 3 stars.

Try somewhere else, unless you're really particular to their food, in which case, being the large chain it is, you won't be disappointed by."}
{"text":"For a huge corporate run chain this place has awful service. My 2nd and last visit here ended even worse than the first visit 3 months ago. Server spoke 2 words the entire visit, had to ask for refills which the the server filled with a completely different beverage, bread sticks burnt, soup was never refilled and the server never offered. The picture is of my empty soup bowl sitting on the table while 4 servers watched sports on TV and chit chatted amongst each other. I could have went to Fazoli's and had better service with better food and saved $30!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for five or so years. Yet lately it seems that the service and the time of a typical dinner at this location have both headed into murky waters. There is no clear agenda to be unique, just to take your money for the check and to pop you through your meal like a car on the assembly line. My advice would be to find a way to make this olive garden feel less of corporate mandate and drive service. This will keep your restaurant's wallet share per customer higher and you won't share it with local italian competitors."}
{"text":"Great food but even better service!!  We were seated by an obnoxiously loud group of people when our waiter Shelly along with her 2 managers went above and beyond to show appreciation for our patience - they gave us a \"patience cake\" that was really nice and delicious.  We will definitely go back because of that!  Just the fact that they acknowledged the problem is amazing, then to \"sweeten\" the situation topped it all off or us.  Great job Olive Garden!!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat at this location... customer service is always pleasant and the food is mostly great. There are times they put out  new recipes and I have to try it... it's a 50/50 chance your gonna like it, but that's anywhere. Anyways, I recommend this location. Mostly for the service, but food is really good too."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service was amazing, the hostess , the server, but I'm giving them  3 stars because of the food. I'm not expert , but the pasta was tasteless, no flavor at all.  the salad and the bread sticks were good !! like i said great service , bad pasta ........!"}
{"text":"The little point of sale device on the table was a waste of space and only a way to sell game play time. They are so inn our face saying \"make sure you pay\". I hope they removed these so Olive garden will return to being a nice friendly place to eat instead of money grabber."}
{"text":"Wow, the service here couldn't be any slower or shittier. 45 minutes for salad and breadsticks and 15 just to get a glass of water??"}
{"text":"I always choose to come to this location because of the quality of service I receive each and every time. 

I was immediately greeted upon entering the door and seated. The hostess was very friendly. Our waiter, Kory, was personable and professional. He offered us a free wine sample which my husband gladly accepted. 

I love the Moscato Primo Amore wine they offer. It's my absolute favorite wine. If you haven't already tried it, you must! 

I ordered the Chicken Marsala and it had a lot of sauce which most places don't do. I loved it."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience there today during my office Christmas party .... our server Kelsey was efficient, friendly and attentive to the needs of all ten at our table!!! Great food! The bartender is awesome as well!!!"}
{"text":"I went to the Olive Garden during the week on a Wednesday and there was no wait time to get in. We got seated Fast and set up with free salad and breadsticks, the salad was good as usual but the breadsticks seemed to be very salty and not as cheesy with a hint on parm as I remember from my past visits. But other than that everything was pretty good as expected."}
{"text":"Your basic Olive Garden. The food is consistently good, with an occassional miss. Wish they would keep kids out of the lounge - it should be as kid-free space at all hours. They need to invest in upholstery cleaning. The booth seats are gross."}
{"text":"Maaan I'm not puttin No stars up, Ya'll close at 10 but giving me food at 9 looking like 10. Service Bad at this one, damn how many times do I gotta ask for breadsticks & water refill. Food looks like sum1 made it outta a box, shoot I could've made this, don't say I shouldve that's not the point, I come for 1 thing, it don't matter what time of day or Nyt food should look & taste the same....Olive Garden is good but Boo this one!!!  Skip my server also Craig, took his sweet ass time...smh....I guess I gotta put 1 dumbass star....the review was blank for a reason!"}
{"text":"Usually, I'm quite satisfied with this chain Italian restaurant.  Last week I went for lunch and was skipped over twice for seating.  The hostess, although very nice, seemed overwhelmed.  Good food for the money, but oftentimes too crowded."}
{"text":"We went here because we had a gift card.  The food was very good, actually  better than we expected.  The hostess seemed slightly stressed out, but there were people everywhere, so I'm not sure how you couldn't be.   It was very crowded and there were servers actually waiting in line to ring in orders, but our waitress Jennifer was great! She was very efficient and very nice.  The menu seems way to big, I'm not sure how they pull it off but we would definitely go back.   
Sadly, most people on yelp are so happy to complain,  I'm happy to share a very good experience."}
{"text":"I love the food, and the staff is always great. I think it would be great if you banned smoking within 50 feet of the entrance. Some people with lung disease have problems walking through clouds of cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service and the attitude I got from a waiter who didn't know what he was talking about but assumed I didn't know what I was talking. I come here quite often and can't stand crappy service in something as simple as asking if I need more water not once  did that happen. Actually think it might be time to find a new location."}
{"text":"Great meal and excellent service. Angela, the manager, was awesome. She came by several times to ensure we had everything we needed and just to say hello. The food was fresh and treated great. Thank you."}
{"text":"I went to Olive Garden with my friends for lunch today. Our waitress, Tina, was in a bad mood the entire time. When she brought out soup she split soup on my friends phone and didn't even notice! And it wasn't even her soup; she ordered salad! After she brought our soup she disappeared. She took our soup bowls and walked away before we could order more. Finally we caught her attention and was able to get more soup. One of my friends asked for more water and she filled up hers but nobody else's. Then I ordered more soup and it took over ten minutes to get it! Oh, and a pile of dirty dishes were sitting next to our table almost the whole time. Lastly, it took forever for her to take our checks. And it took forever to get our checks back and she didn't bring my change back..."}
{"text":"Service and food is fine, but overpriced. The atmosphere and the display of the food is more for show than what you really get. It reminds me of heat and serve places."}
{"text":"Amazing food, as always. The wait staff is wonderful the majority of the time. My only complaints are: they don't mention the unlimited soup/salad/breadsticks promo on weekends to discourage customers from purchasing; and once one of the waiters gave me a short lecture about how I was \"forbidden\" from sharing the aforementioned special with my mother, whom I was dining with. Besides that one rude waitress, I am a fan - always!"}
{"text":"Great service! Our waiter (Chris) was very attentive and sweet. The food was good but he made our visit even better by checking in with us to ask how our meal was and answer our questions regarding the food. He listened to our needs and seemed to genuinely care about treating customers with kindness and respect. He would be an excellent example and model for other fellow employees to follow! Thank you Chris!"}
{"text":"The servers here are very aggressive for tips. A few weeks ago my parents (late 70's early 80's) asked the server to take the check to the front since they weren't comfortable with the table top computer. Instead, the server used the table top computer, and made them choose a tip amount while she was standing there. Last night my wife and I went with them, and the server asked us to relocate to the bar after we were done because \"they needed the table.\"  When we left, there was only one other couple waiting to be seated. I can only assume he was next up for seating, and didn't want to miss another tip, even though I gave him a 30% tip because I knew we would want to stay awhile to visit with my parents. He was quite nice, and approached the subject tactfully, but when there was no one waiting other than the one couple, it gave me the impression he just wanted us out of there. 

I hardly ever go to Olive Garden, but the next time I do, it certainly won't be to this location. There are many others to choose from, and I think whoever trains the servers needs to teach them better customer service, not just food service."}
{"text":"On 4th of July, my fiancé and I decided to have dinner here. I don't always have good service at Olive Garden (depending on location) but this time was different! Our server Colin M was wonderful!! Very young and sweet. He definitely had fun with us during our dine in. Times like that is why we go back!! We made 2 orders and both times were extremely timely. Our parents were happy with their dinner at home as well. Thank you Colin M for the PERFECT service!! :) We will request you next time we dine."}
{"text":"My wife's favorite Italian restaurant. Very nice clean , friendly staff , priced right good portions."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst Olive Garden any where. Food was like warm asiago cheese sauce was like a form if paste and the the sausage meatballs were about a hour over cooked. I asked the waiter to cut one and he couldn't.  Can not believe darden Restarants allow this to continue."}
{"text":"Mixed review.  The food is good, nothing to write home about.  Biggest complaint is that they don't answer their phone.  I was attempting to plan a nice evening at home with my wife and wanted to place an order for a To Go meal.  I tried for over an hour to contact them by phone and there was no answer and there is no internet ordering option..  I double checked the number with the Olive Garden website and it was correct."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at this Olive Garden. My boyfriend and I just moved here from out of state. I've been craving Olive Garden for some time so we thought we'd go out tonight for a date night since I'm leaving for a week early tomorrow morning. We moved from a small town and I didn't think about how busy it would be since it was Saturday night. We got there and the wait was about 45 mins. It was almost an hour before we got seated. We were seated in the same section with a large party. Our waiter was Tim. He came over and got our order. He was less than friendly. My boyfriend had a big lunch so he just ordered soup and I made my own pasta. I asked if I could get half Alfredo and half marinara. He said \"oooh I don't know. I'll have to check.\" I knew they were busy so I said if not I'll just take all marinara. 

We pulled up the bill on the screen at the table and he added a $1.79 charge to split the sauce. I don't understand why because I wasn't asking for extra, I just wanted half and half. He didn't tell me that it would be extra. Later on, I heard the large group next to us ask if they could switch something out and he said that it would be an upcharge. Not sure why he didn't want to tell me that. The next time he came back, he dropped off our drinks, my salad and my bf's soup. He never asked if my bed wanted his soup at a specific time, just brought it with my salad. I asked if he could change my pasta to just marinara and he said he didn't think so. 

He left and came back about 2 mins later with my pasta and said they had already made it. I hadn't even been able to take a bite of my salad yet. I had just enough time to put it on my plate. It felt like he was trying to rush us out of the restaurant. The salad was also DRENCHED in dressing. It was more like a little lettuce with my dressing or soup. From the time we sat down to the time we got ALL of our food it was 13 mins. I've never felt so rushed. I was so irritated. He brought out some more bread sticks and another bowl of soup for my bf.  Then he came over and put the receipt on the table and didn't say anything. I put money on it and he asked if we needed change. We said yes. When he brought the change back he threw it down on the table without chocolates. He probably realized that he wasn't getting a tip and for the first time might have realized that we weren't happy, yet he didn't say anything. 

As we were walking out, I asked at the hostess stand if they don't give out chocolates anymore. They said no we do, why? I said our waiter didn't give us any but it could have been because he was terrible. The manager over heard me and inquired about what happened. I explained all of the stuff above and she apologized profusely. She gave us a gift card for more than our dinner was and asked that we please come back and give them another chance. She is the only reason this is not a 1 star review. She definitely felt bad and was not happy with the way we were treated. I just wish that Tim had realized that his service was terrible."}
{"text":"I would give a better rating but there was some issues with my stop at this Olive Garden. Our Waitress Kory was really nice and polite. Our problem was that I took a while for the food but then the didn't make some of my parties orders or forgot items as well as took a long time to bring things out. Also to note one thing that I didn't like but I know can't be changed is the entrance to the location. It is a little annoying to get into. At least the manager chose to take the \"late\" food off the check so that was a plus. They also provided a large table for my party in a back corner so there wasn't many people around us. Well that's all I got for this dinner."}
{"text":"The only reason I give \"5\" stars is for take-out it is great! They go over your order before you take-away so that everything is there. I know this is not gourmet but if you do not feel like cooking then \"OG\" at this address work's. I wish I could remember the folk's names that assisted me, but all of the folk's are very nice! The Bartender is really great! Very spot-on! For the ladies you have some \"eye-candy\" going on.......BIG-TIME! Guess I should mention the food. It is always \"OG\" perfect.....I love this place.......blah blah blah........I have never dined in house, so cannot say a thing. If you want great food to go from this particular establishment @ this address then go......"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best that I have every gone to the serves is the best I had ever had they all ways friendly and are quickly to refill drinks and refill there salads and unlimited bread sticks there food is always quick to come out after you order the chicken Alfredo is the best with a salad they are a very cheap restaurant but have great foods and services"}
{"text":"we went to celebrate my sons \"15\" birthday we told them as soon as we walked in . the server took a super long time to come get our order . Then forgot my daughters drink . It took forever to get our meal. we told this waitress twice that it was my sons birthday and that we were here to celebrate and still nothing. After twenty minutes passed , We asked if he could get some ice cream or something to celebrate. She brought a small ice cream and stated she couldn't sing if we could help which we did we understand maybe she was shy.   Not the place to go to celebrate your party . :("}
{"text":"Ordered a Grilled Chicken Cesar Salad this past Thursday. It was, without question, the worst I have ever had in my life. Spoiled iceberg lettuce, very little chicken, too, which tasted like rubber. I hate to say it--however, McDonald's would have beat it and for a much better price point. It gets worse: My friend had a sausage dish. He ended up getting horribly sick within an hour of eating his meal. Throwing up and everything. He was perfectly fine before eating. I would have given this place one star, but our server was extra kind and the soup we had wasn't all that bad."}
{"text":"There are two things I love about this place. The food never fails to be extraordinary for price,  and it's so quiet here, you can actually carry on a conversation without screaming at each other. We sat at the bar, which is never too busy. My friend had the chicken Alfredo and I  had the shrimp scampi. Honestly, you can't make food this good at home without spending hours shopping,  cooking, and cleaning up. It's a tremendous value for the money,  and the waitstaff are a lovely bunch."}
{"text":"This is the most visited restaurant, I don't even remember how many times :-). 
I have had mixed experience with food and service. Sometimes excellent and sometimes poor. I personally don't like the wait time which varies from 10 to 50 mins. 
Very good for its salad, minestrone soups, bread, customized pasta, bruschetta, cheesy risotto bites, flat bread."}
{"text":"We couldn't have asked for better food or better service.  There wasn't a long wait time for our food and we enjoyed playing the in-house trivia apps while we waited.  Our waitress, Elicia was AWESOME!  She was so nice and checked on us often.  We will definitely go back to this location."}
{"text":"My experience this time was just as expected, Bad, because I got waited by Sabri** the bi***. Terrible waitress, she likes to ignore you. If you sit around the bar area you won't always get good service. The food was alright, but not hot. There was also a fly around. The managers here offer gift cards just to try to make the customers happy if things go wrong, as if that were enough. They should get rid of all the bad apples instead and hire happy and good wait staff, cooks, etc. Last time for me here. My experience at the Gilbert location was awesome compared to this one."}
{"text":"I came here this Tuesday night to have a quick bite with a friend, but the first thing I saw was 2 people just talking in the receiving/to go area, hostess/manager it seemed. I make my way into the bar area only to find the bartender and a waitress just talking there as well. Every single booth in that area was dirty with all the dishes still there. I really mean all of them! Nobody had picked up anything. I also saw a waiter leaving in such a hurry for the day, I assume that nobody wants to help each other out.  What happened to this place tonight I thought? We got so grossed out of what we saw and just left. 
Never to come back during late dinner hours. The 4 employees I saw were just chit chatting their night away. I really didn't feel like telling them if they could clear a booth for us, when there are so many other great restaurants nearby who do care about their public relations."}
{"text":"great food...great value...gotta go early...usually busy!!!"}
{"text":"My fiance took me here for my birthday in August. We were immediately seated, so far so good. Then our waitress took forever to come to our table and bring our drinks to us. We weren't feeling good about this. Then she brings out the wrong entree for me ( or she put the order in wrong) so we pointed this out. She apologized and took it back and we thought we made a mistake coming here. My fiance didn't want to eat his, finish and wait for me to get mine but what else were we to do? We were prepared to leave a poor tip and a complaint after we finished but before we could decide what to do, the manager came out and apologized profusely. He immediately understood that my fiance didn't want to wait so he kept his plate hot while they made a fresh entree for me. Also he insisted that both our meals be on the house as well as free dessert. We weren't looking or expecting a free meal, just an apology, but it was awesome that he came out and addressed it before we could lodge a complaint. That's proactive and we appreciated it. Mistakes happen but as long as management attempts to make it right, which they did here, means we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm leaving one star because of customer services. My friends and I went here for one there birthday expecting to have a good enjoyable time. We sat down and our waiter didn't even say just straight \"what do you want to drink\" got our drinks. And asked what we wanted to eat my friend order the unlimited pasta and soup. When her soup got there she ate some and then asked me if I wanted to try it so I tried that's it. And she took it back and finished it and asked for another one and he said I have to charge 2.99 for sharing and we then explained that i was just trying and he said \"No I saw her eating it I'm pretty sure she ate most of it\" which wasn't true I tried a little bite of it and didn't even care for it so why would I eat it? and so then we decided we were done and she didn't want more soup. 
He was very fine with other customers but I'm sure it was because we are teenagers. Which in my opinion in very unacceptable because we still tip but if you want that tip treat us right too. 

All the food was good though."}
{"text":"Love it.....but.....the menu changes and one of my favorite appetizers is not on the menu! The artichoke dip with the round pieces of bread.....that was the BEST I have ever had! Went to an Olive Garden in Daytona Beach, Fl and they had it! Please get it back on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I love olive garden, but this one seems to have poor service.  The only reason why I keep coming here is for the salad and breadsticks.  I went here for my birthday this past Saturday and it was probably the best service I got and it still wasn't that great.   The wait wasn't as long as usual but that could be cause it's summer.  I wish they let us enjoy our salad longer, but that's probably cause they don't want us to eat several bowls of it cause it's unlimited"}
{"text":"Not a big fan. Their breadsticks and soups are good, but that's about it.
My Alfredo was very dry, and my friends lasagna did not even look like lasagna. Another time I ordered the Parmesan chicken and it was very dry and not what  I remember Parmesan chicken hasting like.
I will not go to Olive Garden again because I have yet to have a satisfying meal.
Customer service was very good"}
{"text":"After an afternoon of post Christmas shopping with the rest of my family, we were famished & decided to have a pasta night at this place. Upon our arrival, the hostess informed us that we will have to wait for about 30-40 minutes. We were about to look for another place to eat because we were all grouchy, exhausted and hungry but the hostess told my sister that the table was just about ready when she tried to erase our name on the waiting list. We agreed to stay and wait for a few more minutes. The hostess seated and handed us the menu within minutes and we started off with appetizers: fried calamari and hot spinach artichoke and crab dip.

The breadsticks came in first then the salad which I believe is caesar. I've learned from past experiences to never really indulge myself to all those free food to make room for the actual food that we pay for so I ate only a plate of salad and about a couple of breadsticks which I thought were OK.

In about a few minutes our appetizers were served. The calamari tasted really good. But then again, what fried food doesn't taste good, right? The spinach artichoke and crabbed dip was a bit rich to my taste but was very good. It was hot and filled with artcihoke and spinanch which was really good with the bread or celery that you're supposed to spread the dip with.

I can't really vouch for the food that my family ordered. As for me however, I ordered the Tour of Italy which consisted of shrimp alfredo, classic lasagna and chicken parmigiana but I substituted the chicken with eggplant. The shrimp alfredo was bland but the lasagna and eggplant parmigiana were very tatsy and full of flavor. In addition, the eggplant parmigiana was crisp to the bite despite it being soaked in marinara sauce. I was already stuffed to my neck and felt like I was about to explode but I could not resist dessert, the main meal and reason why we eat out anyways, right!?! So we ordered Zepolli which are similar to malasadas except a litlle smaller with a chocolate and raspberry dipping sauce. One serving came with 8 squares of yummy goodness, warm and lightly drizzled in white confectionary sugar. Oh so good!!! 

Another plus is their drinks (except for the alcoholic one of course) are free refills. Would really like to come back to this place before I leave this state..."}
{"text":"The food was good soup and salad combo for lunch, can't get that wrong. The service not so much, we waited on our server much more than she waited on us. Not a good thing. We left a generous tip. Definitely more than she worked for to hopefully brighten her day since didn't seem very happy."}
{"text":"When you're here, you're ignored. 

A friend and I decided to dine at the bar seating area for the soup/salad/breadsticks special for a late lunch, but what should have been a simple routine order turned into a train wreck that evolved into the last time I eat at OG. 

They had employees (including what appeared to be a manager) wandering aimlessly like malfunctioning roomba vacuums, several tables were left un-bussed for almost an hour, and a complete lack of service even at the basic level left us mind boggled. We watched a couple looking around, waiting for a server, but they did what we should have and walked out after several minutes. Despite knowing what we wanted before we arrived, our order wasn't taken until over a half hour after walking through the door. The salad was under dressed, the breadsticks salty, the soup was fine although the lack of service left a poor taste in our mouths throughout the entire meal. Our server disappeared more often than David Copperfield so locating someone to get a check took several minutes after finishing. The manager finally came over and presented the check but then the train derailed. We immediately put two cards down to pay and waited, and waited, and waited. We looked around, made comments, contemplated just leaving. Nobody wanted to take our money. Finally, 15 minutes later our server reappeared from her disappearing act to run our cards we requested to be split. Obviously too difficult of a task as the entire bill was charged to one card. 

I regret leaving any tip at all, but the biggest tip I can leave is avoid this place and find a nice local family restaurant that will appreciate your business. There are plenty of eateries out there that will make you feel like family."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden, so what can I say that you don't already know?  The breadsticks and salad are the best reasons to come here.  The wait can be long, and the service can be hit or miss, but my new favorite thing to do is call in my order for pick up.  They seem to have this side of the business mastered, and it's a surefire way to get quick, friendly service and your food in hand within 15-20 minutes after calling in."}
{"text":"Service Review:
I took my daughter and son in for dinner because she chose Olive Garden for her Birthday Dinner.  I was very pleased with the service and the staff that assisted us, they made it a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Arrived here with family and our server, Charlie, was amazing! He was very attentive and professional!! Thank you so much for making our experience here great. I run into very few servers who honestly love what they do and Charlie was amazing at his job!"}
{"text":"So far  worse service got there needed table for 2.   Asked to wait then a group of 5 a few minutes later and sat them first I couldn't understand my waiter bad English .... Soup was the worst all I had was broth in my zuppa toscana . so disappointed ."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at an Olive Garden in probably 7-8 years, and this was exactly the same as back then. The breadsticks were a little stale, but still ok. I was fairly bland and ordered spaghetti with italian sausage. I assumed it was going to be italian sausage meatballs or something of the like. Nope, it was literally 3 small/med sausages thrown into my spaghetti. Lol. Oh well, can't win them all."}
{"text":"Soup, Salad, and break sticks. We had an awesome waiter named Dylan, absolutely the best service ever and he was new! Great experience and will be asking for him again."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service was excellent. It's hard to find good service. Ask for Tamara!"}
{"text":"Just went on Saturday Olive Garden isn't usually my first choice  but it was really close.  The food was  surprisingly good.  But sometimes the service can really make the experience so much better and that's what happened.  I find it hard to remember when we had a server that was this good. It made the whole experience just wonderful. Thank you  Anthony it was a great pleasure to have you as our waiter  I hope you will still be there next month when we are back in Pittsburgh.   Great job Anthony !"}
{"text":"Food was average but we did show up 1 hour before they close. We sat at the bar, the bartender was awesome and very entertaining. But the appetizer was cold, the soup was cold, and the spaghetti was good. I really must say the Cheyenne location is way better hands down."}
{"text":"Wow. This restaurant is now a fast food chain. Went there for Mother's Day and very disappointed. The food was absolutely terrible. You can tell nothing is fresh other than the salad. all of the food is frozen and or precooked to order. This restaurant chain is crashing and burning with no site or reviving it as a cooked to order specialty restaurant.  I am a personal chef and you might fool the average consumer but not real food people. Sorry \"Darden Restaurant\" you have got it all wrong.! Never eat there again.
#FrozenFood #Salty #OverDonePasta #Microwave #DeepFryer = Olive Garden"}
{"text":"I cannot beiwve how Italian this food is. I think I need to worry about the unions when I visit. Otherwise 10/10 get the soup!"}
{"text":"Went to get the Soup and Salad today and it was a disaster. We sat at the table without being attended to for a good 5+ minutes while all of the servers were hanging out by the front entrance. Finally a server walked by and noticed we had not been helped. He took our drink order and we went ahead and placed a lunch order. He told us that they did not have salad and that they were trying to get more. How does that happen? Whatever, we will still do the soup. They bring out the one bowl of soup and breadsticks and that was the last time anyone stopped by our table. After we ate our one bowl of soup we sat there for 10 minutes and nobody even acknowledged us. At that point we decided to leave because of the poor service. We told the manager on the way out that we had a horrible experience and that we weren't paying for the one bowl of soup. He didn't seem to care. This was a crappy experience. Especially since they were not busy. I can deal with the no salad, it was the lack of service that was inexcusable."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was terrible and being seated took more than an hour when there wasn't anyone else. I will go to another Olive Garden next time!"}
{"text":"This is no longer true. Ordered takeout last night. We only ordered 2 dishes but the online system makes you give the staff an hour - no big deal. So an hour later we go to pick up the food and it's not ready. We waited 35 minutes and we weren't the only ones. At one point, there were 9 people waiting for their to go orders. Now, I was willing to let this go because they've been so courteous about things in the past, but we got no coupons and no compensation whatsoever. 35 minutes waiting for takeout after I've already waited an hour? Absolutely unacceptable, especially for a chain like this."}
{"text":"This is about the SERVICE, not the food.

I was here this week on a business trip and the staff here were on point.

They were friendly, upbeat and could not have been more attentive.

The food is...well Olive Garden, don't come expecting amazing cuisine. That being said their quality standards were to be expected. What really made the difference was the staff, they were earnestly happy (I overheard them talking with one another). They didn't talk trash about their tables like in the movie \"Waiting\" they were the opposite. 

Friendly, polite and attentive, they took their jobs seriously, which can be tough when you work at Olive Garden.

The management seems to be doing a good job of encouraging this environment, so kudos to them."}
{"text":"i feel like this might crush any respect for my other reviews, but i can't deny the OG. those breadsticks, dripped in butter and garlic salt, oh, that sald with the dressing from heaven, oh, and that pasta e fagioli soup! oh! i haven't eaten a \"real\" meal here in years because i can't pass up the soup, salad, and breadstick combo. 

throw in a chocolate almond amore (Baileys Irish Cream, DiSaronno Amaretto, Kahla and ice cream) and you won't dare to generalize all chain restaurants again."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant you can't beat it. Good sauces, great pasta and very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"We come here a lot since its right up the street but forget it now. What a sad shame came here tonight at 5:45.
Excited to try the new spaghetti dishes. We waited 5 minutes for a table even though we were the only ones at the host stand but no problem we happily waited. 5 mins no big deal. We get seated in an empty area we are the only table seated in that area. We waited 15 minutes at the table only for no one to come greet us say they will be right with us NOTHING!!!!! So disappointed with the service we got up and left!!!! The restaurant wasn't even busy for us to have to be waiting around with no one even greeting us. So guess My wife and I won't be trying those new spaghetti dishes unless we drive to a farther Olive Garden, because we won't be eating here ever again. Terrible Service!!!"}
{"text":"They took the Chicken con Broccoli off of the menu!  So bummed!  Luckily the all-you-can-eat soup, salad and breadsticks are still an option at lunch time."}
{"text":"What a difference from the last time. Our waiter was great he was on point and was even joking with us. Next time we go will wait to sit in his section"}
{"text":"First time at this Olive Garden, i went with my friend for early dinner... i have to say for a bill that was $50 i was so very disappointed! our endless salad for two had one olive two tomatoes and a few croûtons.... we had the fried lasagna and fried cheese sticks both were awful! tasteless..the meal was no better, .the whole visit was just terrible...will not go back to this one,"}
{"text":"Jim & Brook went above and beyond for us! My husband has a sesame allergy and have been having the worst luck lately when we eat out that we were at the point where we didn't want to eat out anymore. They went y the kitchen personally and checked ingredients! Awesome people..great experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Got the Tour of Italy.... Chicken Parmesan was fried straight from frozen and nasty. Told the bartender who informed the Manager and he never came by to check on me.. despite slow business and walking by me a few times."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here recently. Food was very good as was the service. A little pricey but good place to eat"}
{"text":"Say what you will about chain restaurants,, but the food here is plain great!  Tried the new tours of Italy & really enjoyed.  I have tried all the italian restaurants in Vegas and this is my favorite.  Service is always spot on."}
{"text":"It's good it's a chain restaurant and the service shows that it's a chain restaurant however price is right food's pretty good and the tables are actually big enough for people to sit and dine at lol"}
{"text":"My first Olive Garden experience ever! So much cheese and so much wine! Great place. Desserts were out of the world! Must visit place."}
{"text":"I visit olive garden regularly and this one has terrible service. Food was just fine but the wait staff was one of the worst."}
{"text":"Are here last night for the first time in forever. I forgot why I never go. Terrible time. Hostess were so rude. She put me in an awkward table that 3 people bumped into in the 8 mins I sat there, without being greeted. I asked to move. I got moved to a booth where it took another 13 mins to get greeted. Service was so slow. Everything tastes burnt and old. She was nice but so slow. She never refilled our waters or got us more wine. That I asked for twice. We tried to have a decent meal after a long day. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Today's visit was simply amazing!  Every piece of the meal was terrific. Stephanie was a perfect addition to the meal.  She seemed to be reading my mind lol. Definitely a perfect experience. Giant stuffed rigatoni and beef Gorgonzola  Alfredo yummy and of course Pumpkin Cheesecake for dessert.  We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Me and a group of Co-workers went on our Lunch Hour today. We were sat on one of the booths in the Bar Area and our server was quick to show up. Arianna the waitress assigned to our area really impressed us as she took our drink order and our food order and did everything by memory! She was very attentive and very quick to stop by to check up on us. As far as service everything was excellent! It's very nice when you go and the customer service is awesome, it makes your meal even better!"}
{"text":"So from the outside this place resembles a barn. Ok, no problem. We figured it must be good since the parking lot was full. The staff was very friendly which I love. I ordered the Tour of Italy with the lasagna, cheese ravioli and fettuccine alfredo. My daughter wanted the fettuccine alfredo so that was going to be hers. I also ordered a salad. My husband ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and a soup. His soup was warm, not hot. When the salad came I was very surprised that it was soggy and ice cold. Like it was left in the freezer too long. After a few bites I just couldn't eat it anymore. Our first batch of breadsticks were very hard but our second batch were a lot softer than the first. So our food comes and my cheese ravioli has great flavor but wasn't hot. My lasagna was also pretty good but not hot. I tasted the fettuccine alfredo, which was my daughters and it had the taste of sour milk. Overall, when we visit Las Vegas again in the future we will for sure not be coming here. Olive Garden is my favorite restaurant but not this one."}
{"text":"The food here is simply awful.  It's low quality and very disappointing.  I had a coupon to the place a few years ago and I was looking forward to enjoying some spaghetti, soup, salad, and all that other stuff you see in the commercials.  Nope.  Really bad stuff.  

I've eaten at other Olive Garden's around the country over the past decade or so, and my experiences have universally been very bad.  In the realm of chain restaurants, I'd much prefer Chili's, Bennigans, Outback Steakhouse to Olive Garden.  Maybe chain Italian is just bad.  I also really don't like Macaroni Grill.  

For some people, it appears inconceivable that anyone could dislike the food here.  If you do - you're labeled a snob.  So defensive... tsk tsk."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed and the meal should have been worth $10 instead of $30. Quality of Mediterranean pasta dish and appetizer (mushroom, calamari, chicken fingers) went down significantly. 
Last time I ate at this branch was a year ago and such a difference. 2 stars is for the good service. I  felt like I overpaid."}
{"text":"The Tour of Italy was good and the new stuff pasta shell was really good and the wait staff was good as always. We be back for my Birthday next Friday"}
{"text":"If you goto this location ask for Sarah she is the best waitress with her infectious smile and friendly attitude in turn made the food and experience a delight."}
{"text":"This is consistently the best Olive Garden I've ever been to. 
To go orders-
I've ordered on there go a few times (which is SO easy and surprisingly customizable!) And each time I've been greeted by at LEAST three people with the biggest smiles on their faces. They have had my order ready exactly when I requested it each time and they always make sure I don't need anything else. Not to mention they package my meal appropriately! How many times have you ordered to go soup from a restaurant and the lid wasn't sealed or the bowl was upside down? Not here! They even put in these nifty divider things between items. I love it!
Dining in-
Have you ever worked in retail with a manager who just sat a computer all day, not facing any of the crab burst customers? Every time I've come to this location, I've seen the managers help carry meals to tables, bring refills, check on guests, and even clean tables. What a breath of fresh air! The waiters are all smiles, super fast, and give you updates on your meal before it comes out. Once I ordered a piece of the limoncello cake to go and the waiter accidentally brought it on a plate (not a big deal of course, let's be real, once I saw it I wanted to dig right in!) so instead of bringing me a box, he brought me a brand new piece to go right away, at no charge! What?! These guys get it right. Now, I'm gonna go eat my delicious fresh salad and some of those famous breadsticks."}
{"text":"Food was ok for lunch menu.  Our server Alice was charming and attentive though out our meal with a constant smile."}
{"text":"We came to this location twice in a month.  
Both times the restauarnt were packed. Our server was nice and was happy to answer our questions. 
We ordered salad and soup, and of course their bread sticks,  which we asked for refills about 4 times,  that's how much we enjoyed it.  
Our entres didn't take too long to come out. They came out hot and delicious.  
Overall we enjoyed our time, and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Worst experience with an olive garden ever!  Our plates were cold and the edges of the pasta had obviously been sitting and dried out . The juice from my husbands steak had dried on the plate and it was luke warm. Serving sizes were SMALL, only three ravioli for the main entree at a cost of 17.95. The service  was good, the poor waitstaff had to work with what the kitchen was messing up, and it was as good as it could be with a slow kitchen. Extremely let down as this was a going away family get together. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed with an olive garden before. So I arrive in the parking lot and the outside looks like your typical Olive Garden. Walk in side and it is very open and very rustic looking a plus the chairs are on wheels which I'm not used to but was kind of cool. As usual the wait staff is very friendly and polite. I ordered the bottomless pasta bowl I first had the three cheese marinara with penne pasta and Italian sausage. the sauce was almost non existent and I had to slice the sausage myself and the penne pasta was mushy but I decided to try something else so I got the Alfredo with penne and meatballs. The Alfredo was tasteless surprising because Alfredo is usually always good the penne that time was good but they forgot to salt it during the boiling part. The breadstick were delicious because it is pre made all the have to do is bake it. The chicken gnocchi soup taste good as soon as it cooled and the lasagna fritta didn't taste good till it was coeld. I feel sorry for the waiter cause he could tell that I was not happy, because of him I give it two stars."}
{"text":"For the very first time, I ordered from Olive Garden's  on line To Go menu. Their website was very  easy and convenient to use. I loved the fact that they give you the option to pay for your order when you arrive at the restaurant. 

I ordered the \"special offer,\" Spaghetti with Meatsauce, which included an additional order of Spaghetti at no additional charge. The order came with only two breadsticks. I added a Meatball and a Sausage link (for an additional price), and I choose the Minestrone over the Salad Option.

When I arrived at the restaurant, my order was ready on time, and my server--Meagan--was very friendly and professional. She said that she prepared my order, and she went over my selections with me; which included my special online requests for grated cheese, crushed red pepper, napkins, utensils, and coarse black pepper.

Everything was good, except that the portion sizes were sort of small.If you combine both the regular Spaghetti order with the additional order included in \"the special,\" it just seems like it is one order--which is divided into two portions and called a \"special.\"

Futhermore, if The Olive Garden really wants to live up to its \"Family\" brand that it markets, they should not charge its guests for additional breadsticks or  charge its guests for every other little thing like the tiny  cup of sauce to dip them in."}
{"text":"Just ate an excellent lunch at Olive Garden. A big shout out to Jason, our server! He was fantastic and took such good care of us. Thanks for the great service!!!"}
{"text":"We'd been to this location a couple of times previously, but now we will return more often!   Our server Jennifer was very good. The manager, Beth, greeted us when we came in, checked on us during our meal, chatted with us about the food & wine, etc... She has really turned this place into the best it can be, fantastic job!"}
{"text":"Our dinner last night at the Olive Grarden in Surprise Marketplace was outstanding.  Manager Michelle Adams and her team took great care of us providing excellant service and the food was delicious.  Once you get beyond the breadsticks and salad [who can resist either?] there are a ton on great meal choices.  We were seated in the Family Room which was semi-private.  Most enjoyable.  My wife had the Tour of Italy - Chicken Parmesan, Lasagna Classico and Fetucinne Alfredo. She kept raving about it and took half of it home.  I had the steak and ravioli.  I would certainly order it again.  We're going back soon!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was very attentive and nice. She looked like she wanted to make this meal a meal we will never forget. She understood what we wanted. The breadsticks were absloutly delicious, food was great. The only complain was the kitchen. I saw the kitchen and saw a FUCKING mess. the kitchen looked tdisgusting but the food was good. The lemon dolcini is great."}
{"text":"We go here all the time. Love the unlimited bread sticks. The food is good and enough so you can have some for lunch tomorrow. And the staff has always been really nice."}
{"text":"I always have great service at this location. The food is consistently very good! The endless soup/ salad/ and breadsticks is wonderful. The breadsticks are always fresh and never dry or hard. This location is the best in the west valley in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is a busy location but the quality of food is always good although they do tend to run low on breadsticks which can cause a problem if you are with a hungry group.  The Alfredo dipping sauce is top notch and I usually go with which ever special they are advertising on tv.  You can't go wrong dining here.  Prices are just right and service is usually good."}
{"text":"Good solid food at a reasonable price.  It's not gourmet, but it's consistent, and it's definitely one of our go-to places when we don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"Try the Tour of Italy! It taste great, great variety of things (lasgna, chicken Parm and spagetti). There is literally enough there for two."}
{"text":"very good place for a nice Italian meal. the cheese lasagna appetizer is a must try. however, I would recommend the pasta over the chicken meals. The complementary salad and garlic bread is also a plus. I recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.   We did the call ahead seating so our wait time was only 5 minutes.  We then sat for 15 minutes before the waitress came over to great us.   We had our full order in at that time.  10 minutes later so got our waters.  10 minutes after that, we got our salads.  15 minutes later, my date got his appetizer.  Another 25 minutes after that, our entrees showed up.  We've been waiting on our check for 15 minutes now. If you're ever waiting at this Olive Garden, it's because the service is lousy.  The food was excellent."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place sucks.  Not only is it cold in there the food sucks the wait is long.  Way too much salt on the food.  It is really hard to justify eating here.  There are better olive gardens out there but this one is particularly bad.  I am sorry for such a terrible review but I felt that the general manager needs to know that not everyone is happy with this place."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this Olive Garden. I haven't been to an Olive Garden in at least 6 years & they have improved tremendously.
The service by Erie was great.  He took care of business without being intrusive.
My friend  (from Ukraine) had the salmon & declared it very good, I had the spicy shrimp, it was pretty good.  My sister had soup & salad.  The salad was plentiful & fresh & fed all of us.
I left as a return customer & hope the changes are permanent."}
{"text":"Visited this location for a work meeting. Ill start off by saying the food was excellent. We did have a couple minor problems beginning with my boss feeling like the Alfredo dipping sauce for the breadsticks that's like 5 bucks a bowl was under filled. So the waitress called over the manager. We were all confused as to why dipping sauce was such a big deal. Now we did have to deal with the manager a few more times and I will say he was uppity about the dipping sauce. I thought he was going to turn out to be rude but after one of the steaks was overcooked we got treated like VIP's and it ended with a round of taste testing pastry's which made my boss very happy. Just dont mess with the dipping sauce portion."}
{"text":"Our waitress Jessica was fantastic! My buddy and I wanted to stop in for a quick drink/meal. We were promptly taken care of which made the atmosphere and experience more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I go here every christmas eve for the past 5 years, with a group of friends and family. 
All i can say  THIS IS THE BEST PLACE ... HANDS DOWN...
I am a very picky steak eater, I always end up sending it back ... at other places.... not here.... the cooks are awesome.
Love how they bring the salad to the table in the bowl. Breadsticks are always hot and fresh.
Nice selections of drinks...
The server we had was on top of his game.. and he had 5 tables at the time. 
The place was busy.. and the crew was wonderful...."}
{"text":"Ordered pickup from this location and they gave me the wrong food. When I called to speak to the manager SHAUN and let him know that I was upset. All he did was say \"im sorry\".  Olive Garden is not cheap. Soooo if I recieved the wrong order, he should have offered me something else. EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED."}
{"text":"In the area from out of the state and was looking for a decent bite to eat before heading to the hotel. Unfortunately, I was highly unimpressed with the experience at this location. 

For starters, our waitress (who actually neglected to tell us her name) was very sweet and for the most part attentive.

The salads tasted rancid; bad dressing perhaps? Sitting out too long? Needless to say, my guest and I did not finish it. 

We ordered two of our favorite dinner entrees that we typically get when we go to Olive Garden, and though the portions were wonderful, size didn't quite matter when we couldn't taste anything-- incredibly bland. 

And finally, to top it all off, before our dinners were even served, we watched as a female food runner with a short pixie-style hair cut delivered food to another table while simultaneously running her fingers through the front of her hair. That's beyond unsanitary; I wouldn't even touch my face or hair before serving food in my own home, let alone to strangers in public. 

We will not come back when in the area or recommend to others."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Consistently great servers. Always on top of our requests. Servers work hard and deserve to be tipped well. When you can do a hard job well, it deserves to be recognized. This place is always packed. Only reason why I am not giving 5 stars is for the long wait. But the wait understandable."}
{"text":"I love Italian food and I love the consistency of flavorful dishes you almost always receive at any Olive Garden. That said, I really wish someone would address the seating issues at this location. The booths are broken down and extremely uncomfortable, I actually injured my back getting into the booth and several days later still feel the pain. Ridiculous.  The chairs at this particular restaurant have a fabric arm that is just disgustingly dirty from years of dirty hands and food being wiped on them and are also falling apart and fraying. C'mon guys, pony up a little of the money that you've made at this restaurant over the years and make your customers more comfortable and the seating cleaner. Unless and until that happens, I'll be going to one of the other locations for my meals."}
{"text":"What a disappointment for me today.  Sever didn't even tell us his name. Ordered the make your tour of Italy with  Chicken Parmesan. Waited and waited and finally our 2 meals were served. My chicken was cold! Damn! Took a while to find our server to bring the cold chicken to his attention. Again waited to get another chicken Parmesan brought to table. Was told no charge and then when bill came it was on there!!  Sorry. Place was dirty with stuff all over floors and many tables not cleaned off. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Its not worth the one star.  Absolutely shocking.  Manager is a disgrace and isn't interested in making a customer happy.  Couldn't have cared less that he was chasing away a party of six.  We asked for the food in a particular way which wasn't a problem.  When it arrived it wasn't acceptable and they refused to do anything about it without a substantial upcharge so we told them they could keep it all. 
Disgusting service.  Avoid this place like the plague"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great, FYI: playing a game on the table tablet will cost you $1.99 without notice. Only noticed the charge when I went to check out and review the bill on the tablet at the end of the meal. My son (age 9) was playing and said he didn't know there was a charge, so after paying I went back into the menu to check the games and to my surprise there was no mention of being a fee for playing. Do not mind paying for entertainment but do not like when the company charges hidden fees."}
{"text":"All I can say to sum it up is long! I got here around 7:45 and it's 10:00 and I'm still here. Not to mention that the waitress/waiter (and yes we had a multiple of servers) did not attend to us. People that got there an hour after me received their food before I."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could. The staff is very rude and they don't know ANYTHING about how to do their jobs. No drinks?? No breadsticks?? Haha nice."}
{"text":"I have been to this location in the past and thought it was decent enough for a quick lunch. Nothing special but good.

This time around was completely different. We were in for a later dinner. About 8pm or so. We were told the wait would be about 5-10 min. This turned out to be more like 20 mins. We were then seated at the back if the restaurant near the entrance to the dish pit. Two people in our party got a glimpse of it and said there were dishes and food all over the floor. Both of them work in the food industry and were pretty aghast at the state of it.

We had a variety of dishes. The soup salad and breadsticks were all good. My meal was so blah that I don't even remember what I ordered. I stole a couple bites of my husbands ziti and it was good.  

Now we were in later in the evening so I understand that some closing things may happen while we eat but I was so distracted by all the stuff going on. One server walked by our table untucking his shirt as he went into the back. Ice was being emptied out of the bar into buckets and it was so loud I had to ask my husband to repeat himself. Servers were standing around in the middle of the floor chatting about their after work plans. It took a very long time for our main meals to come out after our soup/salad. 

Also when we were leaving three employees who all appeared to be \"working\" were at the door and not a single one thanked us or even said goodbye as we left the restaurant.

I know it is a chain restaurant and I do not expect a fine dining experience but based on our time there I will not be returning to the Olive Garden in Calgary again."}
{"text":"Went on Monday waited 15 min for water. Had go up front ask for a manager. 3 tables ware served before us. The waiter handed us the parmesan cheese grater to do our own cheese. Watch kids play with cheese grater in the same waiter station.  Not very sanitary. Manager never stop by. Service overall was very poor. As we were leaving three tables served ahead of us left and had new customers already had a server at the table. Won't be back at this location."}
{"text":"Brandon was great! Thanks for the service! My friend and I had a wonderful time. I was made two Arnold palmers to see which one was better."}
{"text":"We came here on Father's Day. The food wasn't good at first because the noodles weren't cooked all the way! HOWEVER, our server and the manager more than made up for it. The manager had actually gone around earlier giving all the dad's a $10 gift card for next time. When our server mentioned to him our uncooked noodles, he came over with freshly made dishes we had ordered to go and a cake we didn't order to show his apologies. Great! A few minutes later, the waiter came by and explained that everything was taken care of and we didn't have to pay anything. Not for our drinks, not for the bread sticks, salad, my meal (which was different from the other three I was with and was actually fine)...nothing. I was taken aback because I wasn't expecting it to be free.

I don't condone complaining about a place after you've ordered but the noodles were uncooked in the chicken alfredo. 

We'll be coming back because my fiance loves Olive Garden. I think they're all over priced and I personally feel I can make any of it much better and for cheaper, but hey she likes the bread sticks."}
{"text":"This is a reliable consistent place to eat.   Mario Batali might scoff but you know what this isn't New York, and your looking for food off the side of the interstate. 

The service was excellent,  we started with Lasagna Fritta(Parmesan-breaded lasagna pieces, fried and served over alfredo sauce, topped with parmesan cheese and marinara sauce) this was real good.  YUMMY!  

The wife ordered the chicken dumpling soup.  I ordered a salad.  chicken dumpling soup is a traditional dish, that is very simple to prepare, and excels when done with perfection.  This one was not.  UGH!  The dumplings were doughy tasting blobs.  The soup had a off taste to it.   The salad was ok. 

 For dinner I ordered Manicotti Formaggio with Chicken(Ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan cheese and herbs, baked in pasta rolls with marinara sauce) and the wife ordered Stuffed Chicken Marsala(Oven-roasted chicken breast stuffed with Italian cheeses and sun-dried tomatoes, topped with mushrooms and a creamy marsala sauce. Served with garlic parmesan mashed potatoes).   Both dishes tasted good, and were served hot.  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Took an unplanned family dinner here last night. After waiting for nearly 45 minutes to be seated, our party of 5 was seated at a large table in the center of the restaurant...then forgotten. A very sweet server (not ours) jumped in and took our drink order, but had her own very busy station to tend to. When we finally got our waiter and ordered, we waited another 30 minutes without a refill, salad, breadsticks, nothing. I walked all the way to the front of the restaurant to find a manager. She was very quick to remedy and even gave us a $40 gift card. By the end of our meal (now nearly 10pm), we stood waiting for our to-go orders (published special) and our check...both of which he got wrong. His parting words...? He didn't know we were in a hurry and he had only been there two weeks. We probably won't be visiting again any time soon."}
{"text":"Why people continue to eat here remains a mystery to me. The wait is painfully long on weekends, the food is obviously frozen and simply heated up, the portions are nil, and the price is outrageous. I ordered a seafood pasta dish and got about 5 little shrimps, 5-8 shriveled up scallops, shredded clams (probably equivalent to 10 or so), and a few pathetic mussels in a tasteless sauce for $15. $15!! 

Furthermore, the spaghetti-to-topping ratio is WAY off. The only reason people leave full is because there is about 3 lbs of spaghetti and 1/2 oz. of actual topping (shrimp, scallops, etc.).

And I'm sorry, but pasta and breadsticks are no reason to go here. It always seems like people are ashamed to admit they paid for food here, so they pull out the \"all you can eat salad and breadsticks\" excuse. The dressing tastes like salt water mixed with oil. The breadsticks are clearly frozen and reheated.

If you want an Olive Garden meal at home, follow these simple steps: cook spaghetti, put it in the freezer for 24 hours, put it in the microwave, then pour a can of sauce on top. There, I just saved you $15.

In conclusion, Olive Garden seems like the Nicki Minaj of the restaurant world. No one admits to liking it in person, yet it keeps on going.

1 Star - Waiters/Waitresses are typically nice."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and tonight was the best service I have gotten here in a long time. Our server Rome was very nice and always there when we ran low or was just checking on us to make sure we were ok."}
{"text":"Let me first start out by saying: I love Olive Garden!

It makes me so happy coming here. Every waiter/waitress I've had here has been absolutely amazing! They make me feel like family, and it makes me want to come back!

The food is awesome! The salad and breadsticks is so good I have to make sure I don't fill myself up on it, because I know I still have a delicious entree coming. I usually get the 5 cheese ziti al forno. It has the perfect amount of cheesy goodness! I get peach tea here too and it's better than anywhere else. Some places their peach tea is not sweet enough and I have to add sugar. But not here! It's perfect! 

The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake was soooo yummy! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it!

I have been here many times, and I will continue to keep coming here! Good job for making this such a wonderful place :)"}
{"text":"I love \" Chicken Ramanta\", but will be end in this week.
Superb ambience
Outstanding food
Always top quality
Always the best of service
If you like Italian pasta,  don't miss this gem. The garlic prawns pasta are to die for... Never let down. Best to make reservation"}
{"text":"The Olive Garden is always a decent choice for mainstream Italian. Don't get me wrong, if you're looking for something more authentic, this is not your place.

Starting with the appetizer, my wife and I decided on the fried mozzarella and fried zucchini combo. It was the first time I've tried the zucchini and I was shocked at how similar these are to Carl's Jr. I would put a decent amount money that they are 100% the same. Extremely strange to see this at a restaurant of this quality. For those of us who love fried zucchini, in my opinion, Cheesecake Factory takes the cake here. Pun intended! 

I had the grilled herb salmon with garlic broccoli and it was pretty decent. Salmon was slightly over cooked but nothing to complain about. 

My wife had the Lasagna Classico. She's a lasagna eater and she said it was bad. 

Lastly, we always get sangrias and went with the berry. I enjoy sweeter sangrias rather than tart. This was tart. Obviously this depends on the wine its made with. 

Sorry no dessert to talk about. We take care of that somewhere else."}
{"text":"Olive Garden on Decatur is very good.  A couple of us go there quite often, usually around noon and we can never seem to get past the soup and salad.  The Zuppa (sp?) and Minestrone are delicious and you can have endless supply.  Bread sticks come with soup and salad.  All is good here.  I've never tried any of the others in Las Vegas,  I stick with what I know to be really good. 
The service is good too and the staff helpful as well.   I would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night.  They do not take reservations so I planned to get there a little early (meeting two other family members there).  Put my name on the list and was told 20-25 min but table was ready in 10.  It was still only me and I offered to move down on the list until the rest of my party arrived but they suggested I go ahead and be seated.

All staff encountered were friendly and attentive.  Our server came right away and took my drink order and brought water for the table.  She also offered to bring bread while I waited.  I ordered the make your own pasta with whole wheat linguini, primavera and grilled chicken.  Was very happy with the dish except that the chicken portion was about a half breast-- it would have been a five-star dish if the chicken portion had been reasonable.

This was our first time in a long while at an Olive Garden.  As my husband was looking at the menu, he noticed that the steak item had been changed from a T-bone to a sirloin steak-- that was what he was looking forward to ordering.  Olive Garden has definitely downgraded in order to save money.  Too bad they didn't adjust prices and keep the quality.

My husband had the lasagna which he was disappointed in and will not order again.  I did not try it but it was not visually appealing and looked like a very small portion.  My brother had one of the seafood selections and was very happy with it.  The minestrone soup was very good and was served nice and hot.  We split the black tie mousse cake which was excellent.  All in all, we were happy and will return."}
{"text":"Love their pasta fagoli soup & bread sticks.

Sometimes the pizza is good too when they use seasoning on the crust."}
{"text":"Dined at the Olive Garden today for lunch. This was the first time my family and I have eaten at this particular location. We are big fans of the restaurant, but NOT this location. The server was so unhelpful that he ruined our experience. He was no where to be found most of the time, and when he was around he walked like a snail. I don't remember his name because he never introduced himself, but he is short with black hair, and quite frankly is not suited to be a server. Luckly for us the food was good (when we finally got it). Do not reccommend this location however."}
{"text":"Last night a group of friends from work and I got together to have dinner, I had called ahead on Thursday to make a reservation and the took my name, time & the number of people I would be having. Once we arrived on Saturday night at 6:50pm the said there are no such thing as reservations on Friday, Saturdays & Sundays.. I was very upset because the person the day before took all my information down and never informed me that reservations were not allowed. Which in my opinion is not a great idea considering like the girl said its your guys busiest days which would only make more sense to allow reservations! The told us it was going to be an hour wait for 10 people which is understandable but also I was so upset because I called ahead of time for this specific reason, especially because someone could have informed me. On top of that the girl that handed us the little machine that goes off when the table is ready responded with \"let me know if you change your mind so we don't wAste the time getting the table ready.\" That was so rude of her! It's to bad I didn't get any names. The server although was amazing and waited hand and foot on us. But we discussed that we will not be going to this location again because of how rude the customer service was up front, especially because they could have been a lot nice considering we had to wait until 8pm to be seated even though I had called ahead of time."}
{"text":"Been here many times and staff and food always great. The seafood Alfredo is delicious."}
{"text":"Usually when my family and I go to Olive Garden, we have a 5 star experience. For my sweet 16, that wasn't the case. We were sat quickly, but waited 15 minutes before a waiter came to order our drinks. By that time, we were ready to order, so did that as well. After waiting another 30 minutes, our salad and breadsticks came out. Unfortunately, so did our meal. My father, long past impatient, sent the food back to the kitchen so we could eat our salad and bread without being rushed. Our drinks were frequently empty, sitting on the end of the table waiting to be filled. The manager was called over on multiple occasions, and we almost walked out at one point during the meal. At the end of our night, we were left wishing we hadn't gone. I picked the restaurant because we were always given exceptional service. The manager picked up the check, and gave us a $20 coupon as compensation. This was the worst experience I have had at Olive Garden, and hope it won't happen again."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last week the food was excellent and and service will be coming back the location is great wish we have one in south of Calgary than it will be bit  closer"}
{"text":"This is the one I always go to with my family. The are quick usually never a wait to get a table. Plenty of bread & salad;) as that's everyone's fav lol. Great servers!"}
{"text":"Server was in slow motion tonight.. Took ridiculous long for everything (they were not that busy). Food was decent as always. The also ran out of boxes (well they had very small ones so I have a bunch of those)."}
{"text":"We went despite the poor reviews and are sad to say they were right.  
Between the noise, the wait, the under-trained staff, the wait, seeing staff standing around while tables needed bussing, floors needed sweeping, other diners becoming agitated, waiting an hour and 25 minutes (with 'pre-packaged' dessert to go) to walk out and fight our way through the chaos at the front door of people wanting to dine and seeing people lined up outside knowing that there were empty tables everywhere.  

The waitress must have been new. She was nervous, slow and  unorganized but smiled the whole time.  Clearly under trained so I would look to the managers for that one! 

We'd give the food a 7 out of 10, Unfortunately, it didn't matter what the food tasted like."}
{"text":"Terrible. Waited for a table for 30 minutes, sat at table for 15 and nobody even took our drink orders. We were totally ignored by the other servers. We got fed up. We left and went elsewhere to eat. This place has been going downhill for a while now, ever since the upper management and staff changed. We more than likely will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Always had different servers but service has always been great. Juan was superb was on top of things with our order. Will definite come back"}
{"text":"Had a $50 gift card to eat here and it's been burning a hole in my wallet for a year. We always hated this place last time we ate here was 11yrs ago.

I'd say they have drastically changed things. Their new Polenta crusted steak and Raviolis were actually very very good. Lasagna not bad either!

I'd say not quite Carabbas chain quality but it's decent for a chain. Deserves the 3.5 star IMO"}
{"text":"Seriously, the service here always sucks. Don't bother getting anything unlimited because you definitely won't see your server again after ordering the first time. The food is the same as all of the other olive garden's but the servers just are the worst. One time we had our server literally pick his ear wax as he was talking to us."}
{"text":"What a sorry excuse for Italian food.  Places like Guarino's in Little Italy or Tommy V's in Mayfield will serve you a meal way more tasty and authentic for the same price or less, but hey, they don't have the same advertising budget, so I guess Olive Garden will still be busier.  Do yourself a favor and venture a few miles off the freeway to experience some real Italian food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, just like every other time that I have been here. The service on the other hand, not good. I love going to OG because I get my money's worth, but the waitress we had today refused to give us another order of soup and said we couldn't take any breadsticks to go (after telling her other OGs have let us, she gave in). In addition, there was a point in time when she didn't come check on us for 30-40 minutes. I would understand if there was a bunch of people in the restaurant, but we were one of the very, very few tables she was serving. Disappointed but will come back again. Hopefully service will be different."}
{"text":"One of our favorites lunch places - today my husband had his usual soup & salad and I had the Shrimp Scampi - delicious except for the asparagus- very tough and unpleasant! It's a pricey lunch dish so just add the tips forgo the rest to prepare this dish!  

The service was excellent & she assured me she'd let the chef know about the asparagus!"}
{"text":"Service was relatively slow. Foods were salty: the breadsticks were salty, the soup was salty, and the pasta was salty too. The service and foods don't worth the price."}
{"text":"For it being the first time coming to olive garden, i was expecting more from my experience. Everyone i know said it was the \"place to go\", so i was excited to try a new restaurant. WELL, i will tell you the service/food was terrible, on one side it wasnt a slow night, but from what ive heard about line ups out the door it was not entirely busy either. It took our food over an hour from the time we sat down and ordered to arrive at our table. The server was nice, and professional but, she kept dissapearing for a long time and rarely checked up on how we were doing.

When we FINALLY got our food. I found it really lacking. It wasnt bad, but my expectations for the food were a lot higher ( because of word of mouth)


So over all i was severly dissapointed. Will i eat there again? Probably, just to give the restaurant another chance and see if it will  be the same story."}
{"text":"only one area section opened and it was too crowded (including a couple of families with playful children). the noise level was unreal. hoping to have a relaxing lunch with my husband but we had to shout to hear each other. we each order the buy one/ take one...should of checked the bag before we left because it was the wrong order! when we first arrive I did request to be seated at a table (husband handicap) but given a half booth. Really wished we we would gone to the other end of the parking lot ate at Lindo Michoacan or Red Robin. BTW food was good but if I wanted to eat with a bunch of children I would of gone to Chucky Cheese. Have no problem with children at restaurant but I think these parent could of had better control on the noise and perhaps the hostess should of opened up another section."}
{"text":"Below average service. We have been waited so...long to get our food, to-go boxes and our bill. Our server even by accidentally pour coke to another table guest's  clothes. The lunch took us one hour and 40 minutes and more than 50% of time is waiting. After we are done, it took them over 30 minutes to send us the bill. 

Please put more care to your guest: Olive Garden! I am disappointed. 

Will not choose to go to this restaurant again unless I have nowhere kill my time~~~"}
{"text":"Gotta say this place has friendly people & good food.  Go there alot and had one not so great meal & we frequent this place 3 times a week (soup&salad @lunch can't be beat).  Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"The worst. Its fast food you order sitting down. Why anybody would consider this a place to sit down in and dine at is beyond me. Its reheated packaged food."}
{"text":"We had quit going to Olive Gardens as their food quality and portions have diminished continuously over the past 10 years. We thought to try them with their new ad on having a meal and getting a 2nd meal to take home for free. Let me tell you, the food quality is dismal and only 5 limited choices and portions not enough. Even with a free 2nd plate offer, still not satisfied. Our waiter Kyle however made up for it by offering an absolutely great and pleasant service. I left him a 25% tip. No more Olive Garden for us."}
{"text":"i frequently go to olive garden, and i love the service the food is excellent though the fries on the italiano burger needs to have a diffrent flavor than garlic, other than that the servers were friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Don't know what I expected going to Olivia Garden. Food wasn't that great and service was horrible. We waited a good 10 minutes to just get drinks, thought it turned around when we got our order taken and got the salad and soup quickly. But then our server disappeared. My boyfriend had to get up and find someone just to get a togo box. The food itself wasn't bad, but there were huge chunks of uncooked garlic in my meal. I love garlic as much as the next girl, but this was too much, I needed to go and pick through my food. 
We got a gift card for Olive Garden and used it and now will never go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Walked in and was told there was a 10-15 minute wait. Sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after I did. Walked up and the hostess. She said, sorry you're next. The service sucks here. Night was ruined before I got my food."}
{"text":"We went out for dinner. We ordered calamari and it was served to us cold, dry, and crunchy so we had to send it back and when we did we over heard  the manager \"Alan\" ask what was wrong with it as if nothing was wrong. As our waitress was holding it! Thankfully our waitress Elvia was very accommodating in fixing the problem! And when the new calamari came out it came with our salad and soup so we weren't able to enjoy it as much as we hoped! I even took a picture to post but apparently I'm a little to special to figure out how! Looks like we might have to go to Carrabbas next time!"}
{"text":"My wife and I took my mother out to dinner for her birthday at this Olive Garden location.  We received the worst service ever.  I wouldn't even call it service,  I would say we were more like an annoyance to our waiter who seemed to want to have nothing to do with us.  The restaurant was busy when we arrived so we tried to be patient about our drink order taking longer than usual.  The fountain drinks arrived first but the beers that my mother and father ordered were taking a little longer.  No big deal, until my father's beer took another 20 minutes to arrive because, as the waiter explained, it was in \"the other cooler.\"  Our appetizer's arrived in a timely matter and they were very good, and all of the main courses arrived on schedule except for the wings my dad ordered.  The waiter explained that the wings were just being cooked now and that there was confusion in the kitchen.  This would have not been a major issue, the waiter said the wings would be up in 2-3 minutes.  By the time my wife, my mother and I had finished our dinner my father still never received the wings he ordered, this was after about twenty minutes since the waiter delivered our food.  He never checked in with us to apologize or give us an update, he just ignored our table.  We had to get the manager just to tell him we didn't want the wings anymore and wanted to leave.  He was apologetic and got us our check, but then he had to come back about 15 minutes later to get the check because we were still being ignored by the rest of the staff.  The waiter seemed very upset with his staff and from our observation most of the people working that night didn't seem to care.  The only conclusion we can gather about our waiter is that he was working hard for a big tip from the table of eight he was serving, which is his mistake because if he would have given us good service I would have most certainly tipped him 20 dollars on the 62 dollar bill we had as I usually like to take good care of waiters when they give good service.  I was so upset that I gave no tip which I have never done before.  The service at this Olive Garden is poor based on our experience.  The food was delicious and well prepared, the kitchen staff should be commended.  The service staff should be reevaluated and retrained."}
{"text":"Excellent service tonight by Stephanie!  The Chicken Marsala was delicious!"}
{"text":"We had a table of 10. When we were seated we had no silverware. When the salads and soup were brought to us we had no silverware. We were all left staring at our food with no silverware. The waiter and waitress had my grandmothers drink mixed up with someone else's drink. I ordered the Tuscan Sirloin medium-well, it was brought to me well-done. I complained. The manager told me it would be corrected. They brought me a rare steak to go."}
{"text":"Excellent!
What a great place to celebrate my 5 yr data-versary : )
we got here a little before 6PM.
There was no line.
Its our tradition to go to an olive garden just like we did in the beginning

(its their fault we're in love, they started it in 2005 by setting up the mood when we were \"just friends\"!)

Our server was so friendly and easy going, he put us at ease and we were able to enjoy the meal.
The team there was attentive, fast, and courteous.

I got a virgin Tangerine Palermo(sp?) b/c I don't drink alcohol.

Its off the menu since a few years ago but if you ask the bartender he will make it for you.
Its the best drink ever.

At first, they did serve me an alcoholic version of it without carding me which I thought was a bit odd since I look twelve.
I took a huge sip in an empty stomach, and yikes it was STRONG and I got buzzed and a mild headache that followed,...

anyways the server fixed it and got me a virgin tangerine palmero(sp?) and apologized.

I got the trio sampler:
stuffed mushrooms
pork ravioli
battered fried calamari.

Dang good stuff, especially the calamari!

I also got the new \"Lasagna Fresco\" (?)
basically stuffed lasagna with plenty yummy cheese and tomato sauce.
I loved this dish.

Minestrone was hot and fresh as usual.

I would totally go back again, even if I got an unintentional buzz."}
{"text":"The service here is always a hit or complete miss. Came to have lunch with my mom, and our server Brittany was slow and forgot drinks and never smiled. She honestly looked annoyed the whole time when helping both tables she had. I'd much prefer to go to the Nellis location than this one."}
{"text":"Very friendly environment but really slow on the service to bring check, Togo boxes and water. Other than that the food was great and the food came out in a timely manner. The bread sticks where perfectly baked and season. And they have a great deal on the entrees."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Thursday for lunch. Andrew C was our waiter. He was fabulous. He made us feel as though we were the only people in the place. He was courteous, upbeat, outgoing, and on top of his game. I haven't had service like that in a long time. It was refreshing. The stars are for the service. The food was fine. I can't believe the sizes of their bowls for soup they are like four bites way to cut costs."}
{"text":"Today's review is for a place I've visited many times before: Olive Garden on Sunset Rd. The restaurant was busy but I did not have to wait long for a table. Fortunately I missed the usual lunchtime rush.

The hostess, Danielle(?), after making me wait for what seemed too long while she finished tapping away at her computer display, merely looked up at me and waited for me to say something. Perhaps she was tired due to the hour? I requested a table and was seated at a booth in one of the dark and cozy rooms. The restaurant areas I visited seemed clean but the decor is dated; the table was set with four rolled-up sets of eating utensils & napkins as well as the previous guest's check and payment.

After a few minutes, my server, Kalecia, came by to get my drink and lunch order. She was efficient, nice and a bit \"matter-of-fact\" (perhaps she was tired too). I had Soup, Salad and Breadsticks -- my usual business-day lunch. I've always liked the salad at OG (something about the dressing and the way the fresh ingredients are prepared and presented) and today was no exception. The Chicken Gnocchi soup is usually good (though there are too few gnocchi and chicken morsels to really make it exceptional). The breadsticks had just the right amount of garlic seasoning today (sometimes they're just too bland) and were served warm. With a slightly watered-down soft drink, tax and tip the tab was just under $14.

I'm not looking for a five-star experience when I go to OG -- it's more a desire for some comfort food served in comfortable surroundings by friendly staff. I may be old-fashioned but I expect the hostess to greet a customer with \"Hello! Welcome to Olive Garden! How many in your party?\" or something like that. Other than that one minor issue, I had no complaints and I'll visit them again. I've read that OG is trying to freshen its image as well as the decor of its restaurants. This restaurant is definitely showing its age but I can't complain; so am I.

-- 3.2 comfortable stars"}
{"text":"I gave it one Star because of the Service was pretty good.   
I love Italian food and have always liked Olive Garden until this visit at this Unit.
Didn't have to wait,  Got our drinks pretty fast but had a little bit of a wait to place our order.
The Wife's Shrimp was \"cooked\" but incorrectly as the breading fell off.  My Endless Pasta Bowl was disgusting,  I don't know a better term.  The Pasta was over cooked and Alfredo sauce, what little they put on the Pasta was TASTELESS,  did get a Bowl of Soup not good or bad.  I could have opened a can of Cambell Soup and saved my money."}
{"text":"Good place, I have been to this place many time and every time I had excellent customer service. Staff is very friendly and food is well prepared."}
{"text":"I called to place an order for take-out.  It was for a business dinner for 6.  I spoke with the catering specialist and asked for help.  (The client requested Olive Garden, I have only eaten there once.)  She had no idea how to help me.  I asked her what was the most popular entree she said they are all popular.  She asked me if I would like her to list them alphabetically or would I like to visit the web site and then she laughed at me.  So I pulled up the website to find only 7 choices of pasta trays.  I asked about the gluten-free rotini since they didn't have the regular and she laughed again and said she has never tasted it.  I ordered, we confirmed the pick up time and then she said bye dear.  DEAR?! She was probably half my age!  I have ordered countless lunches for business meetings and have never been treated like this.  Never, never again at any location!"}
{"text":"Walked in 20 minutes before closing to find the 2 hostesses sitting at the bar eating.  Could not believe the attitude I received from the man at the door.  He rolled his eyes and didn't say a word to me.  Feeling award I asked what time they were closing.  He said they were closing in 20 minutes.  I decided to leave.  Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I am positive my phone was stolen this afternoon by a male employee. This employee who I believe stole my phone and our server Freddie were the only people at our table after we were seated by the hostess.  I was confused as to why this guy was even at our table, because Freddie told us he was our server and took our drink order.  I brought my 5 week old and two year old here with a friend.   My phone was to my right, on the table and I was busy coloring with my two-year old to notice it had been taken.  I went to check us in on Facebook and it was gone. We checked EVERYWHERE numerous times and could not find it.   I explained the situation to the male manager and all he did was look in the trash and say sorry it's not there.   Our server Freddie was very nice as well as April they stayed and helped us try and track it but we couldn't track it. We tried calling it would ring twice sometimes three times and then go to voicemail.  After this employee left for the day we tried calling my phone again and it had been shut off.  This gives me reason to believe he had taken it.  I do not have insurance on my phone (swore I did) but I don't and now I have to pay the remaining $466 on it and I have lost irreplaceable videos and pictures of my children.  Also, I am on maternity leave since I just had my baby and I do not have the funds for a new phone, nor to pay my phone off before I can get a new one.  Such BS.  I do not recommend coming to a place where their employees just come up and steal your property.  What lesson have I learned....to keep your phone in your purse at all times, ridiculous. I contacted the district manager but I don't believe there is anything he is going to do to help me."}
{"text":"I went to Olive Garden for the first time in a long time. I was very disappointed that they didn't remind me of the advertised special they have going on - a two for one entree special.  Conveniently they \"forget\" to mention that when you are preparing to order. Very disingenuous of them. Almost like a bait and switch scam."}
{"text":"I find that the previous reviews are a little too critical.  People this is a chain restaurant and if you state you have eaten at others than why would you be expecting anything different.  Our food has always been good and I have never had a bad waitress/waiter.  In fact, when I find one I really like I ask for that person personnally (the one I like the best is a Frank). 

The reason the wait is so long must tell you that there are a lot of others out there that like to eat there.  Would you go into a restaurant that only had 3 cars in the parking lot?"}
{"text":"Forced to go into this place w/ a group of co-workers.  Sorry, I do NOT willingly go to a restaurant to eat a freaking side salad or that insipid, totally uninspired cop-out called a \"steamed veggie plate\"   UGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH.  

With the exception of said freaking side salad and dry breadsticks NOTHING is vegan here.  Not even the minestrone soup (chicken broth).   Why cant corporate chefs at chains get it into their heads to specify vegetable broth for a soup FULL OF VEGGIES??????   Everywhere else, dried pasta doesn't have egg in it (only fresh pasta).  Nope, not here.  

On the other hand, I saved myself from consuming tons and tons and tons of fat and sodium :)"}
{"text":"The bread sticks were really hard like if they were old, the salad wasn't fresh and my chicken Alfredo wasn't that great either, my daughter loved her pizza and my husband liked his chicken parm bread stick sandwich. I had better tasting Olive Garden that's why I gave them 3 stars. Will try again."}
{"text":"What a sh%& show. Italian? What a joke. This place is a joke. All Olive Gardens are a joke. For some stupid reason I gave it a chance for lunch. Mistake. Soup is basically oil. The pasta is crap and nothing has taste."}
{"text":"I went yesterday. The food was okay. But the prices are ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I absolutely do not recommend this location. Rude hostess and bad customer service."}
{"text":"Food was nasty, came back twice and still wasn't right.  service was fairly poor never came back to see how anything was. Manager was non-existent to address my issues. Second time this has happened never again I'll take my business else where."}
{"text":"Let's be honest with a show of hands, is anyone here going to \"all of garden\"? 

If you don't get it or haven't seen the meme that exploded throughout the internet back in 2015 then a) you're missing out and b) where have you been? 

But in all seriousness the real review:

I've been to Olive Garden twice so far (one being checked in of course) and all I can say is if you never had real Italian pasta then I don't know what to say. The reason why I used the word \"real\" and not \"authentic\" is that there might be another Italian eatery in Calgary somewhere that is serves amazing mouth watering food but I haven't found it yet. Although Olive Garden is a real Italian restaurant and not a bootleg mall food court cuisine all I can say is for the past two times I went the breadsticks were either bland, too doughy or not fresh enough I mean come on I'm using it to dip into my sauce at least let me have that warm crisp feeling instead of having it feel like I'm eating a basic chopped up baguette.  

Recommendations:
- peach bellini
- moscato citrus berry cocktail
- peach sangria 
- caramel hazelnut macchiato
- strawberry/passion fruit limonata
- create a sampler

{"text":"Love Olive Garden.. from the time you walk in the door great service..  love the salad and breadsticks, plus the pasta.. mmm delicious.  We love Bill waiting on us, super friendly and refills our drinks without asking him to do so..."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and was given about 1 1/2 cup spaghetti noodles and 1/4 cup of tomato sauce on top to accompany the eggplant parmesan.. There was so little sauce on both that l asked for extra sauce...she brought the smallest condiment container of sauce that l just lacked my food to go so l could add a normal amt of sauce at home. There is something wrong with this picture when you can't get enough sauce at an Italian restaurant. There was not enough sauce for either item!!! Won't go back there again!!!!"}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden, they are the same wherever you go across the country. Mediocre Italian food, fill you up on breadsticks and a decent salad. If you are expecting anything more than that, that's on you, not the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant! And service is good, but food is overpriced and bland!! No flavor! 
As an Italian, I know what good Italian food tastes like, and this isn't it. 
*Side Note: The Lazy Dog restaurant in Summerlin is NOT even an Italian restaurant yet their Pasta is SO much better and filled with flavor compared to Olive Garden!!!* 
\"Unlimited Breadsticks\" Didn't feel like it! Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Frequent Olive Garden about  once  a month. I'm not sure what  happened, but the service was terrible. Salad came out quickly.  Entrées  came out a half an hour later. (We timed it !) Food was luke warm at best. You can tell  it's been sitting for a while. Ordered  the lobster ravioli ,wife had the chicken  parm. Top of the dish was dried out. Was going to take a pic. But didn't  want to spoil anyone's appetite  out there. I've  been a loyal follower  of Yelp. Plummer ,electricians & restaurant  recommendations.  All through Yelp. Thanks  to fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"Honestly the food was great but horrible service from this one waitress. S.R. . Everything came out on time and tasted amazing! The service was questionable and it honestly ruined my my experience. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Went high as balls expecting an outstanding Italian brochure of pleasure. What was I given? Horse shit on a plate. Literally... I called the FDA and they told me that there have been recent reports of mice vomit in this olive gardens sauce. Beware."}
{"text":"Overall it wasn't a bad visit from the welcoming staff to the cleanliness of the restaurant. Salad and breadsticks were normal and good. But the reason I went was to try the Lobster Raviolis. There I was very disappointed. I don't know if it's because I ordered a dinner dish at lunch but there was almost no filling in the \"Double Filled\" dish. Shrimp on top was nice but no LOBSTER FILLING."}
{"text":"If you're one of the few people out there that orders soda water at a restaurant, this place charges $2.60 - full soft drink price. Wish someone, especially the server, would've told us this. We were shocked when we got the bill. Every other restaurant we've been to has never charged for CO2."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian restaurant when living in Pittsburgh.  Food and service was always great."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night, and it was quite busy. It was nice though because we only had to wait about 5 min for a table. They have the computer system on the table where you can order appetizers, and I appreciated that because usually the waiter forgets about my Alfredo breadstick dipping sauce, and this way it came out right away.

Now I go to Olive Garden not for the Italian food because as we know this is not authentic Italian; I go for the Olive Garden experience. We usually get the same thing, and I get soup while my fiancé gets salad, and we share. This time I wanted to try a new entrée so I ordered the steak and Gorgonzola Alfredo dish. When it came, the steak was very well done (I ordered medium) and had a liver-like taste. I did not like it and neither did my fiancé who will usually eat anything. After we got our entrées one of the managers came by to ask how our food was, and when I told her I didn't like my dish, she was happy to replace it quickly with one I did like.

Two of the general managers stopped by during our visit to ask how we were. This was excellent service, better than what we've gotten at some very high class restaurants. The food was ok, but the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Thank you for the wonderful service. We called ahead to say we were bringing a party of 14.  the hostess said no problem, 20 minutes.  After we get there and waiting an additional 40 minutes ,the hostess says another 20 minutes.  We left"}
{"text":"Wow I don't even know where to start. I don't ever write reviews but I was here yesterday with my husband and his friend after a long day of work. Our waiter was anything but professional I couldn't believe it. When we got our food our waiter pretty much just slammed our food at us and asked if we wanted cheese , we said yes please, so he carelessly puts cheese as if it was a bother that we said yes and gets it all over the table and our clothes. Later my husband asked if he can get another soup and the waiter's exact words were \"you can only get what you already have on the table\" and walks off. We let it go. Then he comes back and we ask him for a box to go he says \"how many because I don't want to make more than 1 trip\". Was that really necessary to say? He brings our boxes and leaves them at our table which is fine but the last 30 times I've been to another Olive Garden the waiter packs our food for us? Then my husbands friend asks if he can get a refill (he never asked us if we needed anything not even a refill) so he says ok, we waited for about 15 minutes he came back with the check and we reminded him of the refill and he says \"oh yeah right\" he comes back and literally slams the drink on the table so hard that the soda splattered up and got on our friend's shirt. Once again the waiter just walks off without an apology. We then just gathered out stuff, payed and left. Never again coming back to this location (We did notice our same waiter was being very nice and attentive with other customers who were Caucasian so if you are not Caucasian DO NOT COME HERE YOU WILL BE TREATED WORSE THAN A STRAY DOG)."}
{"text":"We went there for my daughter's birthday since she has never eaten at Olive Garden before and it was her request. The host who sat us down was very pleasant, asked if it was a special occasion and we said yes, it's a birthday for a 23 year old. Kyle was our server. Everything went well except our server never once came to refill our drinks. We waited almost 10 min for our take out boxes. We still waited for our birthday celebration and that didn't come either. We were supposed to go to the Decatur location but last minute decided on the summerlin since it's in a better location and figured service would be awesome. I guess we were dead wrong. So we just paid the bill and left  to get dessert somewhere else. I would of not added any tip however knowing what it's like to be stiffed, I will be a kind human and leave what's right. Maybe being the only Asian family sitting there had something to do with it. We will never know."}
{"text":"Great place to just come for coffee and a good conversation with your special someone. This place is my wife and I special getaway   for some sports and spiked coffee  

Customer service is decent, not bad for the place. DON'T come on the weekend (Fri, Saturday or Sunday) you will never get a seat and will wait for hrs. Other than that, it's a great place."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of olive garden for a long time but this particular location is a hit or a miss. We visited this location for lunch on last Sunday and ordered lemon chicken and tilapia. Tilapia was broken ND not cooked properly, the broccoli was raw. When we told the waitress she said this was how it was prepared.  The salad which she brought was bland and on requesting to change it.. she got a cup with the dressing. Probably the staff needs more training but I can see it is hurting the brand."}
{"text":"I took my order to go and was extremely dissatified with the quality. I ordered the chicken alfredo for my anniversary and when I got home to check it, the noodles were very dry and had a very minute amount of alfredo sauce. Also, the noodles were halfway over cooked. Next time I would definately check my food before leaving and ask for extra sauce. Brooklyn Boys' alfredo blows this place out of the water!"}
{"text":"C'mon, it's the Olive Garden. Consistently delicious. Consistently good service. We also do take out from time to time. One take out time my order was prepared wrong, and it included an ingredient that I was allergic to, but I didn't know until I got home. I called the store and the awesome Manager attempted to bring me another entree! It was late so I declined the offer and he mailed me very generous gift cards. Well done O.G.!"}
{"text":"Disgusting.   Probably the worst food in a restaurant in years.  Was invited by coworkers.  Last experience with Olive Garden was about 5 years ago.  And I did not go back until now....for a reason.

Ordered a chicken panni which was just disgusting.   They actually served a concoction of minced chicken with cheese and spinach.   Absolutely vile.   

And the service equalled the food.  Just pathetic.  Hour and half for lunch midweek. The manager was as clueless as the waiter.

I cannot express in words how absolutely awful this place is.   Clueless service and disgusting food.  No one was smiling like in their commercials.  The most awful chain restaurant.  Beware.  Vile!"}
{"text":"Until recently, I worked near the mall and a couple of weeks ago my wife and daughter decided to surprise me at work for a family lunch date and this OG was selected.  Biggest mistake ... ever.

The only positive part of the visit was the host/hostess station, who had their act together enough to seat us with minimal wait.  We then sat at the table for15 minutes before anyone resembling a waiter appeared.  When our waiter approached our table, he set down two menus and walked away without saying a single word or acknowledging us in any way.  We then waited another 10 minutes before he returned to take our drink AND meal order.

At this point, we were both upset but decided to give them a pass since it was a busy lunch rush on a Friday.  My wife and I both ordered coke and decided to get the all you can eat three pasta promotion and asked for our garlic bread and salad to be brought out before the meal.  

We then did not see our waiter again for 30 minutes when he appeared carrying our entire meal out on one tray - drinks and pasta - without salad or bread sticks.  We were visibly upset at this point, my lunch hour was now over, and we were just now getting our incomplete first round of our \"all you can eat\" order.

He literally put the food down on the edge of the table without asking us who had which dish and disappeared again.  My wife had ordered the fettuccine Alfredo for her first dish. I am not exaggerating when I say that what she was brought was a bowl of cold linguini noodles with a glubbed-on ball of cold Alfredo sauce sitting in the center on top of the noodles.

I never request to see the manager when the service is this poor because management is always the problem.  Incompetent management breeds the hiring of incompetent wait staff, so rather than make a scene I simply leave the restaurant.  If they care to stop me to try to insist I pay, well then game on.  No one stopped me.

I returned to work with an empty stomach and placed yet another restaurant on my black list.  And we never did receive our salad and bread.

Olive Garden - your food is not that good to begin with.  If you wish to stay in business, I suggest you visit stores for quality checks on a much more frequent basis - especially this location.  Just dreadfully awful.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, Don't even try ordering ToGo. that is, unless you want to wait for 20 min when you arrive to pick it up.  I even showed up 5 min late from there timeframe that they had me for my food to be ready.  pretty ridiculous! I won't be going back.  Food was cold and soggy when I received it.  If I could rate zero stars I would have!  If youre reading this review and contemplating coming here...dont!  Never Come to this olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Typical Olive Garden.  Good food.  Poorly designed lobby with nowhere to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I picked up dinner here a few nights ago. The dinner was for a friend, so I'm not going to talk about the food, as I didn't eat it.

I arrived at 6:00 to pick up the order. The place was packed and there were at least 10 people waiting to be seated. I checked in with the hostess who said that the to-go person would be with me soon, which ended up taking about 5 minutes.  Once she went to get my order it took another 10-12 minutes.

I realize that they were busy but waiting 15 minutes for a to-go order that had been placed 3 hours before seemed a bit much.  

I don't go to this Olive Garden very often and I'll probably go again at some point; however, I will try to avoid the rush hour.  I didn't think that 6:00 on a Thursday would be that busy."}
{"text":"I don't know what is happening to Olive Garden, but the quality of the food has gone way downhill.  Because I used to really enjoy this restaurant and was hoping that the last few times I ate there and the food wasn't that good was just a fluke.  Not so.  I ordered carry out this time - the chicken marsala, lasagna, and chicken alfredo.  The chicken alfredo was ok but the other two dishes were horrible.  The chicken was totally dry, even the marsala sauce didn't help.  The lasagna didn't even taste like lasagna and I could have done better getting a frozen dinner at the grocery store.  Sadly, I have given up on this restaurant.  I refuse to pay the prices they are now asking for inferior food.  I would not waste your time going here."}
{"text":"After seeing the commercials for this place we decided to try it out.  We arrived around 6 pm and there was no line.  We were seated within 5 minutes of getting there.  

Restaurant is clean and in fairly good condition. We had a booth close to the kitchen. Table and seats were clean.

Our waiter came to greet us and took our drink orders.  We both had the Alfredo specials.  Food came out quickly. 

The gnocchi and chicken soup was okay. I'm not sure if I'd order it again though. Maybe try the minestrone if we go back. 

My bf had the garlic chicken Alfredo. He said it was good. I tasted the sauce and it was better than my entree.

I had the chicken and broccoli Alfredo. There was hardly any sauce on it.  Chicken was okay but a little dry. Broccoli was cooked well.  I think if it had more sauce it would have been better. 

For dessert we had the chocolate option. That was good. A  bit rich. But yummy.

Overall an okay restaurant. Will we be making it a must go to when in Vegas? Probably not."}
{"text":"Went here around 8pm on a Friday and they do not take reservations on Fridays. Luckily we did not have to wait too long and we got seated within 10minutes. The hosts was nice and friendly.  They have specials limited time only if you buy one starting at $12.99 you get to take one from selected menus home for free, does not include salad or breadstick for the 2nd one.  We ordered steak gorgonzola, seafood lasagna, and chicken fettucini alfredo. They were delicious!. I like the fact that you can pay from your table with a credit card. We ended our night with white chocolate strawberries dessert."}
{"text":"Great preparation for Valentine's Day. To go orders area was very well organized. Well done guys."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and our waitress Tina R was even more awesome! Ask for her when you go!!  She is super fun to talk to and brought our food super fast"}
{"text":"Standard Olive Garden food, which I crave for occasionally. We visited the east town Olive Garden for lunch for the first time today. Sat on table 103. The waitress was unbelievably cold and rude. Did bare minimum service, will drop plate in front of us and immediately turn back as if we were lepers. She did not even look at us to complete the orders, will turn back as I am in mid sentence. Her behavior with customers on adjoining tables was markedly different, so it was not a personality issue. After calmly looking over her behavior through out the meal, the only variable different between us and neighboring tables was skin color. Sorry to see such disgraceful behavior at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Smells like wet dog.  EXTREMELY humid inside.   Food was good (the two stars worth).  Service was very bad today.  I am a server myself and I would be beyond embarrassed if I provided such poor service to a table.  Added bonus - It constantly seemed like she was trying to rush us out.  Delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking!!!  Also delivered our checks before we were halfway done and we had to ask to have a desert added on..."}
{"text":"We went there last night (Thursday ) for dinner. I ordered a tour de Italy with tortellini. Not only did it take 30ish minute for us to get our food, despite not being very busy, my tortellini were still cold with lukewarm sauce poured over top. The other pasta dish was also cold despite the fact that my husbands came out piping hot. I told our waitress and she didn't seem to care too much, she basically said deal with it. Considering I couldn't eat two of the items I ordered I'm pretty ticked I spent 20$ on a plate. We won't be going back here again.

Update: I called the next day and spoke with the manager Leslie. She was understanding, helpful, and on top of addressing the issue. She made it clear that the food and service we reviewed was unacceptable and she corrected the issue. We intend to go back shortly and I will definitely ask for Leslie if I have any problems! Thanks Leslie!"}
{"text":"Italian food is my favorite and I love nice and soft bread sticks with their salad. Love eating at olive garden, but i thought this place didn't really have that good service that I usually get at other olive garden."}
{"text":"We had a HUGE group tonight and the servers were amazing! They had the big group service thing really figured out!"}
{"text":"We love Olive Garden!!!  We visited on Mothers Day and just this past Wednesday.  We had Jason both times along with someone else.  Ask for Jason...he's an amazing server!!!"}
{"text":"Olive garden Used to be one of our favorite places. But recently they have been awful. A couple weeks ago a friend and I met for lunch, and our waitress was not only slow, but rude and inappropriate. We wired 25 minutes just for our drink order! Another 20 just to put in our food order, by the time we received our lunch 35 minutes later, it was ice cold. Our waitress was no where to be found. I'm glad we weren't in a hurry. A couple nights ago, my family and I picked up carryout.  What a mistake! We ordered a five cheese ziti, we did not get that. I don't know what we got instead,  The bread sticks were rock hard, and we were missing two salads. And the monestrone soup seemed like it just came out of a cooler. We will not be back ever again."}
{"text":"The Chicken Parmigiana is my favorite and the Kiwi Melon drink is bomb... The server was awesome and nice even though the place was packed... This is our place to go on weekends..."}
{"text":"Just a shout out to Francisco and Brittany.  Thanks so much for the soup and salad!!! Our office loves the Olive Garden. We usually order to go and they always get our order right.
Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"They have good sized portions for the money. The soups are delicious. The salad is to die for."}
{"text":"Don't go in here if your black. They will be extra rude to you. The wait was longer than I expected so I changed my mind. Wife wanted to stay so I went back and reserved a table for 5 again. She claims I said 5. She did that to be nasty. And I think because we were the only black family there."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I weren't feeling to well so we went in to get some soup. Colton W was our server and he was fantastic. Always there to replace the soup and salad and our drinks. He even offered to get us drinks before we sat down. Would recommend this location to anyone and especially Colton as a server."}
{"text":"came here last week for aunts bday. she loves olive garden while im not a huge fan of the food but the service was awesome and is why ill be back. Our server Dakota was on point,he kept the drinks full and service was speedy and he was courteous. doesn't seem like much but nowadays that goes a long way. so thanks Dakota for letting us enjoy our meal."}
{"text":"Probably worst Olive Garden we been in .... we got up an left ...  service was bad ....   people next to use said the same thing ..."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently had dinner here before a movie and the service was absolutely amazing. Our waitress, Myrna, was a sweetheart and provided us with what we needed and answered all of our questions. Even if she was unsure of the answer, she was willing to find out for us. She definitely made our night with her personality and great customer service. Go Myrna and Olive Garden!!! Woo hoo!!!"}
{"text":"First time at an Olive Garden, and I must say it was FANTASTIC.  From the bread sticks to the entree, the price, and the service - everything was really great.  I am definitely coming back my next visit to Vegas.

This location is right down Flamingo, catch a cab from the Strip and you will get there in about 5-10 minutes.  

The food was really good.  I had the Grilled Shrimp Caprese on angel hair pasta, but started with the Spinach-Artichoke dip (WAY better than CPK), Chicken & Gnocchi soup (fantastic).  The bread sticks were fresh out of the oven, perfectly warm and buttery.  I had bites of my BF's salad and it was OK.

Service was awesome.  The waitress was really friendly, she didn't pressure us when we needed more time, was very attentive and made sure our glass was always filled.  She came by often to check up on our meal, and everything came in a timely manner.  I can tell that they have happy workers there because in the background a lot of the waitresses were really enjoying themselves - everyone seemed really friendly.  The hostess was kind to call us a cab, and while we waited in the front for our cab, any worker who passed by talked story with us.  Everyone was great."}
{"text":"Admittedly I did order take out, I was told it would be ready at 7:55pm got there at 8:15pm and wasn't ready until 8:35pm enough said..."}
{"text":"I love a good deal, but I like great food even better, which unfortunately not the case here. The Pasta Fagioli soup is pretty good. I order the never ending pasta which the way my stomach felt after never ended. Ugh! I had ordered the Cavatappi with Asiago Garlic Alfredo and Crispy Chicken Fritta. First off the pasta could have been cooked a little better, secondly the sauce was already separating when it was benign served, and the chicken wasn't cooked all of the way. Boooo!
Unfortunately chains rely too much on their big name.
I ate about half, probably shouldn't have, but then waited a half an hour for my server to return. At that point a just asked for a check. She didn't ask if everything was ok, if I wanted a box, or if I was interested in desert.
Oh well, won't ever be going back there."}
{"text":"Service was slow, but acceptable.  We had lunch. I had the soup, salad and breadsticks. My son had the meatball breadstick sandwich. He said the meatball had NO seasoning - none at all. He was disappointed"}
{"text":"Placed a to go order at 710pm on a Thursday night and was given a pick up time of 740pm.  Reasonable enough.   Arrived to pick it up at 745pm.  After waiting 10 minutes to be acknowledged,  had to wait another 30 minutes for my order...no explanation no apologies.  Food was haphazardly thrown in containers (broccoli side for kids pizza literally thrown on top of pizza).  Never again.  Food isn't good enough to justify this experience."}
{"text":"This location on Charleston Blvd is the best Olive Garden I've ever been to! The service was exceptional and the atmosphere was lovely. A million thanks to our server, Gina! We've met the manager as well, Oscar who was also a pleasure to talk to. 
And last but not least the food was delicious and plentiful."}
{"text":"Been to this location a number of times.  They have a nice space for family parties.  Last weekend, we had a special family get together and had reserved the family space.  On the day of the reservation, we called again confirmed.  Got there, and someone else was in the space.  We had really looked forward to this but it was very disappointing.  Manager blamed it on the previous shift.  Bottom line, don't count on a reservation meaning anything at all at this location."}
{"text":"Took my Italian mother-in-law to The Olive Garden last night.

She took one bite of the spaghetti and her eyes lit up. AUTHENTICO! she cried. The staff started clapping in unison which was truly a sight to see, being that it was NOT anyone's birthday or other special occasion. The manager came out from the office to offer us \"comped\" salad and bread sticks. \"Comped\" is a term from Las Vegas casinos - very exciting! I had to ask what it meant. My mother-in-law says she has never had such good, authentic Italian food before, and she has lived in Italy her whole life.

My Italian wife was so pleased with my choice in restaurants that after dinner she made sweet love to me."}
{"text":"When we arrived, they were very crowded and gave us a 40 minute wait time.  While waiting, we were presented with a coupon for half off on a glass of wine.  Although we didn't utilize this coupon, it was a very nice touch.  Less than 15 minutes later, we were seated.  

Our waitress, Jessica, was attentive from the start.  We were a large group, 3 adults and 3 children, and she was able to keep our glasses full, despite every one of us guzzling our drinks.  

Our salad came out promptly after we ordered and as soon as it was empty, we were offered another.  Our food came out fresh and hot, straight from the kitchen.  It was missing a couple of items, which Jessica was quick to notice and correct.  The food was delicious!

The overall experience was wonderful.   I was expecting the worst with the amount of people and large parties, but everyone was attentive, helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered here yesterday and with my daughter's allergy we had a great assistance in getting our order. We also had an extremely accommodating order, we will definitely back to this particular location!"}
{"text":"The service was really good I had the Tour of Italy very delicious and My Son had the never ending Pasta and Meatballs the soup and salad were great and the breadsticks yummy I will return here"}
{"text":"A very rare lunch with my husband since he works overnites& sleeps during the day! We got seated right away, orders taken, salad/ breadsticks came right away and special attention to my pop mixed with flavoring!"}
{"text":"Best Olive Garden because TYLER P! The man! Aka Blood Dragon! Ask for him when you come through."}
{"text":"Horrible service since the beginning we were seated. Get rushed by our waitress asking if we'd like a sample. We say no thank you and she walks away. Didn't see her again for about 25 minutes. No drinks no name nothing! Comes back and takes order. Still no name. Get order about 45 minutes afterwards. My child is still without his food. We get it 15 min after we asked 3 times. They bring only one side and we ordered two. 15 min after they bring food out, they then bring the second side. I was told a manager would come over to speak with us but none came. This was the absolute worst experience ever at any restaurant. The best part is, the waitress still never introduced who she was. 

Our waitress was Ana. I saw her name tag. If you have her, ask for another server!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden is as corporate as it gets but the food at this location is always very good.   I hate to say it but I visit during never ending pasta bowl every year because the quality of the food and the price makes up for the servers. They do have a few that are good but in general they always act as if you are a bother. Our server tonight used her fingers to put the cheese in the grater. I'm not one of those picky people but some folks would have lost it.  I do love the older hostess, she has been there for years and is always pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Very poor quality food. The only bright side of this dinner was the pleasant waitress.  Our pizza was mushy and undercooked. I ordered the chicken toscano and it tasted like straight up balsamic vinegar and the risotto was pretty bad. I couldn't eat it. The description was nothing like the actual entree.  But the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"There was a 40min wait for Valentines dinner,  understandable so my Hubby and I waited at the bar, ordered a bottle of wine. Our buzzer went off we went to the hostess area, we were then seated.  A manager came up immediately said told the waitress to leave our table. Proceeded to accuse us of bring the wine into their restaurant. Told him that we paid $25 when I could have purchased it at Safeway for $12, had him feel the bottle that it was chilled. He was oh sorry & walked away. Everyone in the room was staring, shaking their heads. I went to speak with Bartender, who apologized up & down knowing we were celebrating Valentines and early Wedding Anniversary. Manager came back to our table, couldn't give us a straight answer of how could we bring it in their place when we were called for the table from the bar area. They comped the meal but that doesn't excuse the fact how embarrassed we were, stating its hid fault for not looking into it before coming to us. Waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.. horrible waitresses that can take an order correctly and the wait for the food was almost an hour.. Will never go back there, but the fillet will try another Olive Garden"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible.  The lady profiled me because I look younger than 21.  She then kicks my entire family out from where we were sitting to some cramped little booth. Our server speaks so fast & becomes frustrated when my family asks questions.  I don't not recommend this place.  Our waitress doesn't elaborate on any options for the meals we order & then appears to be upset that we don't understand her.  The salad is terrible the breadsticks are terrible.  The sea food fettuccini made me so sick that night.  Tiffany was our waitress and she was so so rude to my family.   She then rushes my family the entire night & we were barely able to enjoy our meal.  Never coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"I must say....years went by without me visiting an Olive Garden, because I felt that they had gone to S***. This new location opened up a couple of years ago and I haven't had anything but great experiences. 
The servers are great: they're friendly, attentive, and happy. I love it. We dined here Monday night and my husband even ventured off of his usual and tried the new steak alfredo with gorgonzola and spinach in it; he added shrimp of course. It was delicious!!! I even liked it better than mine; the stuffed chicken marsala which I think is amazing. 
I really keep going in for the knochi soup. I can't even eat my entree so I just take it home. I always feel bad for asking to take soup home but my server made sure I had my late night snack. LOVE HIM!! I can't remember his name and I wish I could because he was great. OH WAIT! It was Dakota!!! So props to you Dakota for making our dining experience a good one! We will be back of course. It is actually the best place to eat around here. BJ's went downhill, Red Robin-well, it's Red Robin. Don't even get me started on Firerock. That place is a joke.  Michocaan is good. 
Anyway, this is a review for Olive Garden! 
Oh and we notice that every time we dine there, a manager always checks on us. It should be done EVERYWHERE. So we appreciate you and all your staff. Didn't get his name but I have never seen him before, a thin black gentleman was there that night. Friendly demeanor and he made it a point to visit all tables that were in the restaurant. 
Keep doing what you are doing at this location. We have been in this industry for a long time and you all are doing things right!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food that I believed was gluten free.  Within twenty minutes I started to have symptoms and was sick for two days.  I believe that my food may have been gluten free but that cross contamination caused my problem.  I had the same experience at another Pittsburgh Olive Garden restaurant and so am concluding that they may not be careful with cross contamination."}
{"text":"Why do people go to Olive Garden?  Why did i go here today?
Simple answer: with force.  
I HAD to go where a member of the family chose to go.  I haven't eaten here in about 8 years.  Many reasons which were confirmed tonight.
Pasta was mushy. The \"famous\" salad actually had decent flavor but was drenched in dressing.  Breadsticks were a bit hard and tasted like buttered white bread.  Fish was breaded but okay tasting.  Pizza was not so good. Didn't like the cheese.  To sum up the whole meal: it was like heating up a \"t.v. dinner.\""}
{"text":"Have never had a problem with this restaurant. Good food, fast service and friendly staff. This time was no exception except one small detail that really rubbed me the wrong way. Our waiter (which I didn't catch his name) brought the salad and breadsticks and asked if we would like to have some dipping sauces for our breadsticks. I was psyched as I didn't even know they offered that! I asked what they had and he named off the sauces, my boyfriend excitedly said he wanted 3 of the 5 sauces he named. Okay cool. The check comes and I see that those dipping sauces were almost 4$ a piece! Okay maybe I'm naive for thinking they were complementary... but I feel like I should have been warned before we went all Willy nilly and getting 3 of them! Yeah that was an unexpected 12$ added to the bill I didn't appreciate the surprise"}
{"text":"Waitress looked like a crackhead, dirty appearance. I was with a group so not at a comfort level of saying something just went with it. Salad, breadsticks, pumpkin cheesecake and hours later in the bathroom need I say more......"}
{"text":"Tonight we went to this location for dinner there was 6 of us in the family that went.. We don't come to this location often but it's closer to our new house so we thought we'd give it a try... To start it off, we walked in and the hostess asked us how many in the party and they told us it would be a little bit of a wait so we said okay thats fine. She didn't take anyone's name to be put on the wait list. Which is wrong, I am a hostess my self and they were VERY unprofessional. Then a party of 6 or more walked in and got on the wait list and they got seated before us. So we were a little irritated about that. Then when our table was ready the hostess took us to our table and my mother said that it was a bit tight and with an attitude the hostess said \"ya it will be but we can fit 6 plus a high chair here.. It's all we have!\" so we sat down and ordered our drinks and food.. We got the endless pasta, soup, and salad .. Which was delicious. My mother odered fettuccini Alfredo with chicken, in fact we all did. And the chicken was nasty. It tasted like canned chicken, our server did tell us it was different than the usual grilled chicken.. It looked and tasted like tuna. Ew. Then my mother ordered a refill on her pasta. This lady Amanda brought out a refill, within seconds of ordering it, to my mom and it was angel hair Alfredo and she didn't order that so my mom said \"oh I didn't ordered that\" and Amanda said \" it's chicken Alfredo, it's the same thing! It's just angel hair pasta!\" and my mom said \"okay, but I didn't order that!\" and Amanda just rolled her eyes at my mom and walked away!!! That is NOT okay... The service was terrible! We will NEVER be going back to that location. Ever again. Our server got the manager for us and she acted like she didn't really care and she offered my mom a gift card and my mom said she didn't want it because we will not be coming back ... She kept asking if we wanted the gift card over and over .. She wasn't getting it that we didn't want the gift card... She only offered us a gift card, she didn't offer to comp anything for us. She bugged us enough to where we just said yes to the gift card.... Our server was great. He did nothing wrong but everyone else was terrible.. We love Olive Garden and we were all so happy to go out to eat, and we all left very disappointed. I wouldnt recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"I recently dined and wrote a three page letter to the corporate about this location. Having been a previous employee (server, trainer,hostess), I was excited to go back to a place that I had spent many years working at. From the front door to the table, it was definitely a rude awakening. My letter was over three pages but I will keep this brief. Parking lot a mess, staff unkempt and dirty in general (yep those cooking my food), servers discriminating in snide remarks as they profiled potential tables based upon age (yes people nearby are listening!), server that rushed food service to the point we had all three courses on the table and cleared within forty minutes( appetizer, salad, entree), server couldn't make any suggestions. The great points: bartenders were smiling and upselling their section. Should have sat there. The hostess with the mostess at the front was beyond nice. She doesn't get paid enough for her job. 
Essentially: Olive Garden used to be your grandmas place where when you're there you're family. Now it's like an unkempt ride teenager. Get in, give me money, get out. Here's your breadstick.

'*guest relations sent me a gift card in response. This was not my point since I wanted to just give them my point of view as a former employee (I parted on great terms for a full time career). Their relations team has been swift and nice. Let's hope they can make a change. I plan on finding a deserving family for my gift card."}
{"text":"I came to Olive Garden here because I had gift cards. Being Italian and to call this authentic Italian cuisine is a misnomer. So I will grade it on the food delivered. No appetizer needed with the salad and bread sticks complimentary.  Main dish was decent but typical fora chain restaurant. Service was good as well. They got a 3 because they had good good and service but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner on 3/9/15 and while the wait time wsa low got seated right away. I had Chicken Alfredo and the chicken was over cooked and dry there was barely enough  sauce on it. My wive had one of ther buy one take one home offers  she said the sauce was too sweet and did not go real well with the chicken. My other complant like mot restraunts people have no regards for thers by bringing young kids the either run a round while  mom and dad do nothing about the problem or real young kids that cry and fuss etc... and of course the restrant does nothing bout it. After last night if we ever go back I t will be a long long time. Overall not a good experience. I would not recommend this to my friends  or family."}
{"text":"Meal was great! Oh billy, was a great server, attentive when we needed him, and stayed away when needed. Beef tortellini was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is truly one of the greatest restaurants you can visit. I'm speaking specifically about this location only. The two hostesses at the entrance were great. They greeted my friend and I and immediately sat us down. They were both giggling as they sat us down, so I'd like to think they were hitting on us. I doubt it though, haha. Anyways, our waitress was fantastic. She always noticed when our drinks were low and regularly checked in on us. I ordered the never ending pasta bowl, which was amazing. However, I'm a wimp and couldn't even make it to the second bowl. Food was excellent, prices were worth it, and service was top notch. This is a truly great dining experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this Olive Garden, great customer service and even better food!!! We were sat by the awesome Nia and our server was Mrs Shawn!!!! Love coming here for the soup and salad!!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE!!! Service is horrible, food is horrible, management is horrible. Came here with my wife and had a horrible experience. We aren't hard critics it takes a lot to get under our skin. I am surprised this place is still open the Health department needs to shut them down off sanitation alone.
 1) I over heard something about them washing dishes in a trash can because the dishwasher was down...I just threw up in my mouth sad that we were almost done with our food by this time, dirty dishes piled on trays were throughout the restaurant. also beware of bugs in your food there was a grasshopper or something in another tables salad.
2) Our server Eden was so sloppy clearly they don't enforce proper uniforms, she didn't look clean at all and had an attitude to match her attire...tacky! 
3) The manager Larry whom I over heard making racist comments with one of his servers Molly or Holly, about an African American family that was in the restaurant with their children saying \"they are black, of course they want free food\" with a reply from the Molly girl \"and they just had to sit at my table, f#@% my life!\" and it truly offended my wife and I, In fact my wife will be calling corporate to make a formal complaint. But back to the manager Larry he was not professional at all he just strolled through the place as if he was lost seemed very timid and not manager material (must be related to someone in the higher-ups) he came by our table briefly we told him about our concerns and he never returned but from the looks of our experience it doesn't take much to move up in the place. 
4) The food was small portions, cold, flavorless and took forever to come out, our appetizers came after the food had arrived, breadsticks please...\"oh they are making fresh ones they will be right out\" HA!! guess that is the lie you tell when you keep forgetting.

I could go on and on but moral to this review is DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!! you would be better off going into the 7-11 next door and getting the hot dogs. 
This place is a joke and the last time I will be coming back...farewell olive garden!"}
{"text":"Last week my family and I went to Bethel Park's Olive Garden and our server was Macey Hammers! She was outstanding. She provided us with excellent service the entire time. Some of us ordered the soup and others ordered salad but she brought the salad, soup and breadsticks out in less than five minutes! We didn't even have to wait. We always had refills and the food was alright. The pasta was dry but she brought us more sauce. You could tell she really cared about my family by the way she took care of us! Prices were okay, but we will definitely be back to see Macey!!"}
{"text":"We visit this location often and the food continues to be exactly what one would expect from the Olive Garden.  The downside is the location in the only far west location and therefore it is often a pretty busy place."}
{"text":"Went to Christmas Eve dinner with my family of 12.  We had a reservation.  I can't describe how wonderful it was that the waiter failed to put in both me and my husband's order in so that by the time we received our dinner, the rest of my family were finishing their desserts!!  Will never go back there again."}
{"text":"With a rocky start with our server not coming, I went to the manager to get us a server to wait on us.  We were waited on by Aisha, she was excellent, I don't know why our original sever didn't wait on us but they missed out on a 20% tip.  Thank you Aisha.  The atmosphere and food is what you would expect. The manager rectified the problem immediately with the sever that never showed.  Try the pumpkin cheesecake, it was excellent."}
{"text":"I have never had a negative experience at Olive Garden it's always great. Everyone is always friendly and the food is delicious (believe me I'm a picky eater).. But this time my experience was different.. I had a really long tiring day and just wanted to grab a bite to eat and leave. I don't usually review places but I just couldn't help myself.  My experience today was phenomenal due to the waiter named Haile. He was so genuine and made it clear how much he loved his job. He went above and beyond to the point where he even helped my husband put his jacket on. I asked him how long he worked at Olive Garden and he said 15 years. I mean this place must be amazing if a employee has been there for that long. Over all Olive Garden is amazing... but if you happen to get this server then you are in for a treat!"}
{"text":"I loved it here. Everything was great from the food too the service. We had to wait about 10 minutes because it was a holiday but once we were seated we enjoyed our experience and hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Second time dining at this location.....service has consistantly been very attentive.  Our waitperson, Sean S., provided excellent service and was very familiar with the nuances of the menue.
I had salmon and wife had seafood alfredo....both were tasty and portions was generious."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food! They don't take reservations but have a nice lounge area where you can have a drink (and kids are allowed in). You won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"It was doing a good business at 2:30 this afternoon, response from server seemed a bit slow but also looked like he was stretched a bit thin handling quite a bit of area.  The linguini marinara is tasty wheat pasta and sauce quite good, and portion fairly large. The spaghetti with meat sauce was also very good. For the first time in recent history our breadsticks were very fresh and right out of the oven. The salad seemed fresher today also...not that it's ever been bad.  I had sat my empty glass out to see how long it took to get the raspberry lemonade refilled & the waiter had to be asked for a refill when he came by and asked how we were doing.  Had he been paying attn it should have been apparent.  My guest had iced tea and her glass was about half full bit was not offered a refill. Fortunately she hadn't wanted more anyway.  Usually the refill is automatic and rarely do I need to request. Picky picky I know!  Our meals here are 9 times out of 10 tasty with good service. I'll put this one down to a good meal as well."}
{"text":"A $25 gift card brought us to Olive Garden last night. When OG was a new chain, I went a couple of times a year, but this is literally the first time I've been to an Olive Garden since the night I moved here in February 2004.  I did have fond memories of a pretty decent unlimited salad and yummy breadsticks.  They are unchanged and still pretty darn good.  I also had the Apricot Citrus Chicken dinner which was tasty and one of the healthiest options on the menu.  Because I've been tracking my food intake for the last few months, when I got home to record it all on my Daily Plate on Livestrong, I was shocked to find that the breadsticks are 150 calories EACH!  (Glad I only had 1/2 of one!).  We also shared an appetizer of Fritta Lasagna....which turned out to be 1200 calories!  Yowza!  1200 calories for an Appetizer?

The place was packed at 8pm.  Floor was dirty, but service was fairly good.  Everyone was friendly, but it just felt icky.  I guess that's the way the big box restaurant chains are these days.

So, 3 stars for the fond memories and tasty food and decent service.  But the huge calorie count/unhealthy food really makes me keep it at no higher than that.  Plus it's a big ole nasty corporate chain....  sigh."}
{"text":"Be it take-out or dine-in, the food is rarely flat out bad. 

The food is normally scorching hot, but not overcooked. The waitstaff is pretty friendly and helpful.

Sitting at the bar can be fun, their bartenders are lively and enjoyable to talk to.

The chicken and shrimp carbonara, lasagna, and chicken flatbread never disappoints.

The chicken parmagiana is good %90 of the time, but be careful of the tough cutlets that can be churned out of here sometimes. The calamari and spicy calamari is great when you dine in, but beware of tough or fishy pieces if you order takeout at night. The same goes for the stuffed mushrooms, they're flavorful and tender on a good night.

 I'd say the chicken alfredo has a lower success rate of being as good. The alfredo sauce can be sticky and clumpy at times."}
{"text":"Food was what you'd normally expect from an Olive Garden, but the service was the worst in all of my dining experience memory. 1st question from the waitress was \" Are you folks on a time constraint?\" should have been our cue to get the heck out of there.  Had to ask 3 times over 15 minutes for a beer; after passing by without it about ten times, she finally brought it but brought my companion the wrong flavor Margarita.  Ordered meals with unlimited salad but never once was asked about refilling our empty bowl; no surprise though since the waitress visited us once every half hour (not exaggerating)   - The analysis could continue, but MAIN POINT: If you want Italian in this neighborhood, go to Maggianos, maybe Bravo.  If you want Olive Garden, go to Cuyahoga Falls, or Mentor and be happier you did."}
{"text":"I liked the spaghetti, bread and salad! Really delicious! I ordered the one as attached picture. I didn't know the name of the deli. It was awesome. However, the another one \"shrimp spaghetti \" was so so."}
{"text":"I would not normally give a restaurant a 5 star review but the waiter (Jason) gave such great service.....this deserves a 5 star!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in from a long drive from phoenix from some lunch when we got into town. The service was good. but the food tasted like crap. the sauce was watered down.

After we all checked into our hotel all four of us were sick to our stomach."}
{"text":"As far as unlimited soup, salad, and bread sticks go the Olive Garden makes for a good lunch. Skip this place for dinner and make the extra drive to Little Italy or try Frankie's around the corner."}
{"text":"By far the best olive garden I've been to. The staff is so friendly it's kinda unbelievable and a BIG thumbs up to KRISTY IN PARTICULAR she was AMAZING. And the 2 for 25 is an awesome deal that should be considered regularly menu deal. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Typical chain type Italian restaurant ...salad was great and the past dish was average...It was our waiters first day so he was super nervous and wasn't that good but I figured it was first day jitters"}
{"text":"One of the worst meals ever.  Bread and salad good but cold pasta and frozen appetizers deep fried.  Ugh 

Not worth it.  They just made all the other ones for me not very good"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain ethnic foods, especially Italian, which is royally easy to screw up.  That said, why did I eat here?  Well I have been drug here for birthdays and such over  the years and the boyfriend and I just ate here this weekend out of desperation.  (I.e. no food since breakfast and it was going on 7 p.m.)

We had to wait 20 min. which went by fast.  Our service was outstanding which is something this location usually does well.  We both had the stuffed rigatoni with chicken.  My meal was typical.  Find the chicken (so did NOT look like the picture on the menu) and the pasta was woefully over cooked.  

It's Olive Garden, so......"}
{"text":"---There is absolutely nothing Italian about this chain--- They serve food that give horrible impression of Italian cuisine. --- Heavy tasteless pasta that are obviously made from preprocessed material, boiled to death, then drowned in either a very acidic tomato base sauce or some white creamy sauce they call by some fancy name. Many of the cheeses are also heavily processed that do not enhance taste. Breaded and fried seafood is a total disgrace to Italian cooking!! Worst of all are the chicken dishes that are choked, if not strangled in pasta!!! Chicken is not a garnish to pasta. Pasta is not a side dish. No discussion. --- the executives of this business or they themselves need to spend time in Italy and perhaps, they can learn something."}
{"text":"I found a big Lettuce CORE ( very end of bottom core!) in my salad. My waitress said \" We don't make salad here so it is not our fault !\"   I will never go back/."}
{"text":"Last night we (10 people) had a terrific experience at Surprise Olive Garden. Great food, great service, great fun.

We are 5 couples, 2 live here full time, 2 are \"Snowbirds, and 1 is visiting from Washington. We made reservations and were promptly seated in a small alcove off the main room. Very conformable. Amber G., our server, was right there and asked if we were ready to order drinks, which we did.

We tend to joke around a lot and give the servers a hard time and Amber was right there with us the whole night. She has a sparkling personality and we enjoyed interacting with her. I think she was rewarded well in the end.

Oh by the way, the food was terrefic also.  Several of us enjoyed their Never Ending Classics, while the ladies ordered off the regular menu. Talking later, in the parking lot, we all agreed the food was excellent.

I can't emagine how this evening could have been any better."}
{"text":"I went to Olive Garden last night with 2 other people. I was really not impressed. 
They have benches right next to the entrance which allows smokers to sit right next to the door so you have to walk right through their smoke to walk into the restaurant :( 
It was about 830pm when we shoed up we were sat right away, right next to the kitchen door, in a pretty empty restaurant :(
I at down and grabbed the chair to move it closer to the table and I put my hand in some sort of stick black goo, gross!
a few minutes later our waiter showed up and brought us our water a few minutes after that.
I needed a little time to decide what I wanted because I was super hungry, it was not like 8:45 and I was hoping soup would be out soon because we ordered it, I asked it was on the way and the waiter told me that we had to order before he could bring us the soup/salad/break sticks. Seriously? I'm freakin' hungry and I don't know what I want yet.
Finally we order and the soup and breadsticks come out about 10 minutes later. Breadsticks were hard as a rock and the Gnocchi was very soggy which created a poor texture. Zuppa Toscanna was good though, BUT THEY RAN OUT :(

AS WE ARE WAITING FOR OUR FOOD THIS GUY POORS A BUCKET OF WATER ON THE FLOOR AND STARTS TO DECK SCRUB THE FLOOR, NOT EVEN 8 FEET AWAY FROM MY TABLE...YES, THIS CREATES THE PERFECT AMBIANCE FOR MY DINNER! NOT!!!

The food came and it was okay, not OMG I remember why I love this place, good, but just okay.
My son got the BYO Tour of Italy and it only cam with a small portion of lasagna, 2 ravioli, and a very small portion of Alfredo, portion not worth the price at all.
I ordered the spaghetti with chicken, bacon, and veggies and the flavor was great, I would get it again.

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR OVERPRICED, COMMERCIAL TASTING FOOD TO EAT WHILE FEELING RUSHED THIS IS THE PLACE. 

DO NOT TAKE A DATE HERE

USED TO BE A QUIET, QUAINT, \"ROMANTIC\", INTIMATE ITALIAN RESTAURANT BUT, THAT IS DEAD AND GONE...SAD"}
{"text":"All I wanted was salad and ravioli. All I got was a glass of water. The restaurant wasn't too busy, but it proved too much for our server. Waited a while for water and the salad never arrived. Left dissatisfied and hungry."}
{"text":"I recently ate at this olive garden. I found a roach on my table while eating. Found five more before moving to another table. I reported it to their manager Sarah and her responce, \" don't take pictures of our roaches!\" I was not looking for anything more than an air of concern. Sarah didn't want to see my pictures and with her response it's obvious she doesn't care. I can only imagine what other issues are swept under the rug. I will never eat there again. I've added my photos."}
{"text":"Major props to this olive garden location. Came here with my fiancée on a Friday night. Yeah it was a little crowded but they got us in pretty darn quick. My date is visually impaired and has a guide dog and so I was majorly impressed by how the hostess, our server, and everyone in the restaurant respected and treated them. They pulled away a chair so the dog could lay at the table, they would always let my date know what and where things were being set, and seemed to do everything imaginable to make it a wonderful experience. Even with a busy restaurant our food came hot and fast and given a great amount of attention for all the customers there.
We both tried the 4 cheese panchiettas which were really really good. I had the sausage and could only eat half - it was even better the next day! 
I'll definitely keep coming back to  this Olive Garden location. Good service in this town can sometimes be hard to find but credit goes to Olive Garden to making their employees realize how important it can be!"}
{"text":"The most uncomfortable dining experience I've ever had.  Ordered  chicken caccitori manicotti,  cold in the middle with no mushrooms. Waited 10 mins to have some sautéed.   Waiter hurried, didn't listen,  distracted. ..never put in our to go order after been given to him 2 times...left without it.  More stressful than relaxing. Not happy."}
{"text":"Review for late afternoon October 29. 2017. We had been traveling all day, wanted to eat before arriving home. Decided to sit at the bar as it didn't look too busy. We did notice the tables were dirty.
Server ( possibly \"Susie\"? Shorter blonde hair with attitude,heavier build) gave us menus- we said we'd have a glass of wine and already knew what we wanted to order- she took the wine order said she didn't want to take the food order at that time.....apparently didn't want to take other patron's food orders either as we all sat forever while she went over and visited with some apparent friends who were there.... finally took food orders... told a helper to \"throw these breadsticks at them\" ( pointed to us).....all the while chatting up a storm with other workers about how slow of a day it had been. Poor service, cold food, no hospitality whatsoever =we won't be coming here again"}
{"text":"I love their unlimited soup, salad and breadstick for lunch special!"}
{"text":"This place creeps me out when the hostesses open the door, acting as if  you are walking into someone's house. Their act is very phony and a big turn-off. Food is okay. I am not sure why people rave about the breadsticks. I would call them hot dog buns with garlic powder - nothing Italian about them. Overall the service was good and the salad is above average at best. Reasonable lunch prices. If they would just eliminate the creepy artificial greeting at the door, I would probably go there again..."}
{"text":"Ordered online and came to pick up the order. The staff was extremely courteous and very attentive. They offered us free beverages while we waited. Everyone that passed by would greet us and smile. The food was hot and exactly what we ordered. I have gone to several Olive Garden locations but this one is by far my favorite because of the good quality food/service."}
{"text":"This is the worse Olive Garden I have eaten at.  Stay away,  food is horrible and service is worse.  Waited 20 minutes for drinks, received raw eggplant.   Saw a manager.  Horrible horrible."}
{"text":"I used to love this place as a child, when I didn't realize that this wasn't true Italian food! Many, many calories, and very heavy servings. 
The flavors are fine, but I would not choose to pay for a huge plate of grease and fat."}
{"text":"Food was great but service is real slow, took nearly half an hour to get our drinks!  Server didn't clear our salad and appetizer plates for quite a while, would second guess coming back!"}
{"text":"Olive garden is one of my favorite Italian restaurants. I love the Chicken Fettucine Alfredo and the garic bread they serve. Wide variety of wines and the staff is attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"If your not Italian, this place is awesome !!!! We love going there. But try to not go there during their rush hour. You will be waiting forever lol . The bartender there was awesome. :D"}
{"text":"V celebrating our friend birthday it was a great experience, we spend more than 2-3 hrs. The service and food soo great sure will be back soon"}
{"text":"we had dinner at OG on sunday, our waiter, Jeremy, was GREAT! he was attentive, personable and did such a great job!  the table we sat at was by a very noisy group of 4 women...as soon as the left the atmosphere great improved...Olive Garden's food is always the same, I enjoy the fresh salad and the soups..."}
{"text":"Not one of my best dining experiences at the Olive Garden.  I ordered the Tour of Italy and the food was very dry as though it was overlooked in a microwave oven.   The fettuccine Alfredo had very little sauce and was piled so close to the Lasagna and Chicken Parm that it ended up with too much tomato sauce in it.   The Toscana soup was very salty and the bread stick definitely nuked.   I ordered a sangria which was so sweet I squeezed the lemon and lime garnish to cut the sugary flavor.  Not at all happy"}
{"text":"So i have always been a great believer in giving praise where i see fit and i always figured that the reviews i read we mostly made by people just having a bad day. Well let me tell you i am singing a different song these days! I am now reading yelp before i go anywhere! And i hope i can help out the future customers of Olive Garden on Southern and Superstition Spring Blvd! First of all I called in to see if they were busy and Donna answered and she said there was no wait. So i asked her if i could make a reservation anyway since it was a friday afternoon and i know they can get busy. So she put us on the reservation for 4:30 for a table of two. We arrive 2 minutes before our reservation and checked in with donna who we had spoken to on the phone. Now she had already had an attitude as it was on the phone but i was willing to let that go. I walk up to her and she doesn't even acknowledge me, just keeps writing on her paper so i tell her we have a reservation and its for 4:30 and she finally looks up and says ok, looks at her paper for all of 2 seconds this time and says there will be a 10 min wait. I said fine and started to wait. The room was packed and i noticed a lot of people getting seated before us but i figured this was because they were here before us. So I played a game in my head where i memorized the customers that came in as i was waiting to see if they got seated before me. 25 min later 4 different groups of people that were groups of two, four, and five got seated all of who came AFTER us. My husband went back up to Donna and asked if she knew when we would be seated and she snarked back that it would be ATLEAST 10 MORE MINUTES!! K gotta say don't even bother making a reservation here or expecting the staff especially Donna to be cordial or even decent because as I sat there waiting for the 30 minutes I watched Donna and three other waiters roll there eyes and make faces at each other about the customers. Now i understand that some customers can be pains in the asses thats a given but there us no reason to roll your eyes or reply rudely when a nice old man comes up to you and asks if he needs a buzzer! I mean come on people have some common decency to treat others with some respect! Needless to say we left after 30 min of waiting and we will not be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"The food is always good here. We come often to this location. We get different servers each time but this time we got Rita. This woman is awesome! From being on point with every detail to selling us a bottle of wine (we were not planning on drinking) to just being kind and gracious. Truly a professional! We will ask for her from now on!"}
{"text":"You know what to expect for food from Olive Garden, thats why you went there.  What makes the experience great or not is the service, the wait time, and the overal quality of the facility.  I rated this experience highly based solely on the hard work of our waiter, Brandon.  He was very nice, personable, and actually GAVE A SHIT.   When he found out our appetizer wasn't out in time for his standards, HE RAN back to the kitchen.  He wasn't busy and wasn't trying to rush us, he was just genuinely concerned about his service being timely.  And when my wife ordered her cheesecake to go, Brandon brought her cheesecake out for her approval before he boxed it up.  Let me say that again... For her approval.  Who cares like that anymore?  My wife and I were pleasantly surprised and will go back to this location as long as we can be seated in his section.  He was truly fantastic and deserves our gratitude and respect.  Thank you Brandon."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very \"Olive Garden\"
When problems arise (e.g. Multiple inaccuracies in a Togo order), they are happy to fix it."}
{"text":"Slow service (probably because they were super busy) ... Ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo, the steak was rather dry.  I forgot what my wife ordered but she wasnt happy with it either."}
{"text":"Had the large salad, found a half eaten pepperoncini in my salad-disgusting. Food is lousy, overly salted garbage. Twice they served me a glass of wine with lipstick on the rim. Stay away from this dump, If you do go bring an air sick bag for later! The also have the stones to claim to be Italian, are you kidding me! VOMIT CITY !!!!!"}
{"text":"It is easy to ignore and a common target to make fun of, but I have had many better than good meals, and none truly bad, at the Olive Garden.  My children generally like the food and will eat the salad.  I get to gorge myself on all the soup (really like the fagioli, though not that consistent over multiple visits) and salad I want.  Sure there are alot better Italian restaurants in Madison, but this has been a solid option for us on many occasions."}
{"text":"All I can say is soup, salad, and breadsticks all the way.  The food was plentiful and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Fresh Salad, bread sticks and quite delicious food.
I had most of mine leftover because I filled up on bread and salad :)
will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"I have  soup and salad at the bar from time to time. Valdin there is awesome. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow waited 20 min for drinks. Server seemed sick and out of it. Food was great"}
{"text":"I was VERY impressed with our server, Brittany.  She brightened our day with her genuine southern hospitality and attention to detail.  Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Are you listening Olive Garden management?  The hostesses were very friendly when greeting us as we walked in.  And the service?  Ashley was an AMAZING server.  I can't even think of enough compliments .  We were totally indecisive and she recommended wines and entrees and never rushed us as we looked over the menu.  Perfect timing for refills, etc., and seemed genuinely friendly and smiling.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, it has proven that good customer service does still exist!!!"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and courteous. The food was very tasty and serving size was more than adequate. Overall an enjoyable meal and experience."}
{"text":"Olive Gardens one of my favorite restaurants to go to. Every time my family and l go there, we always get amazing service, and food. There are times where the service is taking to long but that is because theres a lot of people there. One time when my family an l went there to celebrate, I think my siblings birthday, they dent have good service. It felt like the service to get to the table took about 30 minutes and then it took even longer to get our food.and at that time they gave me the wrong drink and then it was 20 minutes until l got it back, and l even had to remind them about my drink. At that time my family and also felt like they were trying to rush us, so that we can leave. Personally that was one of the worst time there, but every other time we have amazing service and food. 

 The food at Olive Garden is always amazing. Personally always get this type of shrimp, but that's only because it has a different taste from all the other meals. I love how they have all these different types of pasta and cheeses on they pasta. My family loves pasta and different types of cheeses, and that's one reason why we love Olive Garden. If someone asked me what type of restaurant to go to, l always recommend Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This review is for the take home order for 3. The staff was friendly and quick, even though the place was packed on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. I don't necessarily mean just this location.

To specify on the location, the host was extremely nice; handed the little one her own menu. He was inviting and had a good attitude.
Sit down and immediately get the vibe our server is disappointed with our table. I'm assuming it's because we have a kid with us.
Every time the water went empty he'd mention he was going to get water and 5 minutes later he still wasn't back with water.
He didn't come check to see how our meals were. He went to the table behind us 3 times before he came back to our table.
Our dirty plates sat in front of us for 10 mins before he came over and asked us if we wanted dessert. Meanwhile our waters were still empty.
I noticed a manager; Lady, Wearing purple, that seemed to just walk by. She didn't look very happy.

As for the company.
WHERES THE FOOD? The portion sizes are SO SMALL! But it seems as though the prices just went up. That build your own tour of Italy, what a rip off

Not sure I'll be back to Olive Garden.
End rant."}
{"text":"Me and my wife were feeling fancy so we decided to go to this Olive Garden location as it was the closest.  We were sat down pretty fast and our drinks came almost instantly.  I had the iced raspberry peach tea which was pretty tasty.  Our breadsticks and salad was good as usual and we even got the Alfredo dipping sauce for our breadsticks that made the flavor even more great.  I decided to order the Tour of Italy which included Lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmesan.  I was awaiting the meal that cost me $18.50 and when it came I was less than impressed.  The chicken Alfredo was crisped black and way too crunchy yet this part of my tour was the best.  I did find a way to enjoy it after but then the lasagna came along which tasted like a freezer burn piece of garbage.  It had an awful taste and was cold in the very center, it ended up looking like mushy baby food.  Then the fettuccine Alfredo came along which wasn't terrible but was absolutely bland.  My wife decided that she needed some dessert to complete our meal so we ordered the the dolcini.  It is a mousse substance along with different flavors. They were quite good and I did enjoy that.  Overall it was a terrible meal which ended up in total with my wife's food 60 bucks.  The service was nice but that did not make the food any less gross."}
{"text":"Good service, affordable meals, and tasty to boot. Although it is a chain, the formula here works. There is usually a wait no matter what day of the week but all in all this is my favorite location in the city, keep up the good work OG!

I had the Stuffed Chicken Marsala by the way. :0

I can't say I have tried everything on the menu nor would I want to (picky eater here) I can assure you there is something to please your palate."}
{"text":"Food....cookie cutter Italian. You can make this at home and when they bring 5 breadsticks for a table of 9 you will wonder why you didn't stay home. 

Ambiance...like every other Olive Garden over crowded and loud.

Staff.....well trained but not especially friendly.

Verdict....I love Italian and you can tell how I feel about this place. You wont get a bad meal here but for the price you can do better."}
{"text":"I came to this location on Sunday 4/23/17 around 7-8pm with three friends and we were super pleased with the service we got! Hunter! Great job! Keeping up with us and making sure we got everything we need! Super nice! Friendly! And outgoing! We will be coming back for sure! Thanks Hunter!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! There new lunch special is amazing and so feeling! Everytime I go there with my family we always enjoy all the kindness and our wait may be a little wait but it's definitely worth all it! Never a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I will be honest I'm not the biggest fan of Olive Garden but the service this past Saturday was great.  It was a very busy lunch and my salad n soup were fresh as were the breadsticks. Waitress was attentive to our table. Additionally, I watched how a manager handled a complaint from the table near us. Very professional. Will def come back to this location."}
{"text":"Always great service! Food gets a lil blah sometimes. I would like to see then introduce a rose sauce with bowtie pasta!"}
{"text":"I came here before and waited for at least 20 min with no service not even drink no body even said hi. I see the server  standing right there with no response. I said let me give it another shot and today the same thing happened it is like we are invisible any way bad bad service. Now lites talk about the food I ordered the spaghetti with meet sauce it test like nothing literately the sauce like red water that all. Never going there again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local eats and I love the all you can eat pasta when they have that promotion. I try not to eat too many breadsticks because they really fill me up. The salad is always tasty too. Service here has always been really good and I plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Forget this place. The gm and the female mangers here are the worse. One has no idea what he is doing sense he has no clue in this industry of how to do things. While the woman named Sarah shawna idk can't remember the name, but can't do there job for shit. Asked what happened to Brittany they said he no longer works here. Never going back here and if all the servers were smart they would find somewhere better to work then this place of a joke."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden, but this location has kept me from going back. A couple months ago, there was an issue with take out. The store manager called and apologized and offered us a gift card to return. When we went back, we decided to eat in the restaurant, assuming things would be better. We watched for about half an hour as people who walked in behind us were immediately seated. We have 3 small kids, so a smaller table that seats 4 would have worked out perfectly. When I mentioned it to the employee who eventually sat us, he acted clueless when I pointed out the fact that from the beginning we could have sat where the restaurant was full of the patrons who requested seating after we had arrived. The waitress was okay, but would have received a better tip if she had not tried to shove her breasts in my husband's face at the end of the meal. The food was mostly consistent with what we are used to for any Olive Garden Restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Food is fresh, they tell you about specials, EVERYONE comes here. They make you feel at home. I ALWAYS love their salads & breadsticks! (It's addictive) TOTALLY worth going to on a date!"}
{"text":"Come here every once in awhile with co-workers on our lunch breaks, the service is always great as well as the food. It works out nicely because we only have an hour lunch and the staff always stay on top of our orders to ensure we get back to work in time :)"}
{"text":"i have been to the olive garden in metro center for many years until they close down :(  their  food was fanatic especially the stuff chicken  marsala and the garlic mashed potatoes, so i went to the oliver garden on 2626 n. 75. ave  and i order a  chicken marsala now i have my mouth watering for this fanatic meal, and what do i get 3 small pieces of chicken with mushroom and fried potatoes what has happen to oliver garden resturant they have gone down hill. this the second time i have been to this oliver garden resturant but never again they have lost my business for good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"UPDATED 11/23/17:
The Director of Operations Scott and Gen Manager genuinely worked so hard to accommodate us and correct our experience promptly within 2 days of the incident.  My family and I left very pleased with the amount of attention and care provided by both.  We sincerely appreciate their attentions and we had a wonderful experience yesterday.  They took our feedback and seem to really care to improve their staff training at night to prevent this from happening.  Excellent customer service and responsiveness on their part.  Thank you again and you certainly have restored our trust in Olive Garden!    we truly appreciate it!

It was the WORST experience we have ever had at a restaurant.  I even cirsed and I never have do.  But I was pissed off with the terrible service.  The waitress took 20 minutes to get us water.  It took her 3-4 times for me to ask for lemon to get it.  She doesn't seem to understand what multitask is and she would bring one thing at a time.  It took her 10 more minutes for the soup and bread (30 minutes into the visit).  But did not bring the cheese or lemons.  Still no milk for my son.  She finally brought it but forgot the cheese.  10 minutes later my soup was cold by the time I got the cheese.  Not even 1 bite when a piece of hair was on my soup plate and it took her another 10 minutes to get a new one.

I called by phone (from my table) to try to get a manager to come to our table.  Not busy (maybe 4 tables total) and the girls were hanging up on the calls.  There were 3 times the employees than customers.  Finally after several attempts, some girl picks up and despite my request for a manager, he never came.  She told me she would send one but never did.  They ignored us and other customers.

50 minutes since we came in the door still no food.  My children starving and I was heated and frustrated.  I walked inside the kitchen to get the manager myself.  Just to find him and others not doing ANYTHING in the kitchen relaxing.

The restaurant was not busy at all.  Not understaffed.  No excuse for this poor service.  
The manager reactions were so slow, that make me fee he might be on drugs or under the influence.  I dropped the F word and complained about their service.  Still he came to the table and did NOTHING.  Listened for 10 minutes and did not offered to speed up anything or correct it.  Just acted like a total useless idiot \"ummmm what do you want me to do\", \"what can I do\"? That is what managers do: resolve problems, not ask the customer how to do it.

But no offers to hurry up and take charge to fix it.  He appeared lost and had no clue what to do.  Definitely incapable of being a manager.
We were very upset, but not arguing/yelling, just getting our points across.  But he was completely useless and doesn't appear knowledgeable of manager duties and responsibilities.  Not sure if he is new or what the problem was.  
I have never experienced this poor service EVER.  One whole hour wasted from 9pm till 10pm when we stood up and left without eating since the manager did not offer to get up his butt and try to get the food ready for us.  Went to Dennis & ate in 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Salad is amazing and I love there bread sticks. Great customer service and very clean inside and Beautiful on the outside."}
{"text":"It's my neighborhood Olive Garden, and hands down the best one I've ever been to.  Great food, well done.  Take out service is almost always perfect."}
{"text":"My Family and I have been coming here for years, tonight my son wanted to go here for his birthday. This had been by far the worst diner service we have ever had. The Server was J Martin we where a larger party of 8 plus a high chair. They set us in the back room with a even larger party next to us. Our server was very rude to  me and one other member at our table because we did not order a meal just soup and salad. He was not friendly to either one of us, even the other members in our party noticed how rude he was to us. I did not want to get the manager involved since it was my son birthday so we eat and left. Hopefully this server can change his ways and not be rude to the ones that don't order full meals, not everyone is hungry to eat full meals all the time. He made me fell very uncomfortable eating their tonight so it will probably be quite so time before I want to go back there again. 
Also his helper or another server that was helping him I was the last of my party to pay the bill the bill since we broke it up when he returned my change he through the black folder on the table in front of me and all the change went flying over the table in witch my son watch this happen as well. I wish I had his name that was very uncalled for. If he was my employee he would be enjoy so time away from work and some work Ethics classes for his actions to a customer. You do not through stuff at your customers or on the table I  front of them. Something needs to be done for his actions. 
Hopefully others have noticed the actions on way these 2 employees treat your customers and training is applied, because like I said my family has been coming here for years and I would like to continue to enjoy going here but. If this behavior continues and spreads to other members of your team, my family and I will  never return."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner this evening.  Our server Khutso took excellent care of us so be sure to request him on your next visit."}
{"text":"After standing out in the heat for 20 minutes waiting to be called back, the hostess goes to seat us just for out table to be given away by another hostess. Our hostess then proceeds to walk around trying to find an open booth. Once we found one and are getting ready to be seated a different hostess comes along and says \"Ugh oh no, we are seating this couple there.\" The customer then goes on to get loud and says \"excuse us we are going to sit here we were here first\" Um excuse me, no you weren't, we were. The couple is seated anyways and both hostess walk away leaving is standing in the middle of the restaurant. When I finally say forget we are leaving and going somewhere else and proceed to leave thats when a hostess comes runing up and says oh we have a booth for you in the bar area. Okay fine. We go to sit down and the booth is a nasty dirty mess. Food, wrappers, finger nails all thrown in the corner of the booth. The manager tried to apologize and comp us an appetizer but when the food came out mine wasn't even hot. I will not be reruning to this location and remember now why we quit going to that location back in 2013."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  Service lower than mediocre, but you get what you pay for, right?  We sat in the bar, and had to wait 5-10 minutes AFTER we sat down for the table to be cleaned.  And then the bus boy cleaned every table around ours before he realized it was our table that actually needed it.  The server was VERY chatty at another table so it took her a while to get to us.  And then she was VERY chatty with us and all we really wanted to do was order and get our lunch.  We had two kids meals and a salad.  The meat sauce is much too sweet for my liking and the kids pizza is kinda small, even for a kid.  The bread basket was very full (much to my kids liking) and the salad was sufficient.  (You do know what you're getting....).  I'll go back, but don't really expect my review to improve from the three stars."}
{"text":"Nice place good service  , me and my family love it .nice and quiet , not too much noise , everyone is on . 
Love it"}
{"text":"I ordered the spaghetti with marinara sauce and chicken balls , the chicken balls were super dry and had a weird  taste to them ! Glad I was only serve two chicken balls"}
{"text":"Had crappy service today . Waited 10 minutes for someone to show up to take order , wait by show up I mean I had to flag someone down to come to the table which I wasn't pleased with , then they take forever to bring our drinks , then when we finally receive our food no silverware to eat with and once again had to flag someone down to receive anything. Not too pleased with service . You would think it would be better since they aren't very busy ?"}
{"text":"Friend and I ordered soup/salad for lunch. I had the gnocchi soup, friend had pasta fagioule. My soup was perfectly creamy with cream, mozarella, herbs, and a generous portion of gnocchi. Companion seemed please with soup too. Service was good. Waitress was attentive, but not overly. The salad is long overdue for an upgrade. Iceberg lettuce? Need I say more."}
{"text":"The minute you step into this OG, you will get the stench of smelly socks. Very hard to un-notice the smell. Service was poor, the waitress was just trying to get rid of us ASAP, even though we went in at 8PM (not too late for dinner in my opinion). The place is not clean, the table we sat was sticky.

Food was in par with the other OGs. Will I go there again ? nah for the amount of money I pay I would go some place else - that at the least doesnt smell.

Im giving this two stars only for the food."}
{"text":"Terrible!!! I use to love the Olive Garden, but this location has probably ruined it for me. My boyfriend and I went there to have both of our plates of food inedible. Mine was cold and even the manager agreed that he would not even touch what my boyfriends plate looked like. The manager took care of the bill, which he should of, all we ate was salad. Our server was good so we tipped her a twenty and left. Not once did the manager invite us back to make this up to us. We will not go back."}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal today.  We had the 4 course special, plus a beer and a glass of wine.  Salad was crisp and the soup was hot.  Entrees a little quick, but I had a second bowl of soup.  Belgian shock top ale was a good fit with meal.  The 5 cheese spaghetti. was good.  Service was spot on."}
{"text":"Staff is disgraceful. The hostess took 10min to even look up and realize there was a line out the door. Then after trying to talk to the manager (he was a joke) I got nowhere. It was like a debate with him and I'm just so shocked that they let him treat customers like that. Then after talking to his supervisor I finally got somewhere. WOULDNT RECOMMEND TO MY WORST ENEMY."}
{"text":"What a sad place to have dinner!  This place is by far is the worst establishment I have been to.  The food was standard like in all Olive Gardens,  but the service was just terrible.   They ignored my  reservation, brought wrong wine ( more expensive, of course), brought wrong food, zero apologies.  The manager chickened and didn't come to the table when  asked.  Stay away from this location is my advice."}
{"text":"Ten minute wait and easily most tables are open!!! Surprise it's lunch time!!!! I just passed six tables empty and clean. Beyond me..."}
{"text":"I'm dairy free, my daughter is allergic to milk (breastfed) I called to ask what their dairy free options were and the lady on the other end sounded as if it were a bizarre question.. 
She had no answer for me and as I asked if she was sure she started naming soups and the milk ingredients.. I continued to ask for a marinara pasta with shrimp and she sighed and told me to hold for a \"to go specialist\" this particular location is horrible at customer service. 
People have allergies and it'd be nice to have a friendly Worker be able to answer or find an answer to those kinds of questions.needless to say I won't be going to that location anymo"}
{"text":"We get there, and it is FREEEZING!!! COLD!!! The lady in front of us walked in and she got seated, we waited for about 10 minutes to get back to, so we ended up just going to the bar instead. The bartendar was really nice, super friendly, awesome! However, they kept switching rolls, meaning bartendar and another waitress. I ordered the breadstick sandwhich, it was really good however..... .WAYYYYYY TOOOO MUCH SALT!!!!!!!!!!! I honestly took a couple bites out of it and lost my appetite due to the amount of salt on it. When we were ready to leave, it seemed as the bartendar and waitress were  busy chatting and so it took a while to get someone to give us our Check. Food was Alright, Service was Alright."}
{"text":"We began our conversation to place a to go order on the phone as we headed west on I-10 at 27th avenue.  When we arrived and our to go order was still not taken (I-10 and 115th avenue), we were starved and ready to order.  We were hung up on (I don't know if this was on purpose or not, who knows) and had to call back only to have our order misunderstood three times.  When we arrived we spoke with the manager Dave.  He immediately retrieved his pen and paper and told us to order with him and that he would be making the food himself along with an apology. Due to Dave, we left Olive Garden with a different impression than we would have had he not taken care of us like he did.  Hats off to Dave! P.S. Dinner was great Dave!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff! Did take out and the nice young lady at the register said my pasta looked a little dry so she got extra sauce on the side for me. When I ate it it was delicious!! Will return!"}
{"text":"Yes, the menu is consistent across the Olive Gardens, but we've been coming here for past 2 years for the service--all our birthdays and other celebrations! Don't need to reserve the private room, the staff here will always make the accommodations we need. There are restaurants closer to home but we know we can get treated well here by Gary and his team."}
{"text":"Okay service and quality food. Not my favorite place but it's a good pick me up.  I had the chicken gnocchi soup and I really liked it.  I recommend it to someone who likes creamy soups."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary. We were so glad we did. We had a wonderful waiter. His name was Austin. The food was great and the service was outstanding. We will return to this location because of the excellent service we received."}
{"text":"My wife and I try to go to this location any time we go to the movies.  In addition to looking Olive Garden in general, this location we've noticed has been the most consistent in good service and properly cooked meals.  Be sure to ask for Kyle if you are stopping by, his service is truly exceptional."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from Rhode Island and found ourselves at Olive garden. This is one of the better Olive Gardens that we have been. Great food, good service,friendly staff and clean. Just wish they would bring back veal. If you want and crave veal you won't find it at any Olive gardens."}
{"text":"Dined there 4 times in the last three months.   Enjoyed timely and friendly service from the staff.   The food was great, and the high-end price menu was well worth the quality.   Highly reccomend for a great dinner, lunch, or dessert."}
{"text":"Last night, my best friend and I went to this location to enjoy some soup, salad and bread sticks. We were both exhausted having worked all day and just wanted something quick and easy. We walked in and were seated right away. Our server, Trent, greeted us, asked how we were doing and if we would like something to drink while we decided what we would like to eat. He quickly returned with ice water but gave us time to look over the menu. During this time, my friend decided to take her hearing aid out because it was just too loud. Our server didn't even flinch when I began interpreting for my friend. He was very gracious and speedy when placing our order and bringing out our meal. To complete the dinner, we ordered a pumpkin cheesecake. When he brought out the dessert, I slyly asked him to come sing happy birthday to my friend. Again, barely a reaction and brought back 3 other servers with him. He explained to my friend they were going to sing happy birthday and I was going to interpret. This is the cool part. As I was interpreting his explanation, the servers asked me how to sign happy birthday. I showed them a few times and they responded with, \"Okay we're ready.\" They started singing and SIGNING happy birthday! It was the most amazing thing ever. I have been friends with Holly for 3 years and out of all the restaurants we have gone out to, NONE of them have ever done anything close to this. I know it meant a lot to my friend and it sure meant a lot to me. We spoke with the manager of the location and informed her of how impressed we were with the service and with this extra gesture which was in no way required. I will definitely be back to this location in the future and will make sure to ask for Trent. Thank you OG for an amazing experience. :-)"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered car side to go and it was supposed to be ready by 8 p.m. We arrived at 8 and called for our order. The lady answered and put us on hold for 5 minutes so we hung up and called back. She then told us in a rude voice that she will bring us the food whenever its ready. We waited for 20 minutes before I decided to go in and see what was going on. Come to find out my food was just starting to be made and they messed up on one of my orders! The lady did not tell me that i was going to have to wait even longer for them to fix the mistake until I asked another employee what was going on. My food took an hour to be ready..and all they did was offer a dessert and said sorry. All we ordered was soup salad and appetizers! It was an overall horrible experience and we will not be returning to this location. Rude employees and slow service."}
{"text":"Dirty. Lots of fruit flies all over our booth and food. The service was super slow. Don't waste your time or money going here!!!!"}
{"text":"horrible and slow service if we could give zero out of five stars we would. Out of the 10 plates we  were given four for them were dirty . My husbands soup was spilt in the plate that was under the bowl, The waitress showered me with a cup of water, and my chicken was completely burnt. Never coming back again, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Our waitress was Joy which was certainly a true Joy to have. Food was Delish and Service was Priceless. We are from Chicago and truly appreciate good service. The Manager was very delightful as well."}
{"text":"Second serving of Never Ending Pasta Bowl was rather pitiful. Got one lousy meatball with small amount of pasta. Food was average at best. Service was friendly. Lineups out the door. I just don't get why."}
{"text":"I have been to Olive Garden countless times growing up. I've only been a handful of times in the past few years & usually it's for the soup, salad & breadsticks lunch. Yesterday was no different & that's exactly what my mom & I ordered. For our soup choice we went with minestrone. Their soup, salad & breadsticks are always consistently the same. The minestrone was good & had plenty of beans & veggies. Their salad is ok, I wish it had romaine & spinach, as opposed to all that iceberg, but I do like their dressing & croutons. The breadsticks are delicious but so fattening! I was good & only had 1, I could easily eat 5 or 6 of them. We also split the calamari. It was actually really good, lightly breaded & not at all greasy. Came with marinara & a parmesan-peppercorn sauce, both were yummy. Oh & I ordered the peach-raspberry iced tea, man was it sweet! Now don't get me wrong I LOVE sugar but this was definitely overkill. Total for our lunch was about $30."}
{"text":"First time coming to this location. Service was great. Our server Steven was AWSOME!! Very attentive. Made sure we had everything we needed. He also makes your interaction with him very welcoming. We were there for my daughters birthday. The gatherings of the staff was great. Definitely we'll be back because of him and great service."}
{"text":"Three stars sounds about right. My fav is the Toscana soupa. It has potato, sausage, leeks - super good. 

On this occasion I tried the featured dish, the chicken marsala (chicken, mushrooms, side of roasted potatoes and peppers). Umm, sorry to say but the chicken was comparable in taste to the chicken in a Lean Cuisine. Ouch, I know. 

I am obliged to come here ever so often because my boyfriend enjoys the Never Ending Pasta Bowl. Basically, a pasta buffet if you will, that you don't have to serve yourself. 

The service was good, no complaints there. I don't really dig the whole thing restaurants are starting to do lately, the multi-server thing. Most the time, the servers aren't communicating that well and it seems like a big waste, but OG has it down. We didn't have to repeat anything to any of our three servers"}
{"text":"Our server Tanya was very attentive and friendly. Great service. 
Food was very good."}
{"text":"Ugh. I have to say that the Olive Garden is the most consistently crappy restaurant around. It's far from good Italian and everything seems as if it was just poured from a bag and heated up. No matter what Olive Garden I've been to in the country, they're always the same. This is not a good sign. It means that there is one company making all of the food for all of the locations, which means that nothing is fresh.
I was in an Olive Garden once and some teenagers at a nearby table ran out on their bill and the waitress said that she is personally responsible for paying their bill. If this is the case I do not want to support a company with those kind of policies. Especially because of the amount of money that the Olive Garden makes every year."}
{"text":"I just don't get why people wait in line to get into this place.  My family and I go here from time to time, but I think today's visit will be our last.  We got a table right away, but we waited about 15 minutes before our waitress arrived.  She apologized and said no one had told her that we were there. I ordered bruschetta and salad and my companions had soup and salad.  Olive Garden's soups are pretty good, I'll grant them that.  But the bruschetta was just awful.  It was just toast with chopped tomatoes, no garlic, salt or olive oil at all.  The breadsticks and salad  were just ok; I don't see why people rave over them.  Salad did have pepperoncini peppers, which were a nice touch. The waitress was polite but seemed to be either new or overwhelmed. She never refilled any of our drinks and just seemed sort of distracted. We left her a nice tip though.  I've been a waitress and know how hard it can be, especially at a chain restaurant where the crowds and their demands are never-ending.  

I'm no food snob, but Olive Garden seems to aspire to lowest-common-denominator, faux-Italian food for people who've never had the real thing and don't know what they're missing."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. On our way in we over heard some people on their way out telling the manager how great their server Chelsea was. Because of this I asked to sit in Chelsea's area. The service was exceptional. She was always around to refill the salad or drinks. We didn't have to wait to order and when we were finished she brought the bill right away and waited for our cards. Very satisfied. Will come back and specify to sit in her section again. She is the gold standard on how a waitress should perform."}
{"text":"By far, way better service than the ones in the Bay Area!  Our waiter, Rachel, was very warm and friendly, and anticipated all of our needs...from drink refills to when our entrees will be ready (\"just a few more minutes\"), she was never late with anything.  And if you're on a health kick / lifestyle change like me, order the Linguini Marinara.  Even the version with whole wheat noodles was deliciosoo!!"}
{"text":"Derek was an amazing server! He started our night off with an amazing wine recommendation then led into the best cocktails we could have made by the bartender. Then with my dairy allergy he made sure to accommodate us by making sure the food we ordered would work for us. We felt very important by how frequently he checked on us at the perfect pace with a very personable demeanor. This location is very lucky to have a server such as Derek and we highly recommend this Olive Garden to anyone who wishes to dine at this location!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time! Kyle was our server, he went above and beyond our expectation. Food was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Come on its Olive Garden! Yes the food is always good  BUT the calamari was nasty small burnt pieces and I returned it. Server was nice and took it back no question so that made me happy.  I like this place."}
{"text":"Always very friendly and clean & very professional. They always know what the right wines to recommend for me. Love this place, my favorite restraint ever!!!"}
{"text":"I live closer to the centennial location but after 4 failed visits Id rather continue my visits at this location. The service and the food is always consistent."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. Only reduction here was the food. Pasta was undercooked and the breadsticks were dry. Not sure if it was just a bad night or if the place has gone down, but it wasn't good enough to justify the price. I'll give it another shot for sure, but the food quality has to improve."}
{"text":"Good food for the price! Love the unlimited salad! Good service ."}
{"text":"I liked their 3 course $12.95 special! I asked for chicken with sauce on the side and they provided it no problem! However we kept having to hunt down the waiter which was annoying. Decent food for the price and they always have great specials!"}
{"text":"Came here after having a bad experience years ago.  Only to find out that the service still sucks, the manager was very rude and was gossiping about us after we almost left because they closed down the outside portion of the restaurant.  The bartender and hostess also had very rude attitudes so it apparently is contagious.  Watched the manager talk about us with the bartender after ordering our drinks and look right at us.  I quickly requested the check and didn't bother ordering anything else after witnessing that, it was very easy to notice.  So, its set it stone now, never returning"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Olive Garden for a long time so last Tuesday, i told my daughters we are eating there. Well,  i wasn't disappointed. The food was good and filling, i didn't even get to a 2nd serving of my endless pasta. Service was good too!"}
{"text":"We went there last night (1/22/16), a party of 12.  It seems as though there was a mistake and they were not suppose to take our reservations.  They did however, let us in and give us our own room.  We had a wonderful time and the food was fantastic.  Our waiter was Adam and he did such a fantastic job filling our order and making suggestions.  We will be going back soon.  Thank you Adam and Olive Garden."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Olive Garden last Sunday night.  I had a coupon for a free appetizer which we loved and our meal was very good as well.  The best part of our experience was the waiter.  Zack was one of the best servers I have had.  He was quick, attentive and went out of his way to  accommodate our special needs.  It was a very pleasant experience and I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I really like Olive Garden but the reason why I am giving this place (green tree next to Starbucks) is that the service is not consistent over time. One time the waitress was so rude that she was throwing the food on us and hubby got his coke with no ice. I understand that it can bee too busy at times but I have been to other Olive Gardens which they are equally busy if not busier! The food here is good but I would really recommend Olive Garden in Robinson instead."}
{"text":"I love the chicken gnocchi it's the best soup of the house I have it every time I go I recommend it to all my friends and family"}
{"text":"Olive Garden food is always just meh. This location must be under construction because everything is basically in shambles. It felt like I was in a grimy mom and pop style restaurant. NOT what you are expecting when going to a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"They r just sooooooooo slow when it comes to curbside take out. It is painfully slow."}
{"text":"I've noticed a lot of reviewers haven't been giving good reviews on this place...

Not judging....i guess your mileage may vary.

But as for my experience, this place has been really good to us. Me and my wife come here all the time on special occasions. Every time we come and enjoy the services here the experience is pleasant. I Can say that this place is always crowded, but the most time we had to wait for a table was about 20 minutes...after we got seated the food did take a while to get there but we got a dessert to make up for the wait...and when we got our food...it was nice and hot! and like i said we always enjoy coming here. waiters and waitresses are always friendly to us... 

again...Your mileage may vary"}
{"text":"I was a bit surprised. Usually decent place to eat however the pasta this time was over cooked whereas it was disgusting. The waiter was a bit arrogant and acted as if he didn't want bothered with us. No offer to bring out another dish to exchange our meal.
Very poor service this trip and I must think hard before going back."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Italian food I love it fresh and tasty the people they're very nice and polite also they have a nice bar with a lot of drinks that you can enjoy good for kids and good for adults definitely definitely going back thank you I'll Oliver Garden"}
{"text":"I had very friendly and fast carside pickup service this afternoon! I ordered the lunch special. Minestrone soup and salad. I asked for onions only on the salad and that's what I received. I always double check before I leave places, just in case. It comes with two breadsticks but I wanted extra ones and some for later. Everything was fresh and hot when I returned home. Will be ordering lunch from here again! Breadsticks are amazing!! The minestrone soup is vegetarian as well! They also threw in two mint chocolates, a 20% off coupon for your first online order, and a magnet!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most consistent restaurant chains.  Everything is always fresh and tasty.  The staff is always friendly and the food is always good.  It doesn't get much better for the price."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Olive Garden in years and now I remember why....I ordered a cocktail that took almost 15 to receive and upon receiving it, it was the wrong drink and my friend who ordered the soup was told that, sorry it didn't look very good, that it was the bottom of the barrel...seriously, who says that? The salad was drowning in their dressing, the chicken and vegetables were swimming in sauce...it was horrible, save yourself a few bucks and eat fast food!"}
{"text":"What a joke! My girlfriend and I were rather hungry and we had a gift card for olive garden so we went here. Not only was the 'host' rather short and seemed to hate his job.. We sat and waited for a server. We sat there.. Waiting.. And waiting.. As a waiter repeatedly walked passed us. Asked the table next to us if they wanted dessert, proceeded to drop off their bill, took their payment without ever even acknowledging us. I guess our cue that we should have left before we were ignored for over 10 minutes sitting at the table was the couple speaking with a manager as we walked in, they didnt seem very happy. We drove the extra 10 miles to the e. Cactus location where we had awesome service and the food was enjoyable. So all in all, don't be surprised if you have a bad experience at this olive garden!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The staff is really friendly and the food is always good!  Thank you John for the wonderful service!"}
{"text":"First time to this location and needless to say we will never be back. We waited at least 15 min without a server even acknowledging us, even though we were seated right next to the kitchen in a nearly empty restaurant and groups of waiters standing around chatting with each other. Eventually the waitress did show up and took our drink orders (water) without even an apology about the wait. Ten minutes later and our drinks still haven't come, nor has she returned to take our food order. Deciding that we wanted to eat this century, we gave up and walked out."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent. Extensive diverse menu. Quantity and quality high. Delicious soups. My favorite: Tour of Italy. Reasonable prices. Superb service. Bethel Park seems superior as compared to other branches."}
{"text":"This particular olive garden is consistently good. Great service and delicious food. I live near it and dine there frequently always having a great dinner experience."}
{"text":"This is more of a review of our waiter than the restaurant, and he's probably gone by now, but I'll post it anyway. We ate here on a date night a while ago after a strenuous rock climbing outing at Phoenix Rock Gym. Say what you want about Olive Garden, but the food I order is consistently good. It may not be \"holy crap...that was amazing\", but I never have a bad dish, either. We had the chicken parmesan, which was big enough to split, which we always do. Couple that with the complimentary salad and breadsticks and it makes a filling meal. Now on to our server, Montique. He was very attentive and humorous from the start to the finish. He never let our drinks sit empty, he was always asking if there was anything else he could do to make our meal better and he gave us good recommendations for the dessert. After quickly finishing our dessert he asked if we liked it. I jokingly said that I thought we needed another piece to fully evaluate the taste. He laughed and returned a few minutes later with another piece of cake, which he said was on the house. How cool is that! Hopefully he hangs around, as he is definitely an asset to this restaurant. We'll return, simply because of the service we were given by Montique."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Lacked season and the pasta was stuck together. Be careful when getting  the appetizer sampler.... you get 3 mozzarella wedges and a billion ravioli bites. They should serve an equal amount of each appetizer in the sampler. The chicken meatballs are really flavorful."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. Every time I go there (every 2 months) they are always welcoming and know all about the dishes in case I want to try something new.  They are very family and business friendly.  When I had my birthday there they went out of their way for us."}
{"text":"Good service and great food. Came in late on a Sunday evening for our Anniversary. Waiter was very friendly and recommended two meals on the buy 1 take one home special. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Olive Garden especially to this particular one. Is clean the food servers are great, because none of this so far are not at all rude like in some other places. I love to eat the Shrimp Alfredo but to start off with an appetizer I love the Lasagna Frida"}
{"text":"I called to order a take out order.  I was on hold for 4.5 minutes.   They said 30 minutes. When I showed up in the parking lot a man was just leaving and said it took them a hour to get his food  and he called in too.  He waited over an hour for his.    I waited another  15 minutes for my food. I am thankful that I did wait an hour."}
{"text":"Was on my way to see my sister at the after having surgery she was getting home from the hospital. Ran into Olive Garden to get some take out.   Josh was more than helpful and was able to get our food ready and out the door in less than 20 minutes.  This was during one of their busiest time.  Josh thank you for being so prompt and had such a smile on his face.  Well Done!!"}
{"text":"Tour of Italy is my favorite!  So worth it and at this location I've never had a problem with the service or the food :)"}
{"text":"A chain restaurant???  I know, but since this one only has 16 reviews, I thought I'd help out.

It's an Olive Garden, if you've never been to one, you'll like it.  The food and menu is the same as any other Olive Garden.  Good unlimited bread sticks and salad.  I really do like the salad dressing here.  Best deal is the unlimited pasta bowl.  Good selection of different pastas and sauces and proteins.  But really, how much pasta can you possibly eat.  If you get past the initial serving you're doing better than me!  But for $9 and it comes with the unlimited and bread sticks!  Great value!

It's also a nice change from eating in all the casinos.  If you're in the area, and you're sick of the casinos...come here!"}
{"text":"Every time we have come here the service and food have been excellent!! As its the only Olive Garden serving a large area its usually busy but it makes for a good fun atmosphere! We try to go at off times to beat the wait and crowd but even during peak times the wait has been minimal! 
Its our comfort food place love it!!"}
{"text":"It would have been a 10 star but as we arrived we saw a long line. I didnt worry as this place is quick to seat people.  
I was given a waiting ring but about 5 min later saw an open but dirty table in the bar area.  I asked for it and was told in a minute. 10 minutes went buy, a smaller table was cleaned and was immediately taken.  The one i was waiting for was skipped.  So i asked again, sure let me get someone. Once again another was cleaned but not the one we were waiting for.  By then two of the front ladies are looking at me and commenting among themselves.  Not good!  Im deaf but im not blind.  Very disrespectful to do this to anyone. Finnaly i saw another person and asked if it could be cleaned.  Total waiting time 25 min. If my waiting ring would have not been taken away from me i would have been seated in 10.  My complait is against the two young girls.  Rude to talk about customers.  Yes i was hungry but i wasnt rude.  Erin took care of us once seated.  She gave us wesome service."}
{"text":"I can't believe I am rating a chain restaurant at a 5 star. Our server Maureen was amazing. I haven't been here in years (maybe a decade) 

We ordered the sampler with the stuffed mushrooms, cheese stick, and calamari. The stuffed mushrooms have a hint of crabs which was absolutely delicious . Cheese sticks were pretty good but the calamari was definitely boring. We made note to Maureen our server, she got us a brand new order of spicy calamari that was extra crispy it went from a 1 out of 10 to a 9 out of 10.

It comes with a great salad and lots of breadsticks. I don't remember much about the entree because I was stuffed by the time the entree came. I took a bite into my entree, just to verify I liked it. 

This place is surprising good for being a chain and if you get Maureen as a server, you will be delighted."}
{"text":"We were seated fast.  At the time we entered (445pm) there was no wait.  By the time we left at 615pm, there was at least a 20 minute wait with 30+ people in the waiting room.  Once we were seated, it took about 10 minutes to get our drink order.  After that the service was prompt.  The waitress even brought a pitcher of rasberry iced tea to a location near us so she could keep my partners drink filled.  (Which he ended up drinking the whole pitcher).  The endless bread sticks and salad was nice.  I was bound and determined to be full by the time my plate came.  My plate was the Parmesan crusted biscette.  I asked for it medium, but it came rare.  Luckily I really like my meat rare and only order medium because I'm paranoid about food borne illness, so I didn't send it back.  Asparugus was awesom as well were the mashed potatoes, but I thought the portion size of the mashed potatoes was tiny for the price of the plate that I payed($17).  Overall good food, good service, and I'd go back here again. 

Thanks."}
{"text":"Always have a great time here.  Gotta love those bread sticks."}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars... I would. Worst experience at a restaurant. Hosts were rude and unorganized. Skipped our name because they rely too much on a computer instead of thinking for themselves. The food was bland, dry, and came out wrong as it always does at this location. A manager came out to talk to us since they always get everything wrong. The managers here are the most useless use of payroll I've ever seen. I don't know how Adrian still has a job here. The way he looked at my friends and me creeped us all out. So gross! At least I think his name was Adrian.. couldn't see the name tag all too well. I saw him yelling and mistreating a lot of the staff there. Servers especially. Management is a joke. The food really sucks. Don't for one second think that Olive Garden represents Italian food.... I've only gone here twice but both times were terrible.... don't go to this location. Its always too crowded and all you hear is people bitching for discounts."}
{"text":"On 12/19/15 my wife two kids ,and I stopped in the olive garden 2626 N. 75th Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85035 (Desert Sky) for dinner.

My wife and daughter ordered shrimp Fettuccini and I decided to ordered the \"create your own pasta option\" Rigatoni pasta, Primavera sauce and chicken. My son decided on the kids pizza. We occasionally dine at different restaurants throughout the valley. The food arrived 20minutes later. My wife and I where completely flabbergasted with both dishes we ordered. My wife shrimp in her dish were very small over cooked and tasteless and tasted raw. The dish was very bland. It was so bad that she could not finish eating it and left it on the table.

I don't know if this was normal for this location or not, but I will never eat here again.

My server asked how my dinner was, and I told her that it was not very good I asked for an additional side Primavera sauce to try to possible help this poor dish! but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce??. I then stated I was very unhappy and embarrassed for them, she then stated she was sorry to hear it, and reported to the manager on duty.

I was shortly contacted by the Manager on duty by the name of McKenzie. I expressed to McKenzie my horrible experience and concerns of the location. McKenzie apologized for my poor experience and stated he was from another location and was just helping out. I was accommodated with one meal completely removed from my total excellent customer service on McKenzie part! But this location definitely needs a visit from whom ever it concerns ASAP."}
{"text":"probably the worst service I've ever experienced .....drinks stayed empty....waiter disappeared a few times....brought out the wrong food....poured peach tea in my regular tea....girl that was helping him had her hair on the pitcher of tea..... Quinton you tried son but stay in school bro.... it's not for you"}
{"text":"National Chains are NOT our usual destination, however this is very close to home and it was later than usual.
We missed the rush Friday night crowd...so bartenders were spiffing up when we arrived.
We always sit at the bar, and the bartenders are ALL good, friendly and take excellent care of us.
We dine out on Italian regularly...so we are not easy to impress, but last night this Olive Garden was better than usual.
Caesar salad (not vinegary) now has a crispy parm topping, instead of croutons...LOVED THEM!  Nice touch.
Herb pan seared salmon was very good, not dry, nor over/under cooked.  Broccoli was a bit overcooked...but usually is.  However, not mushy.

Thanks to Olive Garden, I can now be a RED WINE DRINKER...which I have wanted for us for a long time!  The red grape skins in red wine contain Resveratrol a very health promoting  component...good for the heart and immune system.
ROSCATO from Italy is the wine.  It is sweeter than other reds, and served chilled.  We adore it now!  Slightly lower alcohol content so you can sip another glass!  It is not overly sweet, just right!
Dream come true...a red we can love!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were waiting to be seated.  We noticed that people that came in after us were being seated first.  My husband approaced the two people in charge of seating and asked him why this was so.  The young African American female seater told my hunsband he was being hostile.  My husband was a bit taken aback and said he was not being hotile and the girl then proceeded to address the waiting area as if addressing an audience and said in a loud voice to my husband, \"don't you yell at me!\"  I then stood up from my seat and said to her that he was not yelling at him.  She refused to seat us and her companion seater then led us to a table and was apologizing profusely and also acknowledged that we were not yelling at the girl and had no idea why she was acting the way she was.  The manager also came and after hearing our side of the story offered us his apologies and a free appetizer.  We were starting to calm down but not too long after, I saw the same girl seating a group near us and she gave me a haughty look.  I will not return to that restaurant ever again and am tweeting the experience."}

Went their because i had  already put myself in the wait list had seen 0 wait time got there at 9:30 the greeter  said sorry we can't attend you  because our policy is before 9:30... i was turned away. Even though restaurant was still full of people. Very upset because we drove across town. Also i could of gotten a call not  to go if we were going to be turned away. When i was put on the wait  list online they do ask for a phone number so no excuse why not i wasn't  even called. Very dissapointed at their  customer service."}
{"text":"In General, I consider the Olive Garden chain to be one of the upper-average casual chain restaurant choices.  The Champaign Olive Garden has declined significantly within the last year.  I believe this is due to a change in management, but I am not 100% certain.  My last meal there was in November and the standards were that of poorly-run fastfood restaurant.  This is what I wrote about it at the time:

\"Remember how Olive Garden used to be a 'nice' place to have a casual meal?  Even though it was a chain restaurant and you knew most of the food was heated up in a microwave, it looked like real food and it almost tasted like it had been cooked.  It seemed a little nicer than your T.G.I. Fridays and your Applebee's.  Well, it's not like that anymore.  Not the one in C-U anyway.  I don't think I will be going back there ever again.  

 The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that the entire place reeked like a sour towel.  Someone had obviously wiped all of the tables down with a cheap disinfectant solution that had gotten a bit... ripe.  It was disgusting.  

I proceeded to the bathroom to wash my hands before my meal where I found two employees lounging about and chatting while pretending to clean the restroom.  Since they did not find it prudent to tone down their conversation whilst a guest was in their presence, I got to enjoy a pre-dinner melodrama.  Apparently an employee of the Olive Garden is trying to file a sexual harassment suit and the management had been asking both ladies if they had experienced any inappropriate behavior.  And while the accused sometimes gets a \"wild hair up their ass\" they did not consider themselves harassed.  Speaking of sex, Manuel looked FINE this morning and when he came into work they were like \"oh my GOD!\"  

When I got back to my seat, our waiter (who I admit was nice and attentive) served us a sample of white zinfandel that had the distinct vinegary taste of a wine that has been left uncorked for too long.  The food, which tasted decent, no longer looks, tastes or feels like real food.  Both the dinner and dessert had an artificiality to it that resembled an expensive TV dinner.  The textures were waxy and the cheese was lardlike.  While the flavors were bold, they tasted man-made and had a processed mouth-feel.  It was to real food what Velveeta is to real cheese.  The dessert, the chocolate torte, especially had the look of something that had just been plopped out of it's microwavable container.   The vanilla sauce was practically flavorless and the torte was only heated halfway, resulting in a jello-pudding like consistency to the fudge filling.  It is also made with artificial sugar now, which adds to its alien flavor and texture.  In truth, the food quality is comparable to a fast food restaurant.  The only difference is that they offer more variety and a few more low quality ingredients per dish.

I know it's just Olive Garden.  I know it's an evil chain restaurant and a glorified McDonalds.  I guess the thing is that it didn't used to be this way.  I think I've heard that they are under new management.  It used to be satisfying in a guilty pleasure flavor overload sort of way and it made you feel sort of ok about it because it deceived you into thinking it was real food.  But now it's not.  The seams are showing.  Quality of service and presentation has gone way down.  Corners are being cut and it shows.  You can tell it is just a fancier Fazoli's and it's really had to pay $25-$30 bucks a person for some sour wine and some microwaved Italian Velveeta in a place that smells like mildew."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Our party of only 4 got bumped twice by hostess. After finally being seated, I asked 2 different people 3 different times for a booster seat. It was twenty minutes for our drinks to arrive. After we had to clean up a drink spill and used all our napkins, we asked for more. Instead of bringing more napkins herself, she tried to find someone else to bring it. After the wait for that, i got up and got them myself. During the meal, our waitress was pretty M.I.A. We spent the whole time wondering where she was and if we would ever get what we asked for. Had to get up and have another server run our card to pay. Waitress got our take-out order wrong. This was not even the dinner rush!! And they didn't look short-handed. Lots of workers were standing around all the time. They all looked like chickens without heads. By the end of the night, we were running out of this place. Someone from corporate come in and re-train. FAST!!!!!"}
{"text":"$17 pasta that tastes like plastic? No thanks. Unless butter is your favorite \"flavor\" I'd opt for something else. 

Now I remember why I stopped visiting chain restaurants... OG has definitely gone way down hill as far as quality goes. And to top it off, their prices are through the roof for what you receive. GO LOCAL; better quality good and a better deal."}
{"text":"this review is entirely about the service . I wish I could review the food but our server Jamie never put in my order . Not only did our server not put in my lunch order with everyone else's by the time my order did come the party of 7 I was with had all finished eating so I got my lunch to go ...Oh and while I was waiting I asked for more bread I was rudely informed \"there is some at the other end of the table at which point he turned and walked away .We had to flag down another server walking by just to get our drinks refilled . I was very polite and didn't make waves as I was with a group of co-workers, Were I with family or friends I would have demanded to see the manager to let him know before I walked out that his server Jamie might be better suited at bussing tables or washing dishes that is how bad it was"}
{"text":"Have been coming to this restaurant for years. There have been numerous occasions where this restaurant was lacking but kept trying to give it a chance but as a family we have collectively decided that we will not go there again. 

There was one time where the restaurant ran out of breadsticks. We had to wait while they \"borrowed\" some from another location. We've ordered Zappa Toscana and when we told the waitress that it was lacking in the items it usually has in it, she said it was \"the bottom of the pot.\" 

Today, we showed up and were the only ones waiting (party of 5). We were asked if we wanted a table for 4 and a chair pulled up to the side. We declined. Then another party (7) walked in after us and were seated before us. When I asked the hostess why all she could do was look flustered and stutter. We were then seated. The breadsticks were hard and browned. When we told the waitress she told us a few reasons why it was that way. 5 minutes later we got 1 basket replaced when she initially brought out 2. The waitress forgot to bring us our Alfredo sauce boat we ordered. When we added two more Alfredo boats through their automated screen, they never came. Our daughter ordered endless soup and it was not brought out until the entrees came out. The waitress said she put it in that way so she could eat with everyone else and didn't ask us if it was OK. We had to ask for drink refills and the service was lacking. 

We will no longer go to this restaurant and would not recommend it to anyone. So sad and disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here for business and company lunches before and it was very decent (this was a few years ago). The soup and salad lunch special was actually REALLY good and fulfilling.

Recently though, we've been aiming to go here for dinner... but it's ALWAYS packed and the wait times are super long (45 - 90 minutes at times). Finally, we managed to make it there at a good time and actually got a table within 10 minutes.

A place like Olive Garden should have good pasta right? ... wrong. The chicken was (I imagine) cooked from frozen and chewy and gristly... which is really un-appetizing when diving into a tetrazzini or penne with sauce. After a few of these terrible chicken pieces, we decided to call it quits and left, our plates still half full.

Service, on the other hand, was great. People were friendly and helpful and if the food (vastly) improved, we would certainly give it one more shot... but not for another couple of years.

Parking is actually not bad, but be prepared to park in the Home Depot or Safeway lot as the shared lot between Olive Garden and The Keg tends to fill up quick.

If you're in this area and craving Italian, drive up to Sunridge East Side Marios... and have a pasta. They're consistent, great tasting and very quick on the order-to-eating time."}

{"text":"I ordered a lunch deal and asked the waitress if I could get a side of fruit. She said it wasn't available. My friend and her four year son were dining with me and when it was time to order the four year old's meal, the waitress asked if he wanted grapes. Are grapes not a fruit? Wth?!"}
{"text":"I usually never have a bad experience here but today was the worst.. I ordered wedding soup and salad.   She bought the wedding soup and it tastes funny.  I looked and there were beans and a old tomato in the wedding soup . I asked the server for another bowl because it had old food in it. She bought another bowl and there was a huge potato in it.   It supposed to be wedding soup.. she explained that sometimes the soup get mixed in with the others( well that's gross) she said she would try to find fresh soup.  By this time I didn't want it. Paid my bill she did t discount any of it. Never bought mints or even thanks.   I still tip 20 percent because I was a waitress for many years but today was just a bad experience at this Olive Garden.."}
{"text":"Went to address at 1010 W Elliot about 3pm (not very busy) to eat dinner with a family of five.  Was in section that already had 4 other families eating, and being served.  Witnessed one gentleman send his plate back.  Sat patiently for 15 minutes or more without being acknowledged.  We finally got up and left.  Before leaving I asked the hostess to speak with the manager (Kayla).  Kayla seemed genuinely concerned, the hostess who sat us down confirmed it was actually 20 minutes since we were seated. She offered a gift certificate which I declined, I just wanted to make sure she was aware."}
{"text":"The manager Shawna is irresponsible and misleading. She needs to be replaced right away. As a manager, her job is to make sure that the consumer is happy and has an enjoyable experience. I came to eat here with a party of 7 and from the moment we got our experience was worse than an experience I once had a taco truck where I found a fly in the middle of my cheese quesadilla. I ordered a penne with pink sauce and noticed a bug in it (look at the image I posted) and instead of changing the dish for me, the manager first decided to ask me if iiiiii put the bug in the food ....I was confused at first because I didn't know that people carry around bugs in thier pockets everywhere they go. I thought it was insulting honestly and writing a complaint on yelp should be considered a compliment bc im sure others would take it much further. Bottom line...I hope u like bugs, cuz I was lucky enough to just end up with a small one, but God knows what they have in their kitchen. 
Goodluck!"}

Sat there... for 10 minutes while the bartender and 2 waiters flirted with each other until I finally called to their attention that I was waiting.  The female bartender apoligised, asked my name and \"How are you this evening?\".........  I replied \"not very happy\".  She asked why... I retold the story above.  She apoligised... asked if I  would like a drink?   Snottily I replied \"Yes, but not if I have to pay for it.\"  She said \"No sir, it's on the house\".  Finally some customer service! ...

I used to love olive garden till my experience at this one. I was visiting my buddy for a long time again. We were greeted at the hostess stand and we did not have to wait (granted it was around 8:40pm). We waited a long time till the waitress came by. Jessie or Jessica or Jennifer  something. At first she came immediately then (to my utter disappointment she dissappear ed for 20 minutes). Another waitress was wondering if we had been helped and even asked others where our waitress was. It was an embarrassing moment. We saw a server who has helped is before and the server greeted us.... We were not at that server's table. She even talked to that server as she pasted. Okay maybe she doesn't know I haven't been here before. I will give her that. It continues to get worse. 
 Finally  when she came around she made the person I came with so uncomfortable they left. The reason? They were of a certain gender and ethnicity and status and appearance, and I was not. 99% of contact was addressed to my buddy. It was obvious from the way they offered that soup and salad was free and insisted I should take it home to that person (this is after I absolutely refused twice any soup, salad or cheese from them) the reason why my buddy left. This was unacceptable. How would they k ow if i am staying or visiting my buddy? Nope, just more assumptions. If a customer refuses a food item, the server should respect his or her wishes. This was only the begining. 
   The other server brought me food. I understand if the restaurant was busy, but that was slightly rude. Okay, maybe she had something to do in the mostly, now nearly empty restaurant. I feel better when my entrée finally arrived at 9:30pm. One hour later after I sat down. That's fine. Suddenly, crunch. A shell on a 'shell-less shrimp' . Thank goodness I took a picture. However, she suddenly  came to take the plate away before I can take the close up of the shells. (First picture is the first one I took. It describes this moment.) I ask for another. She asks that it will be taken off the bill, BUT she asks if I wanted this shrimp boxed.... Why would any sane person want the shrimp they asked to be taken away boxed? First of all I can only assume she thinks I am doing funny things to get free shrimp. I refuse anything of that notion. Secondly, I can only assume she thinks I am younger than most by my appearance only or because I am a certain ethnicity. I was never offered a sample of wine (even when I was with my buddy). Other times we were asked our age first then offered wine, but no this service was worse. I noticed at this a table with 11 people of a certain favorable age, favorable appearance, and ethnicity had already been served and left while I  wait. 
 So I was not happy and feeling quite disgusted at this point. I get the shrimp now and behold. Fewer shrimp plus shells. It smells like it was reheated (for the 15 minutes I had to wait). Thank  goodness I took a picture. It is obviously shown below the difference. I did not touch or eat anything on that plate for fear it had been tampered with. The manager was called in. I do not  believe she offered a name. She Offered to take the bill except for the appatiser I ate. I refused and paid the entire bill with cash because I was being nice. I left but forgot I would like to write a comment. Behold, it was past 10 already and the Hostess would not let me back in. Even though she saw me walk out a few minutes ago. Why? 'Safety reasons'. Probably because I was wearing a sweater, no makeup. I was finally let in due to the manager after waiting insistantly with the protesting hostess. At this point you can guess I was very upset. The manager asked if I wanted my change. That was the first thing she said to me. Not, how can I help you. Honey, I do not want money. ... probably once again from my ethnicity or age or appearance. I never raised my voice just insisted on writing a comment. Unfortunately, she tells me I cannot do that. Why? I paid in cash. Sure. I will pay in credit this time. Forget giving a message to the gm. I know that won't be delivered because 1 customer is not happy. Thank goodness for yelp and media. Well I definitely paid in credit just to write the comment. This comment is now on for  my friends on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, instagram, mass posted on Whatsup and posted on my personal Web site along with pictures

      Did I mention she was 'helping me' by trying to fill out my customer survey. I wasn't even the one to punch in a few answers and not even the one to physical punch in the amount of tip. Can you imagine a customer survey not completely filled by the CUSTOMER? 

This dinner was over 1 and a half hours long for 1 meal for 1 person. Be ready for terrible service and sub-par food if you look a certain way. Be sure to also get lucky and have the good server as well. 

No amount of breadsticks, salad, soup,  or cash is worth this."}
{"text":"Very sweet waitress named Mandy, asked if we wanted a sample of wine right away. Came back to check on us periodically but not too often and had a great lunch experience. Didn't have too long of a wait for anything. I will definitely be back. Only downside is I feel the quality of food has gone down but prices remain the same. Nothing against the waitress though."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Waited ten min to be greeted was never offered wine or dessert! Never received refills on drinks bread sticks etc took our server 10 min to come and check on us! Will never return to this location!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"From all the olieve garden restaurant i have ever went to. THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY OLIEVE GARDEN THAT I LOVE (only this north nellis area) simply because, the manager is super super nice, the workers are so friendly, everytime i come here, they know exactly want i want, i dont even ask for it. I never had any problem. I come here over and over again. You guys are fantastic."}
{"text":"Standard Olive Garden, nothing too special. I did a catered lunch from this location. The order was correct, although not ready at the appropriate time. The staff was friendly and that can make all the difference in diffusing a tense situation."}
{"text":"Tonight I called in an order after being on hold for 15 mins they rudely took my order. Every time I've been to this location iv had a problem with my order. I've never complained but the last time they forget a whole meal that costed over $15. I call and spoke to a manager who told me just to let them know the next time I stopped by. I advised the person taking my order who told me to talk to the manager when I picked up my order. When I spoke to the manager she said she couldn't do anything about it but offer me a $2.99 dessert because she had no idea about it. I should have known better and checked my order but I didn't till I got home and sure enough they forget my side of mash potatoes and didn't give me salad dressing. I called them they said I was not charged for the mash potatoes they forgot to ring it in and offered to send me a $10 gift card. I didn't want a gift card just wanted my food to be correct. I asked if I could get it next time but the manager said no only if I drove for it tonight. I live 20 mins away so it's a 40 min drive round trip. I didn't want anything free all I was asking is to please get my food right. I had a dry salad and no mash potatoes for my little ones because the stuff was to busy gossiping at the bar and the managers are no help."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch 10/28/2013.  Got seated right away, our server was very pleasant and got our drinks really quick.  The chicken & gnocchi soup is the fricken Bomb!  So was everything else we ordered. Since we are from Hawaii and don't have an Olive Garden of our own yet,  our server gave us a bottle of their salad dressing as a gift which was so sweet of her!  We're planning to use it as a marinade on chicken or fish. Definitely a great place to dine.  Can't wait for them to open up in Hawaii:)"}
{"text":"Came at 4 o clock with husband and 2 kids. Was told I'd have to wait 15 minutes because theu didn't have enough servers. Although there were 7 people standing behind the welcome counter. Only 2 tables had guest.they were slow. 

Took over 8 minutes to get water to the table. Window seal covered in dust. 

Waitress was polite and friendly. Fair prices. Good food."}
{"text":"I really like the bar. The bartenders are awesome. One even takes the time to write a random fact on a card and puts it in with your check. Did you know the platypus hunts underwater using electro-location? The bartender did."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Olive Gardens in Phoenix. It is always clean and most of the staff are friendly and pleasing people. 

We went to this Olive Garden for lunch this weekend and like always it was packed. Our waiter was the very sweet and on task! He was great and catered to every single one of our needs in a speedy manor.

My husbands food was not cooked correctly and we made the waiter aware of this. He then fetched the manager who was a horror to deal with and offered us nothing for their mistake, not even an apology. This was very frustrating after having such great service. The waiter took it off of our bill with us even saying anything more. I just think that it is pretty pathetic when managers do not step up and do their jobs correctly and then it becomes the waiters responsibility. 

Thanks to our waiter Anthony, who has much better customer service then his \"superiors\"!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice with my honey and I have no complaints. On our second visit I ordered the chicken gnocchi soup as usual however this bowl was lacking the dumplings (main reason for ordering) my husband informed the waiter and they came right out with another bowl full of dumplings! & it was Sooo good. There prices are great for the amount of food you get, we always need take home bags!"}
{"text":"This place when it opened years ago was a great place to go with friends or family and to a certain point it still is.  They need to update their menu and make it seem less like a Denny's experience.  I try to avoid most chain restaurants and stick to the more trendy places. This is no exception."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Never a bad experience!! We always hope manager Susan Is working!! Food is worth every penny and service is awesome!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here quite a few times. The times that we are lucky to have Martel as our server we feel the service is exceptionally high. The food has always been great. Everyone could take a lesson in customer service from his outstanding personal skills!"}
{"text":"Overpriced just \"okay\" italian food.  My dinner included overcooked (mushy) pasta and overcooked shrimp...husbands chicken had gross fat and chewy sections.  Not worth the $50 price tag...should have ate at a local joint."}
{"text":"First we got a table and then the server took about 10 minutes to get to us at first it was okay cause we thought he might have been busy but then he came we were being helped but mostly everything was being thrown at us at the table we let that pass too our food was coming out right but whenever we asked for something the server was taking forever service was just bad and to top it off it was my birthday lunch and the experience was not so great staff at the chandler location are way nicer than staff here at this location"}
{"text":"The marinara sauce can use some work, but the food combinations were good. Very much enjoyed our server Marissa B. She's was efficient in managing our table and was very kind and personable."}
{"text":"Our main complaint was that it was hot in the restaurant. This was about noon and the air conditioning was off or not working. This was just a couple of days ago.
I enjoyed the food, the wine, and the waitress was top notch. But I was boiling right along with the pasta."}
{"text":"Not bad.  A little disappointed with portion sizes.  Great chagrin over the final tab - paid more than we felt it was worth.  Service was pretty good if you can get past this waitress's really shrill voice.  Again, not bad, but far from great.  Wouldn't hurry back."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden! The food is always wonderful and the staff is always so nice! Only downside: I eat WAY too much! Lol"}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation this morning. When the customer service gal came on the line I asked to make a reservation. She said one moment and I was put on hold for nearly 15 minutes. I hung up and called back. When I got another lady on the line, I was abruptly told they don't take reservations. I asked her not even for larger parties and she asked me how many. Then she told me NO you just have to come and wait. I asked her how long the average wait would be on a Tuesday at 6pm. She said 45 min to an hour and half. This is unacceptable. Some people just can't wait around to eat. Children, Elderly and Diabetics need to eat on schedule. Thus we plan and make reservations. We research the menu prior so we generally know what we are ordering.
My only option around this no reservation policy is to go early and get a table for us. They have no idea that they are wasting THEIR time. I will be there early I will get a table and I will sit and patiently wait until all of my party arrives. I don't care if we suck up a dozen seats for 4 hours, just to make sure we have seats when we need them."}
{"text":"First time back from a not so stellar experience.. 

I am amazed with our server Alex... She's got to be the most on point server I've had in years.... 

Drinks were 1/3 full and new ones were placed in front of us with out us even asking.. 

Food was perfectly timed from apps to entree to dessert.. 

Funny and personable yet still got her job handled... My god... I believe I will be coming back much more just because of her!!! 

Olive Garden, you've got a great employee!!!!"}
{"text":"Food = Gross
Service = Horrible

Its very obvious their food is frozen and heated up in the microwave. Save your money and go to Carrabbas!"}
{"text":"Ok so this used to be a good restaurant but I have no idea what happened. My chicken was saltier than the damn Atlantic Ocean, then they messed up my friends order completely!! After that whole mess, the pasta was really heavy in cream or something, because I threw up everywhere in the bathroom with my friend right there. That's embarrassing! Olive Garden, please step it up, your restaurant used to be a very nice place to eat! But now, I can't stand it. Every time I drive by that place, I get reminded of the horrible food and me throwing up in the bathroom."}
{"text":"I ordered take out last Saturday night. I ordered 4 dishes:chicken scampi, chicken alfredo, 5 cheese ziti al forno, and shrimp alfredo. I got 2 soups and 2 salads with it. Also, I got breadsticks with the order. Everything was good besides the chicken scampi. The chicken scampi tasted plain. Overall, everything was fine."}
{"text":"Not as good of service as other locations, but man I love Olive Garden regardless."}
{"text":"I always stuff my face, and I always love it. Fabulous food, great service."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever at an Olive Garden. Will never be patronizing another Olive Garden. In the Ohio area again."}
{"text":"Cold mussels and cold bread stick. The restaurant looks unclean and tasting mussels as starter- only bottom of bowl was a little bit hot. Everything else is cold - you can tell by starter, they really don't cook in the kitchen just make a lot of food then bring it out no matter what. We cancelled our main dishes and just left. I guess sometime you have to believe yelp."}
{"text":"I came here today 9/21 with my cousin and her daughter to catch up and have some lunch. Our server's name was Ray. He was very nice but kind of forgetful . 
My cousin ordered a strawberry passion fruit lemonade , and a shrimp scampi special order (must try!). Her daughter had Mac n cheese with a side of fries , and I had a peach Bellini with seafood Alfredo . I also asked Ray if he could bring us zucchini frittata as an appetizer . He said that was a great choice since it is the last day for it. 

When our meals got to the table by another server, pretty quickly I might add, there was a few things that were off. 

My cousins' lemonade was a sprite, she had asked for grilled shrimp and got fried shrimps instead and Ray came up and told me he had forgot to add my appetizer and If I still wanted it. I said no.

Overall, it was an okay experience . I really liked that Ray was friendly but I would've liked to really try those fried zucchinis !"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the service is great. The second time I went with my family a waiter named Juan Ortiz was superb at his job considering he only been there less than 3months. it was great and he is just great at what he does and the personality suits it all and I highly recommend the place to eat and ask for him. My family enjoyed his service and he was friendly and efficient in what he did. My husband is hard to please when it comes to eating out but he really did enjoy this one. My family enjoyed his sense of humor and his fast service and friendliness. And I am a big tipper and this young man is worth every penny"}
{"text":"The one thing I like from Olive Garden is their Famous Home Salad and I know it is easy to make but it's much more better if it's from this place. Ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Carbonara which is a big full plate and I am so impressed with it coz other places it is just minimum portion. I tested out our server if there is a free dessert for a birthday celebrant and he flatly said \"NO\". Hmmm I think it depends on their mood because at the Outback the server was really delighted to give us a complimentary dessert. Anyways, given the fact that he said \"NO\", I wasn't impressed also the time we spent over there. We kept on waiting for him to get our to-go box so it took him 10 minutes then asking for our bill took him 7 minutes, then giving our gift card took him 10 minutes.  Then giving our change back took 8 minutes. I almost feel asleep waiting for him. I know it was busy a little bit but I was just really bored waiting for him to be done with our service. Oh boy, time to move that ass a little bit faster please!"}
{"text":"We love the Olive Garden! Got in around 6:30 and had to wait about 25 minutes which was expected on a Saturday night but well worth it. The hostesses were very friendly with greeting and seating us. Our server was Ryli. She was very attentive and friendly. For dinner I had the five cheese ziti al forno while my husband had salmon bruschetta. Both were impeccable dishes. Ryli was great with drink and breadstick refills. She would always check in to make sure everything was going well and we were okay. We will definitely be coming back and asking for Ryli."}
{"text":"Good food but my chicken and gnochi soup literally had ONE gnochi in it! And the tiramisu has dry ladyfingers in it. However, the service was great."}
{"text":"Horribly sweet sauces, ditsy wait staff, food is terrible with tiny portions, very bad menu options, gave me the wrong sauce, soup is pitiful.  Just overpriced and gross!  Small portions are appalling."}
{"text":"Everyone knows The Olive Garden is notorious for the unlimited salad and bread, and this is why I went. 

It was very loud, and the layout of the restuarant isn't great because we were on a main route for all people to walk to their tables and to the kitchen.

We ordered white wine, and there was no ice bucket for our wine to rest in. So by the time we were ready to pour our last glass, the wine was warm.

Our waitress started off very strong (great service, friendly) but then got forgetful and pushy trying to hurry us up (came and asked if we wanted dessert, said we wanted to finish our wine first and then she brought the bill and mentioned she was being \"forced\" to go home).

The chicken's texture and taste were like tofu. If it was real chicken I question as to where the restaurant gets their food.

Disappointing all around. We ended up going elsewhere for dessert and more drinks where we liked the atmosphere and the service and food was appropriate.

Will not go back here again."}
{"text":"Olive Garden, Why do you put coupons out if you fire your employees for taking them? Just because the percentage to sales is high you fire employees. You are a ridiculous company for doing that. I will never eat there again and I will make sure my family and friends know this is how you treat employees that have been loyal to you. No investigation you just go by your numbers."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and received terrible service. Will never go to this venue again. Had to ask the second bartender for the salad and bread sticks. Sat there for at least 5 min to be greeted by the 2 bartenders who were busy talking to the guests who were sitting next to us."}
{"text":"We went to eat there yesterday and the service was the worst service I have ever had took 40 minutes to get our bread our food was cold we went before and loved it it was no good today would not recommend it again"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the quality of food at this chain is going down. Breadsticks were crunchy (why!!?) and my chicken alfredo looked like it was sitting out for a while before the waiter brought it out. When I stuck my fork in it for a bite, I picked up almost all the pasta on the plate--wayy too dry!! I ended up asking for more alfredo sauce. Chicken was not good either. Very soggy and oily. I remember OG being sooo good back in the day. Oh well, at least the salad was tasty."}
{"text":"My mother wanted to take my wife and I out to dinner for my wife's B-day, we were a party of eight, we were assigned two waitresses that had a difficult time getting on the same page. Wrong order, wrong drink refills, and it took 1:49 from the time we placed our order until the food reached the table. A member of our party stated a food allergy, he had to order twice and still received food that contained his stated allergy. Upon notifying the manager we were told not to worry the check was taken care of and he apologized. He suggested we dessert as well, which took another 34 minutes, and arrived with the check. Upon leaving we had to walk by the rear of the building were the waitress and manager were talking and over heard her complaining about us, when confronted the manager apologized again and returned inside. Needless to say we will not return to this location again, and I would suggest that you do the same. We were not the only ones with a grievance as several other 
patrons were given gift cards and comped bills."}

{"text":"Terrible customer service!!! Wasn't greeted by staff when I came in. When being seated the girl taking me to the table was cutting through people leaving and a waiter with a pitcher of ice. Waitress was cold. Machine on table was blinking out of paper, wine glasses never picked up off of table since they aren't being used. My meal came before my salad or bread sticks. I had to ask about my salad and bread. I went to mix my noodles and a black wiry hair was in my noodles. I informed the waitress when she was bringing the salad and bread sticks. She just looked at it and said \"oh it's black\" and took the meal. No apology and never reported it to the manager. The manager was doing his rounds and I informed him about the hair that was in my food. He just said he would have to look into it, once again no apology. The bill came, no comp, no discount and no apology. So if you want pubes in your meal and crappy service this might be the place for you. If your looking for a quality meal with good service look elsewhere. I'll be writing corperate later tonight."}

{"text":"let me start off with the service was amazing and our servers and waiters provided us the best customer service i have experience in a long time but I have a huge issue with this Olive Garden

a friend and I decided to do lunch on a Friday afternoon and we went into this location at 12 o'clock exactly and it looked like it was really busy from the outside but we got seated right away

the server and hostess were very polite got us our drinks right away and then our waitress came she was super  friendly and helpful by showing us all the specials 

we decided on a appetizers fairly quickly because I had to be to work right after lunch. as soon as we got the chance and knew what we wanted we both ordered Alfredo mine was seafood and my friends was grilled chicken

we ordered the risotto bites for an appetizer they were a cheesy risotto ball and it was dipped in batter and deep fried with a homemade crushed tomatoe sauce and shredded cheese on top  one of our favorite things about Olive Garden is the endless soup salad and breadsticks and let me tell you what she kept it coming she kept offering us the freshly shredded cheese which is absolutely delicious and when I'm ready she brought us the amazing Alfredo even throughout the meal she refilled are breadsticks   we both had the spicy potato and sausage soup which is amazing as always very creamy very hearty  and it even has kale in it  my friends chicken alfredo was amazing a chicken with freshly grilled it was not dry it was very moist and juicy and handles were home made my seafood Alfredo the sea food was cooked perfectly it was nice and tender the alfredo sauce very creamy and buttery and rich and it was just full of flavors I could soak up with the breadsticks

she boxed up my leftovers and our leftover bread sticks and even gave us cups to go for drinks when we had it out so like I said the service was amazing the food was amazing the locations great 

the big issue that I have is when our bill came I paid with my credit card. our bill was under $40 and I gave her a7 dollar tip (in cash) well later on I noticed that not only do we have our lunch tab on my bank account I also had a almost $50 charge from Olive Garden that was subtracted from my account so I was missing 90 dollars out of my account for a 30 and some change meal! 

so I gave it 24 hours it was not back in my account so as soon as I got off work I called it down to the location from the number provided to me on my receipt when I call the manager on duty was Jake up Jacob did take a good look into the situation explain to me everything that happened and when I questioned why my card was ran twice he continued to dig deeper into the situation 

I was not letting him play it off as a server error because she was amazing then  I made him dig until he came to realize that my card was swiped for my table and somebody else's table! when I notified him that the extra charge on my account cause me to go over draft he then started to become apologetic.  

I have been in the restaurant industry and management for the restaurant industry for the past 5 years and this is something manager to manager that Jacob needs to learn apologizing to your blue in the face does nothing for customers you need to compensate them for the inconvenience that you caused them and expecially in this situation with the extreme inconvenience  

I didn't get offered a coupon for next time or a lunch on Olive Garden all I got was a we reverse the charge right away it should hit your account on Monday hopefully your bank will return the overdraft fee and I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry  it's like he did not even care if I was going to ever return to his location or not  

I really do love Olive Garden and I love the convenience of the location its right next to my job it's really close to my home and it sucks that I don't want to go back because of the way I was treated because of an Issue they inconvenience me with. might go back to another location but I will probably never go back to this one"}
{"text":"Poor Service.  Long wait.  Party of 6, only 5 were served.  6th person recived there food after everybody else was finished eating.   Never again will I spend my money here or any other Olive Garden.  After all that they still had the balls to give us the bill!  This place rates 0 stars, but since this wont let me Save 0 stars I had give give them 1.  And that is being generous..."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend to this particular olive garden for lunch today. Hostess & servers did a very excellent job food what can you say normal. We both got hot sausage with peppers french fries salad and bread, you get one little piece of sausage on about a 4 inch bun cost was 6.99 not worth the money!!! Will not be back to olive garden agin food very disappointing and overpriced. Only reason getting two stars hostess and servers excellent job!!!"}
{"text":"ask for angel. I came in with only myself and a baby . She was amazing! Professional, neat , clean and organized . She was explanatory and made sure I had a very pleasurable dining experience. She should be a trainer for all servers! Wow! Just wow ."}
{"text":"In some cities (Detroit for example), Olive Garden is the place you go once a year for something really special--wearing your Sunday best.  In Charlotte, Olive Garden is the place you go when you want some fairly good italian food--wearing your shorts and t-shirt.  The Zuppa Tuscana (soup) is really good.  The alfredo sauce is pretty good too.  One thing you must try (if you are of age) is the Sangria.  Excellent."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an O.G. in a long time. I am suprised to say that things have changed for the better. If you're looking for real italian food this is not the place to go. But the foods that they are serving are great. The service was top notch. The menu change are cool. They stole that but one get one pasta deal form Maggianos which I love! You can go wrong in my opinion. Salty garlicy bread sticks and the non stop salad. Enough said.."}
{"text":"Chad is a great waiter for big parties. Excellent service  with excellent food. We'll definitely be back and look for him."}
{"text":"it's amazing the food was delicious and the service very professional my kids love the place and food the waitress is so nice she's always smiling and we had a very good experience and we plan to go back...."}
{"text":"Food was decent, not outstanding. I don't like being served our entree when we are still eating our appetizer. Our server was pleasant and attentive. However, I nearly walked out as the odor in the front lobby as I entered was not good !  The odor permeated the front entrance and continued into the ladies room. Or maybe it originated there..?  The tile flooring had obviousely been washed in the ladies room and front lobby as there were still tell tale signs of water on the floor in places.  My best guess is they used old nasty water/mops to wash the tile without any sanitzer.. 
If the odor had permeated the dining area I would have left the restaurant.  But I won't be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food has gone down hill! The chicken that I had didn't have any seasoning on the chicken and the potatoes tasted plain. I know it was really bad! They try to rush you out the door once sat down. OMG! The best thing to eat was the bread sticks."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our three small children (3yo, 5yo and 7yo) here to eat, recently because we were given a gift-certificate. We take our kids out to eat ALOT, so they are well accustomed to being on their best behavior in restaurants but, all the same, we got there for an early dinner (around 3PM) to avoid the dinner rush, so we sailed right in and were seated right away. The hostess was okay, she gave us our menus and crayons to the kids. So, we set the kids up with those and the games available on the table tablet and we proceeded to sit there for the next 20 Minutes with nothing else... we were not even offered water and had no idea who our server was. It was frustrating to watch those who had been seated after us, enjoying their drinjs, breadsticks and salad, while we sat at an empty table, looking like a bunch of fools.

I don't like to complain to people who will be touching my food, so I was just telling my husband that we should just get up and leave when I saw the hostess walk by and I made the split second decision to summon her from our black hole. The next thing you know, there is a flutter of activity around us; the female manager, 2 servers and the hostess. The manager apologized and seemed genuinely sorry. The server we were appointed was perfect and got over a 20% tip from us, by the time our meal was through. The  food was just so-so, but I don't expect fine-dining at Olive Garden... I don't expect it anywhere I take my kids, and the manager threw in free dessert for the entire table, which the kids loved, at the end. All in all, yes I would go back, but it was not my best ever experience at an OG. It was not my worst."}
{"text":"The best thing about our trip to the Olive Garden, was our very friendly and proficient server. She was fantastic! I hadn't been to this Olive Garden in quite a while, and I was surprised to find that it had been renovated. Our meal was standard Olive Garden fare. Eggplant Parmesan always seems to be a safe choice and never fails. The strawberry daiquiri I ordered was incredibly watery, though, and as you can see from the photo, someone thought it was a good idea to add very sad looking strawberry to it. At least we had a good laugh at that."}
{"text":"Valla soy el primero comentando en español solo quiero decirles que este restaurante es uno de mis favorito siempre que cumplo años es el lugar donde prefiero a comer a mi me gusta todo..."}
{"text":"So I gave it another chance during the Lunch shift. Completely different experience provided by Amanda the bartender. Excellent service and great personality. She was busy but kept all the plates in the air without missing a beat. Based on this experience I will be back! Great Job Amanda!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Our server Nathan was even better. We will definitely be back to see him ! Love this location. Food is always good. We had the soup salad and breadsticks this time, but everything we have ever ordered has always been great !"}
{"text":"Thanks Cassie for taking care of us today! My mom and I had a great lunch and you made it even better with your excelent customer service. I will denifintely come back!!"}
{"text":"Worst managed restaurant EVER!!!! Doesn't matter when you arrive there is always a wait. I would understand if a restaurrant is crowded but this happens ever time we go to this location. When you wait twenty-thirty minutes and 30% of the tables are empty that is just POOR MANAGEMENT. Busy hours rarely change, so staff yourself better instead of inconveniencing your customers. Love the food but absolutely refuse to go back to this location."}
{"text":"Second visit in a month.  Last time the chicken gnocchi soup was watered down, the wedding soup was the worst (and most unlike real wedding soup) I ever had in an Italian restaurant and the portions were either too small or the plate too big.  This time I tried the new 4 course promotion.  Salad and appetizer were delivered together and entrée was delivered less than 10 minutes later.  Hard choice to eat the salad and then a cold appetizer and entrée or eat hot food first and salad afterward.  The lady at the next table got a piece o paper in her pasta.  The chef explained that the fresh pasta is laid on parchment paper and when they cut it they must have got a piece stuck to it (and it didn't come off in the boiling water??)   WHAT REALLY GOT ME THOUGH, at the bottom of my receipt it says Thanks for visiting us today in English and then in SPANISH!!!!.  What the heck, this is an Italian restaurant....your menu isn't in Spanish why are you thanking me in Spanish.  When I go to a Chinese restaurant they don't thank me in German or Polish.   Pay more attention to your Italian food! I hope none of my friends give me any more gift cards for Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I can't explain how horiable my experience was at this place. I called a head of time and asked if there was a wait and they said no. While on the phone getting that answer I asked about some menu items and the lady I spoke with had a rude tone and attitude. I though maybe it was just her . When i got their half hour after that call not only was their a twenty minute wait and a line of people out the door but all the staff were extremely rude . We finally got to the table and too make everything worse we got a waiter who didn't speak much English. We only saw him to take our order. A new lady brought out our food. The food sucked and so did the service . No one came to say bye or full water or ask how food was. Worst experience at a restaurant ever!!"}
{"text":"It has been a couple of years since I have eaten at this location. The one North of Phoenix is much better. I adore the Soup, Salad and Bread sticks for lunch but the last couple of times I ate at the Cactus location the bread lacked garlic and was only a salt fest. I stopped eating here when they made people wait to be seated, with the restaurant only half empty at 4:45 PM. I eat out with some older individuals and this restaurant consistently made us wait when most of their seats were empty.  I have tried the spaghetti and lasagna a few times but can make better ones rather easily. Fortunately they have added back the \"grilled sausage and peppers rustica dish\" as it is much better than most of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch on 5/5. Always had great food here In the the past. But this time the salad was not good. Appeared to have been partially frozen and then thawed. Very mushy. Soup was good but deep fried asparagus was stuck together in a  block. Server was excellent."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in my life! This was my first time at Olive Garden and is definitely going to be my last! Our waitress Vanessa was the rudest nastiest fucking bitch ever and because of her I will never be back! Learn some fucking manners and lose the attitude you entitled bitch. If you're gonna have a fucking attitude the whole night then don't fucking work here. This bitch told me to calm down, bitch fuck you! 0 stars cause of you fat bitch"}
{"text":"i love pasta sooo perfect place for me. buy one, take one work so good for us.."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden and it's in Surprise, so it's always busy. I've always had decent service and good tasting food. If I have my choice, I'm always going to choose a less chain place, but it's not bad in a pinch."}
{"text":"We've been eating at Olive Gardens for years. We've eaten at this particular Olive Garden in Madison many, many times. It has usually been very good: a relaxing meal, served well, the food pretty consistently good.....UNTIL!! We were there yesterday after dropping our kid off at UW and moving all the stuff into the dinky student apartment. We were tired and somewhat sad and looking forward to a nice dinner. It didn't start well. Our waiter was a strangely aloof, indifferent guy who seemed to deign to wait on us when he had a moment. Plus, horror of horrors, there are now those little 'ziosk' thingies on each table, just like in a sports bar. We hate those things and so moved it to face the wall. However, when Aloof Guy came to take our order for an appetizer, he pointedly reached across me to get the apparatus and clicked in our app order. In other places where they have these dumb things, using them is optional. Salad and breadsticks came as usual. For my entree I ordered fish and shrimp in 'light wine sauce'. Our entrees came very quickly, we were not done with salads yet, but Aloof Guy didn't care. He just crowded the plates onto the table while we scrambled to make room. When I saw my fish I was immediately wary. The sauce looked like something you'd find at a cheap hotel buffet or a highschool cafeteria. I tasted it, and yup, tasted just like it looked. Very, very salty and with a strange, sourish taste to it. Plus the 'seasoned' broccoli was dry, practically raw and inedible. I politely and apologetically told Aloof Guy that I couldn't eat it and asked for the portobella ravioli, which I've had numerous times before. It's very rich, which is why I didn't order it in the first place. AG said he'd inform the manager and put in my order and then left, leaving the unappetizing plate of fish in yuck sauce in front of me. It took quite a while for him to realize that he'd left it there. Finally he came and got it and finally removed the empty plates from the appetizer and salads. The manager came by and asked about the problem with the fish. When I explained, she as much as told me I was mistaken, as that was her 'favorite'. She just loved that salty sauce! The ravioli finally came and - ah well - not in the sauce they sauce they usually were in - this was thin and broken ( showing the fat separated out). By this time I had given up. I'm assuming that this was just a bad day for the cook, but the aloof and uncaring waiter was a bit much. Also, when we were ready to pay, sure enough, he grabbed the ziosk thing again. I said, are you going to make us use that to pay? and he just firmly said, yes ma'am and left. It was a pain to figure out. So much for the relaxing dinner after a trying day. I guess we'll skip Olive Garden next time!"}
{"text":"I had a business lunch yesterday and it was meh. Our server and other staff members would say \"no problem\" every time someone at my table said thank you. Well gee, I hope I'm not a problem. Try \"my pleasure\" not no problem. I was barely 2 minutes into eating my soup when the main dish was delivered. So I'm watching my lunch go cold. Also, when the server would come by, he never removed ONE dish off the table. We sat talking for several minutes after eating with every dish (including our finished appetizer) on the table. Finally, I used the washroom and both towel dispensers were empty. Yea, now I get use toilet tissue which stuck to my hands. The only reason I didn't give a 1 star is because we made a special request which was accommodated."}
{"text":"Just had another tasty lunch at my local Olive Garden.  I have been a fan for what, maybe 30 or 40 years now, since I used to live in California.  My waitress, Jackie, was as friendly and as fast as you will ever get.  I usually get the soup, salad, and breadsticks lunch, since it is filling and tasty.  The soup was great, the salad was great, and the breadsticks were hot and tasty.  All in all, a perfect lunch.  Look for Jackie and you will be in and out quickly, so you can enjoy your day, with a nice full tummy.  Will go again soon.  Five stars!  =D"}
{"text":"I have been to this OG location a few times and it was always good but today I was impressed! Our server Taylor was fast, polite, and just pleasant! She kept the food and drinks coming and had them coming FAST!! She offered us a delicious wine sample and we were convinced to buy a whole bottle. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious! We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"It irritates me that we have to wait 1 1/2 hours every time we come here. They don't take reservations on weekends, not even for large parties (we had 8). So their solution every time is to make you wait 1 1/2 hours. The restaurant wasn't that busy about 1/2 full. I literally watched people walk in and walk out. The food is delicious, I can't say anything bad about the food!!! My favorite is the chicken scampi. Yummy! I have never been disappointed with the food. I would give it more stars except for the wait. We will come back, I just wish they would have a better strategy for larger groups."}
{"text":"First off. let me say that I love everything about Olive Garden, great food and staff and atmosphere, nope not this time. I went with siblings and my aunt here on Sunday night. We were seated the minute we had walked in the restaurant. First off our server seemed like she had not wanted to be there and was very flustered, I don't know why seeing as they weren't extremely busy. Whenever they had brought out our salad and bread sticks the salad was fine, but the bread sticks were very tough, like they were stale. I had ordered the Chicken & Gnocchi Soup, what I always get. It all tasted fine except the Gnocchi had a gummy aftertaste. I had ordered the Seafood Alfredo and my aunt had ordered the regular Alfredo because she's a vegetarian. Her Alfredo had basically no Alfredo Sauce! It was dry and she asked for a side of more sauce. My Seafood Alfredo had a very weird flavor and it had a very strong fish taste, because of the scallops, which I ignored. But, almost every scallop tasted sandy, like they weren't cleaned well. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the dessert, and it was amazing. We had all split the Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake and it was divine. All in all a good place, just had a bad experience for once. But, if service continues like this I won't be a customer here for much longer."}
{"text":"Great service. We had 35 people for dinner.  B othe food servers went out of their way to to make our event memorable."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, staff is very kind. Door was held open as we entered, kind greeting, short wait for a Wednesday night, good service, and great food."}
{"text":"As always Olive Garden is a nice place for a good meal. What they call \"salad\" is a delicious starter for the main court. This time I tried out the Chicken Picatta with zucchini. Perfect. Now you can pay direct using their tablets on the desk (cards only). The only negative point is that the loyalty program is only for a US residents."}
{"text":"Since the change in general managers both the food quality and service at this restaurant has really went down. Yesterday my wife and I went there for lunch, almost empty parking lot, three couples waiting to be seated.   Hostess took our name and had us take a seat. Five minutes later, one couple has been seated when a coworker came up to the hostess and complained about customers  wanting their chairs moved around or wanting to bei seated at different table. We've been coming to this restaurant since it first opened. It will be a long time before we try it again.  There are too many restaurants around who's food quality is still good and the staff is courteous and not just standing around."}
{"text":"Been to Olive Gardens a ton of times and have to say this location is definately one of the better ones I have been too.  Don't expect a home made Italian dinner as this is a chain restaurant but it's still good nontheless.  Our server was awesome.  Very fast, attentive, and actually took a second to joke around with us which is always pretty cool.  Food came out fresh and correct.  You can't expect much more than that."}
{"text":"When I want something light, tasty, healthy and with good surrounding and friendly services, I come here and get their unlimited Salad.  I have tried their other things, but this is the only one that stands out."}
{"text":"Nothing like writing a review at 11:30 on a Friday night after about 6 beers! Or, wait... does that make me a loser? I'm kind of worried that it might. 

Anyway, it's too late to get a date, so.. on with the review. Soup - ok. Salad - meh.  $8.95 for both? Overpriced. Watching the carbs, so didn't eat anything that I normally would have. Unfortunately, I checked the nutrition info before we went, so don't know if I ever will again.  It's like pouring some marinara over a salt lick and serving it to me on a plate. Blech.

 Honestly, this place never held the special plate in my heart that it does for some people I know, even when it was one of two Italian restaurants in the small Illinois town I was raised.  But why are you reading this? You've been there already and have your own opinion.  Just don't read the nutritional info before you go."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I was craving Olive Garden and decided to stop in for dinner. I'm  only giving this place 5 stars due to our server Juan. Juan was real nice and gave us great service. I was surprised to receive such top notch service from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"It's Olive garden. We just go there for a quick bite that's better than normal fast food. Nothing outstanding but it'll do."}
{"text":"So depressing!! I love Olive Garden!! But tonight it totally sucked! We ordered 2 fettuccini Alfredo's with extra bread ad extra sauce. Well first off we were charged our extra bread but never received them. But the bread we did get was so hard, like it was old or something. And now the depressing part! Ugh! The only reason we eat Olive Garden is for the Alfredo, but tonight we just ended up throwing all of it out! There was so much like oil in the Alfredo or something, it was totally weird! I tired to drain it out but you could just taste like grease! It was sick! Sucks it was a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Waiter was extremely rude. Reminded me of a grumpy David Spade. Ordered the shrimp scampi and for A $17.00 dish, I could not believe the size!! My 3 year old niece could have eaten that plus 2 more plates. Needless to say I left there hungry. My husband's chicken Alfredo looked like it was a day old when it came out. Terrible service and food."}
{"text":"When you go to the Olive Garden, you should not expect to have an experience on par with a gourmet restaurant. It is a high volume decent restaurant. The food at OG is just fine, but obviously not made from scratch. So, the people who complain about this should really get real. What really makes or breaks the dining experience is the server. Being a server is a hard job! I cannot imagine the stress at this particular restaurant. I hear the other patrons around me. Some seem as if they have never been out in the world before. In the face of these wacky customers and the hyper pace, there are some truly fantastic servers there. I want to tell you that Rome is one of the best servers I have ever experienced in my life. What a genuinely nice person. So professional. He would be wonderful at the most high end establishment. I am sure he will go far in life. For now, this Olive Garden is extremely lucky to be represented by him. I hope he sees this and knows how much he was appreciated by my party last week. He made it a stellar experience. Thank-you, Rome! Take notice Olive Garden. This is the type of staff you should strive for."}
{"text":"Ordered two lunch entrees with salad and bread sticks.
Never got a salad refill. One of two, sandwiches was not what we ordered. Waited and waited for right one. When we got it it was nasty and thrown together.
Then the bill was 55.00 for two entrees at 6.95 each. 
The server was never available..... Never!
Then we got the right bill and it had a drink we didn't order. Now they can't give us our money back. Instead we got a gift card....
Asked about the manager and was told he left. Today was his last day.
I look  behind me. There is the manager. He made it right.
Omg people you can make so much money waiting tables.... If your not ignorant"}
{"text":"What can I say? I'm a sucker for chain restaurants sometimes. I can't help but have a craving for those warm breadsticks. I'll have to be a little picky though because recently they haven't been to generous with the breaksticks. 

Yes, Scott Pilgrim, bread does indeed make you fat but that's why I don't eat at the OG everyday. So when I want breadsticks, I want a full basket please. 

Usually, I order the Chicken con Brocolli. However, I was really in the mood for just a bowl of pasta. The lingiuini sounded good but I wanted a different sauce. AHA! My mom always orders the Penne with cheese baked on top. They add bread crumbs for the perfect crunchy topping. My mom purposely leaves half to take to work the next day but sometimes I can't help but steal a bite or two.

I did not regret my decision. Paired with an iced cold Bellini Peach Tea, I was in OG heaven.  :)"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic medallion with Fettuccini. Paired with the signature salad and bread sticks. I choose the peach margarita. I love peach! After ...the pumpkin cheesecake! Seasonal and delicious!  My waiter Taylor ; was exceptional! Made my visit twice as good!! Tipped to much.(?) But what can I say? Excellent is excellent. 13.00 on a 32.00 check. I like what I like. M"}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden! It was so awesome to go and eat there, because I just love the food there. The only think that I didn't like about this Olive Garden was the service. We were put into a dark little corner (which could be romantic I guess) but I think that is a place where the waiter forgets about you a lot. It took a rather long time to get the food, because while I was waiting I must have ate all my bread and salad I was full by the time my entree came.  I loved the food, but I think the price for their wines is overrated."}
{"text":"This place's customer service/treatment of VETERANS IS ATROCIOUS!!!!! I WILL REPORT THIS HORRIBLE UNFAIR TREATMENT AND POSSIBLE RACIAL PROFILING TO MY LOCAL VFW AND VA COMMUNITY!!! MANAGER CHRISTINA SHOULD BE FIRED OR WRITTEN UP FOR THIS.

I patiently waitied over 45 minutes outside, three times the wait time I was told, and witnessed 1 hostess come physically outside to address another woman waiting but never called us.

When I approached the front desk the hostess that I spoke with told me they called me 15 minutes ago, gave me a \"hmph\" and turned her nosed to me and continued on. I asked to be seated and was disrespectfully declined. This is incorrigible!!!!!"}
{"text":"After flying in from Chicago Ohare on our way back to Fort Mohave Arizona, we decided to stop at Olive Garden for dinner. I had the Chicken Parm and Joe had the Stuffed Chicken Marsala. Both were excellent aa well as the salad and breadsticks. Jeremy M. Was an excellent server and got us anything we needed."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!! Missing my boyfriend tho! Good to get out and spend time with my brother at a good place!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for a double date and had a great time! When we arrived the parking lot looked pretty busy so I was a little nervous about the wait but to my delight when I walked in and told them how many was in my party we were seated right away!! Our waiter (Brant I believe) was very attentive and polite.  I had a few questions which he didn't mind answering at all and helped me pick out a very tasty wine to go with my chicken and shrimp carbonara. Overall we had an amazing time and will definitely be coming back to this location!!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been in here, and today, the best part of my dining, was our waitress named shay! If you dine here, ask for her! Not only was she prompt, efficient, but friendly to us and the children. She is by far one of the best servers I have had anywhere in a long time. I even went as far to ask what days she works, so I could have her again. I don't know where they found her, but olive garden has a gem on their hands. We dined for over an hour, bcus we felt right at home and she was very knowledgeable about their wines and specials. She never made us feel like we were in a rush to leave. My five stars go to her! Thank you Shay for your amazing customer service! :)"}
{"text":"Splendid Olive Garden! Overall, Great restaurant, nice and great. The food sometimes isn't good though. Sometimes they mess up and the food isn't what I expect it to be. I have been to the one at Desert Sky Mall near 75th Ave and Thomas Rd and the newly relocated Metro Center location at I-17 and Peoria Ave, plus a location in San Diego.  I usually sit near the Emergency Exit. When the Red Lobster closed because it's company Darden sold the land, I was surprised this didn't close. Overall, Excellent location. If I were to give it a grade, I'd give it a A+, 100%."}
{"text":"I know. It's a chain restaurant. But after a busy day of business meetings, our party of four wanted something filling but fast (and moderately priced)  since we all had to either return to the airport or go to the next meeting. The service was very southern--meaning welcoming, friendly and pleasant. My Minestrone Soup was filling and the Venetian Apricot Chicken was tasty without leaving that all-too--greasy feeling of a burger & fries before a heading on a four hour flight."}
{"text":"Because I work so close to Olive Garden I stop in often ordering a ToGo meal. They are always on time with my meals, never have to wait more then 10 minutes. Staff is always super nice and friendly!!! My food is always hot and ready to go!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service !  Waiter always making excuses,  food not as good as in past!"}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden and always have. The atmosphere and the food. But recently I had about the worst experience here. Ever. My friend and I had visited this location planning on splitting a nice meal, considering neither of us have that big of stomachs. After requesting the Tour Of Italy but split, the waitress then left us a bit confused as she explained that since it was only one meal that she could only bring out one plate to eat our salad on. We really had no idea how to react so we let it pass since we were hungry. My friend's plate was brought out with the salad and I shared it with her but I was forced to use my smaller breadstick plate that was already there. The food came out and we continued eating only for our meal to be disrupted once again. We were taken aback by our waitress when we asked for another bowl of salad. (Our first bowl was barely filled.) The waitress actually hesitated to accept our request for another bowl of salad but instead explained that she was first, distressed that I was using a plate and sharing the salad (???) and second that she was only going to bring out one more bowl of salad but no more after that. I also feel bad for pointing fingers but this server's name was Eddalena B. Maybe after this review she will be corrected on how to serve at a restaurant like Olive Garden. We will continue to find another in-range Olive Garden since we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Loved some of the food thought the entrée was a little blan. They over charged me. But they got me back with some food and money. All in all it was OK."}
{"text":"It's hardly fine dining, but my wife adores the Chicken Marsala here, so we frequent it a few times a year when the urge strikes her. They make a good alfredo sauce (try it on their cheese ravs) but they're always so stingy with it. Ask for extra."}
{"text":"Wow! Really disappointed!  Thank god for terrific breadsticks and salad, or this rating would be negative stars. Experience was terrible, from the rude hostess TEAM, one of which was changing her clothes in the lobby while those of us waiting had to watch, to the indifferent, almost effecient wait staff.  Better be careful Olive Garden. Customer service is still important!!!"}
{"text":"Decent Olive Garden, not the best we have been to. Waitress got the husbands order wrong and didn't ask if we wanted anything extra (like more breadsticks, salad, or soup). Food was par for the course. I felt like the portion of the shrimp scampi appetizer was smaller than I've ever had. It was served in the mini appetizer plate, but was still 8.79. Husband got chicken fettuccine Alfredo, wasn't the best he's had from Olive Garden either. There were only 2 gnocchis in my chicken and gnocchi soup. We had to remind the waitress that my husband was getting dessert."}
{"text":"Ordered trout and gave me white fish . Good appetizer , salad and breadsticks as usual . Good service . I wish I got real trout ."}
{"text":"My girlfriends phone was stolen by an employee yesterday afternoon.  She was eating with a friend, and had our two kids with her, and her friend had her child with her as well.  She never left the table, merely sat her phone down next to her at the table.  The only person who came up to their table at all was their server, and another employee, named mike, who visited the table and commented on the kids and was showing them something.  He moved some stuff around on the table.   When my girlfriend looked back down, her phone was gone.  They searched their bags, the floor, everywhere and it was nowhere.  The person who took it began ignoring the calls.  Mike, the person suspected of taking it, suggested that they text it and offer a 100 dollar reward to have it returned (not sketchy at all, right)?  He then left from his shift and within minutes of him leaving the phone was turned off and no longer ringing.  My girlfriend tried contacting the district manager, who did not help, because he cannot prove it, and there are no cameras.  They were given the employee (mike)s name by other employees, and searched data bases for him to match his mugshots with a criminal record with multiple charges including armed robbery.  The DM Insisted that they perform background checks and does not seem at all willing to look further into this. 

Don't go eat here unless you want to literally have to keep an eye on everything at your table for every second so it doesn't get stolen by an employee who skipped a background check."}
{"text":"Excellent value all around, with the most friendly & professional staff in town! All other Olive Gardens should emulate this restaurant."}
{"text":"While dining at this Olive Garden, a table next to us decided to change their baby's dirty diaper in the booth right across from us. In the middle of eating our lunch (for my birthday no less) I had to sit and watch someone change a dirty diaper and then proceed to smell it. We asked to speak to the manager and we watched our server go up to him, talk to him and he never stopped to talk to us. He even walked by our table, looked at us, then walked by the table that was complaining about their meal and did nothing. Another manager was at that table and was clearly struggling with the tables several other concerns, but chose not to help. The manager who was supposed to come to our table and instead just walked by was named Shane."}
{"text":"Olive Garden to me is just overpriced,and it is not so great...they don't have much to offer really...it is just average food. I am totally a fan of their house salad though. The dressing is amazing, there is no other house dressing like it!"}
{"text":"I love the Olive Garden because the service here is fantastic and the food is so good that I may come back here to eat. Love this place."}
{"text":"I come here alot and the food is pretty good. the price is fair. I get mints when I pay. My serevers name was denim (like the pants) and he was super friendly.  From time to time there is a small problem depending on where you go but I love this one."}
{"text":"Me and my family had dinner here. our waitress Sara was so unprofessional she did not write down our orders which cause her not to remember what we order instead of take our order right for the second time she stood at our table and told us all her personal business and issue she and then we over heard her at another table tell the girls there how she had quit her other job and wanted to get them shut down needless to say we got our food to go and she brought the check and we paid she proceeded to walk away then she turns around and say hey I think you for got to give me a tip at that moment I was mad so I asked for the manager she refused to get them this lady really need to be fired she was so unprofessional me or my family will not come back to this place we had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Our waitress Melissa was personable professional and awesome food was cooked a specifications all the staff was courteous wonderful time would come here again and recommend it to my friends"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but this location always delivers a stellar experience, and tonight was no exception.  The food is always great, but it's the service that keeps me coming back. My wife and I visited this evening and Brian was our server.  He was prompt and friendly and always there right when you needed him.  I had the braised beef and tortelloni and my wife had the cheese ravioli with cheese and more cheese :-) We both left impressed with our meal and the service.  It's hard to find consistency in both departments these days but this is our go to from now on."}
{"text":"I had flown in from NY that day and by 2:00pm I was starving.  I was staying in a hotel a block away and decided this was the closest restaurant to just walk to, get in, eat, and get out.  The parking lot was jammed with cars so I wasn't expecting great service.  I was proven wrong.  Service was exceptional and the food was to die for.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Absolute Best real Italian Food in the valley! They use only old world recipes as taught by the old masters in Italy. My favorite dish is the Toscano Soup. The Veal Parmagian is incredible. Try it You'll like it."}
{"text":"For many years, my family is a big fan of Olive-garden food, no matter what my review is my kids will take me there as they love OG soup and bread-sticks. :-) 

I love OG soup, bread sticks, Chicken alfredo, Chicken scampi, shrimp scampi etc.  I ended up ordering chichen/shrimp scampi most of the times.

I come here at-least once a month,  had been in many places before moving to charlotte... so i tried different locations as well.  When compare my experience with other locations, this is 'OK', but others are 'better'. 

I like my food prepared with extra sauce and requested when ordering few times, but never happened.  However, when i requested additional sauce, they provided separately.  So i am OK with that.  Service was always very good, every waiter is very friendly and talks very nice and attentive.

Here is my rating...
Food - 3 out of 5
Service - 5 out of 5
Location - 4 out of 5

I have been visiting this place for a while, will return again, just a matter of another month :-)"}
{"text":"I am in the middle on this place. The thing is, everytime I visit this location, its either great or it's just horrible.  There isn't anything consistent!

During my last visit, we enjoyed some entrees from their \"lighter fare menu\" which actually turned out to be pretty good.  Everything arrived hot and cooked perfectly and the salad was fresh.  Our waitress was excellent and even gave us a ton of to-go breadsticks and drinks.  She and two other staff were very attentive without seeming overbearing.

Now to the dinner before this.  We were seated in the bar section in a small, rounded corner booth under a high wattage spotlight.  A vent was directed right onto our table and would blow hot and cold at various times, with cold being the predominant temperature.  All we heard all night was the clinking of glasses and motor grinding of the drink blenders.  This echoed throughout the room combined with the voices of 3 wait staff and the bartender, who would not stop reliving their drunken weekend with each other.  This made for an overall unpleasant experience with our young, awkward waitress who, by the way, didn't even know what kind of wine she was offering to customers to taste.

Now, another previous visit, I will note that we have never had an issue while enjoying our NeverEnding Pasta bowls.  They need to bring this back!

I could go on, but the point is, you never know what you're going to get at this place.  Its in a central location for my friends, so its nice to go, but I'm starting to realize my money would be better spent at Carraba's."}
{"text":"The food at Olive Garden is always so amazing! Our Server Stan Lee Farley provided excellent customer service. He was very attentive and recommended a great appetizer. I will definitely be visiting Olive Garden again!"}
{"text":"This was the worst dinner my husband n I have ever had. Awful! We will NEVER be back! The bartender John wasn't on his game at all!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and so was the service! My family and I just left from having dinner here. Immediately when we walked in, we were greeted by several workers and had the door held open for us. Our waitress, Karina, was excellent and went above and beyond to make sure we were all satisfied. Even if the food wasn't good (which it definitely wasn't, it was delicious), I would come back for her promptness and attentiveness. 100% would go back and recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden was pretty good. The server was nice, and checked up on us quite often. Overall, I spent $15 on custom pasta, a soda, soup, and bread. The food was good, but $15 is a bit much."}
{"text":"Admittedly, we are fans of Olive Garden because of the good and plentiful food for the reasonable cost.  This location is no different....everything was great.  However, we wanted to mention the server, Kathryn, who was simply outstanding!  She pointed out the new duo meals, which are delicious and inexpensive...checked in with us frequently, but not too much...and was very polite and attentive to my elderly father, who is hard of hearing, and will talk the ear off anyone who listens.  She was very patient with him and all in all, was one of the best servers we've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service. Server Brian was extremely polite, attentive and helpful. Good was great, there was just so much! Would definitely recommend to someone looking to have a quick dinner but something nicer than fast food"}
{"text":"The food was so fresh and hot, it was so yummy. I order a margarita while waiting for the food at the bar and wasn't able to take it in a togo cup before leaving. I tried to finish it but it was too much so I had to leave it behind. But other than that the service was great."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday this weekend and decided to have dinner at Olive Garden. We had a large group (17 people) to include a handful of children. I was very happy with the small wait time (10 mins max) and the 2 servers Toni and Jacob were amazing!!!! They were pleasant and very attentive especially given the size of our group. After we ordered the food was right out and the happy birthday singing was hilarious! Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"OG has gone down! The service from our server Margaret was perfection. Great personality and too much personal info About her life but she was sweet. The food was unbearable! Calamari seemed uncooked and chewy. The chicken from the chicken Alfredo and chicken parmesan was mushy. Similar to frozen chicken that is thawed while cooking in a microwave. Salad had chunks of iceberg lettuce which is the poorest of the lettuce family. The sample of wine was delicious and the breadsticks were great.  Sorry Olive Garden (OG) but another one bites the dust. No longer on my list of restaurants to frequent. 

Andi"}
{"text":"the server was awesome!!!Gave 18% tip, I would've gave him more except, Im a baller on a budget lol! Matt was awesome! Will go again just because of him. Except it was an hour and a half wait."}
{"text":"The food was very yummy! I normally do not like Italian cuisine, however I enjoyed my dinner. I went with the Stuffed Chicken Marsala & my husband went with the Steak Gorgonzola Alfredo. Both were very tasty. I liked the  sauce on my husbands meal  The service was nice. It started off a little rough with our waitress (at least I thought so) however it didn't end that way. It ended with great conversation between our waitress and us. Overall I enjoyed my visit and would come again since the menu was totally revamped since I visited 4-5 years ago."}
{"text":"Love this place. My family and I have been here a couple times and were fascinated every time. Their salads are amazing and have some great pasta as well. Defiantly will be back."}
{"text":"Went there last night got food poisoning from their chicken Marsala. Had to go to the ER cause I got so sick!! They ran test and it was confirmed it was from the food! So I called in and their shitty manager just says sorry no one else called wish u luck! Are you FN kidding! I paid for shitty service got sick and an ER visit cause you don't know how to prep food!! I wish I didn't have to give u one star and the manager needs to get fired!!"}
{"text":"One word - Meh. 
The server took a long time to even greet us and offer drinks. -1 star
 We had our 2 yr old son with us and his food came out first which was nice. +1 star
The portions were huge. +1 star
But the food lacked seasoning and taste. It was all pretty bland. -2 stars
Server didn't offer refills which my husband hates. -1 star
Server was very quiet and was hard to even hear what he was saying. Had a bored look on his face. We sat for a looooooong time for our bill. -1

Wow! -1 star AGAIN had to come edit this as the server gave a bill to another table and the customer commented on the slow service and the server didnt acknowledge him and was super rude then slammed his bill book at the till stand. Wowewww

All in all I would rather cook pasta at home and save my money."}
{"text":"Eat here a couple times a month. This trip was disappointing. Hope things are better next trip."}
{"text":"With a call a few hours before arriving, our very large party of 22 people were seated after a wait of only about 30 minutes. While waiting were sat in the bar area where the customer service was great. 
The staff set up a line of tables so that all of could sit together, which was fantastic. We had 2 servers-James and Damien who were awesome and very patient. They were personable, chatted with us, and provided great customer service. 
James even offered to take a picture of all of us. 
The food was great and customer service even better!!"}
{"text":"Monday, President's Day.  We were'nt expecting the crowds after 1pm, and neither did the staff.  However, they handled it beautifully.  Management checking on guests after their meals, staff buzzing all over.  We were a table of 4 older folks.  Ashely our waitress was excellent!!!!  She caught the kitchen's mistake of chicken meatballs instead of beef meatballs and quickly offered options.  No, don't take the whole bowl back, just more meatballs please.  It was a great meal with great friends, and exceptional service all around.  The $5 coupon the icing on the cake (but no room after lunch)."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is spectacular! The was was very clean inside and I felt the employees really wanted to help me. Definitely will be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times I was hesitant about my order and pleasantly surprised by its delivery. 

The food is always good, the waitresses are always attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere is pleasant. 

It is a great local restaurant, perfect for just about every occasion, including no occasion at all."}
{"text":"To start Olive Garden is one of my favorite places to eat when I feel like splurging on a restaurant meal, normally I'll stick to the location near Metro Center, but this particular time I took my younger brother out to eat who lives near the Arrowhead one. 

We visited on a Thursday afternoon. Started out by being seated and having to waive down a passing waitress to ask who will be waiting on us, after near 10 minutes of waiting, she was very pleasant and apologized( though she did nothing wrong) and informed us she would get our waitress. 

Once our waitress arrived she took our drink order and brought back two completely different drinks than what we ordered. Followed by us being given the wrong appetizer, politely said that it was not ours and she rolled her eyes as she took it off the table. We waited an additional 10 minutes for the correct appetizer to be given, never once having the waitress come to take our actual order. 
Once again, after now being in the building for 45 minutes I had to flag down another waitress to ask for our order to be taken. Our waitress then came back to us and placed two orders of breadsticks down on the table, as my brother went to reach for one she stated \"oh those aren't for you, they're for another table\" took BOTH orders of breadsticks off the table and left. 
At this point I was furious and asked another passing waitress(who happened to be the original waitress I flagged down) if I could please have the check. Never saw the waitress who was supposed to be waiting on us again. 
Long story short, I'll be sticking to the Metro location no matter how far I have to drive!"}
{"text":"What can I say. They have reached a new low.

My wife and I use to go to the Olive Garden every couple of months, for years. The food was always what you would expect and was very consistant ,on the mediocer side ,at best.

When we arrived it was an 1 hour wait, which is normal at 6pm on a saturday. no problem, we wait for our table for six.I noticed other large groups that came in after we did getting in before us. I do a quick recon of the hostesses clipboard and sure enough, no less than 5 partys of 6-8 ppl got in ahead of us. Sorry they say....it will be just another 5 minutes.

We ordered drinks and they did'nt have the advertized special. Mint lime fresco something. No problem, it must have been so good they sold out. We did get the breadsticks( cold and way undercooked)
The food ,when it arrived,was obviously sitting under the heat lamp for waaay to long. Everything was dry dry dry.
Our friends young son order pepperoni pizza. It came with no pepperoni .
Dessert time.  Hmmmm what to have? Nothing of course because its still all frozen!!  ( insert apology here)......ha ha ha , NOT!

They normally do better. 
This time , however, they completly failed on so many levels I was embarassed for them."}
{"text":"Food is always good; management needs to learn how to interact with people. During our last visit, we witnessed on several occasions the manager 'Carlos' verbally humiliate several waitresses and hostesses. He would go out of his way to belittle staff in the crowded dining room, and when he wasn't doing this he walked around with a scowl on his face. Aside from 'Carlos' being a complete jerk, the evening was fine. Food was outstanding; servers are very good, despite being busy. We will return again, as long as 'Carlos' is not the evening's manager. I have filed a complaint with Olive Gardens head office in regards to his behavior that night."}
{"text":"I cooked there for three years, and I was amazed at how many of the ingredients were imported from Italy.
The two biggest problems with the Olive Garden are:
1) it was never intended to be true Italian cuisine-true Italian cuisine is a lot less tomato-based sauces and a lot less beef- more white sauces, seafood etc.
It's like Chinese food in America-it's not true Chinese cuisine, it's Chinese-American cuisine. Example: Chow mein doesn't exist in China 
This is Italian-American cuisine. Example: pepperoni doesn't exist in Italy.
2) The recipes have to be so simplified so almost anyone can make them.
Having said these things (and I've spent time in Southern Italy & Sicily) the end result is pretty decent. I was never ashamed of the hundreds of meals I cooked, even though they were sometimes less than completely authentic."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a higher rating. But the only concern of mine is the hostess that we had a this location was absolutely horrid!! She for got what we ordered as she did not write down what we ordered at all. Brought us water but once again forgot that we ordered (2 sodas). She was a young blond haired girl, I believe her name was Amanda as she told us that about 10 times. 
She seemed nervous as she looked like she did not know what she was doing. I do believe you should get someone undercover in this job. Especially on this waitress she is incapable of this job and should be doing the dishes and not hosting."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!!! My family and I had dinner today at this location and we had Darryl C. for our server, he was amazing! We eat at this location very often and this was the best service we have ever had there.  Thank you Darryl for the great dinner service."}
{"text":"Courtney was nice to me and my auntie and she is really pretty. Thank you courtney ~makayla"}
{"text":"Poor service.  After a long wait, the waiter brought out all our food at once, with the exception of the appetizer and water.  We got our water AFTER asking about it and the appetizer.  We were told the appetizer should be out soon!  The bread sticks were cold and dry.  The soup was only warm, not hot.  As we left, the hostess never noticed, not even the usual thank you or have a good afternoon....they were too busy talking to each other to notice I guess."}
{"text":"I could eat their breadsticks and unlimited salad all day, the entrees are ok, I like the Alfredo."}
{"text":"We have been to this Olive Garden several times and generally the food and service have been good.  Last night, however, was a different story.  The Chicken Alfredo was not creamy, but rather an oily mess and the Shrimp Primavera was so spicy that my husband could not finish it.  The server was OK, but seemed to be rushing us.  We still had about half our appetizers on our plates when she came by and said she would take the plates away forcing me to ask for a few extra minutes.  Then, instead of waiting for us to ask for our check, she just dropped it on the table when it was convenient for her.  We were with my son and his girlfriend and wanted to enjoy our time together, not be rushed ."}
{"text":"My Hubby and I went to the Olive Garden for a treat.  I love this place!

We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table on a Sunday early evening.  Usually the waits here are long on the weekends and they don't take reservations during those times.  

Once seated our server came promptly and took our drink order.  I find the staff here usually are friendly and have a fun attitude.  I had gotten a glass of wine, their glasses go for around $6 or $7.  You get free refills on their pop and iced tea.  We got our drinks quickly and he took our food order.  My Husband got the tour of Italy and I got the chicken con broccoli, but with whole wheat linguine instead of the normal pasta.  It was no problem for me to substitute.  

We were brought our garden salad and bread sticks while we waited.  I always binge on their bread sticks, which is silly because then I don't have much room left for my pasta.  But they are so good, I'm pretty sure they coat them in some addictive substance or something.  Needless to say we enjoyed them thoroughly and got a couple refills.  

Our food was really good.  I could tell the chicken in mine was frozen, it didn't have much flavour.  The broccoli was a bit crunchy, but I didn't mind.  My Hubby had no problem stuffing his face with his massive platter of food.

When we got our bill, I asked the server if I could have extra chocolate mints that they give you.  He came back with a whole big handful!  So that made me happy!  This place isn't super cheap, you are looking at $13 to $16 a pasta, but the portions are big.

I like this place, we had a good experience and our food was pretty good.  If you haven't been here it is a must go, at least for the bread sticks and mints!"}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite restaurant. Our last couple of visits we had a server by the name of Maria. We LOVE us some Maria. She is an excellent server and so sweet she will rot your teeth right out of your head. She treats her customers like her children, and her kids are spoiled. Oh yeah, and the food is good too."}
{"text":"Service was kind of eh, but the food was good. Our server's name was Kim. I don't know if she was having a bad day or what,  but she just did not seem like she was a people person.  She was not a terrible server, but it was nothing to brag about. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Second time eating at this location. The first time--maybe the cook is having a bad day. Second time-ah, sh!tty cook again?  Maybe the third time will be a charm? 

Cant go wrong with the salad--yummers!  Love the frozen Bellinis!!"}
{"text":"What has happened to good waiter service? When I get better table service at a fast food restaurant like In n' Out than at Olive Garden it makes me want to stop going. To avoid the terrible service we've started using their order online and pickup service on late work days because we can pick it up on the way home. The takeout service is packaged nicely and you get a good sized salad for each entrée ordered. My husband and I usually each eat half our meal and save the second half for lunch the next day. The salads are large enough that we can usually split one for 2 people and save the second one to eat with our left overs the next day. If you want to eat at the restaurant, eat in the bar! You usually don't expect great food service in the bar because the main focus is the bar, not food, but this place is the exception. If it's not too crowded, eat in the bar!"}
{"text":"Kori, Kori, Kori! Our helper did a PHENOMENAL job helping us! Our food was cooked perfectly, but she was the star of the evening. 

When we told our hostess, who was also VERY sweet, about our experience, she called over the manager. SHE was just as excited about our time in her space. We felt SO welcome at this location. 

Try the red moscato! Thanks Kori!"}
{"text":"Service was great, the waitress was very helpful and fast on her feet. The food was very good"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went last night and I have NEVER had such an amazing waitress. She was incredibly funny , patient and explained every little thing to us. She had us laughing the entire time. \"Veronica\" was her name. Would go back again just to see her!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch on Friday, February 9. I was pretty surprised at how full the parking lot was! I was seated immediately and received excellent service from my server. I chose the spaghetti lunch special that included unlimited salad and breadsticks. Of course, the small pasta entrée took a backseat to the always wonderful salad and breadsticks. Thankfully, Olive Garden has kept the salad and breadstick recipes it has had for many years. These items always make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Seriously?! I came back to this location due to a family dinner choice. Got chicken scampi again, 2 orders of it for the table. And sure enough, as expected both dishes were completely dry and void of any sauce. The tiny sides we requested were not even enough, and the chicken portions were alot smaller. It's fucking mind-blowing at this point how poorly you can execute a popular menu item not once, but 5 times. Obviously management doesn't give a shit to correct the problem, thanks guys for another disappointment."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting!!! I ate here yesterday around 6. I usually love Olive Garden but the last 2times I've been here was nasty. The outside is dirty, front entrance littered with cigarette butts. There is a stinch as soon as you open the door. The food was gross, greasy and very bad. I gave it one star because of the waiter.  I'll never go to this one ever again. The health inspector needs to visit and manager fired!!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner tonight.  Our server was Mia and she took good care of us. Drinks were brought out fast,  food was served nice and hot, And she continously checked on us.  It was busy as it was dinner time.   Once again,  I'm very pleased with our experience tonight.   

Only reason why I didn't give this a 5 stars is because,  I took my daughter to use the ladies room and it was quite a mess."}
{"text":"The last time I had eaten at the Olive Garden was in January of 2011 at this same location.  I took a friend of mine from out of town as she had never eaten there as I was raving about their bottomless salads.  We both ordered a shrimp and pasta dish.  When they brought the food out and placed it in front of us, I could tell immediately that something was wrong.  The shrimp looked like it had been cooked some while before and then just mixed in with the pasta and sauce to cover.  Before I even took a taste, I knew that shrimp was going to taste rubbery!  And boy did it.  To top it off, I found nose hairs as I got 1/4 of a way through it on one of the noodles.  I signaled to the waitress who came over and looked at it also. She didn't even argue with me; those were definitely some dirty cooks nose hairs.  So she asked me if I wanted something else to which I replied, \"No, I've lost my appetite.\"  
Next, the manager came over to apologize which I thought was a nice gesture.  

Thinking it was just a fluke, I took a client this time over to this same Olive Garden last week which was almost a year to the date later.  I ordered the salad and an appetizer.  She ordered the spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread.  I couldn't believe it when she showed me what she had found mixed in with her spaghetti; yes, she was holding up a long string of spaghetti with a long brown head hair hanging from the fork.  That did it; I felt like throwing up on the spot triggering at that moment my memory of those nose hairs last year on MY pasta. 

I don't know what is going on in those kitchens over there, but that is it for me!  I'm done with this place!  This just tells me that there is no oversight as to what is going on in those kitchens over there. Yuk! The health department needs to take a really close look in these restaurant kitchens as to how the help is handling their personal hygiene when working with food served to the public."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my family of 12 and when we arrived they only had us down for a group of four. That was a minor mistake compared to what happened at the table. I don't eat meat so I ordered one of the few meatless dishes - the minestrone soup, \"a vegetarian classic\" quoted from the menu. I got it and it looked fine but about halfway though eating it, I noticed that there was ground beef in my soup!! I let the waitress know and she handled it horribly. She told me that there was no beef it in it. She brought it back to the kitchen then came back with the same half-eaten dish and put it in front of me proceeding to imply that I was wrong! The manager got involved and told me that they had mixed two soups in the kitchen together - a vegetarian and non-vegetarian soup. Imagine how many other customers were subject to this mistake that night. Following their mistake they even made us pay for the soup. Absolutely unacceptable.

If you have any kind of allergy or specific dietary needs, avoid this restaurant at all costs. Don't be sorry."}
{"text":"The drinks, bread sticks, shrimp scampi appetizer and salads came out very fast. We ordered the create your own pasta bowl which turned out to be a large portion of deliciousness and the chicken shrimp carbonara which was also very tasty. 

Be sure to ask for Terry as your server. He made sure we had plenty of everything we wanted and made sure it was the perfect meal for my lady and me."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in the service of my waitress. Her name was Vanessa, I came in 12/11/17 at 8pm. The whole time I felt rushed and not welcomed at all. I asked her a question about my check and she said \"calm down don't get mad\" when I asked a simple question. The whole time she looked like she wanted to go home and was annoyed when I would ask for anything. This was my first time here at this location and it will definitely be my last. I do not recommend anyone else to come here."}
{"text":"Service was great. The wine was delicious. We come here often and this time was exceptional. Everything was great from the service to the food! Keep up the good work and thank you again from my family to yours. Breadsticks are amazing as always.
Thanks Yelp and Thanks Olive Garden. I really enjoy good food and great service.
Hard to find these days.

Best Olive Garden in Arizona that I have gone to so far and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Olive Garden has excellent service and is very hospitable. The waiters were awesome, the food was fast and delicious, and the drinks and bread sticks came almost instantly. I've come here multiple times and I never leave disappointed. To begin, the service was excellent. We were served almost immediately, and the waitress spoke to us with respect, and was very nice. She brought us our bread sticks and drinks immediately and she was constantly asking us if we need our drinks refilled. When we ordered our appetizers, the waitress brought us more bread sticks without asking if we needed more, because she noticed ours were all gone. She was all around a great waitress!


Also, the food was delicious. The appetizers were awesome, and the entrée was the delicious. The food was really hot, cooked to perfection, and definitely mouth watering. I don't have a single complaint about this restaurant. I love eating here and have been there more times then any other restaurant. The prices are high, but for the quality of the food I really can't complain."}
{"text":"We started off w/ two appetizers, stuffed mushrooms and Calamari. Well the Calamari is my wife's. lol. They were both great. We both got the never ending pasta but added the chicken. We ended up getting Chicken Alfredo. My wife never orders soup but tried a soup, Chicken and Gnocchi and says it's amazing! I got endless salad which was good. The food experience is always great when we come here! They have a great wine selection as well. We usually order a bottle of Moscato and have a couple glasses than take the rest home to enjoy for later! We definitely recommend their place to anyone. This is place is very family oriented. We usually brink our kids as well and they have tasty kid meals as well at least that's whut they say! Great atmosphere too! Our waitress was great as well!"}
{"text":"The Olive Garden has always been one of my favorite restaurants. I've been here a few times and was pleased with the friendliness of the waiters/waitresses and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I love coming to the Olive Garden franchise. This place was no different. The overall experience was great! I have no complaints."}
{"text":"The calamari and stuffed mushrooms were a little undercooked, they replaced the calamari. The Fettucini Alfredo was tasty. I was not extremely impressed with the breaded zucchini, wouldn't order that next time. Really like the buy one take one special. The host was sort of rude, but the hostesses were nice and our server did a great job."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I got the 2 for 25 deal. I thought its pretty awesome deal for your money with unlimited breadsticks and choice of soup or salad. Then there's a choice of entree and I chose the spaghetti with meatballs an I thought it was really good.  Then dessert was good, forgot the name of it, something amaretto dolcini or something but it was good and hit the spot. Waitress was very helpful and friendly:) will return again"}
{"text":"Came in here for the buy one take one deal.. kids ordered spaghetti and Alfredo..our waitress wasn't very  attentive to our needs, she didn't even bother asking what my kids wanted as the take home meal,usually we get to choose but, she assumed the kids wanted the same pasta.
Also wasn't aware that they charge for extra dipping sauce, I brought this issue up with Chris Casper and all he says to me is \"nothing is free\" lol..very professional
As far a I know salad & breadsticks are free with your order."}
{"text":"The food is always good at any location I go to. Our waitress at this location was super friendly & was very helpful. Their roscato wine is so good! Not as sweet as moscato."}
{"text":"Great service by Susan .. we went yesterday late she had all the time for us super good service 
I would take a star of for to little things.....
The youngest person in da joint look really tired like granny ....
Stay away from the sausages ... just a hogdog...lol
We been there b4 with bad situation Not This Time 
Thank Susan
She did everything perfect ..."}
{"text":"The best part about Olive Garden is the buy one take one deal. I'm not sure how often it happens, but every time its there, I have to get it. You get a full entree while you are there, and another full entree to go! It still comes with unlimited breadsticks and salad. Which is also a great deal! 
The customer service was nothing spectacular but they werent rude."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday September 17, 2016 ( my birthday). We were a table of 4 without a reservation at 8:00pm. They got us right in, which was great. However, our food was terrible. The soup and salad were great... but moments after receiving them our entrees came out. Strange thing was our entree's were over cooked and dried out like they had been sitting in the window.. or frankly just not cooked well. My husband and son in law had the tour of Italy. Both plates chicken parmasian the chicken was hard as rocks with black edges on the crust, their fettuccini was also hard and crusty on the edges. I had the mushroom ravoli.. ick. The cheese sauce broke and it was all piled in the center of the dish exposing the tender ravoli and making them hard... I ate 1... and just stopped. My daughter was the only one who received a meal that was enjoyed.. and it was the build your own pasta."}
{"text":"Worst case of food poisoning I've ever had they got me with spoiled lobster ravioli.  I I inquired to why this meal was late and I was told that they had to make the sauce so basically what they did was a portal the spoiled sauce and made fresh sauce.  I had a fever and emptied my stomach and then most of top intestine in 6 vomit bouts over the course of 6 hours.  The best part of the day was being able to hold down water again.  My throat is so soar.  Now I just have to get the bottom out and I'm done.  Many bathroom trips.  Never again!  BTW I have an extremely strong stomach and can eat any sushi you give me. Sea urchin etc and never once have gotten sick until I was deliberately poisoned at olive garden."}
{"text":"o far the server is very rude. Tables were dirty and busser never came to clean them. Ordered the soup and salad and soup they had. I believe the comment was,the same four we always have. Wow. . We sat at the bar and our \"server\" was named Jesse. Walked up to the person next to both of us asked them how they were and continued to walk past us. I really don't understand why be in   the service industry if you hate the public. Hope it can be chalked up to a bad day. Too bad because love its close to my house. I said I wouln't come back again bc this lady just treated us so badly, but I gave it another shot. the food was just as good as always and so was the company. Our service was ok,, but I think this location could learn a thing or 2 about service and should take a refresher course."}
{"text":"I catered lunch for my team we ordered the Lasagna Combination. The order was ready when I got there. The food was good and there was more than enough for us. The service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The service was delightful! I came here for my birthday with a group of 8 and spent a couple of hundred dollars on the meal. We were all satisfied until just walking out the door we all started to feel sick. All, but two of us had serious  stomach issues all night. My husband was in so much pain I almost took him to the hospital. Such a shame. I really loved this place before last night."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, but it seems lately that this resteraunt is lacking. I noticed that they have cut their portion sizes in half... and the alfredo sauce is always inconsistant, sometimes it taste like they water it down instead of using the real ingredients...maybe to cut costs?? My husband took me there for valentines day and my alfredo sauce tasted like it was burnt. Not sure I will be going back there anytime soon......I think I'm going to start looking for a new favorite italian place to eat at!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this location. Yes, it's a chain, but the staff is friendly and courteous. The summer menu is okay, nothing spectacular. The mozzarella cheese fondu is my favorite...along with a pitcher of red sangria...I'm set to go! The setting is quaint an cozy. Enjoyable for a group...late night as well!!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and when something's off they'll take it back and fix it no problem.Over all great place to eat for the family."}
{"text":"I really like Olive Garden ... Not because I am expecting authentic Italian food.. But because it is a fun place to dine ... and you can get a good meal for a decent price... and WHO doesn't love garlic breadsticks.... 

They are handicap accessible this earns them a giant star... Especially since I am not able to get around very easily. They put me in a place that I could easily get IN and out with my knee walker (I will be so glad when I don't have to have it anymore) 

Then we sat down and ordered ... We started with peach sangria- 
then lasagna fritta... (this was my favorite thing of the meal) They brought it out and it was like lasagna noodles that had been stuffed with ricotta cheese and then breaded and fried ... they have a cheesy sauce on the bottom and a marinara on top . They are chewy and crunchy at the same time. They are sooo good i would have eaten them for my lunch only. 

However we ordered chicken parmigiana - with salad. 

The salad was crisp and fresh - and was not over saturated in dressing. 

Then we had the chicken parm... 
Everything was really good and the service was good also :)"}
{"text":"So amazing. After the Shrimp Alfredo, I couldn't resist the piccoli dolce. Two bites into my dessert, I felt my pupils dilate and started getting overheated. The food was so amazing I started having an ecstasy flash back. I was with my gram so I had to run to the bathroom and splash my face with water until the trip wore off. It didn't take long. I think the MDMA high came from the initial endorphin rush from the amazing food. Would highly recommend this restaurant to friends and family!"}
{"text":"I remember growing up, Olive Garden was the \"fancy\" place for a family dinner. It was the place my parents took me and my sister to celebrate a good report card, a local competition win, or a special birthday. This is also where I took my date for our first high school homecoming dinner. 

Fast forward 15 years, my well traveled older self have come to realize that this is far from the authentic Italian food that has established itself amongst world cuisine with its fresh, rustic ingredients and detailed workmanship in the kitchen. But there are a few things here that still have me coming back after all those years of cultural growth:

(In no particular order)
-Great drink selections
-Endless soup with any entree
-Zuppa Toscana
-Dolcini (guilt-free cup sized mini deserts)
-All day lunch portions served at reduced prices
-Prompt service and friendly staff
-Consistent quality

So next time you're in town and not sure where to go, there is something for everyone at the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was not. Waiter Oliver did not have a pleasant attitude when taking our orders or checking up on us. We did NOT receive any refills on our waters throughout our entire stay. He had messed up on our bill three times until finally one of the managers stepped in to correct the matter. Absolutely worst service I have ever received. Will NOT be coming back. (1 star just for the food)"}
{"text":"I want to take a few minutes out of my limited time off to share an experience I had with your company last night.  At the location at 26000 Harvard Rd, Beachwood, OH 44122. Ironically enough I came to the Olive Garden with my family to celebrate receiving a promotion. I was made a service manager of a major electronics retailer. A job that is centered around making sure customer satisfaction is maximized. On this evening we were seated at a table directly behind another family of 3. After about 30 minutes we had still not had a server come to our table. Not a single time. Not to get us water, or salad, or breadsticks, or even to just say hello. The table seat right before us had now receive their food order. They got their drinks, their appetizers, and now their food. At this point I went and notified the hostess that seated us. She apologized and got us started with drink orders and she said she would find out who out waiter was. 8 more minutes went by and we still had not received drinks nor had a server stopped by table. At this point I went and spoke with a manager named Leo about my issue and he assured me a server would be by soon. Shortly after a different hostess came and took our order and several more minutes went by before we met our server. Once we had a server he was either upset or ashamed of what happened and provided a service that was barely passing. The manager NEVER came back over to check in with us, make sure we got served, or were satisfied with our visit.
I am beyond disappointed that I chose to come to this location on this specific evening and am beyond disappointed that my entire family got to experience such a letdown. I hope that you can learn from this experience and I can assure you I will be sharing this experience with everyone I can."}
{"text":"If you want to play a really funny prank on your friends, I would highly recommend this Olive Garden! You can tell your friends you have a time traveling machine, blindfold them, and take them to this beautifully decorated establishment from the 90's. Their all wood barnyard style is certainly a throwback to times when interior decorators were just stay at home moms! Their \"shelves\" had to have been from a thrift shop of years past that were painted in a dull gray style, and then decorated with cheap bottles of wine. 
I would rate the service as excellent. Fortunately for this restaurant, their servers have more flair and flavor than their food! We had a wonderful waiter that made sure we had a plentiful assortment of salad, crack-breadsticks, and cardboard (or some may consider it pasta). 
The salad and breadsticks are why I go to this pretend Italian restaurant, and for this reason and the good service, I was able to add a few stars to their rating! I also appreciated that patrons were allowed to leave their babies in the lobby instead of bothering others with their fussiness! 
I might recommend the cooks cut a tad back on the amount of salt added to the entrees. Fortunately, I have great blood pressure so I didn't worry about having a heart attack after I stomached a few bites of their food, but judging by others who were feasting, I doubt they can say the same!
I would recommend the soup and salad just to be on the safe side, unless you're really low on sodium, then feast away! I'm going to upload a few of the delightful decor pictures if anyone wants to stage a time travel prank on their friends!"}
{"text":"Had a great night. The place wasn't packed and the food was prepared really fast. It was a light dinner anyhow. Just some salad, soup, and appetizers. Our waiter was very friendly and never let our drinks empty. Only thing was I know the lighting is for ambiance and what not but its hard to read the menu with the lights so dim."}
{"text":"Good Ole reliable Olive Garden.  You're not going to get 5 star service, you're not going to get 5 star food.  What you will get is some pretty darn good italian food at a reasonable cost, especially if you go there during their all you can eat soup and salad or the never ending pasta bowl.

The Olive Garden has become one of those places where you know the food is going to be good everytime you go.  They don't move their menu around every 6 months like alot of places do.  They offer consistency over variety.  That's not to say the food is boring, quite the opposite.  The Olive Garden has found a niche that works for them and I for one appreciate it.

On occasion they will bring some new dishes from their culinary school that might be worth a try.  They also do the same thing with their seasonal desserts.  Which reminds me, if you haven't tried the pumpkin cheesecake ye, WTF are you waiting for.  That thing is delicious!"}
{"text":"Came in at 11:30am and had to wait 5min for them to have a server on staff before seating us.  But once we had a server she was amazing and food was quickly delivered."}
{"text":"We always have sucky service when we come here, but today was so sucky it deserved a review. We waited 15 minutes and we never got waited on. The table next to us had 2 waiters and we had none. They didn't even acknowledge us. Needless to say we walked right out and went to Chilis and had great service. Get it together OG!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Olive Garden chain restaurants but I would have to say that the meal we had yesterday was pretty good. I had the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was superb. The sauce was not too strong and had the right amount of consistency. The service was spot on. all the dishes that we ordered were tasty. We had ten people and our bill came up to $169 and that was including the tip. Pretty good deal for a family meal. The all you can eat salad, soup and breadsticks were awesome. I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday about 4pm.  Waitress handed menus walked away and did not return for 10 minutes to even take drink order, breadsticks came well after salad which took 15 minutes to get.  I was extremely thirsty and had finished by beverage.  I sat my empty glass on the edge of the table hoping the waitress would grab it on her way by, didn't happen until after meals came.   Waitress was too busy to attend to her tables as she was taking pictures at another table.  I wanted a refill on salad which I did not receive.  Waitress reached over my plate of food to reach the empty breadstick plate and stuck her arm right in my food.  I sat there in such shock and horror at the way she performed her job.   Two breadsticks, very small amount of salad, her arm in my food and an empty beverage glass.  The manager was walking table to table asking about service however skipped our table (probably noticed the look of disgust)   I went to front looking for him while my date paid bill.  Manager had disappeared."}
{"text":"I just called to make a reservation and was told to call back tomorrow. I held for 10 minutes to be told that. I explained to the man who answered the phone I work all day tomorrow and will not have time to call. I was then told well that is what my manager says!  I then said to the man I guess you do not want my reservation for 15. I can find another restaurant that does.He then said okay thank you have a good night! Wow great customer service."}
{"text":"Look, when you go to the Olive Garden for lunch, you know what you're getting. The food is consistent. We ordered the peach raspberry tea, which I love. Then we got the soup, salad and breadsticks lunch special. The salad is always good. The breadsticks came out warm and garlicky. 
We both got the chicken gnocchi soup which was very good as well. 
We went ahead and got a dessert to share. We decided on the wild berry layer cake. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Service is good and fast. Always love the salad soup and breadsticks but the rest of the good is usually mediocre as far as Italian food is concerned. Lunch prices give you more bang for your buck. They added a new summer menu which had some interesting ideas on it. I got the vegetable lasagna with shrimp which looked better than it tasted . The pasta was way underdone but the overall flavor was decent."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is always awesome! To bad there's not one in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at Olive Garden in years, but after receiving such impeccable first class service by our server Billy tonight we'll definitely be back. Billy knew his menu front to back, suggested items, and our drinks never got below half full. 

We will wait for a table with Billy from now on. 

**Trust me, ASK FOR BILLY**"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came for dinner after a long drive home from AZ in which we hadn't eaten.  Husband requested a booth since it was not busy on Monday night. Hostess said it would be just a minute since a party had just left and it needed to be cleaned. We went to the bar and ordered a glass of wine to drink while we waited.... and waited.  Husband went to check with the hostess and she said it would be just one more minute....We then watched a couple come in and be seated immediately at a booth.  We couldn't believe it!  This was a span of about 20 minutes in a not busy restaurant.  Finally got seated and spoke to the manager, but dinner wasn't great. Ordered apps and salad came first. Had no plates when the app was served and asked server for a plate. She said great and then preceded to chat up the next table and clear their dishes... while hot app is turning cold. Service was awful... we won't be back! Food was mediocre... salad was good."}
{"text":"How does that spaghetti and meatballs song go? Well I forgot the lyrics to that song a long time ago, but I definitely haven't forgotten about the Olive Garden. You know I've heard a rumor that they closed down Olive Gardens in Ontario. If its true, I feel really bad for all those people because Olive Grden's tiramisu is hands down the best I've ever had. No joke. It's one of the reason why I go there and occasionally just order tiramisu for take out... Yup, just the tiramisu.

I went there again last night for the nth time... k, wait - is it just me, or is everyone I know either getting married or pregnant (couples) or getting married AND getting pregnant at the same time? It's ridiculous. I went there to treat my newly married cousins out for their wedding dinner that happened 2 months ago out of town. Someone had pasta cravings so I suggested 5 places in town and they picked the Olive Garden... I did mention that if we went to Olive Garden, they did have tiramisu... and BOOYAH! Olive Garden it was! Hahaha

Family oriented atmosphere, calm environment even for a date, reasonable prices and you can even get full on the unlimited soup or salad before your meals arrive... Unless someone's a triathlete or a sumo wrestler - that probably won't have the same effect. The service is consistent, you can't make reservations on a Sunday, wait times can be long (but hey, that just means this place is really popular) and the staff are friendly and service oriented. The food selection doesn't change very much so it's consistent. If you have any problems, management has always been courteous and made sure everything was taken care of if something wasn't right and I've always left satisfied.

The Olive Garden is consistent and a happy place to enjoy a meal with family and close friends, that's why I keep coming back. Plus, have you had their tiramisu?! Haha"}
{"text":"It's probably been about 10 years since I've been to Olive Garden - being that the only location in Calgary is in the NE and it was usually lined up out the door, I've never had the urge to go back.

However after seeing one of those mouth watering Olive Garden commercials on TV and the current special was \"2 for $25 Italian Dinner\", I started to crave pasta all day! Conveniently, I had been carpooling with my boyfriend (who works in the NE) for the past week so it worked out perfectly - we were having Olive Garden for dinner! YESSSSSSSSSSSS!

We arrived around 6ish and I was expecting a line because the parking lot was pretty full but we actually got seated right away. Although the decor is a bit dated, I like that this place is quite big and there's windows surrounding the entire building so it looks open and inviting.

A quick glance at the specials menu, I realized the special was \"2 For $35 Italian Dinner\", what the? I pulled up the website (Canadian version!) on my phone, and a small disclaimer said \"Prices may vary in Alaska, NYC and Canada\" . . . okayyyyyy

We started with the famous garden fresh salad and baked bread sticks - and seriously one helping was already filling, I wonder if people actually take advantage of the unlimited salad and bread sticks they offer?

After our helpful waitress answered some questions about the entrees, I went with the Tuscan Garlic Chicken and my boyfriend got the Five Cheese Ziti al Forno. Our food came out pretty quick, and after a generous helping of grated Parmesan to cover our pasta we dug in. My dish was super tasty - the chicken was lightly bread and crispy, pasta was cooked perfectly and it was all lightly coated with a nice cream sauce. I had a bite of the Ziti al Forno and it was like fancy homemade Mac & Cheese - if ya love cheese definitely go with this!

I only ate half of my meal to make room for dessert - which was a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. I was expecting just a bite size piece, but out came a HUGE slice of cake! I think I might have been a bit full to really appreciate the cake, but it was pretty delish.

My boyfriend ended up having my leftovers for lunch the next day and he said it was still really good. I will keep in mind for next time we go again :)"}
{"text":"My wife loves Olive Garden and I've always thought it was mediocre but we went there for our anniversary on a Monday night. It was busier than most restaurants and they said it would be a 20 min wait. We were seated within 10 and we had the best server! If you go there ask if Lynwood is working bcuz he was fantastic. Very attentive and knew the menu well. This new location is slightly quieter than the one on Cheyenne as well. We will surely be going back soon."}
{"text":"I usually dont give praise to any of the service here at this place but i would like to take the time to write about our waiter Daniel. We having been comming to this place for the pass 6 years and havent had the experience we did like tonight. The food here is great and thats what brings us back. Anyways about Daniel first and foremost yall need to give him a raise his attitude was over the top the customers service was out of this world. Daniel went out of his way to make sure that we were taken care of not just us but every table he waited. My water and all of our drinks was never half empty he kept it full at all times. The food was fast and quick. All in all the best experience i have ever had customer wise in this city of sins. Thank you Daniel."}
{"text":"I've been here many times throughout the year. Gerardo was our server and he always does a phenomenal job (make sure you ask for him). This time we went with the party of 16 persons, like alway, he delivered excellent customer service. Everything in their menu is good and you know that you can never go wrong with Olive Garden."}
{"text":"We went here because we won a gift card at work. It was actually surprisingly good! The service was absolutely great; especially since we had a 6 month old and asked for a car seat sling then a high chair. They were very accommodating.

The food was pretty good to for a chain restaurant. We had the 2 for $25 (with a $3 add on for seafood Alfredo) plus a limonata and calamari. We also had a $5 off coupon. ALWAYS look for coupons when going to chain restaurants. It can save you some money!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden continues its slow down hill slide. This particular location had a leaky awning out side draining water onto the benches out side. The staffs answer to this was to throw napkins on the wet bench. Wait staff was unfriendly and inattentive. Salad literally tasted like it had a cigarette butt in it. Bread sticks were cool and extra salty. Waited over 45 minutes for entrees to be served. Waitress dumped my wife's leftovers and mine together in one box, despite both meals being VASTLY different and not compatible. TERRIBLE SERVICE, WORSE FOOD. GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE..."}
{"text":"This was NOT my first time at this location. I actually frequent this location pretty often. However, I guess the world wanted me to hold out on writing a review for it until this very night. I kept telling myself to write the review after each time, but ended up writing about something else. 

BUT, now I can write a review for this location of the famous Olive Garden chain everyone knows so much about, at least I am assuming. 

This was the first time I went with a 10 grouper. Usually its the casual date where the guy just loves Olive Garden that much or family and friend outings. However, this time I was with an organization who have end of the year dinners. (Year, meaning, school year, UNLV). 

In the past I have had good service. I never had issues, everything is always good. At least everything I choose...

Well this time, they had two people from the wait staff(gender neutral is happening) and they both were just really rushed for some reason. The gentlemen on my side of the table was nice and suggested all these things, but would not let me get my word for the longest time. He just kept going like the energizer bunny. That was just my drink order! Which I had some pomegranate drink which was fantastic, but then came the meal and at first I did not know what I want when he got to me, then I decided, however I took too long apparently because he skipped me... thank buddy. Now I have to wait for you to go all the way around because you could not wait five more seconds more me to find what it is I really wanted. 

Back to me, OK cool, so I ordered and then he went to grab the menus and caught his arm on my friends drink across the way. You expect the usual spillage of ice and drink all over the table sometimes your lap... but no. Not this time. What you do not expect is to be hit directly in the forehead with an ice cube... (ya you ponder how that happened because I have no clue). I have some type of beverage on my arm, little on the pants, but I am still astonished about the ice cube that hit my head. New restaurant experience to add to the books? I think yes. 

He did not even apologize to me, only to the person whose drink it belonged to. He just kept on rushing.... It may be a Friday night, but still. 


Other than that, my experiences have been good. Great food, great drinks, wine, sangria's, the works. Did not like their restrooms, they are shaped so awkwardly...but that is just me. 

Ok rant complete. Maybe an update down the road will help them get to a 4 star... to be continued...?"}
{"text":"My husband and I liked Olive Garden. We would always split a main course and each have wine . The dinner check was reasonable although a chicken dish for 16.49$ is a bit high.
This restaurant has great food and service, BUT they have hiked the price of house wine to
$1 an ounce of wine...and that is house wine folks.. .No happy hour that I know of. 
Guess we will go elsewhere to enjoy wine with our dinner."}
{"text":"Have have to say I have been ordering take out for lunch for about a little more than a month now, I have been wanting to write this review for some time now, I have to say that Sue L. Is the best she answers me and brings me everything correctly and always on time, thanks Sue your amazing . So if you want to order lunch from here they will take care of you."}
{"text":"Don't go there when busy. Horrible time management with food and wait staff. Had to wait 30 minutes just for more breadsticks. Food/app was cold and hard."}
{"text":"Came here for the 10.99 deal and it was everything I expected and more! The soup was amazing and filling! The breadsticks are still as good as I remember! The spaghetti was my favorite thing on the menu! The 5 cheese marinara topped it off wonderfully. The dessert was really yummy. I had a wonderful experience here!"}
{"text":"Very quick with our meals..food was basic. Nothing to really rave about .my wife is Italian and I would choose her cooking over   what I was served."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Monique is excellent.  It was my sons birthday and the dice of us had a great meal.  Very reasonable."}
{"text":"Our dinner was great but the only thing keeping me from giving them 4-5 stars is their disgusting bathroom! My daughter and I went to go wash our hands after eating and to our surprise, a big turd was in one of the toilets just out in the open! I could not wait to get out of there... How disgusting! Some people just have no shame... Please check your bathrooms often!"}
{"text":"We love Olive Garden.  We have gone to the Olive Garden in Rochester, MN and Kansas City, and Chandler, AZ, but the one in Goodyear is not the same.  It is like a training ground for average cooks.  Everything is a bit off.  The salad was not up to snuff tonight.  Tired tomatoes were 2 pieces in the whole salad with a ton of croutons.  The gravy on the Chicken Marsala was runny and weak.  The Zuppa Tuscana was interesting.  Big chunks of meat in it that had not been broken down prior to being added to the pot.  This Olive Garden needs a new chef and new management.  They continue to be busy, but they are not a very good store in Goodyear.  Go elsewhere and get happy.  Wait staff is great!  Food was sub par, but eatable."}
{"text":"I went to Olive Garden today for lunch with a friend. We were greeted right away by the hostess and seated in a booth.  The place was surprisingly packed with customers.  I don't know if it just due to graduation celebrations or maybe everyone was enticed by the endless soup and salad lunch combo.  We both enjoyed our hot soups and the salad was nice and crisp.  With fresh shaved cheese it really hit the spot.  Nice atmosphere, good food and fast service makes this a winner."}
{"text":"You know, it's not like Olive Garden is the debbil or anything. What it does, it does pretty well.  Like other chains, you know what you're getting, and it actually tastes really good.  So, shoot me, I'll eat there for lunch or a casual dinner with the fam. Seriously, I'd go there for the breadsticks alone."}
{"text":"The service was great.  The food was tasty. The salad is always great. The entrée portions are small and over priced.
I have a huge gripe about the little black computer box on the table. I played a game on it and then there was a  charge on my check for $1.99 for playing the game. I never saw a warning that there was a charge for the game  I was never given the option to decline playing because  there was a charge.  WHAT A HUGE RIP OFF.  I warn you, throw that little black box off your table."}
{"text":"Awesome, great stuff, delicious. I go there every week. The tour of Italy is the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent Birthday Dinner with my family at the Estrella Parkway and McDowell Road location. The food and our server was wonderful. We couldn't have asked for a better experience!Thank you!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch or dinner. Every meal is served at the proper temperature and tastes great. The servers are awesome.  They point out specials and very knowledgeable about the menu. Five stars for the entire staff."}
{"text":"All five stars are for Stephanie the carry out  server. Excellent customer service I was in a rush and it came up the food came up fast I'm home and opening the bag and I see that she put everything in there it's no different than eating at the restaurant and Carryout Service is excellent thank you very much for a wonderful meal at the Olive Garden by Metro Mall"}
{"text":"We called ahead and had someone go to check us in  and get the little buzzer before we went because we didn't want to wait long for a table with 2 toddlers running around. We also had family with us from San Francisco. We were one big exhausted hungry group.
I was told it would be a 20min wait. That's perfect. Good! Well 20min came and went. The kids were restless after 45min so I asked how much longer the wait would be. The hostess told me we were up to 8th on the list but it would still be at least an hour. 
Seriously? If I had been told the actual wait time when I got there I would have said okay and just come back another time. We left and went down the road to a Hawaiian BBQ place with no wait that was delicious!"}
{"text":"What is going on at this location?  The staff is always different from server's to managers and they get worse and worse with every visit. Shawna is a joke, I thought she was a hostess for the longest time until I commented about my Stuffed Chicken Marsla, tasting awful, her reply was \"Well I'm sorry you feel like that, what else do you want?\" That wasn't the point and her tone was very offensive. Needless to say I don't think I will be back, for a while, if any one knows where

{"text":"Avoid this Olive Garden at all costs.  The host discriminates against minorities.  This is the second time this man insisted on showing us to the worst table in the house and when we asked for a different table continued to stear us where we would not \"offend\" the other patrons, dressed in shorts, flipflops and t-shirts.  Tables he selected for us included, a very large table for 8 for our party of 3  way in the back of the restaurant, next to the kitchen; a table right next to a dirty serving station, and a table in an alcove where our party was not visible to others.  

Although we asked for a more desirable table, it was refused.  Favored guests had one thing in common--they were all white, while all minority patrons were seated in undesirable spots."}
{"text":"I have not been to Olive Garden in four years. I returned to take my mother out for a nice meal. It took us five minutes to find a parking space. When we entered we were seated quickly. The newly addition of the ziosk ruined the atmosphere of a nice Italian restaurant. Service was very quick and we got our food. They had messed up on my order. They had served me chicken tenders instead of pasta. My mother had ordered the unlimited pasta. The first pasta had been served in a big bowl and the second one in a small bowl. All in all, my experience deserves 3 stars."}
{"text":"The food today was all good ..we had chicken Alfredo ,kids ravioli , the new wings , risotto balls and the soup and salad , they were all tasty I really enjoyed the wings. The service was however pretty terrible the appetizers arrived after our meal we think they forgot that part of the order . the bread sticks showed up finally as we were done . I will say the manager did give us the appetizers for free without us ever having to complain so that was a plus .."}
{"text":"I went for a pickup order and wanted to purchase a bottle of wine to go. They told me I can buy it but have to consume some of the wine in the restaurant. Not only do you promote drinking and driving but a open bottle leaving the restaurant. This is beyond the stupidest thing I've heard that I can't purchase a bottle as a gift for someone that I have to drink some and then give it to them. Not only did you tell me to go to Bevmo but you lost a 25.00 sale. This policy needs to be changed its stupid."}
{"text":"seriously? i mean, really and truly?? if you live in madison and you think the olive garden is good food, either you were born without taste buds or you had them surgically removed as a child. there is no excuse for the olive garden or applebee's or the like in a town like this. eating there should be criminal."}
{"text":"Honestly disapointed the last time we came here. 2 of us went last week for dinner. To start out we just stood at the host stand with the host while he was trying to get someone to seat us (there were people behind him). You could tell they just didnt want to. Finally the same person that was behind the host finally decided they would seat us. I get it. we came in late. But not great first impression. 

The place was really bright. Not sure why. It seemed like they just got done being busy because a ton of tables were dirty and not reset. Our booth was wiped but there were a ton of crumbs on the booth seats. 

We got seated and the waiter did a great job of getting to us and taking care of the table especially because i saw the host triple sat him all at once. 

We ordered wine and both of our glasses had something floating in the wine(maybe cork)

The food was awful. I had the new pork tips which were very fatty and extremely small portioned for $15. It came with ravioli and there were only like 5 on the plate and the pasta seemed dried out. The presentation looked like they just slopped it on the plate. I finished it only because i was starving and i dont like to complain and send things back

The other person had lasagne that seemed like was just microwaved and put in a bowl and brought to the table. The pasta was extremely dried out and barely cut apart with a knife. She ate about a quarter of it and just stopped. 

The only good thing about our experience was the server did a great job. Other than that it would only be one star. No one besides him just really seemed to care from appearance to quality of food. 

I try not to be a bad reviewer but it was just bad all around. Very disapointed from a place i used to love going to ."}
{"text":"Olive Garden usually consists of consistent quality, throughout all locations. The food on my visit was actually very decent, as are most Olive Garden's.

It was busy, and told we would be seated in 10 mins, and took 25 min. After that, the food took a while to come through. The food tasted great but it took a while to flag a server down for additional food and then later the check."}
{"text":"The never ending (chicken alfredo) pasta bowl special is not worth the $17.99. They start you off with a regualr portion of chicken alfredo but when you get a refill the second portion is the size of an appetizer plate. They also neglect to add alfredo sauce. This is a ploy to make you to make you wait 15 minutes for the alfredo sauce. By then you are full from your beverage and the unlimited soup and salad. Voila!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden: more like gringo italian food with bagged salad, bottled dressing, and jarred sauce.  But still not too bad!

Our server was Jason and he was accurate to-the-point & quick.  We got iced tea with has a long spoon- nice touch.  The salad and breadsticks aren't bad but far from homemade.  I mention that that they probably have that yoga mat ingredient that subway got in trouble for.

The salad is decent but they probably have the same exact amount of onions and croutons on every single salad.  The lettuce is crisp and I appreciate the few carrot shreds and 2 pepperccinni.

I get the never ending pasta bowl with angel hair and marinara.  My hunny gets the grilled fish & shrimp.  Our food is quite decent but not exactly chef prepared.  Jason reminds me that I can take a portion home which we do.  I ask how many bowls he's seen people eat of the never ending pasta which he says 5!! 

A sweet lady checks on us we are eating & all the tables nearby.  She was nice & charming to everyone which did add personality to the mediocre food- hence my 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Lil Man and I went there yesterday to celebrate a friend's birthday. There were suppose to be about 10 of us, but ended up being only 5. Lil Man, my friend, the birthday gal and her son, and me. Here is what we all ordered:

D = Stuffed Chicken Marsala (Oven-roasted chicken breast stuffed with Italian cheeses and sun-dried tomatoes, topped with mushrooms and a creamy marsala sauce. Served with garlic parmesan mashed potatoes. (Suggested wine: Secco-Bertani Valpolicella)... instead she had two Strawberry Margarita with Sugar around the rim of the glass.

V = Seafood Alfredo (Sautéed shrimp and scallops tossed with creamy fettuccine alfredo.) Served with her plate, she had a Strawberry-Mango Limonata.

A = (kid) Italian Cheese Pizza topped off with mushrooms. Served with his pizza, he had a few glasses of rasberry lemonade.

M = (my son) = (Grilled Chicken with Pasta) - Grilled chicken breast with sides of steamed broccoli and spaghetti with tomato sauce. Served with his meal, he had a glass of sprite and a glass of rasberry lemonade.

Me = Capellini di Mare. (Shrimp, clams and mussels sautéed in white wine, garlic and a zesty marinara sauce. Served over capellini and topped with fresh basil.) Suggested wine: Sutter Home White Zinfandel.... Instead I had a sprite and strawberry margarita with salt around the rim. 

As a appetizer, we had bread and salad. For dessert, the waiter, Mario.... forgot his name tag, therefore, his boss gave him one with the name of Buddy... Brought out a birthday cake that was awesome for the birthday gal. The cake was awesome. Check out the pic. 

We all had a blast because we were filled with laughter, chatter, great food, and a great waiter."}
{"text":"I want to update my reviews since last oct my 21 bday I decided to dine with Olive Garden with no other than Joanalee! I'm telling you guys her service is incredible she is so humble, nice, and accurate. She really cares about what you want and need. I've been to plenty of places and waiters can be crap. My 21 bday was coming up and I wanted to celebrate with my family at this location only. The closest one is on sunset it you definitely won't have the same experience as this location. The food was fantastic and the service was fine dining plus. Thank you Olive Garden for another memory to cherish and thank you Joanalee for making my bday something to remember. You're truly the definition of a customer service pro"}
{"text":"I normally think that Olive Garden is one of the better chain restaurants, but I just haven't been that impressed here.  I had a gift card and had come by several times but never went in because the line went out the door and down the sidewalk.  I don't wait in line unless it's something super special.  Finally decided to just go in, and was lucky to find a couple of seats at the bar where we could eat a full meal.  I ordered off the \"light\" menu and didn't like my meal at all.  Bartender didn't come back to see if it was ok or give me the option to order anything else. My husband's seafood fettuccine on the other hand was pretty fantastic.  And the mixed drinks were good. Just accept that the food is going to make you fat and go ahead and order the real thing."}

But over the last year the employee service has gone down hill I always go here I've always put good reviews but this time 
The ppl were rushy and rude were the kitchen is ppl don't move or say excuse me you can walk right in to them and they won't say sorry they are all about there selves and their paycheck they need ppl that at least can show they want to be there I know it's just a job but at least play the game put on a smile and have a good attitude but the boss the tall guy was friendly holds the door on way in and greets ur table making sure everything is good"}
{"text":"If they aren't interested in serving you dinner in the bar (because of lack of help?) they just don't clear the tables in the bar area. We put our name back on the list for main dining room and told them why...THEN they hustled to clear it. Our waiter was overworked but he did a great job. Food was fine but I've had better there other times."}
{"text":"This place really is horrible... Every time I wind up getting convinced to go here, I always walk out feeling like my pocket has been picked. The food isn't \"bad,\" but at roughly $25-$30 per person, there are SO many better places to eat. To hell with Olive Garden.

And this particular one has the worst-smelling parking lot in Las Vegas... every time I drive by (to go to B.J.'s nearby, which is a thousand times better), it smells like a sewer main broke or something. 

2 stars only because the wait staff is friendly."}
{"text":"We visited Cheyenne location on March 23rd 2016. Had absolutely the WORST experience ever and by writing this letter, I just hope that anybody else wouldn't have to experience the horrific chain of bad incidents that we did.
I was there with my two daughters, ages 3 and 4 and my friend. I ordered kids mac n'cheese and chocolate milk for my girls. Waitress brings the chocolate milk that smelled very strange and had big chunks of thick milk clumps inside. After confronting our server, she called a manager over (her name was Sheila if I'm not mistaken). Manager didn't seem to be that concerned and her response was: oh yeah, its just frozen cause we have been keeping fridge doors open for a while so temperature has changed dramatically. What?!?!?!? That's the response from the manager? I was so upset that I asked her if she would serve her children with something so disgusting where she responded she wouldn't.
After her reassuring that everything is good and she will make sure of that, we decided to stay and finish our meal. Our salad had onionskins inside, my friend couldn't finish her pasta cause of a strange taste she tasted.
The same night, my friend got very ill that lasted for 24 hrs. She was not able to eat anything the next day and had to stay in bed.
We both were frequent Olive Garden customers and were always more than satisfied, but never ate at that location before. 
Neither the manager nor the waitress apologized about the situation and we were charged the full amount. The worst experience ever. Luckily no loss of human life, yet..."}
{"text":"3.5.  Nice decor.  Service was very personable but a little slow.  There were many hardworking staff but unlimmited soup and salad handled by waitresses probably slows  them down.  Food was tasty and reasonable.  A good experience."}

{"text":"Great place. I've always loved the food here.
The service is great also the environment there is so 
Warm and friendly. Love this restaurant and will always be my favorite."}
{"text":"Typical olive garden. Consistent decent food"}
{"text":"I came in the other day and as I was walking In I noticed all 3 hosts sitting there gossiping and I came up and told one of them politely I was there for take out. The host replied with total attitude and said \"uhh it's at the bar!\" Needless to say I was thrown back. Please tell me how I am supposed to know where take out is. Well when I got to take out the girl was awesome but as I was leaving the hostess were all 3 sitting there gossiping once again and as I was walking out never got a good bye or thank you have a great day. I've been hosting for over a few years now and this is definitely a problem. I figure Olive Garden hires for looks only."}
{"text":"Never going back! The server took forever to come over and when she did was not paying attention and obviously had her mind somewhere else. She had asked to repeat my  drink order twice and my dinner order three times. When the food did eventually come out it looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing that was even edible was the salad. So needless to say I will never eat at an Olive Garden again."}
{"text":"We were up in Las Vegas from Bullhead City AZ with friends, decided to go to Olive Garden on Sunset for dinner.  We had an absolute wonderful time, our server (Julie) was amazing, she couldn't have done anything more to make our dinner a great experience.  

Kudos also go out to the manager on duty (Angelique D.) she stopped by our table and we had a very nice conversation with her.  This is the way a store should be run, she obviously cares about Olive Garden customers and she also appeared to have the respect from her fellow employees, 

Thank you, Julie and Angelique and all the other Olive Garden employees for their service, smiles and kindness that they all showed us, even if we didn't have direct contact, they all seemed to appreciate us dinning at Olive Garden."}

{"text":"I highly recommend not eating here!!!
I've been here twice in the past 4 months and both times the food and service were terrible.
And IMO even if the food wasn't terrible it's just way over priced.
Garbage!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Olive Garden on Cheyenne Ave through the UberEATS app. I recently moved to Vegas and come from an area with one of the busiest Olive Gardens in the world but we didn't have UberEATS at our disposal; needless to say, I was very excited to try out this new (to me) service. 

Because I just moved here, I haven't had much time to grocery shop or stock up my fridge. My choices for dinner are limited: I can either make myself something frozen in the oven or venture out and find a nice restaurant. Some nights, after a long day at work, I just feel like staying home but still want a quality meal. Instead of pizza or Chinese food, now I have the option of ordering from one of my favorite restaurants and eating in the comfort of my own home.

I ordered the lasagna, some extra breadsticks, and tiramisu for dessert. My food was delivered to me within forty-five minutes and I paired the meal with a bottle of red wine from my own fridge. Everything was delicious and the lasagna was still hot when I started to dig in. It was a great meal and one I look forward to having again and again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 1 pm on a Saturday and our service was slow.  Water \"with no lemon\" arrived with lemon.  It was later substituted.  After ordering we waited a long time for the salad and bread sticks and then removal of dishes was also delayed after salad and main courses.  Waited for carryout containers and waited longer for billing and, when he didn't show to pick up our payments, we took them to the front counter to pay when he showed up."}
{"text":"On Thursday, Feb. 4, 2016 we had lunch at the Olive Garden on Elliot in Tempe.
The person who served us was TAYLOR.
Excellent service. Thank you.
Sorry about not knowing how to use the ziosk.
Hope you received your whole tip, which was in 2 pieces. We didn't understand about using a ziosk instead of a person.
Having distractions at the table is a bad thing (the ziosk), and then charging people for using it is wrong. Shame on Olive Garden for that."}
{"text":"My go-to Italian restaurant. I've been going here for years and am usually happy with the service and the food as well as the prices.

I always order the Chicken Alfredo and have the salad. The last time I was here I ordered my usual and was expecting the same. The salad was delicious as always but the Chicken Alfredo was disappointing. Either the chef made a mistake or they have changed their Alfredo recipe.

The Alfredo sauce was thin and soupy not the usual rich and creamy style that I'm used to. I know I should have sent it back and requested a make over but didn't want to disrupt everyone else's dinner at the table.

I will go back and order my usual, just hoping it was a one time mistake."}
{"text":"Called this location to place a to go order and someone answered and hung up twice!! Then I called to see the wait time and someone did the same thing, answer, don't say anything, and then hang up!"}
{"text":"It makes me sad how this is what passes for acceptable eating out these days for the majority of people... that rant being said...

We went here with my family celebrating 8 million occasions.  We all have very busy schedules and can't always make it to all of the events that happen in each others lives.  In the past 5 weeks my family has had 5 birthdays, mother's day, a graduation, and a retirement.  We finally picked a date that we could all meet up on, regardless of some of us missing the individual events.  And unfortunately, my in laws have some sad love affair with Darden Restaurants, so sadly we wound up at Olive Garden tonight.

We arrived with a party of 9 and were seated in less than 15 minutes, which is one of the few pluses of our OG experience tonight.  We ended up with 2 servers for our party, which is the company's sad policy.  That equals out to 4.5 people per server to wait on.... should be a piece of cake right?!

Four modifications were made to our party's order:
   - 2 people asked for extra lemons in their ice tea
                -(one got no lemon, the other got 1 lemon)
   - 1 person asked for sauce on the side
   - 1 person asked for an item to be added to their pasta
                - (this resulted in an overly long thought process about
                    whether or not the computer had a button for it)

No one ordered booze. Ice tea and water for the whole table.

Food came out moderately promptly and was accurate.

Drinks; however, were left not refilled for 4 party members for 15 minutes.

Salad plates were only cleared from half the table

Boxes were asked for, but left on a tray for us to retrieve ourselves.




Typical, but annoying is the response I have to this Olive Garden experience. But, why bother improving service when people keep coming anyways, right?!"}
{"text":"Over the past few years the quality of service here has been deteriorating. It usually depends on the server you get. We decided to come here with the kids for lunch. We had another bad experience here again. Just after being seated our waitress came to the table and took our drink and food order. We ordered the soup salad and bread sticks. It took 25 minutes for it to arrive. The soup bowls were filled below half. The tomatoes and peppers in the salad(s) were rotted and the onions were not properly cut and still attached to the core. She forgot to bring out the alfredo dipping sauce that we ordered and then copped an attitude when we reminded her. Also there was not enough bread sticks for everyone at the table. Since they were only filling the bowls less than half way, we were constantly having to get refills. Being that we were having to wait for our waitress up to 15 minutes at a time, it was taking forever. Then she would just come take the soup bowls and never ask us if we wanted to have a refill. I had to basically stop her as she was walking away with my empty bowl and ask if she could bring another. The last bowl she snatched before I could ask for another. We were obviously being pushed out the door. She brought the check shortly after the food came out. I saw her waiting on us and one other table. The other table only had 2 people at it. At least a few times she walked past our table to check to see how they were doing at that other table while I was just sitting there again waiting for a refill. We also had what was supposed to be steamed broccoli and it came out completely raw. We were there for 1.5 hours and only had 3 bowls of soup! By this time I was so angry paying $50 for lunch and receiving this horrible service and extremely poor quality of food that I was looking for a manager. If you have been to an Olive Garden you know that they are always walking around and at least once comes to your table and asks how everything is. No, not this time. This location gives you less food than any other Olive Garden that I have been to. This is the last time I visit this location. I never have these problems at any other location!"}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday. We don't usually go to chain restaurants, simply because there are so many delicious locally owned restaurants in the area. However, we had a gift card and decided to go have dinner. 

We got there around 6 and had no wait for a table. However, when we left, there was alot of people in the lobby waiting for a seat.

We both ordered a glass of the house red. Well priced and very good for a house wine.

I ordered the soup and salad with the pasta fagoli soup. My husband ordered the lasagna primavera from the lighter side part of the menu (it had spinach and veggies in it).

Breadsticks and salad came out like expected. The breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more. The soup was very good and my husbands lasagna was even better. However, we were joking that there is no wonder that the lasagna was on the lighter side. It was so small!! I guess we should have expected that, given that making lasagna \"light\" isn't an easy task. I can't even begin to explain to you how small it was......AND normally we normally split meals at restaurants, so we are typically used to smaller portions to begin with! Probably the size of half a deck of cards (width, length, and height) with like 3 small pieces of grilled chicken on it. He ate it and didn't complain....it was tasty, though!

Normally we skip dessert but when the waitress came by, my husband ordered the pumpkin cheesecake (not sure if it was because he was still hungry or just craving something sweet!). This was SO good. HUGE slice of cheesecake. Very tasty and that slice was gone in like 5 minutes haha. 

Overall, ok experience, just wouldnt go back unless we had another gift card."}
{"text":"False advertising the endless classics is bullshit !!
I ordered only one order of chicken Parmesan and was charged 15.79 which is not the advertised price!
Not getting out of here for less than $20 per person not cool Olive Garden take that bullshit special off your website and stop running that commercial if your not going to honor that price!?!?"}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas you have to eat at Olive Garden. There are others in other cities but Vegas is the best one.
The service is really good, the waitress is very charming, also the service is too quick and the food is awesome.
You must try, it's a great option for those who don't want hamburger or pizza anymore."}
{"text":"Man, my visit here was sad.  2 for 25 deal is a great deal if you get good food.  Didn't happen this time, maybe next time.......
I'm gonna say the reason I am even writing this review is the pasta I received.  It was unforgivable.   Pappardelle portobello Alfredo was the name of the dish, it had three mushroom bits on the whole dish.  IA had to ask for more sauce because it was so dry, and the pasta was mushy.  What a tragedy to have overcooked pasta at a pasta place.  :(    Rosemary chicken needed more sauce as well.
The tiramisu was gross.  Tasteless except for the old coffee mush underneath the mascarpone.  
I am so glad that the salad was good and never ending, otherwise this pregnant mama would have been a bear.  
I was peeved at the service time, it took 10 to 25 minutes to get water.  What was so irritating about that was that there were four or five servers hanging around the bar shooting the ship the whole time I was there.  
I called and talked to manager Lisa and she listened attentively and offered an apology.  I appreciate her listening and empathizing so they've got that going for them.  She offered a gift card, so we will give it another try and hopefully it's better this time around!"}
{"text":"We arrived just after noon on a holiday, and there was no lineup when we got there. When we left there were a few groups waiting. Our server was great, the breadsticks and salad arrived quickly after our iced teas. When that was done the three dishes we'd ordered arrived. Of the three dishes, our kid loved the chicken alfredo, I was fine with the eggplant parmagiana, and my wife liked her tortellini. I usually like the vegetarian options that restaurants offer, but the eggplant was a tasteless paste battered and fried and covered in cheese. Which my kid enjoyed, of course, because it no longer resembled eggplant. 
Another bonus was when we sat down our server offered us a complimentary sample of wine, which we declined, but it seemed like a nice touch. On the down side, the side of spaghetti that came with the eggplant had the most boring marinara sauce ever. But I never order spaghetti. I assume we were supposed to cover it with cheese and salt and pepper, while I prefer a chunkier sauce with garlic, onions and fried vegetables (which we make at home). 
Next time we'll try the pizzas."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative stars . I ordered an appetizer in which the fried calamari was literally white under cooked . I ordered fried lasagna which was burned . I called 2 different reps answered me . The first one told me to hold for a manager the second one told me to call 2 hours later because they where \"super busy \" . What about my meal ? Service and food are disgusting ."}
{"text":"Just got out of here.  I went in here with my Mother and it was busy as they told us that we could wait 25 minutes for a table or we could sit in the bar area right away, so we decided to sit in the bar area as we were hungry.  When we sat, It was freezing and the air conditioner was blowing in our faces.  The hostess said she would have it turned off but after ten minutes it was still blowing at us very strong so we asked to have it to go.  we ordered the mixed grill and chicken alfredo fettucini, both with chicken and gnocci soup.  It took about 25 mins and we left. when we got home we started with the soup which was and looked disgusting.  I had never ever had a complain about olive garden until i came to this location which is very close to where I live.  The soup seemed like it was extremely watered down.  It is supposed to be a white creamy soup but instead it was very transperant and u could tell it was just watered down.  it was soo nasty.  the bread sticks were fine. When i got to my chicken alfredo, it was not blackened like it always is and states on the menu! I was so mad.  It was breaded chicken. like for chicken parmesan which I do not like at all.  

I've been to olive garden a hundred times but this experience made not want to go back for a long time.  I hate the smell of it now and after tasting their food today I am just nauseous.  I ended up giving the entire meal to my dog, which was a shame.  I am giving it two stars because the hostess who was very pretty, (tall, brunette. long hair) gave excellent customer service.  She was so friendly and never stopped smiling."}

{"text":"Worst experience ever at an Olive Garden. My Mom and I walked through the door. Plenty of tables were available yet we were told we'd have to wait 15 minutes. A table of 5 walked in after us and got sat right away. We figured maybe they had a reservation. That was okay. But then another table of 2 walked in after us without a reservation. They sat and waited in the lobby also. But then they got sat before us. So did several other people without reservations who walked in after us. We were completely ignored. We walked out. Never even made it to a table. Terrible hospitality. Why did they even bother to take our name if they were just going to ignore us? They had several tables available and then the hostess totally overlooked us. We will not be back and I will tell my friends and neighbors about this bad experience.

{"text":"Since we're not big eaters, we always love to go there for the endless soup & salad. The service is good....prefer a booth away from the noise...and also enjoy eating in the bar area.
Hubby always orders the warm bread sticks with an Alfredo dipping sauce.   Salad dressing is great too!!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years, but quality has dropped dramatically.  Went a few months ago to use a gift card, and it took an hour for our appetizers to come out, and then they had to remake our entrees (their call, not ours - they hadn't even come out yet.)  Manager was nice enough to comp our bill, which we appreciated.  

This weekend, we went back, as we still had our gift card to use.  Our table and all of them around us had our entrees come out before even the bread sticks and soup arriving.  Server offered to \"wrap them in foil to keep them warm until we were ready.\"  

After this trip, both my wife and I had...digestive issues, to put it nicely.  Doubtful that I will go back."}
{"text":"I am not impressed with Olive Garden at this location. 
On multiple occasions my meals have been sub standard. 
Case in point: On my last visit I ordered the dish LASAGNA. My dish served to me was more like a pile of ground beef with some spaghetti sauce mixed in.
My expectation is that I see layers of pasta, ricotta cheese, blends of other cheese and sauces. Of course I dont expect to see perfect layers, but at least something close.
Next time we will try another location and maybe a different dish ( only because I do like the soups and salad )
I hope this review helps you avoid the disappointment of that location."}

Im glad I've got a yelp account now because i can let future customers know that wait time for a table was to be 15-20mins but ended up being more like 30Mins.

{"text":"Tonight my husband and I ate at the Olive Garden and we got seated by the manager John. He was very helpful and got our drinks right away, we were so surprised. After he brought us our drinks he offered us appetizers then took our order, we didn't even have to wait for our server. What a great manager. He also assisted us and answered our questions regarding our coupon. It was a great start to the meal. 
We both ordered the chicken marsala ravioli it was delicious. We both finished our plates!!!!! Yum!!! We also had dessert my husband had chocolate mousse cake and I had tiramisu.They were sooo good. Overall we both enjoyed the service and the food. We will be back."}
{"text":"I visited this Olive Garden location today, they seemed to not have enough people on staff which wasn't a big deal as it was kind of slow. However the waitress I had was never there and I was without water for almost the entire meal. I ordered the chicken Alfredo for lunch and it was very small for $13. When the waitress did show up at the end of the meal to bring me my check she refilled my glass almost entirely with ice and spilled ice and water all over the table in front of me and didn't even pick it up. I was also only brought four breadsticks the entire meal."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came from Texas to have a visit and had a fancy for olive garden. We go to the one nearest us and the experience was awful. We love olive garden in Texas and didn't expect anything less from home and when we walked in no one greeted us. The couple in front literally had to speak to the host to get their attention and then she noticed us. We sat down and waited about 10 minutes for a drink then about 25 for our food order. The bread sticks were hard and tasted burnt. We got chicken scampi to share and it took about 30 minutes  for it to come out. It was very bland and small portioned. People around us are even complain how terrible the service is. All in all a bad experience."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Olive Garden in years & it was great! If you go to this location make sure that you get Crystal as your server!"}
{"text":"We sat in the bar area our bartender was CJ he took very good care of us!! Great food, great service will be back. Lighting in the bar was very bright maybe lower lights at dinner time other than that was excellent experience !! Thanks CJ!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time ever in my life. Olive Garden is nasty and a disgrace to Italian food. I honestly don't understand how this place is always so packed? Corporate chain I guess. The food is bland, way too salty, and not appetizing at all. 

Another corporate chain fail. Yuck."}
{"text":"After posting on Yelp, a manager from Olive Garden contacted me and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience. They found our check to discover the food that caused the problem. I don't know the result of their investigation, but I appreciate the followup."}
{"text":"Olive garden has gone downhill.  This Nellis Blvd. location had all the wrong stuff. We entered and had a 10 minute wait so went to the bar. The bartender was short with us and didn't care.  At our table our waitress was as helpful as a drive through window. Nothing came to the table until the server was ready to take the order.  Our food was OK but there were flaws that nobody addressed.  The overall experience was that nobody cared."}
{"text":"I went and picked up lunch today, a choose your own pasta with accompanying bread sticks and a salad. Something I've done before. Got all the way back to work to I paid over $3 for 4 slim pieces of chicken and nearly no sauce... just a container of angel hair. A $16 lunch that I could have gone to Carrabas for.  Disappointing I was sooo looking forward to it  :("}
{"text":"Took 10 minutes to get greeted, server forgot our drinks - had to remind her after our appetizers came out, restaurant very cold.  Food had no flavor, etc. Will not be going back!  Also prices way too high for what you get."}
{"text":"Took my parents here tonight and we all enjoyed it!!  Gotta love the endless salad and breadsticks!"}
{"text":"The 5th star that I didn't give is for the long waits!! About 2 years ago my husband started coming to this location.. We had a waiter named kevin and we have asked for him every time we eat at OG which is weekly. He is very attentive to any issues or needs. Now we don't eat here if he's not working... Go in and request his section , you'll b glad u did!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible service...I never had just a bad service at olive garden till I came to this one  even my girl's notice it and they don't like to complain...I'm only given them 1 star just because the food was good...well breadsticks were cold and hard"}
{"text":"Salad is good but that Olive Garden ya know! The bread sticks were burned and hard. Have to say though my hubby and I both got the endless pasta bowl. Mistake. The sauce was null... Almost none so I asked for a little more and just now the waiter brought us one on those boat things of sauce... Bear in mind that it took 13 minutes to get the sauce. Pasta is ice cold. Ill just take it home and heat it in the microwave.Right now I'm thinking that sauce boat better not be on my check...I didn't need a whole darn boat of sauce...good it's not. In all I will just drive the distance to go to the rainbow location!!"}
{"text":"I will never eat at another olive garden again! Thought it would be a great place for my husband's birthday lunch but service was horrible! I came to this olive garden because the one near me has gone downhill also. It was impossible to get drink, bread, or food refills after the first one. We waited so long for everything and all it was, was the pasta bowl and soup and salad. No extra ranch for salad ever came so it didn't get eaten. She even took another table someone else's entire order.  Oh and here's the best part....that new little machine on your table charges your ticket 1.99 up by the drink charges when you touch it! Omg olive garden, wow! You lost my business forever"}
{"text":"I have always had great service at this location, fast and friendly.  The food is excellent.  If you have never had their Zuppa Tuscano soup, you don't know what you are missing."}
{"text":"Let me get this out of the way first, Our server Aryelle was amazing!! She interacted with the kids and carried on conversation with us. Now to the real reason for my review....i have frequented Olive Garden MANY time throughout the years and have always enjoyed it. However, over the last 5 years I have chosen to eat there maybe once a year. This is due to the increasing prices and I no longer feel that the food is worth the exorbident prices. I want to challenge Olive Garden to make their prices more reasonable again...when I pay 12.00 for soup and salad, something is wrong here...i am a buyer so the value of things heavily determines my decision to give you my business. It is disheartening to see this restaurant put the $$ in their account above providing an all around great experience for their patrons at a lower profit margin."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. The sausage stuffed giant rigatoni was really delicious."}
{"text":"So sad that such a well-established brand can be so poorly run.  We'd read the bad reviews of this brand-new Olive Garden, but went to try it anyway.  At 4:45 PM on a Wednesday afternoon, we were seated promptly in a virtually empty restaurant.  TONS of staff in evidence.  Waited 15 minutes for someone to come check on us, take our drink/appetizer orders.  Nothing.  No one.  We walked out, went next door to the Red Robin and had a fabulous experience there.  What is this place (Olive Garden) thinking???  Is every waiter a lazy POS?  SO sad.  Never again."}
{"text":"Olive Garden gets more and more pathetic, each visit! This was the last straw. My wife ordered the chicken parmijian sandwhich full sandwhich, and got the dinner, with pasta. She then corrected the waitress on what was ordered then they brought a half of sandwhich. I ordered the fettuccine calzone with a side of fettuccine alfredo  what  I got was a four inch mini hot pocket with a thimble cup of alfredo sauce on the side! Go figure, after what my wife ordered and they screwed up twice, I decided another 15  minute wait was out of the question.
Their prices keep going up and portions keep going down. I will not visit Olive ( portions), Garden anymore!"}
{"text":"This was your standard Olive Garden restaurant.  The service was nice.  I got the braised beef and tortelloni, which is what I always get and it was good, but not as good as I have had it before at other locations.   The service was quick and the ziosk was nice to quickly pay."}
{"text":"This rating is just based on my experience with the service wich was bad. Was here with my wife and daughters to celebrate a late Valentine's Day since we both had to work and today was our day off together. Food like always was great.. no complaints.. but service not so good. It took close to 40 min to get our soup and salad. We thought they had forgotten about our table. Waiter never came around to atleast let us know something like \"hey I apologize for the wait, we're backed up or something\". I had to ask another waiter for a refill. Than when we finally got our soup and salad.., we had no napkins or utensils to eat... once again I had to hunt down my waiter... I should have just ordered my food to go... like I said food was good but you can't enjoy it plate when everything else is a mess..."}
{"text":"Since this is a chain restaurant the food is basically what it is but this review is on the customer service. We came here for dinner with our 9 yr old and our 5 month old. Our youngest was getting very moody during our salad and we decided to just take our food to go. The waitress was very prompt in getting our food since she noticed how distressed we were. Aside from the waitress the manager and what seemed like the assistant manager stopped by our table to make sure we were ok and assured us that our food will be ready asap.  Great customer service throughout. If we could get our youngest to be patient during a meal we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My niece and I went in for an early dinner the other day and had the BEST service ever! Christie is an awesome server and very attentive. The food is always good here and we've always had a good experience at this location. Kudos to Christie!"}
{"text":"This Olive Garden isn't what it used to be. The server was nice. The soup, salad, and bread Sticks were as good as I remember. The entrées on the other hand weren't. I had the Seafood Lasagna Sautee and my boyfriend had the Steak Gorgonzola Alfredo. The Seafood Lasagna Sautee had an overwhelming odor. I've never had it, I don't know whether or not it's supposed to smell bad or not. The Steak Gorgonzola tasted bad too, still not sure whether it was supposed to. The Overall presentation of these dishes were poor too. When we got home, my boyfriend and I got really sick from the food. What a way to spend our two year anniversary! :/"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a awhile but the line is always out the door and after finally eating there tonight I'm not sure why.  The food is mediocre at best in all honesty it tastes and looks like the food was microwaved.  My girlfriend remarked on our way out that \"the best part of the meal was the after dinner mint\"  Save your money for Carrabba\"s which has much better food."}
{"text":"...wahhhaaa?!?!? What's the meaning of this... My ears must not deceive meh! I want my Pepsi! THERE IS A WALMART ACROSS THE STREET! You guys couldn't buy a 12 pack? The tip we left could've bought two 2-liters bruh!"}
{"text":"Usually a very nice place to eat. I noticed they have raised their prices but hey what can you do? Waiters are always very nice and attentive. Only reason for 3 stars is I ate here On Saturday and underneath our table was a broken salt shaker, there was glass everywhere and I was wearing flip flops.... just kind of scary .
Ok update my server Carson was so great. Kept our glasses full, courteous, professional, welcoming. He was timely and efficient, promote him"}
{"text":"I have been to this location tons of times. Today I will say the food was excellent which is something I haven't seen at this location in forever. Food was on par the only thing that was missing was service. We were left waiting almost 15 minutes just to get a drink order. I got an \"eye roll\" asking for a refill. If you aren't into your job then get the hell out of a role like this. This lady was rude and never came by. Anything I asked for was like the lady was doing me a favor. Food was great but the server was absolutely the worst I ever had at this location. May come back may not. Darken and Olive Garden in general struggles in the stock market and poor servers and experiences like this is probably why. Train people like they want to be there and so will your customers."}
{"text":"Great lunch choice. All you can eat soup and salad. They have three categories to choice from also. Low prices and great service. Never been to this one before, but for lunch? Excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing Food and amazing service. Cynthia was our server and she was the bestest. Must come here if u on town. I ate the classic lasagna and the three choice platter with a salad. Sooooooo ono!! (Delicious) and try thr Green Apple sangria"}
{"text":"I always love olive garden and there endless soup and salad... tried the new  meals not a fan of them but olive garden is a old classic. This one is always busy because its across from the mall so it would be in your best interest to make a reservation if you don't want to end up waiting and hour."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with friends and I can say our server Arianna was fantastic. She was so nice and attentive. Like always breadsticks were awsome. The stuffed mozarella was very good. The salad is nothing new. The same signature salad and soup. The Tilapia with the zucchini was very good. I loved the place we were seated. It was so cozy and away from the busy tables. Only thing missing was that  they did not offer me the free glass of wine they want you to try for you to order a bottle. When I remembered were ready to leave. Darn!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden did a great job. My Server got me in and out quick I was in a hurry. He was very attentive and very prompt. It makes a good experience we can request that you would like your salad and it comes out that way. He kept trying to bring me breadsticks. I had to keep telling him no I'm a fat kid stop teasing me. But have a great sense of humor great service it was even better that he would prepare something that we requested. Good job Olive Garden food was fresh the soup good!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was great.  Service was great too!  I had the chicken and shrimp carbonara, it was delicious.  Our waitress was very tentative and an the ball :-) I have eaten here a few times and would recommend it for a nice lunch or dinner date."}
{"text":"The place is not even busy when we arrived, but took forever for the server to take the order and bring the food out ( over an hour). The table behind us came after us but with different server got their food and left before we got our food. 

The food is horrible too. We ordered two pastas and both of them are over cooked. Seems like the food was sitting out for too long. 

Will never return again!"}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good but it always takes these knuckleheads AT LEAST 20 extra minutes than the time listed to have our food ready which is a major annoyance. Their kitchen operation must be run by the Cleveland Browns. 

Not that difficult to accommodate or make the adjustment but I guess I'm the dumb one who keeps coming back."}
{"text":"Best place ever you won't regret eating here honestly. I had my waiter check up on me constantly. Always helping me with what I need. Everyone their is so sweet."}
{"text":"My service was excellent. My food did not taste like chet. My server went above and beyond by giving me extra breadsticks FOR FREE! I love Olive Garden dis is my Chet."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, service was slow even though it wasn't busy. Drinks took forever, we have to ask someone to refill our drinks. Food was great as always but the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Take everything you know about Olive Garden, all the jokes about how terrible it is and images of ketchup on overcooked noodles.... and remind yourself it's all true.

I forgot for a moment during an intense Italian craving. Of course, the bread sticks were good. Or maybe they were just good in comparison to the awful food. 

Spend $6 on a jar of Ragu & a box of pasta from the grocery store. 

Really though, it's my own fault. I mean, what did I expect?"}
{"text":"I always enjoy olive garden. I had the soup, salad, breadstick combo. They came and offered refills regularly. It's a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I recently visited the Olive Garden location in Peoria. I have to say that this was the absolute worst visit I have EVER had in all of my years dining with this company. My mother and I exchanged our soups do salad as we have done in the past never thinking it was a problem, well we were most definitely wrong! When the server by the name of Adam came back to our table and instead of asking if we would like refills on our drinks, which we needed, he proceeded to pretty much scold us about switching soup and salad plates. He said to us and I quote \"JUST SO you know by switching plates I have to charge you, I knew it was going to happen it happens all the time I normally let it slide while at the table but JUST SO you know if you take any home or ask for refills I will have to charge you\" and it wasn't said in a quite voice either it was said loud enough so that other patrons could hear what was being said. I have never felt so humiliated while dining out ever!! There are ways to word things and get the point across in a polite and professional manner the way he handled the situation was completely uncalled for and very disrespectful. We were so embarrassed by the situation that we didn't even finish eating the soup or salad and requested boxes to box our barely touched dinners. We allowed him to box our dinner to ensure that he knew we weren't going to \"steal\" the remaining soup or salad. This experience has left such a sour taste in my mouth that I will never visit this particular location!! If I could give this location 0 stars for the service I would!"}
{"text":"Unreal order dinner for the family and this was the kids spaghetti there was nothing there .. last time we ordered a To go the salads had no kids no dressing .. disappointing"}
{"text":"Olive Garden is a dependable restaurant with good service.  This particular Olive Garden has an amazing staff member Nicole who we were privileged to meet today.  Professional, polite, kind, caring & a wonderful smile!!  Our drinks were never empty nor were the bread sticks! We will be back & will ask for her station!!!!  Food was very good, atmosphere was relaxed as it is expected, but Nicole made it amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We had time today before a doctor appointment and decided to have lunch along the way. I grew up eating OG as a child and was happy to go for lunch again.

The hostesses made a great first impression by running and opening the door for us before we even got up there. She was very friendly and when we were seated, I asked to change tables because I would rather sit at a booth because of my back problems. She kindly obliged, and was very courteous about it.

Our server was very cheery, made us laugh, and made sure we had everything we needed. I asked to have a different salad, and he accommodated my request.  He was on top of everything. The manager even stopped by to ensure everything was nice.  Everyone seemed to be happy being in customer service and that is very refreshing to see.  I too am in the hospitality business and I can tell that the management is doing what is right to make sure their staff are happy and it reflects in how the staff are with guests.

To corporate, you need to let your employees at this location know that they are appreciated and the smallest details to service with a smile go a long way.

Thank You especially to the kind hostesses and server and food runners for doing a great job."}
{"text":"Let me change my answer... No it's NOT a good place to bring kids!!!! Ever! Please order and take it home to a candlelit patio table for three. I bet that baby would be happier!! Whew .. They read my mind.  

Meat trio was awful if you love rustic spicy strong flavored... Go for it spinach Florentine yummy!  Tiramisu nom nom! Fast service"}
{"text":"We waited a little longer the expected for a party of 8. But James completely made up for it. Even when the steak was accidentally dropped and had to be remade, he was nice enough not to charge us for it. He was genuine and very personable. Thank you James."}
{"text":"We haven't eaten at Olive Garden in 5 years, but my wife saw their ads for Lobster Ravioli. It is my daughter's 15th birthday so we decided to come. So, guess what? 6 o'clock on a Monday and they're OUT of Lobster Ravioli! Seriously?? And what happened to their famous salad? All lettuce and a few tomatoes. I finally found some pieces of red onion (and I mean pieces) at the very bottom. The server did a nice job and the other food we ordered (we WANTED Lobster Ravioli) was hot and flavorful. I guess we'll try again in another 5 years......maybe"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Monday night....slow and sitting at the bar. In order a tall beer after waiting for the bartender to show up (5-6mins). He says okay and proceeds to take care if the two patrons' bills (5-6 mins). He finally starts to pour my draft and the keg blows. He hangs his head as a testiment to the shitty day he's obviously having and tells me, It's gonna be a second. He goes to the back to change the keg (3-4 mins). He comes back out and tells the mgr. and a fellow server that he can't change it correctly. The mgr. goes to the back and successfully changes the keg.
Bartender has to empty three pitchers of foam before it'll pour correctly. He finally brings me a glass of beer dropping with foam. Sloppy.
Then, he puts in my order of a salad to go.This'll be a fun wait."}
{"text":"The worst experience!  We were seated and over an hour later we got our food. It took 20 mins to get drinks and the wait staff was rude and the manager could care less. There were empty tables but the staff was not responsive. 

They tried to make us feel better by offering desserts but in the end the experience was terrible."}
{"text":"Traveled to the Garden around 9 pm on a Monday evening with a group of about 9 friends. 
Upon walking in I was surprised at how empty the place was however we were seated quickly (within 5 minutes) in large separate room. This was a welcome surprise - a plus resulting from coming in at a non peak hour. 
Our server was very patient and helpful when dealing with our inabilities to order food and drinks off the menu effectively. 
As the kitchen was closing up she made sure to get several additional orders of breadsticks in the oven and wow let me tell you these were definitely some of the best breadsticks I've ever had. Every member of our 9 person party had at least 5 breadsticks each, it was truly phenomenal. 
I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo for my entree, it was pretty delicious as usual. The portion was large (over a thousand calories???) but I shared with a friend so it worked out. 

All in all I'd say this is my best experience at Olive Garden ever. Nearly every other experience has been plagued by poor service and non-unlimited breadsticks but I will look back on this time and smile. 
While leaving I grabbed a few mints and they tasted pretty good too. 

Bottom Line : We got pretty lucky with a good server at a time when they weren't pretty busy, don't expect to share in this positive experience."}
{"text":"Been eating here for many years. The food quality has gone down hill considerably. Soups were bland. Entrees sub par. Probably won't go back. 
Our waitress was fine and the service was fine. But the food actually sucked. Very disappointed. We used to love this place. 
There is also a small iPad on every table for kids to use while waiting. Be fore warned they charge you $2.00 if you turn it on. I know $2.00 isn't a big deal, but my beef is they should let you know up front that there is a charge for it. They were gracious enough to take it off our bill, but why cause the inconvenience?"}
{"text":"Order the new Linguini with seafood claimed to be only 560 kcals....They may have had a typo cos the dish was absolutely no less than 1000....Service also mediocre. Not going back."}
{"text":"I love this place, since I started coming here I've become a regular there food is great and service is excellent they stay consistent with both which is why I continue to come."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. I literally have never been treated so horribly. Our blonde waitress was, in no other words, a total \"C\". Honestly. Bob the manager was very nice, but he gave us another waitress who was almost as terrible, and before we even left our prev waitress had a gaggle of others talking smack about me and my table. Then had the nerve to mock us directly, and hassle our table some more. We were rushed, our food AND drinks were wrong, and were told verbatim \"I have a table of seven, so you need to order NOW if you want any food.\" She scoffed any time we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled, and trust me, she never came back to our table so we HAD to ask. We were then attempted to be paid off with a 20$ by Bob, which was completely embarrassing. We never received an apology. Never coming back."}
{"text":"The Olive Garden is one of those chain restaurants that I just can't help returning to for great tasting food at a reasonable price.  It's not always healthy food, but I love Italian-style food in general, and Olive Garden serves some tasty dishes.

Most of the time I go here it is to take advantage of their Soup, Salad & Breadsticks lunch special.  You get as much as you want of each for just $7.95.  Usually I get the Minestrone soup because it is vegetarian, but I have tried the Zuppa Toscana, which is rich and delicious, but also high in calories and cholesterol. 

I only occasionally go in the evening because the dinner menu is more expensive (most entrees are in the $15-20 range), but all the ones I've tried have been very good.  And after filling up on salad and breadsticks, I always end up taking at least half the entree home, so it's like I'm getting two meals for that price.

According to one of the waiters who recently served my friend and me, most of their meat cuts do not contain nitrates, although certain cuts do.  If you want to avoid it, just ask your waiter.  Ours was very helpful. 

Also, for the gluten-sensitive, there are gluten-free menu options.

This is one of the newer locations, and it's often crowded, but I've never had a very long wait or any problems with the service."}
{"text":"Service was atrocious, we were seated for 20 minutes before we were asked about drinks. As a result, we were very thirsty and drank them quickly. Too bad they never asked if we wanted a refill! The breadsticks and salad were good as usual, but the actual meals were awful. They managed to forget the chicken in my chicken Alfredo (LOL), and my girlfriend said her tilapia and zucchini were bland. After our meal, we fittingly had to wait 20 more minutes to pay our bill. The only positive was that our waitress miscounted and gave us too much money back. We came in rather late, so maybe their staff was pissed about that, but overall I would strongly suggest avoiding this location. This was my second time going, and last time was underwhelming as well."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night.  Suzanna is the best waitress ever! Not just because she was friendly and polite like a waitress is supposed to be,  because she went the little extra to make sure we were knowledgeable able our choices and enjoyed our meal.  Thank you! If I could hire her to sell for the company I work for, I would!"}
{"text":"Next best thing to rice is pasta. Server was great and the food was satisfying. Italian margaritas all day!"}
{"text":"Will never go to any Olive Garden again! The waitress says do you want dipping sauce it's extra, we figured maybe 1.00 or so NOT it was 3.79 for each single scoop, maybe 1/4 cup of sauce! You could buy an entire jar! Then at the end she tries to push the end of the table charge device, flips it to face the kids when I say no I don't like those, and of course the kids start touching it and I end up getting charged 1.99! What a scam that is! The food was very expensive as well for pasta and chicken. Will never go to Olive Garden again."}
{"text":"We were trying to get out of Vegas at 9 pm, and they still made us wait for more than half an hour for our food -- and all I was ordering was soup and salad! Since both are pre-made, I don't get that. That said, once we complained to the manager, things sped up, and it certainly wasn't the poor, overworked waiter's fault.  

My wife thought the spaghetti smelled funny so she only ate a little bit. 

On the way back home, we were listening to a James Patterson audio book in which the protagonist (swear to God!) compared a prostitute to Olive Garden \"you would never mistake it for a home-cooked meal.\" Talk about synchronicity!

{"text":"Really dissapointed in the quality of food at Olive Garden. It has been a while since we have come here. I used to love their salad and breadsticks, which did t seem as good as it used to be. They discontinued my husbands mussels and put a less desirable shrimp scampi on the menu. The ONLY reason I gave our visit 2 stars was because of our waitress who was really great. I am dissapointed in you Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I have a warm spot in my heart for this Olive Garden. 

My mom and I have gone to this Olive Garden for years. Everytime I go visit her in Vegas, this is one of the places we have lunch or dinner. 

I think the people that work at this location are extremely friendly, helpful. educated on the menu, give prompt service and are always making sure you leave completely stuffed. 

I think the food is always good.. if you enjoy Italian food. My favorite items are: Zuppa Toscana (soup), Tour of Italy: Homemade lasagna, lightly breaded chicken parmigiana and creamy fettuccine alfredo and the Seafood Portofino. 

One wonderful experience, that springs to mind is... I was there with my mom and she was cold so she ordered some warm water. For the remainder of the meal, the waitress kept bringing her fresh hot cups of water. Whenever my mom's cup got low, a new hot cup of water would appear. We never had to ask for the great service. 

Another time, our waitress saw that my mom was sad and so at the end of the meal, she wrote my mom a \"thank you\" note. She thanked her for coming to her Olive Garden. My mom started to cry because of the nice gesture. She was having a bad day and when she told the waitress, the waitress gave my mom a hug and some extra chocolates. That ended the day on a good note for my mom."}
{"text":"We came to try the breadstick sandwiches. The chicken and meatball were tasty. I feel like the bread should have been toasted a bit more and the fries were underdone. The cheesy fonduta was great, risotto balls were cooked well but could use more internal seasoning. Salad was a bit wilted but passable as its unlimited. Italian mac n cheese was seasoned well and i love cellentani pasta.  Zeppolis were good. The food is like i remember it a year ago - not awful but not great"}
{"text":"Doesn't matter day or time you eat  here. The food is always great espically the lasagne can't ever go wrong for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"We are from California and This was our first time eating at this Olive Garden . We had an amazing time. Our server who was also the bar tender was phenomenal. His name is Nick from Hawaii! The food was great as well. But Nick just made our dining experience so much more pleasurable.  He was very attentive to everyone sitting and eating in the bar area!! Please make sure you let him know !"}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of Olive Garden in general, and my recent visit to this location was just a reminder why.  The bathrooms were dirty.  We arrived around 6pm on Tuesday, could see several empty tables in the dining room, but were told there would be a 20 minute wait.  We ended up not waiting quite that long.  Our server was pleasant enough, but service was very slow.  We waited a very long time for breadsticks/soups/salads, which is a much bigger deal when you're trying to keep a hungry toddler from screaming and ruining everyone else's time.  But our server had disappeared completely between taking our orders and bringing the breadsticks, so we couldn't even request him to bring them first.  Then our pasta were delivered before anyone had finished their soup, so the table was over crowded and our pastas got cold.  The food itself was mediocre.  Not bad, but not good either.  At $10, the never ending pasta bowl is really only a good value if you get several servings of both soup and pasta.  

Overall, we had no problems worth complaining about, but I am not eager to return."}
{"text":"Great place to let the kids go wild but the food was disappointing.  I could have dribbled the meatballs like a basketball they were so rubbery!  What do they cut those things with?  Polyurethane?"}
{"text":"Good food and good customer service. My only complaint is the mini tablets on the table, they are very distracting. I don't want to see any ads while I'm enjoying my meal."}
{"text":"Good cheap Italian food. Very convenient. Good bar selection. Don't expect a five star restaurant and you will be pleased with the quality and price."}
{"text":"My family and I love Olive Garden. I was so relived to have the server we did twice, it allowed us to feel welcomed and being familiar with staff is always a great thing. James was super nice and took time to explain new dishes to us and that was appreciated. We have two little girls and he was super nice and friendly with them which was great. We have only been there a few times but from now on we would like to be seated with him again, it really adds to our dining experience. Great job LV Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"very disappointed in olive garden mentor.my daughter and a group of 25 had reservations for 4weeks in advance,called twice to confirm,on 10 7 15 for home comming .feservation for 5:15 pm .only two out of 25 were served by 7:00 pm,at witch time limo driver wanted to charge the kids more ,dance started at 7:00 pm"}
{"text":"Came to this Olive Garden after a super long 12 hour day of work.. It didn't start out to well due to being busy and I was starving and the hostess was not enjoying the busy pace I'm guessing.. However, after finding open seating in the bar... We enjoyed our time there. Clarissa was not only helpful with getting the table cleaned promptly for us,but she brought us breadsticks right away knowing we were super hungry. She was upbeat and super delightful and even offered us the delicious tea in to go cups. Made the night end on a great note.Thank you to her for that!"}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you know an employee, 5-10 minutes is what we were told, more like 30 minutes. A few parties arrived and said a name to hostess, seconds later and they were seated. This happened a couple times."}
{"text":"Excellent service! So glad we ended up sitting at the bar! Nick and Matthew were a great time!"}
{"text":"Overall it was ok. Extremly disappointed that an Italian restaurant did not have no manacoti of any kind. How can this possibly be. Really. How can you be an Italian restaurant and not have this. SMH. Get with the program."}
{"text":"Took my son and daughter here for lunch today. Our server was great and the food came very fast. My meatballs could have used some basil but the Tuscan soup was great. The dinner bread, salad, and pasta were all fine. Overall the bill was $35 and I added 25% for the server."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i came here for dinner. First time i had ever been here,but he has been before.                                                                                We had a lovely server ,Alissa. She was very attentive and even gave us a sample taste of Merlot.                                                                                       I got a seafood and pasta dish and my date spaghetti and meat balls. They were both fantastic. Both meals come with soup or salad. We both got the soup. Again ,very good! Bread sticks come with the meal as well. The wine list is very extensive and the choices for food are endless.  It was a lovely evening. The bathrooms were clean and well maintained as well. We all know i like that! Hehe"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. To be honest, one star isn't even deserving after the service we got last night. We arrive at 7:45.. Not too busy at that time but we chose to sit at the tables in the bar area. Drinks came promptly, but breadsticks never came? After asking our waiter he told us that we had to order them on the tablet that was sitting on the table. Never have been told this before? Must be new? So we ordered our breadsticks and some Alfredo dipping sauce off there.We also had no silverware or napkins on our table so my friend had to walk around and take some from the bin herself. Now mind you, we had two hungry kids with us! So we place our order around 8:10 and my friend orders soup. The soup and breadsticks come but not the soup that she had ordered..So we wait another 15 minutes for the right soup. At that time they told us they were completely out of Alfredo sauce and had to make more. At around 8:45 we notice everyone around us has gotten their food... And we have not. After our waiter told us 5 times \"it'll only be another 3-4 minutes\". By that time we had a hungry 5 year old asking what takes so long for mac and cheese and that she didn't even want it anymore. Our food finally comes around 9:05!! Seriously an hour after we order? By that time we didn't even want it anymore and asked for to go boxes, our iced tea to go and bags for our breadsticks. Clearly we were irritated and annoyed. After asking our waiter for these items he says \"your gonna have to write this down or something I have bad memory\". Hmm.. Isn't that your job? We got our to go boxes, got told that they were completely out of to go cups.. And never received our bags for breadsticks (which we had to take in the napkins they come tucked in). The arrowhead location continuously has bad service. This is the 3rd time since November I've been and received horrible, horrible service.I will never return to this location and will spend my money wisely somewhere else. The manager and location need to step their game up."}
{"text":"Went here twice during out spring training vacation.   What a great restaurant.  The service was excellent both times.  Both of our wait persons were very personable and went out of their way to ensure that we had great food and great service.   The food was absolutely fantastic.   I had the shrimp scampi both times and YUM!  We also had the lemon cake for dessert.   Very good.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Gluten free menu now on the Ziosk, and the Ziosk says for more information see gluten free menu, server says we don't have a gluten free menu it's on the Ziosk. I'm slowly going crazy. So the  Ziosk first thing for gluten free says \"never ending pasta bowl\", so I order that.... Nope. That ended already and I don't have the button for that. 
I'm now in a death spiral between the server, my wife, and trying to order a freakn meal. 
Salad is soaked in Italian dressing, dripping...
Gluten free pasta: undercooked 
Meat sauce: canned
Sausage: good
Service overall is polite, slow, uninformed, and not willing to get a manager."}
{"text":"Today's dining experience was one fantastic! The food was delicious but I specifically want to recognize my server Semieka. She was friendly, courteous, helpful, and truly made this dinner date very special. She was the definition of excellent customer service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! My waiter was to busy catering to her friends. I literally had to ask for everything."}
{"text":"Went here the other night for dinner. The service was very good. Our waiter was very friendly, funny, and very attentive. Our food came out very quick and hot, and was the taste was superb. The restaurant was very busy, almost thought about going somewhere else, but the wait ended up being just 10 minutes. Wish I would of remembered the waiters name, because his service was excellent. Will continue to go here often."}
{"text":"For way too many years, readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal named the Olive Garden as Best Italian Restaurant. Although it lost its title this year (to Terra Rosa), this place remains the go-to Italian joint for many families -- not just here, but across the nation. And that's too bad. Not that the Olive Garden is a horrible restaurant; it just puts out pedestrian food that's a little more expensive than it needs to be.

Every Christmas, my family and I swap restaurant gift cards. And that's how I end up at the Olive Garden every year. While I usually go to lunch (yes, I do love their soup, salad, and breadsticks combo), this time we splurged on dinner because we had $75 to spend. 

We each had a glass of pretty good wine (Cavit pinot noir for my husband, Evolution white blend for me), although they were a little warm (a common problem at chain restaurants), and we had the aforementioned salad and breadsticks, which were tasty as ever. For our entrees, my husband had the Mediterranean trout, and I had the portobello ravioli. Although I liked my ravioli, there was barely enough sauce to cover the pasta. Why so skimpy? And although the trout was seasoned well (but predictably overcooked), it was served with a tomato and broccoli pappardelle that didn't match the rest of the dish. Not a big fan of fish and tomatoes to start with, but the addition of the broccoli was just weird.

Service was kind of slow, and the food was just so-so. But I finished my meal on a high note, with a tasty Italian margarita. (Love that side shot of amaretto!) And I know I'll be back next year, gift card in hand. Next time, I think I'll stick with lunch."}
{"text":"Worst service we have ever received.  Soup and Salad lunch after lunch crowd gone.  Went at 2 in the afternoon.  They were not busy.  Waitress Dina bought our lunch and never came back for over 28 minutes.  No more drinks, no more soup or salad.  So disgusted with the lack of service we will NEVER go to any Olive Garden restaurant again.  Do not go here If you value your time and money.  25.00 for nothing."}
{"text":"My review of this particular Olive Garden is, unfortunately NOT a favorable one.  My family sat at the corner table in the bar section as we usually have a few beverages before dinner.  It took our server, Camm, at least 20minutes just to get our drink order (remember, we were sitting IN THE BAR SECTION!).  We did manage to get an appetizer within a reasonable amount of time but after that, Camm was nowhere to be found so we could order a second round of drinks and dinner.  We had one of those 'Ziosk' units and did hit the Call Server button but it did absolutely no good.  So we paid for what we Did manage to order (again using the 'Ziosk' unit).  When we were getting up to leave Camm (remember Camm, the server that never was) showed up.  We did tell him that we were leaving due to the lack of service. So we left and went next store to Red Robin where the service was STELLAR."}
{"text":"Good place to go for Sunday lunch!  Servers are more relaxed and do a better job at that time...tried to go here a few times for dinner on the weekend and the way the table arrangements  are with the crowds make it feel like a Denny's restaurant...but I had a great lunch with Salmon today..."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is a great go-to when you really don't want to cook and want to please a majority of your party.  In general though I either end up with terrible service or they are out of dishes.  This time we had relatively good service, though the server seemed to always overlook me when it came to refills but the rest of my party didn't have a problem.  They were out of the manicotti, which several people wanted.  They did come up with an alternative option though, which I was surprised they had a solution instead of just leaving it just at they were out.

Will continue to come here in the future."}
{"text":"Been here on my last two trips to Vegas. AWESOME customer service and above average food, the four stars are for their great service."}
{"text":"I heart OG, what can I say. The food is not 5 star but they are pretty consistent in all their locations. Good luck getting a table at this location though on a Friday night. We usually just head over to the bar area and either eat at the counter or grab one of the tables in that area. We'ver never had to wait more than 5 minutes going that route."}
{"text":"The waiter Leontray was awesome. I just wish the cook at the beginning of the week was as good as the weekend cook. Every time we come to eat at the beginning of week the food is bland and almost always the sauces split. I have the same dish every time I go so I am very familiar with how it should taste. It is the braised beef and tortelloni.  The weekend cook is much better."}
{"text":"I am giving the restaurant over all 3 stars - not the best food- somewhat stale- it's just an average place. 
But the waiter we had was a five star! Ask for him when dinning at this location! It was slammed when we went. Yet he still manage to be quick on his feet alway polite, remembered everyone's name at the table!! Over all he sets the slandered high for what a waiter should/ could do! Ask for him his name was Sudragon! ( SUE- DRagon)"}
{"text":"We eat at Olive Garden all the time.  Visiting Gastonia.  This is the absolutely the worst Olive Garden we have ever been to.  Our order came out burnt.  We sent it back and reordered pasta with Alfredo and it was like water.  You could Literally pour it out of the bowl like milk. We also ordered soup that came out looking like pasta in broth. Instead of the thick soup we are used to getting at Olive Garden. The breadstick were under cooked. Now here is the last straw.  Our waiter walked up to the table and I look up and there is a big drip coming out of his nose ready to drop off so he reaches up and wipes it off with his fingers and then reaches for my plate that I was still eating off of.  I knocked his hand away and said I wasn't done.  Omg.  Are you kidding me I could have puked.  I certainly will be filing a complaint with corporate. UNBELIEVABLE!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. The restaurant was packed and there was a 30 minute wait for a table but we found a spot on the bar. We quickly grabbed a high top table after ordering drinks from the bartender. Our server had about 7 tables so he was busy. When he greeted us we asked for menus as we had none. Our food was slow to come out but it was busy so that is understandable. The food was good our only issue was the long time between getting more breadsticks and my boyfriend wanted a soup refill that never came. He also ordered another beer that sat in the window for about 7 minutes before a server finally brought it to us. During this time the bartender only had 1 person at the bar but she didn't think she needed to run any drinks. Also an expo employee was hanging out at the bar but not helping our server who was clearly in the weeds. Also as people left the tables were not bussed until eventually a host came and cleaned them. A manager walked by and saw the mess and did nothing! 

Towards the end of our meal we got our check after trying to pay on the kiosk at the table which had the wrong check on it. If a restaurant wants to have this technology they need to make sure guests can use it. 

The tables around us were also upset at the bad service and were complaining to the manager. His exact words were \"sorry for the bad service the server was busy\". That is absolutely unacceptable when the manager saw the server was busy earlier and did not help him!

We left without complaining since clearly the manager didn't care. 

Our poor server did the best he could but he was clearly oversat and had no help from his management or other employees."}
{"text":"Come here if you want to be poisoned!!!!!
Ate Olive Garden 2 days ago, about 8 hours after eating it I starting having gas then more gas which ended up being diarrhea and had that for a few hours until I started feeling nauseated. I threw up all over my floor and almost passed out. I had diarrhea 13 times yesterday and threw up 6 times. I didn't sleep that night. Today I am still nauseated but haven't thrown up anymore and had to run to the bathroom all day today as well having diarrhea about 8 or 9 times as of writing this. DO NOT eat Olive Garden at concord mills their food is contaminated.

I have also wrote this review to google as everyone needs to see this!

EDIT: Went to the doctor and confirmed that I got the Norovirus from this food."}
{"text":"Went here for there lunch all you can eat soup and salad. 

The soups were good. The salad we had is alright. There is only one choice for salad.

I like our server. He is prompt, polite. He made sure we got all our needs. Hopefully there are more servers like him. 

Will come back here again"}
{"text":"My soccer team was in Madison for a tournament the weekend of the Iron Man. We needed a place that could accommodate a large group, 35 of us at 8pm.  I went in the day of the dinner to see if they could help me.  Olive Garden has a back room that we used, which was perfect.  We had two servers that were very nice and patient with this large group, 16 year old girls and their parents.  They did keep the girls happy with bread sticks before our orders came out.  The food came out pretty quickly considering the size of the group. Everyone was happy with their order.  The two waitresses were great and they gave us separate checks - player & parent.  We found out when we left that they had served another soccer team earlier that evening in that room."}
{"text":"Oh boy, very good....LOL I remember we used to get bread stick and free salad back those days. It has been 12 years I haven't been back to OG , so I asked my wife where she wanted to go eat, so she tells me lets try OG again. Well, I said ok lets check it out ... we had a bad experience last time in CA. So we went , different times and place. I could say it was very good, she got her seafood pasta dish and I got the 3 portion Lasagna , Pasta and chicken. My girls got their pizza. I will go back to try other dishes.."}
{"text":"Went to this location on Thursday Dec 29 with a party of 4. Service was ok at best. With a few sad exceptions. After getting our drinks we waited for at least 20 min for bread sticks they came out with the salad (they brought out the salad and bread sticks for 4 other tables by us at the same time). The salad had no croutons or pepperoncini on it. They brought only 4 bread sticks I guess the thinking was 1 bread stick per person. We immediately asked for more and he quickly brought out 6 more. The entrees soon arrived and my parmesan crusted chicken with tortellini was very good. My wife ordered the herb grilled salmon it was overcooked dry and flavorless. We flagged down a passing waitress  (ours was not around ) and sent it back. After a short time the Manger stopped by and said \" I hear their was a problem with the fish\" we said yes it was overcooked to Which he replied \"another one will be out soon\" that was all he said. This is probably the worst handling of a problem by a Manger I have ever experienced I'm not sure why he bothered to come by. About 25 minutes later the second salmon showed up fresh off the grill and piping hot however I think it was on the grill for 20 minutes another fail dry and tasteless. The waiter took it off the bill the absolute least thing they could do. I don't think we even got a proper apology. The Manger didn't bother to stop by a second time so at least we were spared another dismal visit with him"}
{"text":"We all know what food to expect from Olive Garden and that's why I love it.  Consistent quality and food I think is delicious (I know some people disagree on that part).

However, today's review is really about the service.  I was feeling like Olive Garden but just wanted it to-go so I called in a pick-up order.  Kalley was the server who answered the phone.  I had seen the order one and take one special on Yelp and in their e-mails so I asked if it was available on to-go orders or only dine in.  First nice surprise - available on to-go orders. Kalley then took the time to explain the 5 dishes featured on the special and what each contained.  She gave me all the details and didn't rush at all.  I could hear in the background that they were busy but she didn't push me into picking the first item so she could get off the phone.

Additionally, after taking my order Kalley asked if I would like both dishes hot or if I was saving one for later and offered to give it to me cold so I could put it straight in the refrigerator for lunch tomorrow...great idea!

I was told 15-20 minutes for the food and they had it waiting for me when I arrived.  Kalley had three other people arrive for pick-up at the same time but had us all checked out and out the door with our lunches within 5 minutes and did so with polite conversation and a smile.  

It's not that the service is usually bad here but this was an especially good experience!  Thanks Kalley!"}
{"text":"We went here recently was surprised it was not as busy as usual - Server was fine and the hostess but the food was awfully bland and tasteless.
The Marinara sauce was so plain with no salt or spices . We may just have been served canned tomatoes. Salad was ok the first time but when we ordered a second bowl the server did not ask about the cheese nor were there peppercinis or onions. Just plain lettuce. Wont be going back again too soon,,,,,"}
{"text":"Run away before stepping inside this location!  I hadn't been to an Olive Garden in 30 years and it would be another 30 before the next time.  Before one bite of food, you will be so turned off by the level of noise, kids screaming and running loose, filthy carpet and stupid wait staff.  Frozen bag Italian would have been better but not here because they would have overcooked it.  For nearly what we paid my husband and I could have gone to a real Italian restaurant and had great food and ambience.  I'm told the one on West Bell Rd. is much better but I'm not willing to risk it."}
{"text":"We had a very large party for our grandmothers 95th birthday. Amy and Brandy were fantastic servers. The food was perfect and they did not rush us at all. They made my grandmother feel very special. Thank you to all the staff."}
{"text":"Our server was extremely accommodating, and that is more than half the experience for my picky, needy self.  She was happy to substitute the eggplant parm in place of the chicken parm so we could split the tour of Italy and each have what we wanted.  Also, Alicia was on-point with our refills, timing between courses, (we weren't rushed through lunch) and numerous special requests.
As for the restaurant itself, this Olive Garden is newer and nicer than any I have ever been to.  The food was delicious and up to the usual par of Darden Restaurants.  Now, if I could only find a way to get them to have better quality lettuce.....I would be willing to pay more."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonight with the kids. As usual the food was very good.

Right now they have a special deal going where you order two entrees, one to dine in and another entrée to take home. My husband and I both got this. I got the Italian duo and decided to take home a shrimp dish my hubby got the Parmesan crusted chicken and took home the spaghetti. 

Our server did very well and took care of us (and sometimes that's not easy with two young kids!) I don't know about he rest of you but I prefer male waiters, they seem to do a better job, just my opinion.

Anyway, we go to this Olive Garden all the time and we only had a bad experience one time so that's pretty good. I know the Olive Garden gets a bad rap among italian restaurants but we really like this one!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden always hits the spot. Went in for quick lunch today and the service was quick and efficient. Ashley M was my server today and was excellent, she took my drink/meal order right away! She brought out the salad and hot warm breadsticks (my favorite) Ashley was on top of her game the whole time as soon as she saw my raspberry lemonade get about half ways she was right around the corner with a pitcher.My meal was also delicious! I also like how the manger came around to my table to ask if everything was okay and if I was satisfied with my meal. Good customer service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is what it is. Nothing special. 

I had the Eggplant parmesan, it was ok, nothing to go ape crazy over. 

For dessert I had the \"dark chocolate carmel\" something or other. SO not worth the cost, whatever it might have been. I tasted nothing of dark chocolate, or even caramel. 

Basically, I give Olive Garden a complete.... EHHHH."}
{"text":"I often travel for work and I've been to numerous Olive Gardens around the nation and this is one of my favorite locations.  The food is always consistent here.  I have been to other OG's and sometimes the noodles were overcooked or the food wasn't steaming hot.  

My only complaint is that parking setup is pretty bad here.

The staff here is all very friendly and personable.  They are always efficient and happily accommodate specific food item modifications.  I know it is a chain and out of their control, but I wish they would let you get soup and salad with your entree instead of one or the other..."}
{"text":"After my complaint, the corporate office contacted me and offered a $25 gift card. That was nice. But what really made the difference for me, was when Mark the general manager called me directly to apologize and wanted to know who my service was with so he could use it as a coaching experience. These are the qualities of good leadership. Since then my family has been back several time and always had a good experience. Thank you Olive Garden for putting in the effort to continued good service."}
{"text":"Manager Amy was such a rude person, un-professional, un-willing to help & very complex when asking a simple question!!! She even lied to me! All I called for, was to ask if they were affiliated with any food delivery service(UberEats;DoorDash;etc) she said, \"We are not a part of ANY of those companies, they don't work for us! They might pick up food for people, but they are NOT through Olive Garden!\" 

Again, I repeated my question, and she started an argument with me!!!! Now this was absolutely where I had to draw the line!! She was so nasty, I hung up on her! She was NOT HELPFUL AT ALL & I DID NOT DESERVE HER VERBAL ABUSE!!!

Come to find out, they deliver with Postmates!! So not only did this awful person lied to me, but she verbally abuse me over the phone, when all I wanted to know was a simple question. I wanted to support their business, but have food delivered, and this is a treatment I get???? You've got to be kidding me!!! 

This Amy grouch, clearly doesn't like her job and is an unpleasant person to be in contact with!! In this type of business, NO ONE deserves to be treated that way and 

I WONT BE DONG BUSINESS WITH OLIVE GARDEM AGAIN NOW BECAUSE OF IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night expecting a long line.  We were able to get two seats together on the bar right away and got served our drinks almost immediately.  We took advantage of their current $12.95 special and ordered the Bucatini and Chicken Toscano.  The risotto that came with the chicken was horribly undercooked.  What would Gordon Ramsay say?  We told the bartender/server staff about it and asked them to let the kitchen know.  I'm assuming their risotto is cooked in batches with precooked rice so the whole batch would be \"crunchy\".  The male bar porter came up and offered a choice of Alfredo or marinara dipping sauce for the bread already in front of us.  We said marinara, please.
The short story?  The check came and nothing was taken off for the undercooked risotto that we never ate and sent back.  The offer of the the marinara sauce cost us $4.00 which the bar porter neglected to mention.  I think this restaurant is going through start up problems.  I think we'll wait awhile before going back."}
{"text":"First off got there at 8pm, waiting to be sitted until 8:20pm was asked for our order two minutes after we sat down (no time to look through the memu). Asked the server for a little more time ( He didn't come back until 8:55pm.. and yes I was checking the time on my phone). He came back asked us about drinks and left again. Came back with our drinks at 9:05pm. Then asked if we are ready to order. We told him our order and he went and did something, then went and assisted another group of people.. asked them for their drinks and had them out in five minutes asked for their order. Went and put it in the system then brought out their breadsticks and salad. (Hello where's ours). Then he came back to our table and gave us ours. And then at 9:45pm we were given our food. It had no taste, and cold.. At 10pm we told the server that we wanted the  togo containers and that took him 15minutes to get. ( I get that there's other customers but we were there and sitted before they were).  Finally got out of there at 10:20pm. So from  8:20pm to 10:20. We're there and didnt wanna be. Two hours.. everybody around us changed twice as we were waiting. ( excuse my language but) that's BULLSHIT!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated immediately.
The dining room was not too noisy,
the service was prompt,
and the pace of the meal was good.
The server and the lady who delivered
the entrees both did a good job.
The food was tasty and the portion size
was adequate."}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars because of how the management handled my customer issue. Karen the manager was absolutely wonderful I wrote them on their website and she got back to me right away. Awesome customer service handled problems immediately."}
{"text":"So,  years ago my husband and I tried OG in upstate NY and were very disappointed. 
I recently tried it again with my sister in law and very much enjoyed the soup-salad-breadstick deal. 
The zuppa Toscana is my favorite! 
One question I have is \"who\" test drives the new menu items before making them available to the public? 
The pasta nachos seemed intriguing but when they arrived it was an aweful rendition,  I'll stick to eating nachos elsewhere. 
My nephew had the lasagna and loved it! It's a tough decision for me to eat Italian out however,  I may just order something other than soup/salad on my next visit! 
I'm happy it's close to home and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This Olive Garden leaves me very confused. Went here two weeks ago and the food was as good as any other Olive Garden I've had. However, yesterday we went with a larger group and the food that my girlfriend and I got (Mixed Grill and Chicken Alfredo) was really subpar. I don't know if this is because it was a Friday night and they were rushing the food, or some other reason, but it was really disappointing.

The service was good (even though the waiter was a bit awkward). The restaurant also seems a bit worn compared to other Olive Gardens I've visited."}
{"text":"As soon as they let people make reservations and not have a family with 6 children having to wait 30plus mins I will give them review on their service.

Trying to make more money by not taking reservations is actually extremely horrid. When making money is more important than guest service then they will not receive good reviews. Yes I am not stupid and do understand why you guys wouldn't take reservations on busy evenings"}
{"text":"The NEVER-ENDING pasta bowl SCAM! 

Two weeks after getting out of the hospital, my husband took me to dinner at Olive Garden. We each ordered a never-ending pasta bowl. Mine was chicken fettuccine. My husband ordered lasagna. However, the drama was never-ending, not the lasagna. 

Our waitress was slow and not very good. But, that wasn't the main problem. My husband's a hard working man. He wanted a second piece of lasagna. I no brainer, right? Not so fast. The waitress brought out the second helping of \"lasagna\" in a small bowl. 

The second serving of \"lasagna\" was not a nice square piece. Rather, it was a bowl of goulash leftovers. My husband and I explained to the waitress this was unacceptable. My husband wanted a second piece of square lasagna, like the first. 

The waitress took the goulash back. She returned with a second small bowl of goulash leftovers. My husband I both compared it to a dog dish. Then, the man at the table behind my husband turned around and put his hand on my husband saying, \"calm down, buddy.\" My husband told him, \"Don't put your hands on me.\" I said, \"let's go.\" 

We attempted to head to the front of the restaurant to pay the bill away from this confrontational patron. The manager, Shawna, blocked our path. She said, \"you have to pay your bill.\" We both clearly stated, \"we will pay our bill.\" We wanted to move to an un-confrontational area to do so. 

However, rather than taking us to the front or the bar, anywhere away from the confrontational patron, Shawna kept us blocked in the middle of the dining area entry. This was a very unprofessional handling of a situation which could have been resolved with a square piece of lasagna. 

Shawna and Francisco, both managers, insist the goulash serving is part of a business model. 

SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, on Olive Garden! 

Yours truly,

The Annis Family"}
{"text":"Waitress had us waiting over 10 minutes and it wasn't even busy. Then waited 30 minutes for our bar drinks. They came after salad and soup. Told the manager, Shawn, and he didn't even really care. Poor management for sure!  Won't go back to that location."}
{"text":"Friday night 6 PM - definitely a wait for a table.  Pretty much the standard at Olive Garden. I was pleasantly surprised to find seating at the bar area.  It was actually quite comfortable sitting and eating there vs getting a table.  The service was outstanding and I would do it again.  I had the fried mozzarella - it was good but the taste was standard.  The menu has plenty of items for everyone and most are pricy well for me since I am on a budget.  Most meals are over $15.00 a person.  I was able to find a happy medium.  $9.99 Pasta - build your own and unlimited salad/breadsticks.   I chose cheese ravioli- with meat sauce.  Sure, you can add meatballs or sausage but it's a few dollars extra.  Not a bad meal for $9.99.  The dish was in my price range and was ok.    Overall good visit.. three stars . . Thanks Olive Garden"}
{"text":"The OG, also known as Olive Garden.  I've been to this establishment a lot when I was a kid, but now that I'm older, I don't care for it too much, but my fiancee actually loves this place.  She is a huge fan of their soups, bread sticks, and salad.  So usually I'll order an entree and she get the the other stuff.  Pretty standard here, they have a variety of different pasta dishes and stuff, nothing too fancy.  I usually order the Tour of Italy or get the spaghetti and meatballs.  They do have good Alfredo sauce though, usually dip bread sticks into them.

I don't know why, but I don't like dining at Olive Garden, if I do eat it, its mostly carry out.  I usually stay away from big chain restaurants, but what my lady wants, she gets."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this location a star was because I had to. Called to make reservations for 8. Was told by the recording that for any reservations to go to their website to be added to the waitlist. Once we went to the website it stated that for any parties over 6 you needed to contact the restaurant via phone. When we called the restaurant they told us that they could not accommodate a party of 8 on Sunday nights. Called another location and they told us to come right down it was no problem at all. Called this location again and spoke to a manager who said she would get us a table but it would be an hour and a half wait. But we had already been on the phone back and forth for a half an hour. With all that being said that's pretty confusing right? My thoughts exactly. Clearly we ended up going to another location 10 minutes away that was able to seed us almost immediately."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason Im giving this place 4 stars is because of our server, Raul. I understand when a restaurant is busy so the 30min wait for a table is totally fine. But with 3 bartenders behind a half empty bar, and to not be greeted for 10min because they are too busy giggling, is rude. And to basically toss a recite in my direction after 5min, also rude. No, \"how are your drinks?\" or \"can i get you another round?\" or \"would you like to transfer your check or close out here?\"  Little do they know that Im a bartender myself AND a good tipper!...RUDE.

But the second we sat down, everything went wonderful. Food was ok, but Raul made the experience worth it. Its not very often you get fine dining experience at an olive garden. We will be back JUST to sit with him."}
{"text":"I love this Olive Garden!  The food is always amazing as are our servers. Never had a bad experience thus far...my favorite thing on the menu is the Chicken and Gnocchi soup #HomerSimpsonDrool"}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner. 
My husband ordered the fettuccine alfredo and I did the rosemary garlic chicken. 
My husband ate about 1/4 of his meal, and his stomach started to get really upset. He waited a bit, then took a few more bites and his stomach got worse. 
My chicken was pretty good. It was light and flavorful. 
My husbands stomach was still pretty upset until mid-afternoon today. 
Probably going to stay clear of this Olive Garden from now on."}
{"text":"My lunch d8 & I had an ALL AROUND 1DERFUL experience here 2day & I'm so glad we randomly decided 2 give this new loc8ion a try!!  The atmosphere was even nicer than their old 1 (which is now Hooters), ALL employees & manager(s) were EXCELLENT, busy tending 2 guests & making sure everything was gr8 ESPECIALLY our server Michael B & of course everything we consumed was SUPERB!! 

   I started w/ some fried zucchini & they had a sampler platter w/ stuffed mushrooms, chicken fingers & mozzarella sticks. Then I had the minestrone soup w/ salad & bread sticks & my friend got the chicken parmigiana. 4 dessert the wild berry cake had 2 b sampled which we shared & they also ordered the choose 3 Dolcini's: Amaretto Tiramisu, Limoncello & Dark Chocol8 Caramel Mousse. EVERYTHING DELECTABLY DELICIOSO!! MMMmm mmm good (not talkin' Campbell's either)...

   We were there nearly 2 hours catching up & never felt rushed while thoroughly enjoying all the offerings. I have NEVER BEEN SO IMPRESSED w/ the staff @ an establishment!! Not only was our w8er AMAZING in EVERY facet that a server can b, but we were checked on by @ least 1 manager & even had 2 other people occasionally helping by refilling our drinks, serving our appetizers & even a bus person when we were near leaving who cleared our table of dessert dishes & was such a sweet young man, I wanted 2 leave him a tip 2 if I had more cash on me. 

   What AWESOME teamwork, we didn't have 2 want or really w8 4 anything the whole time we spent there!! We noticed every1 else being tended 2 in the same REMARKABLE fashion & even a large party b~day celebr8ion next 2 our booth w/o any surrounding tables falling by the wayside. Will defin8ly b returning & if u find urself on this part of town, I highly recommend this Olive Garden & ask if there's a table in Michael B.'s section if he's working when u go!!..."}
{"text":"Not many choices like there used to be. Services were great. Seems like they remove the dishes I liked."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is nothing special. The only thing I come for is salad and breadsticks, I just wish once they'd shock me with a great meal. Tonight was not that night. The middleburg location just always seems to disappoint. I ordered cavatappi with 5 cheese marinara it tasted fine, but it was luke warm at best. Waiter seemed like he was in a rush, after we waited 10 just for him to initially come over. My bf order soup instead of salad and we had to remind him, as well as ask for dipping sauces they forgot to bring out with the appetizer. We won't be back to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I lived in Hawaii for so many years and was deprived of all the Olive Garden goodness there is, or maybe it's just because I love me some Italian-esque food -- but I'm a big fan of the Olive Garden. Each time I've visited this location, I've had excellent service, was served quickly, and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Wine sample? Don't mind if I do. Buy-one-entree-for-dinner-and-get-another-one-for-lunch-tomorrow? Yes, please. And don't even get me started on their soup, salad, and breadsticks - YUM YUM in my tum. 

If you haven't visited an Olive Garden, stop reading right now, get up, and go get yourself some delicious eats. The end."}
{"text":"I reserved a table for a party of 8, when we arrived the hostess called us to be seated. So we followed her to some corner where she started rolling silverware, confused so I looked around and noticed another hostess  named Jocelyn about 8ish feet away staring at us. I asked her if she was seating us she said yes. So we followed her to our seat. Jocelyn was very unfriendly and maybe was having a rough day, when we got to our table I noticed two slings so I asked her to take one away and she responded with, \" you requested two slings\" which I didn't. I asked for two high chairs she stomped away and and brought them. Then didn't remove any chairs and left the high chairs in the middle of the walkways for me to figure out where to place. No manager came out and asked how we were doing even after I explained to our server our first impression was, so i may not be back at least for a while. I'm giving Olive Garden a decent review because our server Dino did a great job and the food was good."}
{"text":"Always amazing service when I come here! Bread when we're out, refills, and soup/salad always amazing! I've never had a bad experience here. Plus food is always speedy and nice and hot. Love this Olive Garden so much! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The manager contacted me directly. Was very apologetic and offered to do anything he could to make the situation right. I told him that the call alone was enough. He said to ask for him the next time we came in and he would comp our meal. We have been back, but we didn't take advantage of the free meal."}
{"text":"This review is for the take out on line ordering and to go counter at Olive Garden in Scottsdale Arizona. 

Ordered on my phone. Didn't have to register or make yet another password. Easy to navigate menu with pictures and everything organized so you can find what your interested in fast. Super easy to say at the end if you'd like a salad or soup (comes with the entrée). Also asks how you'd like your steak. Tells you where to go for pick up once you're in the restaurant and let me pay online. 

Once I got to the restaurant I saw the pickup counter at the right side of the bar but the host that greeted me took my name and showed me the way anyhow. The host let the server know I was there early and the server put my order in sooner than the pick up time I requested. He also gave me a complimentary soda while I waited which wasn't long. 

Food was great and hot. Good portions. Order was correct and each item was wrapped individually in a good sturdy bag. Breadsticks come with everything. Yum. I had Gorgonzola Beef and the artichokes. It was great. More than I could eat in one meal. Under 30 and two meals in one."}
{"text":"I took my BF here for lunch on his Birthday. Our waitress Jenn was the best. We look forward to going back and sitting where she is serving. Thanks Jenn for making his day Great"}
{"text":"I'd give no stars for crappy attitude and  service if I could. The only reason we're still here is my mother in law loves Olive Garden and is visiting from a small town in Montana where she has to drive 2 hours to get to one. We walked in at 3 pm to a nearly empty restaurant. See photos. Got seated eat a tilted table in the intersection by the drafty walkway where everyone walks by and  brushes up against my husband's chair as they go by. I asked the seater if we could have a table next it across from it--anywhere else! She said um, no. Huh??? 

The service by the waitress was fine, but our Saturday dinner out was already unnecessarily uncomfortable because of this unreasonable attitude by the young hostess. Won't be back. Too many other Italian places all around."}
{"text":"04/15/2016.I see a lot of reviews saying slow service and tasteless food. Well we must disagree completely. My wife's best friend invited us to a late lunch at Olive Garden in Monroe. Not expecting a big deal just friends and lunch. Well was I surprised . First they had a special buy one meal and take one home starting at 12.99. I'm like OK must be small portions, wrong not small. Then you choose from unlimited soup or salad and bread sticks. I had the Chicken Gnocchi ( delicious ) then I had the Zuppa Toscana  both out of this world.My main dish was Sausage Rigatoni. Well I'm not going on and on about what we ordered there was a lot of food involved and it was wonderful.I believe The most important thing for any meal is the service and it was awesome. A special thanks to Yalonda H, She was very attentive, polite and hospitable. When serving us everything was on Que never late never early. It was like she knew what we wanted and when we would want it, fabulous. This is top of the line service my friends. So all I can say is give it a try and ask for Yalonda H and be prepared to enjoy a tasteful and relaxing meal. For Service, Quality and Cleanliness I rate this Olive Garden FIVE STARS  Thanks,  The Food Dude ."}
{"text":"I usually don't Yelp about restaurants, but my experience last week was inexcusable.  I ordered pasta with Alfredo and chicken (extra cost $4.59.).  I had three tiny strips of chicken the size of my ring finger.  Really for $4.59 extra I should have had a plate full.  The ratio of pasta to chicken was ridiculous. The manger said I could order more chicken (since I paid the additional $4.59 I could have all the chicken I wanted).  That's your answer?  Very disappointing.  Won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"We ordered a tour of italy. The chicken parm was almost burnt and greasy. The fettuccini noodles were hardened and stuck together like they had been sitting out.  While I was eating it i found a couple shards of shrimp in it! Which was not a huge deal to me because I am not allergic to it, but if I was it could have been bad! Our waitress, Joy, was so sweet and apologetic, unlike management. They first said it was melted mozzarella, then another manager said it was marinara! I have never felt so insulted. I know what shrimp looks, feels, And smells like and it was shrimp, even the waitress agreed. So if you have food allergies, do not come here! If you believe the customer is always right, do not come here. There are so many better Italian restaurants! Go to oreganos across the street."}
{"text":"Since it was my daughter's first day of PreK we told her she could choose whatever she wanted for dinner. She picked Olive Garden. She chose it not for the all you can eat soup, salad and breadsticks or wide variety of pasta dishes...she chose it because she wanted to play games on the tablet located on every table. Whatever the reason, we took her to Olive Garden. 

The service was good. Food was fine. And many games were played on the tablet for $1.99. I thought it was kind of annoying that they nickel and dime over \"dipping sauce\" for breadsticks... An additional cost for scoop of marina? Okay..."}
{"text":"Our waitress was super nice! Foods always great! 
We had lasagna with the white sauce and chicken, I had the shrimp scampi! Sooo good.
Vanessa was our waitress super sweet girl!"}
{"text":"Really not empressd with this store service was lame we waited seems like 10 min before the waitress came never apologize for the wait food was some what ok but dry. When we got our salad it had more crutons than lettuces I believe the best thing about my meal was the water"}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden. Always a wait & always, always busy. I really only go for the salad & zupa toscano if the truth be told. Recently as in the last 3 years the breaksticks have taken a big dive down or that would be on my fave list. The entire fam have their go to meals here so that can't be bad right? Right! So go forth & enjoy their tried & true dishes."}
{"text":"My friends brought me here for my birthday. The food was delicious as always. Our waiter was funny and very attentive. I ordered the chicken margarita dish! I also got a free tiramisu for my birthday! So good I love coffee flavored anything. Only negative I would say is the silverware didn't look as clean as possible. Some water stains or scuffs I'm not sure. But I love Olive Garden and the endless bread sticks!"}
{"text":"Taryn was excellent!! Delicious meal. Pumpkin cheesecake was great!! Wonderful night!"}
{"text":"Had Olive Garden in Champaign, IL provide the food for a large birthday party. While they call it catering, they do not serve the food. Also, while they deliver within the twin cities, they would not deliver to Rantoul. So, while this was not catering but rather \"To Go\" ordering, they did an absolutely 5 star job of getting us the food we needed at the best price. Schandra is their lead caterer. She is an absolute joy to work with. While they have great catering offers on their web site, she is/was very willing and able to tailor their product to our specific needs and work the alternatives to get us the best price. And, the order was ready on time!  We needed our order at noon on Saturday. We showed up at 11:50 to find the bar completely covered with our order. Six people showed up and we were loaded and driving away at 12:01. Finally, the large order was all wonderfully prepared and totally complete with all condiments, dishes, cups, napkins, seasonings, mints, and utensils needed to serve and eat the meal. We needed to organize this party from out of state and the Olive Garden in Champaign helped make our party a total success. Good job; well done guys!!!"}
{"text":"Came on a week night with my son. They have what I call the E Waiter in each table. You can order, see some menu items, play games and more on a mini tv device. I was able to log in my rewards acct and use some points to get a free appetizer. Our calamari was overcooked and the server noticed and took it away for some that was better. My son was able to get the chicken and shrimp carbonara with fettuccine noodles instead of the traditional spaghetti noodles for no extra cost. Everything else was good and our server was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Olive Garden has decent Italian food but this area is quite ghetto. Just wear a bullet-proof vest and your dinner should be delicious."}
{"text":"This location used to be great.  But something's gone downhill over the past couple years, and I suspect it's the management.  The staff is not being properly trained and at times they are woefully understaffed.
 For example, at my most recent visit I ordered the Steak Gorgonzola Alfredo. I've order this since it was introduced to the menu, and when first introduced it was very good.  This latest one, however, was thrown together haphazardly as if the cook either wasn't trained properly or just didn't care.  The steak was supposed to be medium; instead it came well done.  The pasta was a bit dried out at the edges, as if the whole plate had sat a while under heat before serving. ( That might also explain the meat being overdone).  The Alfredo was minimal and seemed to have been ladled onto one section of the noddles, not mixed throughout.  And the balsamic reduction, instead of being placed over the meat as it should have been, was also off to the side on some of the fettuccine noodles only. So it's as if the cook knew the parts that had to be present, but didn't care at all how they were put together and just threw things on the plate. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Well, the food was great, but the service was not there. It's been a few weeks now and I'm just getting to the review. My apologies. So, I took my wife to this location for the one date night we get every 90 days and almost immediately regretted it. We enter the building and the woman who greeted us seemed almost \"too busy\" to bother greeting us probably, so she just quickly moved us on, and had another woman take us to our table. This woman didn't feel it was needed to bother with us either. Before we could get a word out, she was gone. No words, just a disappearing act. We waited for about 5 minutes before a woman came back and took our drink order. She was nice and polite. She was our server. This girl was knowledgeable, outgoing and friendly. I asked her if they were super busy or something and she said they weren't. I asked because of how the other two employees acted toward us. So, that just made the matter worse for me. But, I figured we had a decent server, so whatever. I usually enjoy Olive Garden, but this was a very off trip. I hope it was just an off day at that location."}
{"text":"Used online waitlist option whereby showed almost a 2 hour wait. Got to restaurant and name was dropped despite being within the hour. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch had a good time. Our waiter was the best. He provided excellent customer services. I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"As good as any other Olive Garden. 
Love the salad and food.
Waiters are cool. 
Tables are kinda crowded"}
{"text":"One of my friends and I were headed to a movie and we wanted to grab a quick bite to eat. The frustrating thing about this area is the lack of food choices that are quick. 

We walked in at around 645 PM on a Thursday and it was packed. The hostess didn't greet us, she just let out a solemn \"30 minutes, name?\". We asked about bar seating and they said that it was first come first serve. At that point we saw two seats open up. Boom, we were in business. 

We sat down and ordered a couple glasses of wine. The bartender was busting his ass. He had a full bar and he was making drinks for the rest of the restaurant. He took the time to recommend two other bottles of wine for us and even gave us a half glass to try! We naturally did the all you can eat salad and my lady friend did the soup. I had an awesome Parmesan Crusted Shrimp dish.

In truth, I normally don't write reviews for chain restaurants unless it's a bad experience. The waiter that helped us was so impressive that I opted to write this one up.

Service was 5 stars and food was 4."}
{"text":"Good clean location.  Very accommodating with take out orders.  Would recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience here:

My husband ordered the only filet on the menu. He said he wanted it well done. Came out not only late, but blood red inside. My husband is not the type to send food back, but he sent this one. The MGR came over and asked what was going on. We showed him our steak and even he was like \"yeah, send this back.\" 

So a good 20 mins later, his steak comes out. The manager brought it and says \"OK cut into this one--I want to make sure it's cooked correctly. We do, and again it's blood red. My husband and I just laugh because it was so awkward and the manager legitimately thought the steak looked ok so he was all \"alright everything good?\"  \"No\" we respond. But this time my husband says \"never mind, I will eat my wife's leftovers\". At this point, the manager could tell it just wasn't working so he says \"so sorry! Let me bring you dessert! And obviously you don't have to pay for the steak.\"  Again, thanks manager for your attention but this is where it really gets bad. 

15 minutes later, our waiter comes back and says \"your tiramisu (the only dessert we really wanted) is completely rock-solid frozen.\" We're just done at this point. 

We won't ever return. This was such a failure."}
{"text":"Typical Olive Garden fare. so-so. I'd expect that. But the service was not good (Not our server's fault apparently). It took us over 45 minutes after we ordered to get two salads and a kid's pasta. We were told it was because of a large group that was there at the same time."}
{"text":"Yum yum this place is so good! I've been here so many time and I loves everything I've ever gotten. I'm getting hungry thinking about it. 
First of all their soups are soooo delicious!! I wish I had a giant tub of them. 
Everyone is crazy about the breadsticks but I'm not a huge fan. They are good but not that great. I also never eat them because I don't want it to fill me up. I want to eat my food! 
Dishes I have tried: 
Chicken and shrimp carbonara- my favorite plate of them all! It's sooooo good. Plus I love when they have chicken AND shrimp. I love it with Tabasco. Is is also my dads favorite plate and the waiters always say how good it is and some have said it was their personal favorite. 
Lasagna fritta- an appetizer and the only one ive had. It was very yummy. Not a top favorite but it was good. 
Chicken & Gnocchi- yum yum!! This Is the super delicious creamy soup. It's so absolutely delicious. 
Zuppa Toscana- my favorite soup and also most people's favorite. It's creamy with spicy sausage. This is heavenly I'd eat this every day if I could. 
Minestrone- this soup Is easily the worst thing I've had in the entire menu. It's not terrible but it's eh. 
Salad- their salad is pretty good but I'm not sure why anyone would be the salad over the heavenly soups. 
Spaghetti with Meat Sauce- I didn't order this for myself but I got it. It's good. Actually very good but idk why you would get this when there are so many better dishes. It's just plain spaghetti and sauce you could make at home. 
Fettuccine Alfredo- their Alfredo sauce is soooo good. But like the one above this is pretty plain and you could easily make this at home. 
Chicken Parmigiana- yum yum! This is super good. Not on my top favorite but it is good. 
Tour of Italy- this is what my mom always gets. Really good. You get 3 different things in one plate. 
Stuffed Chicken Marsala- on my top 5. I'm drooling thinking about it. It's so delicious. The thing i don't like is that it comes with mashed potatoes. I would like it a lot more if it came with pasta. 
Crispy Parmesan Shrimp- this is yummy. Very very yummy but I kinda feel like its an appetizer more than a dinner dish. 
Sea food Alfredo- yum!! I want some right now. It's super delicious! I never really order it since its easy to make at home but it's really good. 
Tour di Mare- like the tour of Italy but in sea food. I loved it. A lot. But I almost ate the entire thing and I don't eat a lot. When I eat tour of Italy I leave almost half the plate. It's not much but it really is good. 
Steak Gorgonzola-Alfredo- it was super good but it didn't have much meat. I finished the meat super quick. 
It still one of my favorite places an i would like to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden is the favorite restaurant of my fiance and myself. We can't get enough of it and we even got engaged at an Olive Garden.

This location is probably the one that we have visited most of all. I love it, but like most Olive Gardens the wait for a table can be long. Other than that Olive Garden is almost the perfect restaurant for us!

The breadsticks and salad are amazing starters, and we almost always order an appetizer of calamari as well. So by the time we get to the main course we are already almost full from great food. Everything I have basically ever had here has been very good! We usually end up with some great leftovers. I love the Andes mints that they give at the end too!"}
{"text":"So I have visited this particular location recently with my wife for our anniversary and I have to say not very impressed and also very disgusted by what I saw. So let me start of by saying that when we were finally given a table the table wasn't even ready for us the manager had to clean it right in front of us with this disgusting dirty wet rag( not very professional for frost time clients) Not that the trash and left over food all over the ground help suit my appetite..  Anyways so we finally got our food after waiting about 35-40 minutes tops and the food tasted microwaved as chief Ramsey would say \"wowowow disgusting bloody hell\" so to say the only good experience from this would be the waiter, very nice gentleman whom always checked up on us and was doing his job correctly. Overall would never visit that location again and wouldn't advise you to either. And for any one who had rated this place 5 stars lack of good taste in food and cleanness!!!"}
{"text":"Both the food and the service were above average today for lunch as I got the unlimited salad and one of those quick lunch items that was similar to a quesadilla. That quesadilla type thing tasted way better than I expected it would even before I added the red sauce and some black pepper on top of it.

My one suggestion and this is coming from a full-blooded Italian and that is to please change up your salad a little bit either to all Romaine or partly romaine lettuce as that would make it more authentic Mediterranean food (and it also has much better food value for the patron)."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. Nice atmosphere. The Caesar salad tastes really good. My main dish is \"Steak Gorgonzola-Alfredo\" and it's also good.


Steak Gorgonzola-Alfredo Overview:
Grilled steak medallions over fettuccine alfredo tossed with gorgonzola cheese and fresh spinach. Finished with a balsamic drizzle and sun-dried tomatoes"}
{"text":"I loved Olive Garden. It was the best place ever to eat it, when i get the fettucine it is very good. The interior is nice inside. Wait staff are very friendly. Very good breadsticks and soup. Its neat kids can play games on the little computers at the table. I would never give this place 1 star it is my favorite in town."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The waiters/waitresses are always really friendly and the food is great. I am never dissapointed even though I always get the same thing."}
{"text":"We often take our grandkids here as it is their favorite place. It's always pretty good but tonight we had a server who made it an experience. He was super nice & got us some wine for half price & saw that our granddaughter was looking a bit bored or down so when she asked for some Parmesan cheese to top her dish with he left the cheese grater with her & that made her real happy. His name is Marquis."}
{"text":"This is the first time we have been to an olive garden since moving to north carolina.  The restaurant was large and clean,  and staff were friendly.  It was a weeknight, and we were seated right away.  Service was ok-not super fast, but not horribly slow either.  Both my fiance and I enjoyed our soup.  He got the never ending pasta bowl and liked it, but since he does not like creamy sauces, he wished there was more variety.  I got my old standby-the tour of italy.  I don't know if it was just this location, or if they changed their portion size, but my meal was very small.  I have ordered this dish dozens of times, and always eat half and take half home.  Not this visit.  The portion looked like a tiny appetizer.  I literally had 3 bites of fettuccini alfredo, and about a 2\"x2\" tiny square of lasagna.  The chicken parm was not much larger.  Instead of my normal packing of leftovers, I finished my entire meal and left hungry.  Felt very ripped off at the $17.49 price of my meal.  It is unlikely I will return here."}
{"text":"Service was great tonight. Glad we came here to eat after a very long day. Our server Kris was polite and helpful. Cleared the tables quickly once we finished the soups. The meals were hot and tasty. The soup was actually hot and not warm.like other restaurants. Overall great experience and visit while visiting phoenix area."}
{"text":"I am writing this more for the manager Kelli than for the restaurant or our server. We actually had pretty bad service, though we did not get a chance to complain about it. We were seated quickly, and our service seemed very new at his job.  We were there for lunch.  We ordered our food and received soups and salad before drinks.  We were finished with our soups and salads before we caught the attention of another server who came to our aid and apologized for us not having our drinks yet.  She alerted the manager as we did not complain, just asked for our drinks.  Drinks came and then our entrees.  Our server came by a couple times and apologized but was still very weak at his job.  Hopefully he is given another chance and receives more training before his next guest arrives.  The 5 stars go to Kelli though for just coming out of nowhere and comping our meal.  Having a meal for free is very nice, but considering we didn't even complain but that she took the initiative to make sure that we were taken care of and happy with our experience - that's why she gets the 5 stars.  Great job Kelli - keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The new menu items were delicious and absolutely re-invigorated my attitude towards Olive Garden. Can't wait to go back and have some more of my favorites. Loved the risotto balls and the artichoke fritta for appetizers and the Pappardelle Pescatore is a great take on a seafood pasta. And don't hesitate to try the salad toppers, they really livened up the salad.

The service was excellent. The servers really made sure our dining experience was as good as it could be. Will return to this location for sure."}
{"text":"TL;DR While boxing up my left lovers, the server literally used her finger to flip the loose noodle back into the box.

Review from my daughter.

She did not give my friend her 2nd drink on time after asking if she wanted one, we had to ask after 10 minutes for her to bring it. She kept using the excuse that it was very busy and it had been busy all day. The food was poor and the salad had way too much dressing."}
{"text":"I was driving to buca di beppo to have dinner with my friend when I spotted the olive garden on the way. We were kind of hungry so we decided to eat here instead, even tough we were thinking that it wouldn't be as good.
 there was only one couple ahead of us so the wait was minimal. We were seated and the waitress offered us to try some chardonnay which I ended up getting a glass.
 We ordered the appetizer sampler with calamari, stuffed mushrooms and fried zucchini which was very good! For our entree we got the grilled shrimp caprese and the seafood portofino. Both with salads and both were very good. With all that food, salads breadsticks and pasta we had to ask for a doggie bag.
Everything was good from atmosphere, service, food,and the check wasn't as big as I was planning to spend so that was a plus!
I really recommend this place.! 
Sorry there's nothing funny in this review, This is only my most honest opinion."}
{"text":"Out here for lunch today and bartender was friendly and good with service. Now it was slow but chalk it up to good customer service. Good to see still out there. Good job!!!"}
{"text":"Alicia and Gina clearly don't know the number 1 rule in restaurants. And need to be released from their jobs"}
{"text":"Olive Garden usually has pretty good service...... but tonight we went to the Olive Garden on Nellis. This was absolutely the WORST service I have ever received at any restaurant including fast food. Aja was our server and she was horribly rude, took our plates to box them to go as we were obviously still eating never once asked if either of us were done! Rushed us since the time we were seated. UNACCEPTABLE! I rated 1 star because I did not have an option to leave NO stars. The server is a reflection of your company."}
{"text":"tasty tasting food. just wish I was younger so I could consume more. eating good food gives all of us great pleasure.  sure wish the waitress would not enter my personal space , especially if she was working extremely hard that odor can be nauseous. while she was trying to up sell me , I was getting a unwanted shower. I was not the one who needed a shower."}
{"text":"The location of the restaurant lays on the fine line between upscale Scottsdale and the old town Scottsdale. Literally, you can look across one street and see beautiful homes, turn around and look the other way and catch a glimpse of peopleofwalmart.com in person.

I give this OG a 5 star rating because of our waiter, Corey. He was the best waiter. Ever. He had a sense of humor (which is almost never seen in a waiter) and attentive but not overly so. Corey, if you are reading this, you deserve a raise! 

The food is standard OG. Endless salad and breadsticks. But if you are lucky, Corey will be your waiter. Be prepared for an OG experience like you've never had before."}
{"text":"Well, you go to The OG not expecting fine dining but at least edible food that tastes good! We normally go there at least once a month but after last night's dinner, I'm not sure I want to go again! We all got chicken parm and it was such a weird texture that I can't describe it. It's almost like it was old chicken or something. I tried to eat it but I just couldn't. We told our waitress that we really didn't like it but she didn't seem too concerned. I brought it home to see if I could salvage it the next day and it was worse than before! Definitely turned me off from returning any time soon! Service was ok - nothing special."}
{"text":"Tonight's experience at The Olive Garden was all about the two awesome bartenders that took care of all of our needs before we even asked!  Come sit at the bar and have a fun and amazing time with DREW & DAVID!! Skip the greeters and go straight to the bar! 2 thumbs up tonight!"}
{"text":"I came here with my three girlfriends and it was pretty good. The restaurant was decently packed for around 7 pm. Our server was so entertaining, I loved him! I don't remember his name but he was a taller African American gentlemen. He made our night with his jokes! Great food too, I had been craving Olive Garden for a solid month"}
{"text":"Austin, our server in the bar area had a great sense of humor, knowledgeable on wine, & the menu.  He made us laugh & the table behind us, was helpful also to the other server in the area who needed help.  

Undecided on wine, he brought the bottles & a few glasses for us to try so that we could pick the right wine.  Offering suggestions as well on all items.  He also let us know that the trivia games were $1.99.  On that same iPad is a beverage & food menu, also at the end you can pay & split the check.

Mom & I split a spicy new appetizer, Crispy Chicken Ravioli Supremo, salad, breadsticks & Jeff C. got the unlimited soup Chicken & Gnocci is the best & salad, which is always excellent!  Also you can try any soup, unlimited.

Our app was split, which was nice of them & had nice spicy cherry peppers, crunchy ravioli filled w/ chicken, mozzarella, topped w/ homemade meat sauce & alfredo. 

Overall, Austin went above & beyond & even though I haven't been to N Olive Garden in years, I will be back to this one because of his service."}
{"text":"I'm rating off of bar service & hearing complaints that were crazy while I was there.  As I waited for a glass of wine before my Wonder Woman movie at Galaxy, I was served somewhat of a wine tasting from Marquis.  He wanted to be sure that I liked the wine & knowing that I was in a rush, he was quick serving & cashing me out.  Chad walks by & says how is your day, is there anything else I can get for you?  Super nice.  
One lady complained that he didn't ask for her ID, but did for her friend.  Another had been late to pick up her order so requested new drinks since by now they were watered down.  The manager, a short haired blond lady was so kind to her & even issued a $15 gift card for fixing that drink order.  There were a couple of other incidents that I found ridiculous in a very short amount of time & thankfully I do not work there cause in this scenario, a few customers were not right.  Everyone at the bar treated them so kind, too kind.  Anyways, I ordered a drink & left in thirty-five minutes, as I killed time before the movie, had no food & sat at the bar."}
{"text":"Finally got to try OG! We love it! The recommendation from out server Joe was
Excellent! Brb"}
{"text":"Where's the love for the Olive Garden?  I can't see why this place could merit anything less than five stars every single time.

The Olive Garden offers tasty Italian dishes in a family-friendly setting, a casual atmosphere with service that's hard to beat!

Coming from Ontario (where we don't have any Olive Garden restaurants left, my wife and I would actually drive down to Amherst, NY to have dinner at the Olive Garden there from Kitchener and then drive back home) we really missed having a local Olive Garden.  Now that we live in Calgary, we get to have an Olive Garden right in town, no more cross-border sojourns for yummy Italian food!

We came on a weekday December evening and there was already a lineup early in the evening (of course, since it is such a good place, we did expect a lineup) and we were told that we would have a 45 minute wait.  Of course, we waited in the bar!  Dave the bartender made my wife a Caesar and a non-alcholic Caesar for myself, the designated driver (don't drink and drive, people, I know it's the holiday season, but everything in moderation).  My wife says it's the best Caesar she's ever had... so nothing better to do than to order another Caesar for her.  Since Dave is very busy now behind the bar, Stephanie the server comes and brings another Caesar for my wife (just as good as the first, if there's anything we like about the Olive Garden, it is the continued pursuit of the consistency of their operation) and an iced tea for me (by the way, free refills for the iced tea).  Next thing we know, exactly 45 minutes have elapsed, my wife has just finished her second Caesar and we get buzzed for a table.  We are seated by Lindsey the hostess and the actual dinner, proper, commences!

My wife begins with a large 9oz glass of the Roscato (by the way, I love the large 9oz serving, sometimes a single 6oz glass is too little and two 6oz glasses - that is 12oz - is too much).  I, of course, still have my iced tea with free refills.  After much careful consideration and consultations with our server, my wife orders the Italian Feast with Cheese Ravioli with Marinara Sauce, Chicken Parm and Fettuccine Alfredo with a generous portion of their house salad.  I order the classic Italian dish - the pride of Bologna - Spaghetti with Meat Sauce with the Pasta e Fagioli soup.  Soup, salad and the famous Olive Garden breadsticks are on the table promptly - I love how the Darden restaurants have the timing of the meal service down to a science - and I end up having not one, not two but three orders of the excellent soup, and now comes the main courses.  My wife loves her Italian Feast.  I love the Spaghetti as well.  Sadly my wife can't finish her meal, but we pack it up and it will be her lunch for the next day - two meals in one for her, what a deal!  Before we know it we are leaving the restaurant very happy, and very full.  From the time we sat down at our table to the time we leave the restaurant it is exactly 1 hour.  Like I said, the place runs like clockwork, folks.

But the story doesn't end here.

As it turns out, my wife left her Apple iPhone in the restaurant.  By the time we figure it out and head back, there are already other patrons sitting where we were sitting before.  Lindsey the hostess, however, tracks down the Apple iPhone and returns it to us.  I am grateful.  So is my wife (it's her Apple iPhone after all).  It was more excitement than we bargained for, but it all ended well thanks to the continued diligence of the committed and thoughtful staff of the Olive Garden always on the lookout for the customer's needs, whether we know it or not.

It's really the excellent service that makes the Olive Garden such as special place for special occasions, or maybe even it doesn't have to be a special occasion.  If you're looking to have a fantastic casual Italian dining experience, there is no better time or better place to go than the Olive Garden.  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Youve turned into cheap people and the spaghetti is watery as fuck. I used to love olive garden but this was some buuuullshit. You want out of this world spaghetti? Dont come here. I could drink my spaghetti."}
{"text":"I've had really good service here before and also some of the worst. It's very inconsistent. The food is also fairly inconsistent as well, but when it's good it's really good."}
{"text":"Slow service and not very happy! I expected more and got less . I'm dissatisfied but salad is always a favorite and the minestrone soup was good too !"}
{"text":"I have tried this Olive Garden over the several years that it has been in Champaign and not once have I liked ANYTHING.  I don't get why it is so crowded all the time and people are willing to wait a long time just for a table.  The house salad is awful and so are all the soups.  I have tried several items on the menu over the years and I have always felt ripped off because it's so expensive as well as awful.  I try really, really hard not to go here but sometimes there are \"those\" people who choose this place to have their birthday dinner or graduation lunch and I am forced to go."}
{"text":"Tonights dinner was fabulous! Service was superb! We decided to sit over by the bar area since there was no wait. Our server was Michael and he was awesome. He was really friendly and had a great personality. He was very attentive making sure our drinks were always filled and our food came in a timely manner. He came around to check on us constantly and we never once had to ask for anything. Overall dinner was fantastic as we started out the evening at another Italian place down the street. Service was so bad there that we got up and left. We should have just headed over to the OG in the fist place!"}
{"text":"$78 for three dinners and two appetizers \"to go\" here.. Got home and found the salad was all the white bitter core from cheap head lettuce not to mention inedible because it had a nasty rotten lettuce smell the minute we opened the plastic containers..oomph.. and the spicy shrimp appetizer was chinsy and sub par (smallest shrimp I've seen) and the chicken dinners appeared and tasted tough and microwaved.. No extra Parmesan as requested.. Olive Garden prices are horrid for the quality of food that is served here and at $18.99 an entree our dinner should have been an awesome experience whether dinning in or taking out period. Not worth the price.. 


Called the manager and was promised a voucher in the mail.... you guessed, nope! Never got one."}
{"text":"We come here a lot with our grandparents and the service is usually ok. Today we had a new server named Emma. I just wanted to say that she was super nice and was definitely my favorite server we have had in a very long time.  I'm sure I will be requesting her from now on"}
{"text":"i love italian food but i only give olive garden a 4 star because i miss the delicious ceasar salad sad they do not have it any more"}
{"text":"The only reason for the 3 stars is for the waitress and not the food.  The food would have gotten 4 1/2.
  
My family and I didn't want fast food.  We didn't want anything too fancy either so we settled for Olive Garden.  The three of us just wanted simple meals.  The wait wasn't too bad for a Tues. night either at 6:30pm.  

Our waitress took a bit getting to us and getting our orders.  We all ordered very simple meals, spaghetti with meatballs, spaghetti with sausage, and chicken alfredo.  My mom and I both asked for extra sauce since the spaghetti normally isn't as saucy as we like.  The waitress forgot..no biggie so we ask again.  She walked off to get it and 10 minutes later we are still waiting.  She returned to another table and saw us and said, \"I forgot your sauce.\"  

My mom wanted to use a coupon for $4.00 off the bill.  Our waitress did take it off and brought back the bill which showed she took it off.  When she came back with the receipt for me to sign, she added the $4.00 back onto the bill.  When I explained to her that I wasn't going to sign the receipt because of the mistake, she blamed it on the computer.  Who knows?  Needless to say, she didn't get the normal 20%  or more I normally leave for food service.

We did have leftovers and my spaghetti with sausage was excellent reheated."}
{"text":"After getting a terrible case of food poisoning here, I recently learned that a friend also got food poisoning here over a year later. I hope that they are making major changes but I am not planning to return to find out."}
{"text":"We have been mostly happy with our experiences here and been served by Josh a few times and ask for him when we go.....he is awesome! So we were having a SB party and wanted to have salad so we ordered take out...I had family here from Jersey and they love meatballs so I was ordering a dozen, so they as the gal was totaling it up for me over the phone I asked if we could get the marinara on the side I was told marinara was EXTRA....????  WHAT???  I proceeded to ask if that meant the meatballs were dry and she said yes...WHO DOES THAT?  I followed up by saying when I order them as sides when I eat in I am never doubly charged for marinara!  So I said forget about it and she said about the marinara I said about the meatballs as well...I don't want dry meatballs....duh!  We eat here quite frequently because it's something the whole fam can agree on, but I never would've realized there were different rules for take out than eating in!  I should've looked closer at the bill because I asked for extra pepperoncinis....I wonder if they charged me for those???  Is Olive Garden now going to an all side menu that they charge for every item ordered? I would've been REALLY disappointed had I NOT asked for the sauce on the side and got home and found NONE....she never asked if I wanted marinara cause they are served dry....am I WRONG for assuming they come with sauce????"}
{"text":"Went in Friday night with my fiance after a movie and over all was great.

Service: 5. Our server Dane, was likeable and super friendly. A little goofy though, but in a likeable way. There was a problem with my salmon and the kitchen manager came to our table, personally apologized, for the inconvenience and told us it would take some time, and comped the meal. I liked how they handled it. Some people have a hissy fit but not them.
FOOD: 4. Started off with the duo sampler, consisting of stuffed mushrooms and fried calamari. I was under the impression the mushrooms were crab stuffed, not clam. No biggie though. My fiance ordered the chicken and gnocchi soup which he loved and bread sticks were amazing as always. I ordered the herb grilled salmon or something. And it was pretty under in the middle.
Drinks: 5. We had boba from another shop, so he just got water and lemon. I ordered a peach Sangria which was good and finished with a Cappuccino, on the wetter side. A good cup can't complain."}
{"text":"I had'nt been to Olive Garden in a few years and had forgot how truly bad the food was. First off, this is cafeteria-style Italian food, ala Kraft or Velveeta cheeses. I ordered the baked Ziti, it was sent back. It consisted of pasta with a pink cream sauce, with a little ricotta stirred in. Anyone that knows Ziti, it is a layered and baked dish, with lotsa cheese. Epic fail. Another at our table ordered a shrimp  and pasta dish, it came out deep fried shrimp, ala Panda King style. I have made the effort to complain, because the food was just plain awful."}
{"text":"It's an Olive Garden. As long as the salad, bread sticks & staff are all good. I'm happy."}
{"text":"So i took a party of 10 here and i was impressed. the waiter that we had was named Dameion and he did the best job that he could for waiting on us and other tables. the cook took forever on our food tho. they kept coming with bread and then after about 30 min salad for a moment i thought i was at the last supper with all the bread and wine, but once our food came out it was on point .. will most def be going back"}
{"text":"very much needed Italian food yum. they have the best servers and food. nice environment very nice greeters at the front desk. very clean place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service at this location. First it took forever to place our order, then we waited over 45 minutes to receive our food. My husband spoke to restaurant manager and he was apologetic, stating kitchen was backed up. However our food didn't come any faster. This is ridiculous, hire more people please."}
{"text":"Sorry, two stars for tonight's dinner service. The presentation was lacking. It seemed rushed.  Way overpriced for what we received.  We will not return."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is always good and the staff are courteous.  The only problem I have is that they don't take reservations and we often have to wait a long time for a table.  The food is definitely worth the wait though :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant opened at 11:00AM.  We were the third party to enter the restaurant.  It took over 30 minutes to be seated.  The story we heard was that a few servers didn't show up, so the manager had to rearrange where the servers worked.  It would have been smarter to let the servers work in their assigned areas and as replacements showed up, put them in the vacant positions.  The food was good, but the wait was unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"So I haven't had OG for years. Possibly 5 years. Me and my fiancé went to get the endless pasta dishes and we only had 1. I  guess the deal sounds good. 9.99 for endless dishes. But there's so much pasta in one dish that you can't eat more than 1. Meat is extra.. everything's extra.. of course. So thinking we would spend under $30 it was more like under $50 for two meals. :/ oh well we tried. I recommend this for someone who can eat a lot. Or maybe athletes who are trying to carb up. 
The restaurant was busy of course. We didn't wait longer than 5 mins to be seated.. we didn't wait long for our food, and our waitress was nice and speedy. We had a Italian Margarita. It was really good. They used amaretto instead of tripe sec.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"So had a bad experience tonight with one of my favorite  places!! Called in as i do all the time to place n order , it was close to closing ,, however ladie takes my order ,i drive over there make it by 9:59 ladie locks doors as im walking to open them and sais sorry were closed, i proceeded to let her know i just placed a phone order and ladie knew i was gonna make it right at the clock, never told me no, why even let me order? N take the time to drive all the way to just tell me to leave ,manager erik ,had zero politeness.  Was really cocky , no way to treat your customers!  When theres a dispute,  and a customer  just wants to give you business as a manager you figure a way to please your customer , collect his money for your company  ,can you tell i wanted my meal ;))"}
{"text":"I don't see how this restaurant can have half the restaurant with nobody at tables and still have people waiting to sit down for a 30 minute wait estimated. When I was walking up it looked like it was closed already because there were so many open tables. Then to top it off we asked the hostess if we could order breadsticks while we wait and she said \"breadsticks? What's that?\" That's remarkable that the hostess has no idea what a breadstick is in the restaurant known for breadsticks and salad. Wow! Definitely needs new management because whoever is running this place now is ruining the Olive Garden brand. I'd recommend going to a different location, even if it's further you'll probably have a better experience."}
{"text":"Not bad, also not memorable; it's chain restaurant food. What's great is what the commercials say: unlimited salad and breadsticks! Ordered a salad, gnocchi chicken soup, rice balls filled with cheese, shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta, and a garlic, white wine sauce with spaghetti. All were tasty enough, but not top quality. However, our service was absolutely top quality. Our server, Aidan, was always ensuring we had what we wanted and needed. Most of all, he really connected with us and the other tables he was serving, we laughed and joked with him and he treated us like he treated his family...literally, because his family was sitting at the table behind ours!! Go Olive Garden for hiring a great dude who is working hard!"}
{"text":"I invited my family to eat dinner at this Olive Garden in celebration for my brother getting a promotion at work. My mother ordered a cup of coffee the first batch was good, but when mom asked for more coffee the second cup was watered down' we told the Manager to try the coffee because it literally had no after taste of coffee! It tasted like water with a little coffee flavoring!!! They brought us new coffee that still tasted watered down! SMH!

The entrees, Tour of Italy were good portions but the all you can eat bread sticks and the salad were not good portions at all!!! The waitress also said that she would charge me for another all you can eat Soup because I shared my soup with my mom??? This Olive Garden is stingy and not friendly!!! Next time I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had a good time. Cindy, our waitress, did a good job being our server. Overall, the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is so delicious, we were there at the weekend before memorial day and the service was very poor. This girl did not seem to have a clue and let us sit forever. We did not get one refill in one hour. But the food is awesome and delicious, especially with the new menu and meatloaf tastes so yummy, We are there almost every second week."}
{"text":"I was there with a couple of friends and my wife. No wait on Saturday noon time. We were seated right away. The waiter was awesome. He had several tables and still had time to come around often to check up on us. Great service. We order a pint of Alfredo sauce to dip our bread sticks in, 2 soups and 2 salads, 2 ordered the Tour of Italy, another person ordered chicken Alfredo, and I ordered chicken scampi. Everything was delicious. They kept coming with warm bread sticks. Good atmosphere and good service. Will definitely come back to this Olive Garden again."}
{"text":"{Date of Visit: 9/7/12}

Typical Olive Garden fare, but an amazing staff.  We were in the area after visiting the Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarium.  We were starving and this was close by.  The best customer service I have EVER received at an Olive Garden.  Shout out to Eric for the wonderful drink suggestion and great personality!  And kudos to you all for working so well together and giving our new waitress a helping hand!"}
{"text":"I dare you to place a to go order. You will be put on hold for minimum of 10 minutes and then usually hung up on after that. If you are so willing to call back and try again you will also be put on hold for another 10 to 15 minutes and then asked to be placed on hold again. When someone finally gets to the phone to take your order they will say oh do you mind if I put you on hold again. And at that time you will be hung up on again. I have tried to place a to go order three times in the last month and have been unable to, and taking up to an hour trying to get these orders  just to see how long it will possibly take you to get an order in.  I give up they win, I will not place anymore to go orders we have got your message ,don't place to go orders over the phone."}
{"text":"My family and I went to the Olive Garden on Howe Rd on Monday at 7:00pm. We were seated right away and ordered. After 20 minutes we were told the kitchen was really backed up and they didn't have any salads or breadsticks prepared and it would be a while. 20 minutes later we got our salad, but still no breadsticks. 20 minutes later we got our breadsticks, but by then other tables that arrived after us had their food as well. When I inquired, I was told that she thought people were taking our food orders and she had no idea where our's were. So at 8:15 pm we finally got our meals, by then EVERYONE around us had eaten and left. I should have asked for a manager, but it was my daughter's special day and I didn't want to make  a scene. We ate and then she asked if we wanted dessert, we had ordered the specials which came with dessert but when we told her this , we just got a blank look , like she had no idea what we were talking about. After we ordered our dessert , it took another 15 minutes to get them. After which we tried to ring out through the tabletop , but noticed we were overcharged by over $13. We had to wait another 15 minutes for her to fix it. We left at 9:00pm , 2 hours for dinner on a Monday night. Highly unacceptable. Why a manager never came over to apologize, I really don't know. Definitely won't be returning"}
{"text":"This is your typical OG. The restaurant is clean and you are welcomed kindly. It's a great place to meet a friend for lunch.

I always order the all-you-can-eat soup/salad/breadsticks. The salad is really good, but get the dressing on the side and mix it yourself. Otherwise, there is far too much dressing. The minestrone soup is great, but it is the only vegetarian soup option. Of course, go to OG because of their divine breadsticks! If you can afford the calories, splurge for a side of Alfredo for dipping your breadsticks.

I'm giving four instead of five stars because our server was not attentive. I was continually having to request more water and soup/salad refills."}
{"text":"If I could this ZERO stars, I would. This Olive Garden is HORRIBLE, service sucks! The last two times I been here in a month and it's pathetic. I will drive out of my way and go to another location. Hire better trained waiters. This last time I waited 15 mins before a server came over, another 35 mins for my food and didn't even bother to refill my bread. Never again!"}
{"text":"I've been to my fair share of Olive Gardens across the country, and I must say that this location is by far the cleanest. The service is also wonderful here. You may have guessed what comes along with these great things though... Very long wait times on weekend nights. If possible, try to come for lunch!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I'm not a fan of Olive Garden I think all their food is awful. It tastes like it was trucked in frozen and thrown in a microwave then slapped on a plate and served. even the bread sticks taste funny (good but funny). The service is always mediocre, I'm not impressed.

Skip this spot and take yourself to Anzios Italian restaurant (locally owned) less than a mile away. There you can enjoy real Italian food and a friendly staff.

Stay away from this frozen swans-man food. Not that I have any issue with frozen food but I can make that at home myself."}
{"text":"I tried eating here tonight, but the hostess was terrible, rude and possibly discriminatory. We walked in and asked to put our name on the waiting list. She said she would, but did not write our names down. We waited for over 15 minutes while we watched couple after couple come in and get immediately seated. When I approached the hostess to inquire, she was rude and said \"I guess we can seat you now\". We left and didn't eat here. This is why your stock price is in the toilet.  Just thought you should know."}
{"text":"Food is always great but our server Daniel gave us lunch menus but charged us the dinner price!!! Then instead if correcting it when we asked about the charge he gave the excuse that he couldn't fix it due to giving us the dinner portion.  I mentioned that that wasn't my error but his.... he still did not correct the error.  Please make sure to be specific with the server Daniel even if you are specifically ordering off the lunch ( that he gave you)!"}
{"text":"Food was good, our waiter was great. Almost a perfect experience except the hostess bitch was RUDE (fat one)!!"}
{"text":"I have hesitated giving a bad review on these restaurants because I wanted to make sure that this was an ongoing problem and that I experienced the same problem at various locations. 
In the past year I have eaten at different locations around the Cleveland, North Olmsted, Parma, and Middleburg Heights areas and I am sorry to say they all have a the same dirty dish problem.  I have yet to get a wine glass or water glass that I did not have to send back. I don't know about anyone else but the idea of dirty glasses (pieces of dried food clinging to the insides of the glass) really turn me off and then nothing else tastes good I am always picturing in my minds eye, dirty food. After all if they don't care about giving their customers clean glassware and silverware then do they care about the food they serve. Ugh, disgusting! If you really love their soups and salad as I do then just be aware of this problem that these establishments have. I myself will curtail from going there for a very long time in hopes that they will straighten this out. I can't see that happening in the near future because I have personally complained to three different managers and still... food particles in my glass and dirty silverware."}
{"text":"4 of us sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon. The food was good. My girlfriend and I split the lasagna. The breadsticks and salad were really good which is what we mainly came for. The problem was the service. The bartender was very slow and no personality. He never checked on our food. It seemed as if we were bothering him if we needed something. I heard other people around getting the wrong orders. He missed up my buddies simple drink order. I know people have off days but my girlfriend was a bartender for 10 years and she said he's the worst she's seen. I still like Olive Garden but we just won't sit at that bar again."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Food was cold. We waited for 45 min for our cold food. It wasnt busy at all. Servers forgot our drinks. Messed up our food requests. Never coming to Olive Garden again. Food quality is booty hole."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends and got the unlimited pasta. It was delicious and the staff was very friendly and quick even though the place was super busy. I don't think in all the years of going here I've had a bad experience."}
{"text":"It's a chain. I cannot like this place...the soup and salad is something you can never go wrong with, though."}
{"text":"I'm from Tampa and was visiting a friend and we decided to eat here.  The food was very good and the service was excellent!! Our server, Justine Mayer, was awesome.  She gave us a sampling of wine, gave us time to look over the menu and then took our order.  She saw to every detail and the evening was perfect.   She checked on us throughout the meal and saw to our needs.  She's originally from Italy and was very friendly and charming.....I wish we had her in our Olive Garden restaurant down here in Tampa!  If I'm ever there again, I will definitely make a point of going to this restaurant and sitting in Justine's area!"}
{"text":"Got the tour of it I for got my bike but I found the Tour of Italy with my GPS got chicken and the noodles not from the box . Pretty good on a busy street night"}
{"text":"Service was good at the restaurant .... until I got home and saw that our server packed the wrong dessert to go... wasn't the happiest as I am seven months pregnant and I was really craving what I ordered. Ha. 

I had ordered a cheesecake that was $6.99 and ended up with the Black Tie Moose Cake which was not good at all and also cost a little more; $8.29. I should have reviewed my bill better. I had ordered the cheesecake to go after the server had already brought us the bill so I didn't go over my bill again after... it was definitely a waste of money!! The sever placed our to go items in a bag so I never checked it. 

Lesson learned... always check your to go food and check your bill. 

Also my child played a trivia game for 5 minutes while we were waiting for our food and I didn't realize there was a $1.99 charge until I saw the bill."}
{"text":"We like the soups and the salads. This time we ordered one of the new appetizers and ordered the soup and salad as our entree. The appetizer was Pasta Chips with Meat Sauce. 

Our server was Dwayne. He took our beverage and food order, returned with our soup and salad, no appetizer...no beverages. He looked at the soup and said \"sorry, there's not a spoon, I'll get one for you.\"   

About 5 minutes passed and I approached another staffer and asked for  a spoon...she returned with one in about 30 seconds.  Still no Dwayne.  About half way through the soup and salad,  Dwayne returned with the beverages, the spoon and the appetizer. 

I don't know if the \"Pasta Chips and Sauce\" are supposed to be room temperature or served hot....they were room temperature. They're OK ...

I don't know Dwayne's true calling....it isn't \"restaurant hospitality.\""}
{"text":"If I could put Zero stars, I would!  This is the second and last time I will ever come to this location. As soon as you walk in, you can feel how dirty the restaurant is. We went for an early Friday night dinner, noticed the parking lot was pretty empty due to the time, but as we were greeted by the hostess, we were told there was a wait!  WTH?? Did no one come to work this evening?  After waiting for about 10 minutes, we were ushered to the tiniest booth I have ever seen. We asked to move to a bigger booth and we were promptly moved across the room. On my side of the booth, the gentleman, I use the term very loosely, had his arm draped over over the back of the booth and into my seat. I started to move towards the seat, he moved his arm long enough for me to sit down, then moved his whole arm back into my side of the booth. Where do these customers grow up, in a barn??  After it was obvious the person behind me would not remove his arm from my side of the booth, we asked to move.  The waiter looked around dumbfounded, and could not find a single empty table ( there were about 5 in our vicinity) to move us to. Needless to say, we got up and left absolutely disgusted!!!  The customers are dirty, the restaurant is filthy and we could not bare to eat anything at this location!  DON'T EVER come here expecting a decent meal, nice atmosphere, or a good dining experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Completely crowded so we sat at the bar.  Glad we did. The bartender Fred was funny and had everyone at the bar chatting and laughing.  Very enjoyable experience and delish spaghetti along with zuppa toscana soup. Fred was attentive as well whereas others have not been as attentive. Thank you Fred and The OG"}
{"text":"I went to Olive Garden for my birthday today and got the best customer service. My waiters name was Rome and he was super nice and friendly!! Food was great and they brought out ice cream n sang me happy birthday. It's hard to get good customer service so when it happens I'll always acknowledge it!"}
{"text":"food, drinks and service here is always great, whether we are sitting at the bar, near the bar or out in the dining room! very consistent, which I love! but tonight, Ryan stuck out.. in a good way. we were all very impressed. thank u Ryan, for being the face of our amazing experience :)"}
{"text":"You know it is Olive Garden. You get what you expect. If you were coming here looking for authentic Italian cuisine then you are crazy. The food is ok. Not great but not horrible. The only time I really come here is when they have some special dish that they are featuring. This seems to be when they really step up their game. Which is saying something for Olive Garden.
I will say the last time I was here our waitress Carla gave us 5 star service. Some of the best service I've ever had at any Olive Garden if not anywhere. She was very attentive. Wasn't stingy with the cheese on the salad. She even added some cheese to the salad, mixed it up then added more cheese on top. Very nice. Great attitude too.
Pretty much everyone is addicted to their bread sticks and they hand out Andes mints at the end. The prices aren't too bad for what you are getting. Still my best advice is wait until they are featuring a special dish. Some of them might surprise you. Olive Garden just made this? Yep. Not half bad.
But at the end of the day it is what it is. Pretty cheap, completely Americanized Italian food monster super chain. Or I guess Italian like food. Don't want to piss off the Italians by calling it Italian food.
It is like what someone said about Starbucks once, They must be doing something right or they wouldn't be everywhere."}
{"text":"This is not the place for Italian food.  It is a pretty generic Americanized Italian food chain joint but if you ever want Beignets, come here and order the zappolis... They call them Italian doughnuts but they are basically just beignets with chocolate dipping sauce and are great!  Other than that... I sat at the bar and the bartender was super sweet and nice, his name?? but the check said \"khutso C.\"  Sooo, I think his name may have been Chris?? He was great, the staff at the bar were very friendly and cool but there were two guys at the door when I came in that had an attitude problem... I walked in and said I was going to the bar and they stood there looking at me like \"whatever!\"?? I mean... Come on, they didn't even have to seat me, thus do their job, so what was up with the shitty looks?  While I was waiting I tried the crispy asparagus app and it was good except it came with this heavy sauce.. I asked for balsamic instead and it was much better!! Also I have to say they had no problem with me using my small vaporizer at the bar and Chris and the other bartender even complimented me on it;) love a vape friendly bar!! All in all, for a chain the bar is great but if you want Italian food this isn't the place... It's like any other national chain, pretty Americanized!  Chris and the other cool bartender should be working somewhere high-end, they were the best part of the visit!;)"}
{"text":"We have never had a more enjoyable experience than tonight at Olive Garden in Las Vegas. My wife Lea and I were waited on by Ryan, who is a very competent, excellent waiter. Ryan was always there for us and helped us get extra help for Lea who is gluten intolerant.  All of the waitstaff were very friendly as well.

Tom the manager was very kind to us and helped us pick out ingredients for a lovely Italian imported Carnaroli risotto rice, with shrimp, carrots, mushrooms. It was a very tasty dish indeed and I was impressed by how the risotto was complemented by the flavorful shrimp and vegetables. 

Even on our way out, Tom and the hostess at the front door wished us a good evening-nice!

They all definitely went above and beyond the call of duty!

We are making this one of our must stop restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"I would go back here solely based on the service; waiters and bartenders are the best people ever."}
{"text":"OLIVE GARDEN! 
(really nice elegant place to dine on a date night or just to have fun with the family) I love Olive Garden!!I really love this place if u love pasta.. this is the place to go.. I'm half Italian.. I grew upon noodles! lol 
I haven't been there in a while but when I go to Olive garden I usually get there endless pasta bowl the  Chicken Alfredo white sauce with Angel hair.. I love angel hair in any pasta dish..YUM! Every time I dined there I never had trouble with there food.. it always come nice and hot! Just like right out of the oven..lol I think angel hair is the only way to go.. lol My dish was about $7.50 (around that area).. not bad..
But I usually get that and the endless bread sticks and I love there salad! I tried making there salad at home but it doesn't come out as near as Olive Garden's..lol  I usually get there peach tea is out of this world! I get that every time with my chicken Alfredo.. Its nice and fresh and they put fresh peaches in the tea make it extra good! YUMMMM! I would love one now! I give this place a 4 star.. I really love there service.. friendly people.. nice location.. easy to spot.. its right on the left.. Nice area also! I would love to come back here again and get some of there tasty win also! Nice job u guys!! I will be back soon when I get a craving for your noodles and your ice tea!"}
{"text":"My family and I went on a Saturday and it was very busy. Despite the busy hour, the service was very timely and all the employees were very friendly. My family and I received a personable and enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful (Damion) #1 server. Food is always good. The only downside was when you came in to the restaurant there was a weird smell. (not a cooking food smell). It was enough to have my wife say something to me. But other then that, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Oversalted everything.

The only reasonable item to order is the lunch menu deal with unlimited salad (skip the canned soup).

Have your salad with breadsticks and pack your oversalted item for dinner. For $10 it is a reasonable price for two meals."}
{"text":"Ate at this location on Saturday it was not a good experience. We placed our order I order chicken Alfredo my wife ordered chicken parmigiana and a order of calamari they brought out the drinks my wife's was wrong but she said nothing. The girl came back by and said I'm sorry I forgot to put in for the calamari they brought out the salad no plates. When they did bring plates they where hot we where told they just came out of washer they should have been in a chiller. When U out the salad on the plate it wilted. Ask for some garlic to put on my Alfredo was told they don't have any garlic it's an Italian restaurant they should have garlic. The pasta was over cooked will not eat at this location again would recommend others not to either"}
{"text":"The service depends on when I go. I've gotten great service before the dinner service and during dinner service I've gotten forgotten about. Since I'm just one person they tend to walk past me. 

I can't seem to get a salad refill during dinner and sometimes I can't get a drink refill. I've also noticed that when I go in before dinner I get a beautiful bowl of salad and at dinner I get a one serving bowl of salad. Did they run out of salad, are they rationing? And, where do the waiters and waitresses disappear too? I see them running around, but I can't seem to get them to come back to my table.

The food, well, it's Olive Garden. It's pasta. You can't really screw up pasta too badly."}
{"text":"Love their complimentary salad and bread sticks.  Sometimes the bill is higher than going to comparable places. Service is always excellent here though."}
{"text":"Your typical Olive Garden, except when they screwed up our order, not only did they let us keep our food, plus replaced the entire order with the correct meals, they also gave us a $20 gift card. That's pretty darn good for an Olive Garden!! :)"}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner. Our server was Jessica T. She provided better service than we have got in a very long time. I hope that more people will ask to be at her table so management will see that she does good work.
The lasagna was really good, but seemed smaller than the last time. Maybe the cuts aren't all the same? My friend got the shrimp and chicken carbonara, that was really good. And of COURSE I tried it! You know me, I have to see if the grass is greener on the other side of the table. Haha. 
Anyways, make sure to look into the \"all you can eat\" pasta. I almost got it. Had to ask Jessica for the special menu that tells about the all you can eat pasta as the server didn't give it to us."}
{"text":"I am sitting here,  40 minutes so far in the restaurant, not even a glass of water.  

If you can't seat or serve your guest with reservations in something resembling a timely manner, why take reservations?  

They seated us 35 minted late.   

Half the table got to order appetizers, half did not.  

I am watching other folks already eat, I haven't even ordered.  

This sucks and I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight. They gave us a time to pick up and we still had to wait 20 min for our order. When I got home the fettuccine was already dried out.  Wasn't very good either."}
{"text":"Fresh breadsticks & awesome soup.. i tried the chicken gnochi n zupas toscana... both the soups were really yummy. I am also so glad they got my favorite smoked mozarella chicken back on the menu. I love that dish.. my wife got her favorite braised beef tortellini sub to chicken which is an outstanding dish... the service was okay as well... we will definately be back...."}
{"text":"I have had only good experiences here! Love their soup, salad, and bread sticks! Their peach tea is also very good! The waitresses have had great personalities. It gets super busy at meal times so plan for a wait."}
{"text":"Everything tastes great. Well worth the wait. My husband had the tour of Italy and I got soup and salad because we shared his meal. Can't say enough about the service today."}
{"text":"We're semi-regular customers of Olive Garden (maybe 4-5 times a year), and we've been to a number of different locations in different states. Living in NYC, we're used to long wait times, so the 45 minute estimate (while surprising) didn't really phaze us. We were seated about 10 minutes short of that, so all seemed well. But that's where it all went downhill. Once we were seated, it took about 15 minutes  for our \"server\" to come around for our drink order. Another 15 minutes to receive our drinks and take our order.  About another 20 minutes after that to receive our salad and breadsticks, and a good half hour after that to receive our food. In the meantime, we asked for additonal breadsticks (we got three and there were three of us), but they never did arrive. We were all finished eating for about 20 minutes before our server came to bring us the check, and another 15 minutes until she returned with my card. No exaggeration whatsoever.

Worst, unfriendliest service we've ever experienced, and I won't even get into the racial overtones. 

I won't hold it against Olive Garden, but we'll definitely never return to this location."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. Katie and Erich the bartenders are freaking awesome! Go sit at the bar and have a great time with those two!"}
{"text":"It is Olive Garden.  They are consistent with food.  The thing they do really well is their lunch.  Soup, salad and bread sticks.  I love their soups.  Great price.

Their dinners are okay as well.  Not great, but consistent and a great price.  

Service is good.  Last trip in some folks did not show for their shift.  They adjusted well, but it actually took some time for them to figure out how to seat folks.  It was odd.  In the end, it all worked out."}
{"text":"Generally typical Olive Garden. Food was good and served hot.  Server was good and service was more than acceptable. Would go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"first impression.... low class in the east side of town... when the waitress brought our drinks, she spilled it all over our table and on my jeans! she may have said sorry or apologized once during the course of cleaning up our table. that wasn't the only thing, angelo ordered chicken scampi which she repeatedly said shrimp, so I had to correct her a few times, then she said that dish was an appetizer! wth she doesn't even know the menu and it was under the chicken dishes! the food tasted old, especially their signature bread... we didn't eat our meals, after a bite or two we asked to take it to go! BAD EXPERIENCE! WILL NOT RETURN!!!!"}
{"text":"I totally agree with Chad. Almost all the so-called authentic restaurants are Americanized to cater most people's taste bugs here.  I went to Italy & saw their Italian cooking. 
I tried to go there last night (Satursday evening) as invited by my neighbor who has never been there. I told him its nice to go at least once to experience instead of just listening. Beside, their food is not bad though commercial. What do we expect when they are so busy.  On the way, I asked if he's reserved. He said no. So I called. The lady said, \" we don't reserve except a party of eight. We only do first come, first serve.\" \" thanks!\"
We arrived at around 6:00 pm, there were always tons of waiters (I mean waiting customers) both waiting inside & outside the restaurants, even it was around OMG 30 degrees.  I walked up to ask how long I've to wait. She said, at least 50 minutes for party of two.  I turned around to ask my friend, even it is a Food Bank, I couldn't wait as we were starving.  I saw there are many restaurants around, perhaps we could find somewhere.
So they lose our business.

Want to respond to some of the reviews.  It looks like this place was acceptable years ago.  Recently, none good comments.  They're still packed by their marketing skill, no reservation, just wait.... Besides, not everyone will research over the yelp to see reviews like shopping for a merchandise."}
{"text":"The food and service is great. I love how there's unlimited breadsticks and soup/salad. Best Italian place in Champaign."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever the server was super rude and the manager was so not helpful we complained to her about the way the server treated us and how she won't refill our soup and how rude she was even though it's unlimited refill all what she had to say you guys can leave if you want to and did not even bother to fix the issue manager name Jenifer Haigh we are a regular customer and we always go to olive garden but this location has the worst customer service."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I trust me to write an unbiased review after how sick I got last night about 2.5 hours after eating dinner here.  It was bad enough that I had to call in to work today.  So the $50 for dinner for two has blossomed into a loss of about $350 on top of it.  As you can imagine, this has not pleased me.  That is why I'm leading with this information.  You should know where I'm coming from.
I can't complain about the service.  The food was standard Olive Garden fare, although the zuppa toscana seemed watered down.  My lasagna wasn't bad going down, although not so much coming back up.  If I hadn't gone through hours of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, I probably wouldn't complain.  It was too expensive, but that wasn't unexpected.  
So, while it could have been a tummy bug, the timing was too coincidental to ignore.  Hence, two stars instead of three, and I'm not going to be wanting Olive Garden for awhile.  I'd be lying if I said I would not return, but it will be awhile!"}
{"text":"The food is always cold and tastes like it's been sitting out for days. This place just has a different feel than the other ones. Run down and gross."}
{"text":"Great service...quick seating clean tables had Andrew for our server very informative and great customer service will definitely be back and ask for Andrew"}
{"text":"Love this Olive Garden, Dine in or to-go. Friendly staff, decent price for the portions. I always have lunch with there salad added to the entree and man are the breadsticks good. I almost always get the lasagna its honestly one of the few places I say makes one of my favorite meals better than I do, the meat sauce and cheese ratio is perfect! Don't hesitate to go here, I've never had an issue."}
{"text":"So i am usualky not big on chain restaurants but i had a gift card so we went. 

Pro: i love the game station at the table. The salad flavor is always consiatent a f the food comes out hot every time. 

Con: this location smelled like body oder.  Especially in the waiting area. It was so bad i wanted to leave. The waiter seemed a little under confident of what he was doing. He offered complimentary wine but didnt kbow much about it when asked. The talapia was dry and over cooked. Thw sause was way too salty.  My husband ordered the rosemary chicken and he loved it."}
{"text":"It's a regular olive garden and they are all the same as far as food and decor.  What makes or breaks a visit there is the service and our waitress, Kathleen, was fantastic. She was super attentive and right on top of everything.  Very friendly and personable.  If she's not already, she should be the one to train the rookies."}
{"text":"We left after about 10 minutes after being seated. Nobody came by to say \"I'll be right with you\" or even gave us an \"I see you, but I can't get there just yet\" nod.

 We went in to try their new sandwich things, but they aren't even on the menu anywhere.

I'm so sick of businesses being understaffed.  Customer service has just gone to hell anymore.  When will places realize that the money they skimp on staff only hurts them in the long run?

I really need to learn to cook..."}
{"text":"My mother stopped today to pick up a cup of soup for my aunt, her sister, who recently had quadruple bypass surgery and had had a hard time eating. My aunt loves the Zuppa Toscana soup and my mom thought maybe she could tempt her with a bowl of it. The lady at the hostess stand was polite and helpful and placed my mom's order without hesitating. Upon receiving the order, as my mom was about to pay, a gentlemen, the store manager, advised the hostess it was on the house and there was no charge. What a thoughtful and kind gesture made by the manager and our entire family would like to offer a huge thank you for his generosity. It was not expected but truly appreciated. We will definitely return in the near future and tell all our friends of our experience. Thank you again, from the family of Billie Jo Patterson"}
{"text":"Good and consistent Italian food.  From coast to coast, you get a consistent dining experience at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I tried to book dinner on 01/20/2015 to celebrate our anniversary. The person that answered the phone told me appointments are only taken 3-4 hours in advance. I really thought he was joking, after all is only a Olive Garden. Needless to say we ended up going to the Yard Restaurant,  where they welcomed our business.
I do know is the same company. I just don't understand the rudeness at  Olive Garden.
Take lessens Olive Garden  employees on how to properly treat a customer.
This restaurant is at Cactus Rd in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I am tired of everyone telling me how good the olive garden is. My family, some of my friends and some people on Yelp also agree for what? good breadsticks? thats the only thing I have ever experienced here that is worth more than three stars. Average spaghetti, average Ravioli, average pasta, average salad, average service. Maybe people like mediocrity as long as it is consistantly pedestrian and uninspiring. In Fairness, I think Buca di Beppo gets this kind of benefit of the doubt where average is the new GOOD."}
{"text":"One of the better places to eat that avoids MSG I understand. Once I ordered Chicken Picatta and could not find one caper but the Tuxedo Cake is to die for and the Salad I have to remember to request Ranch as they no longer have Caesar is all you can eat. I like the Shrimp Linguini, the Chicken Marsala and the Stuffed Mushroom Appetizers. The Virgin Strawberry Daiquiris are good and the Minestrone Soup on a cold day."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden and have been going as a family tradition ever since I can remember. The problem is finding a place with good customer service. 

Upon entering we were greeted and I asked for a table.. As I am a large woman. The hostess takes us to a table and I had to remind her what I just stated two second prior that I needed a table not a booth. Granted I'm now a little irritable.

Me and my husband waited for our server for about five minutes or so and then flashed the new kiosk for the server. Now I'm more like agitated. I informed him we were quite thirsty and he offered wine and took our drink order.

Thank goodness for our server AJ. He turned our dining experience around. He was attentive to our needs and we never had an empty glass. He was pleasant and not too social. Needless to say he earned a great tip at 50% the bill. 

Shortly after we ate the manager came by and asked if our service and food were good. I let him know he had a great server in AJ! Most definitely leaving our other Olive Garden on 75th to come here for better customer service.

Thank you too the server!"}
{"text":"Took my late night to-go order with no problem (20 minutes before close). The manager offered a drink and dessert for the order taking longer than expected. I didn't think it was too long.. Great service, amazing food like always."}
{"text":"Update to 5 stars. After posting my original review the Olive Garden management was quick to respond to my review and open a dialogue to address my concerns. I can't blame the entire restraunt for the actions of one server, and I truly appreciate the effort their management team has put into resolving my complaint. We will definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"Usually my experience here is pleasant but today it was horrible. Went with my family and the service sucked. Took forever for us to get bread sticks and we only got a refill for them once after waiting so long and us having to keep asking our server about them. Funny how every time we asked about them he kept saying they were still in the oven yet we saw other servers bringing them out. A refill for our drinks was the same thing. Pretty upset I probably won't be back to that location."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for the never ending pasta bowl! Yay! It's back!!! Our server, Katie, was excellent and attentive. Food came out quickly, which is a plus because we've had times when it would take forever to get those additional bowls of pasta. I guess my only complaint is that they would only take one of my kid's free meal coupons, saying that they could only use one coupon per ticket even though the coupon doesn't have lost any restrictions. I've been to other locations and that's never been a problem."}
{"text":"Only reason this gets two stars is because our server was fast and great. He was quick with bringing things out and got us anything we asked for. The reason for the low stars is that one the meatballs were extremely cold and felt like they were frozen. Also they tasted like the came out of a chef boyardee can. Second we always get an alfredo boat for out breadsticks and we're disappointed. There was a less than 1/2 inch layer of it in the bowl and the bowl was no bigger then a side plate. For 3.49 it was pathetic. I would not come to this location again."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff, the wait is never bad! One of my favorite Olive Garden locations!"}
{"text":"The waitress with like 8 different colors in her hair has one hell of an attitude and is very unpleasant."}

{"text":"We visited 6/6/15 around 6:30-7. Party of 2. We were seated right away. The host said our server would be right with us to take our drink orders. We waited about 15 mins just to order lemonade. By the time Meghan took our drink order, we were ready to order our appetizer. Good thing because it took 45 minutes for our smoked mozzarella to come to our table. The other guests seated around us all seemed to have better service and didnt have much of a wait. Our server ignored our requests for refills and more bread sticks and had to be reminded a couple times. Our cups sat empty for most of our meal. Not even 5 minutes after our appetizer (almost and hour into our meal), we got our entrees. We didn't have enough time for our app. I have zero complaints about our food, just the service was awful. At the end of our meal, Meghan boxed up our left overs and said she would return with a bad for our bread sticks, but she never came back.  The only thing crappier than the service was the parking lot with potholes that could swallow my Hyundai whole. We will be going back to Olive Garden, but not to this location."}
{"text":"Our server Arielle was awesome trying to deal with our complicated orders thanks again! See you next time!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend recently. Food was typical Olive Garden fare, great soup and bread sticks, and OK-ish entrees. But the service wasn't the best (I am not sure if the bread sticks came out late because they were being baked or if the waitress forgot, but we had wait for about 15 minutes after ordering our food before reminding her - I mean come on, their bread sticks and soup is one of the few reasons I even go to that place !). 

Other than that, their smoked mozarella fonduta was pretty good. Nothing much to write about the rest of the experience."}
{"text":"I asked for spaghetti with meatballs. They asked what sauce I wanted and I said authentic marinara sauce. When I received my meal, the \"sauce\" was just chunck of cut tomatoes that they put in the dish. There was no sauce for the noodles so I just ate the meatballs."}
{"text":"First time at an Olive Garden in several years. First time at this location. We went on a Sunday afternoon. No wait time. We were greeted and seated right away.

Our server was super nice. Brought wine for us to sample. Answered our questions about some items on the menu.

We started off with salad and breadsticks. Delicious as always! I ordered a 'skinny' margarita. It was good. Maybe not as tasty as a regular one, but a good substitute. We ordered Lobster Cannelloni and Baked Tilapia with Shrimp from their lite menu. Everything came out hot. The Lobster Cannelloni was very good! Tilapia was okay. A bit mushy for my tastes.

Everything was very good to excellent. Kudos to them for offering a 'lite' menu. I'm not big on corporate restaurants, but this one certainly doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Clean, nice staff. Waitress Christine F was great. On top of her game. Had the old standby soup & salad. Always good. Partner had spaghetti & sausage, cleaned his plate   manager stopped by all of the tables, a nice touch."}
{"text":"Pasta? Yes! Seafood! Yup! Breadsticks? Keep them coming! OG is just straight up guilty pleasure food that will leave you full yet wanting more!

So much food to devour! You will not be able to finish your soup/salad, appetizer (if you ordered one), and your main dish. I know I was beyond stuffed with my soup, salad, and breadsticks! I expected long lines and even longer wait times for your food but we were in/out in 1.5 hours! Absolutely no wait time to be seated; even with a good amount of customers inside. Our food also was served rather quickly; ding ding ding!!

Their new Strawberry Passion Fruit Limonata is a MUST have! Order it or you'll regret it later! =) Everything on the menu looked soooo delicious and I couldn't make up my mind. 

When I'm back visiting the mainland, OG will always be my Italian food establishment for excellent food and drinks with a homey ambiance."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to an Olive Garden in years, so my wife and I randomly decided to go one weeknight.  Overall, a lot of food for what you pay.  Unlimited soup and breadsticks, which was nice (though I only had one bowl of soup).  Decent drink selection.  And the buy one get one free entree deal was great.  We took advantage of that deal - both my wife and I enjoyed the baked ziti for our entree and had additional pasta dishes for the following evening.  I was slightly disappointed in the dessert.  I ordered the apple crostada, and it didn't really look as big as it did in the picture (but I guess the pictures always look better...).  Good service to top off our experience."}
{"text":"Party of 14*, half adults and half kids with THE BEST SERVERS EDITH AND NATHAN. We were seated promptly as we mentioned our 8:30pm reservation by friendly and professional hostesses. The table was set comfortably -- not too close together. The servers introduced themselves and offered wine samples along with genuine chit chat throughout our party. 

Our, drinks and soup/salads came out in a timely manner considering how many orders were placed. The food came out exactly as we were finishing our soups and salads. Refills came as soon as the bottoms of our dishes appeared with no delay. Edith and Nathan were the best servers of Olive Garden I have ever had. I hope their manager recognizes them for such a wonderful team they are :))"}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying that I normally love love garden, until today.

My girlfriend and I sat down and it wasn't for another 8 or so minutes that our waitress came up to us. She doesn't introduce herself and mumbled hi, we both give her our drink orders and as I was about to say we wanted bread sticks she just walked away. When she came back and we asked to order and she sighed and rudely said what can I get? She also missed the side that came with my meal. Our food finally came out, cold, and starting to change colors on top from sitting so long. Both of us could barely eat more than three bites and didn't finish. We told the waitress and she showed no concern but instead only said, I'll get a manager. Needless to say the manager did comp my girlfriends meal, but the service from her and the food were horrendous...their service was so bad that I HAD to create a yelp account, that says something.."}
{"text":"My visits to Olive Garden are always delightful. Some times the wait is short but most of the time there is a long wait time just to even get into the restaurant. The waiters are very attentive. They sit us down and get started with our order right away. The waiters are very funny and know how to make good conversation.

The food looks very appetizing and is presented very well. The salad is not overdressed and the bread sticks are delicious. The pasta is always super good (my personal favorite is the chicken Alfredo). The dishes come out fast and hot. Throughout my meal the sever always asks how the meal was or if we needed anything else.

After we finish eating the severs are quick to pick up all the plates at the table. Minutes later they come and drop off the bill. The price usually isn't bad (around $20 per dish). Olive Garden is for sure one of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Went to OG yesterday and a lady was sitting in a booth with her little chihuahua-type dog next to her.  It was clearly not a companion/service dog.  I just found this to be a bit gross.  To allow a dog to sit at a booth in a restaurant, with it possibly shedding & whatever else, is probably against some sort of code.  The individuals I was with felt the same."}
{"text":"Let's start off with it was about 50 degrees and 50 mile an hour winds outside. They had the friggin AC on inside are they crazy? It was extremely cold inside and we had to ask them to turn the heat up which they never did, so they turned the fireplace on but that's not good enough.

Had a glass of wine very disappointing not worth the $8 purr glass. We ordered the parmesan crusted chicken special it was horrible it was very dry and tortellinis that came with it had NO taste at all very dry and Bland. 

We should have just stayed home and saved OURSELVES some money it was that bad.  Their menu was also very disappointing it used to be a lot better.
 
I think it's all the Olive Gardens in the Las Vegas area that are for one reason or another are all bad.

Compared to the Phoenix restaurants all the Olive Gardens here need to change or update their menu.

We will not be coming back to any of the Olive Gardens in the area. I think someone from corporate needs to look at all of them and see what's going on."}
{"text":"Busy location but, always great service. Never had any issues. Always tasty fresh soups, salads and breads. My fav soup is the zoppa Toscana a mixture of sausage, potatoes, kale and some other delicious ingredients it's the best. My new favorite dish is the torte al forno small tortellini filled with cheese and topped with a bacon filled sauce. If you love Alfredo Parmesan like we do make sure to order a bowl to dip your breadsticks in you won't have any leftover, trust me. Always our go to restaurant for special occasions, too."}
{"text":"Great customer service great food. Although they Used to make the Alfredo sauce way much better before. That's kind of the only reason why I went to go eat there. For the chicken Alfredo. But since the sauce isn't good no more I stopped going."}
{"text":"Tonight we went out to dinner at the olive garden service was very quick our server name was Adaorah she was very friendly, polite and talkative made us feel very welcome. Under the  Pollo Chicken  Entrees I ordered the Chicken and Shrimp  Carbonna. After having 1 bite of my food I noticed my dish had a different taste other than chicken and shrimp. I asked Adaorah about the ingredients without even knowing she told me there was bacon in the dish along with shrimp and chicken. I felt bad for not realizing the  ingredient on the menu. I sually avoid eating pork because of my allergies. Adaorah was very understanding and kind enough to have my dish remade without the bacon. Eventhough the dish with bacon tasted amazing I knew I couldn't eat pork we all laughed how life sucks to not be able to eat pork lol....  Throughout our dinner she constantly visited our table to service us keep our table clean and clear of plates, refilled our drinks soups and salads. Adaorah definitely gave us a great dinner experience. 
Apon paying for our bill another worker i don't know who overcharged us $22 extra  we brought the overcharge to Adaorah's attention. She had the problem fixed quickly by cancelling out the charge that immediately posted a refund to my account and had the correct amount charged. Adaorah definitely practices professional employee ethics. She definitely deserves a pay raise I hope that my yelp review will have her rewarded or recognized for  her outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Tom, our waiter, was outstanding he was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. We sat in the bar area and had a great evening."}
{"text":"The food was good last I visted. I eat out a lot. The service could be better, the waiting time too."}
{"text":"Always quick service once seated, often a wait but that's normal during meal times. Pretty normal olive garden"}
{"text":"Memorial Day, stopped in early afternoon. When entering in the doors the smell was horrible. Not sure if it's a sewer issue from the restroom when entering but completely fowl. We just wanted a soup and salad  lunch . How can a salad taste bad? Well it sure was so we ordered more salad and again wilted . If you look on the reviews it is completely like that for other customers. Completely disappointed  just moved over to this area."}
{"text":"My friend had a gift certificate to olive garden.  the food was very good but our server Natalia was fantastic she was only serving 2 weeks.   we never jad to ask for a thing she was on top of everything.   Defiantly knew the menu. if you go to this Olive Garden ask for Natalia...."}
{"text":"I like this Olive Garden!  I've been here many times and it's probably one of my favorite locations.  The food always seems to taste best at THIS restaurant.  There's a lot of parking and I've never had to wait too long to be seated.  Waiters are pleasant and usually not too slow, with the exception of our server tonight.  But he was very nice and was waiting on a lot of tables so we cut him some slack. 

I could just eat salad and breadsticks and be happy. :) So good!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience at all ! Our waiter was overwhelmed and late on our drinks !! Appetizer was wrong and the food !! Well what can we say about Olive Garden Food !!

We both had the Trio w/ Shrimp Scampi and it was just OK !! The Cheese Ravioli and  tortellini was very dry !! 
the Alfredo was also very dry and pasta overcooked !! 

The best thing was the carbonara!! Other than that we will not be back !! Salad and breadsticks are always good but had to three times to even get Breadsticks !!"}
{"text":"Typical chain food good deals are on the resto, eat all you can salad, and soups."}
{"text":"Olive garden, more like I love garden. lol ok, this place is famous for there endless breadstick and salad. If you can stop from eating this which is so hard to do, the food is awesome! I sometimes ask for substitutions on my orders like to add chicken or a different sauce, and I have never had a problem. They are always friendly and always recommending different things to try.... I usually go for dinner so I can't speak about the lunch menu."}
{"text":"This was so close to five star I hate to give them a 4 but the bathroom had two sinks and only one that worked. The table was wobbly so much so it almost flipped because one of the leggs was sideways. I fixed it but goodness. Food was great though and waiter was so nice just wish he had fixed the table and not me."}
{"text":"I have been to many an Olive Garden in my lifetime and I usually have a pretty decent experience. Unfortunately, the last time I visited this particular restaurant, the whole experience left much to be desired. 

I went there with my significant other for my birthday this year. The only thing I enjoyed was the salad and breadsticks...but who doesn't. I digress, both the meal and the service needed a lot of work. 

I don't know if our server was having a bad day or he had something out of work to worry about, but he was very un attentive and was kind of everywhere when he was at our table. I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say he was just having a rough night and wasn't at his best. 

The main issue I had was with the food I was served. My boyfriend and I ordered the same things this visit, Chicken Scampi. It took quite a bit of time to get the meal. When they showed up, there was quite a difference in our plates. Mine had absolutely no sauce at all. It was totally bland and tasteless. The server offered to bring me some sauce. It helped a little, but it was still not as good as it's been in the past. Another issue I had was the chicken was charred black on the bottom. Not brown, black. It was awful. I ate maybe 1/4 of the dish when I decided I just didn't want to eat it any more. The manager offered to have it refired, but I wasn't up to having another meal come out of that kitchen on that particular night. I've never not finished a meal at this restaurant so I left very disappointed. 

I will probably go back to this restaurant...I just don't know if I'm ready any time soon."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The service however, left much to be desired. Our server was obviously having a bad night. It took almost 20 minutes to get our salad. At that point our drinks were empty. The server said she would be back with drinks, however it took around 10 minutes for her to come back.

Our server was very nice. She did tell us that she was having an issue in the kitchen. However, that should not affect our service. 

Overall, great food. Nice server. Poor service."}
{"text":"wish I could give more stars for the service I received today Shelby knows how to put smiles on everyone's face"}
{"text":"Ok let's start from the beginning, the only part of our dinner that was good was Amber the waitress. She was on point, and that's where our positive experience stopped, oh wait the bread sticks and salad were good and our soda and tea were good also, now that's where it stops. The food was horrible I had the fettuccine Alfredo, not good. Very bland and the sauce was chunky, my better half had the eggplant that was soggy and she said it was like it was they warmed it up in the microwave. I did taste it and wanted to spit it out. It was, like my favorite line from Caddy Shack, \"This taste  like low grade dog food !\" Thank you Rodney. I would steer as far from this place as I could"}
{"text":"Went with a group of colleagues for lunch. There was a hair in the salad. Our server apologized and brought out a new bowl. The restaurant manager did not come over to ensure everything with our meal was satisfactory after the hair incident. And at the end they made the girl with the hair in her salad pay for her entire meal. This was a bad experience and will not be going back. And did not receive Andes candies, if that's still something they do. Also, the entire restaurant smelled like wet dog. Other reviews seem to have a common description of the smell."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Olive Garden gets a lot of criticism for being a chain-resteraunt, but I honestly haven't found an upscale italian place which justified their prices with better food. My classic go-to dish is the chicken alfredo pasta.  Absolutely fantastic.   There's a reason this place is always packed.  Occasionally the service is a little slow, but most of the time it's great."}
{"text":"One of these worst Olive Gardens I've been to. Took 20 minutes to get drinks. Which were refilled once, 15 minutes after they were gone. The wrong soup was brought out to my entire table and then corrected. We received one basket of breadsticks after asking for more 4 times. The food was overcooked and burned to a crisp. I basically had to chase the waiter down to give him the check. What should have been a 45minute-1 hour lunch turned into a 2 hour debacle. I love the Olive Garden in Summerlin, and live on Centennial. I'll make the drive next time, gladly."}
{"text":"My server was fantastic!  Food great good server recommendations!  Highly recommend!  Lucian server!"}
{"text":"Service was good, however the food was not so great. The dinner portions are really small for what you pay. I got the shrimp scampi and if it weren't for the unlimited breadsticks I would be leaving hungry. Even so the portions should be larger considering you pay 15-20 a person.. also the shrimp scampi was incredibly bland and I had to add lots of salt to make it taste like food. I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Great service. Always busy but worth the wait. The manager jeff was active and made sure our time was great. You do not see this type of attention at many locations. Food was very good also. We always enjoy coming to this location. Thank you Jeff."}
{"text":"I have to ask my self every time I go here  WHY...   I guess because the food is always decent, service is very good and they have a good childrens menu.  They are consistant in every aspect."}
{"text":"We love Olive Garden the soups are fantastic ...and the pasta is excellent and desserts are fabulous. Delicious steaks and seafood. Chicken marsala is my favorite ...Tiermasu Is out of this world"}
{"text":"My god Olive Garden use the proper amount of freaking sauce PLEASE. And what's with the teeny tiny portion sizes?!"}
{"text":"I can not remember the last time that I have been to an Olive Garden ~ probably 2004 or so ~ definitely before I was married..  

Driving home from the grocery store, we decided to swing on in and have dinner at the old Olive Garden.  

Parking was packed.  And, we were about 8 couples behind on the wait list.  After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were finally seated.  I love the way the O-Garden is laid out - very spacious, wall colors are calm, and lighting is perfect.

Our waiter - despite being really busy, spent the necessary time with us.  Took our drink, appetizers, and meal orders promptly.

Once he brought us our drinks, he also brought our yummy garlic bread sticks and chilled salad.  Now, I love the Bread Sticks here.  They seemed to be soaked in Garlic (yum yum yum) and are warm.  By the way, because of the \"heavy\" garlic, you might experience some uncomfortable gas feeling at night... lol... pop in some GAS X before you head to bed.  Your partner would appreciate it... hee hee.  back to dinner... I must say the O-Garden have the bread delivery right.  I hate restaurants where the bread are HARD and difficult to bite into... Soft warm bread is the way to go.  As for the salad, it was perfect.  Dressing was light and ideal.

We ordered the Mussels as an appetizers.  Since we were hungry, the mussels were consumed within minutes.  Very good.  By the way, we took our Breadsticks and dipped it in the mussel butter sauce.   All I can say is \"Ummm Ummmm Ummm!!\"  Honestly, if we had to do it over again, we probably cut back on the bread... we kinda finished two basket full before our meal.  So, we were about 70% full before our entrees were even served.  Note to self, save some bread to take home (by the way, our waiter still got us some extra bread for our drive home too!  yeh yeh yeh!)

For our entrees, my wife ordered the Seafood Mari (can't remember the exact name) and I ordered the Chianti Braise Ribs.  Both dishes were truly good.  Her Mari was perfectly seasoned and had the right mixture of seafood.  And, the red orange sauce was not too tangy and did not overpower the dish.

As for my meal, my ribs were very tender.  I could cut it with a spoon.  My pet peeve with the meat was that the Chianti was a bit too strong and sweet.  They should have used a less potent Ruby Port wine or Chianti.  I did not really like the \"wet\" brown rice that they served with string beans on top.  It looked kinda dirty and unorganized.  It looked like it was \"slopped\" on.  I would prefer instead a clean pasta center piece with a mixture of color veggies (bell peppers, string beans, potatoes, etc..).  Needless to say, I did not care too much for the rice.

For two, drinks, with one appetizer, two entrees, salad, and \"complimentary\" break sticks, the bill comes to about $55 bucks.  Not bad.  Add in the 20% tip, and it runs up to $65 or so for two people.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience.  It is a nice change-up from all the Asian restaurants that my wife always want to go to.

Cheers and enjoy."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this place. I am an Olive Garden girl  all the way, and we go every time we have something to celebrate, or if we are out if town. Now I have a different view of this place. When asking for the wait time for a a table I was told yes and that thre was no way they can fit 8 people. I visit Vegas a lot during the year, and I don't think I will be back with the horrible service provided at the start.  Not a recommendation. Maybe take a longer drive and go to one of the other ones around the area, but not this one."}
{"text":"Edit 5/11/17 - changing to 3 stars because the gm for this location reached out to me. Management there does care about your business. Kudos to him & thanks for reaching out. 


Most horrible experience dining out - still shaking my head in disbelief over how unprofessional and mean our waiter Jason was. He didn't want to be at work and he made us feel uncomfortable and scared to ask for anything. He was angered my friend wouldn't upsell to a tea vs. water; so mad that he walked away from our table without taking my drink order. He wasn't a skilled waiter either as far as forgetting things and delivering the wrong order - I tried to correct it 3 times and he actually walked away on me. So in addition to being mean and unprofessional he treated us with an attitude of how dare we go out to lunch - it was so unpleasant. I could go on with more specifics of what he would forget, comments he made, a gift card with a bad magnetic strip that had to be run manually, etc , but I will leave it at this. I think it's sad no representative of management was there to check on guest experience and I think it's sad that Jason is the face representing Olive Garden. I would've given 1 star but I gave 2 stars because the waiter at the table next to us checked on us a couple times at the end after Jason disappeared- I didn't catch his name but he was friendly and smiled so that was a relief to see."}
{"text":"Samantha was so pleasant, and the food is amazing. Thank you for the great service Sam! We are coming back for the great food, but also because of your warm welcomed service. Keep up the great work, cya again soon! Happy Holidays!"}
{"text":"I hate to only give this Olive Garden 2 stars because my husband and I have eaten at this location twice now and had very sweet waitresses both times but the food continues to disappoint us. I want to like this Olive Garden because we've received quite a few gift cards to the chain, but the food was bland and below average and the \"endless\" salad looked and tasted like it was old and slightly browning. With so many other great options at this price point in the Charlotte area, we will not bother coming back for round three."}
{"text":"I used to love Olive Garden for their pasta, soup, salad, and breadsticks. Prices have gone way up and quality has gone way down! Service at this location was great but the food was bland, lacked sauce and the bread sticks were hard. We ordered dessert and it came still frozen and they didn't have any that wasn't. I ended up having to take it home and wait for it to thaw. I won't be returning. There are so many other Italian options."}
{"text":"My first time going to an Olive Garden was at this location, and I must say I am very impressed with the level of service and of course the menu. I was given a gift certificate of $100, and it was enough for my fiancé and I to eat there twice. We ended up ordering online and picking up the food to eat at home. The first time was so great we went to soon after. We didn't have to wait long at all for the first time, but the second time was a very busy night and we ended up waiting about 15 minutes. The person dealing with orders in the front was very nice to my fiancé and gave us extra breadsticks for the wait. I definitely recommend this Olive Garden"}
{"text":"It is everything you would expect from an Olive Garden. The food is pretty good and you really can't beat the soup, salad, and breadsticks deal at lunch. The service is actually pretty good most of the time as well. 

However, I expect a certain level of presentation with food (just a clean good-looking plate), so imagine my face when my soup was delivered looking like someone had dropped a bomb in it --- soup all over the under plate and around the edges, on the napkins and spoon. Trying to manage around a bowl this sloppy in my business attire is not ideal!"}
{"text":"Always the Olive Garden, great salad, great breadsticks if you ask for extra garlic on them and modest entrees. Most of wait staff are cutting their teeth here so be prepared for some shortcomings. Most are generally in good spirits! We ask for Christy to be our server and Carolyn is the GM.
Come enjoy and try not to be a food critic while dining here this a family friendly place and is not the place to be pretentious. Kids are part of families so if you dislike dining around kids this is NOT the place for you?"}
{"text":"I love the food and the non-alcoholic drinks. I can't say anything about the alcoholic drinks as I don't drink, but they looked good too. Service is good, not great because they're always really busy, but as good as they can. I really like the fact that you can now pay right at the table and your debit or credit card never leaves your sight. Since this feature has started, I've begun going more frequently."}
{"text":"Came in for our 20th anniversary had an amazing meal served by Rose who I believe is my new favorite waitress, she went above and beyond to make this a great day for us and our family Thanks a bunch"}
{"text":"We decide to have lunch at Olive Garden. I wanted to check out this location because it's close to home. We arrive there around 12 o'clock. The restaurant was really busy, but we still were greeted warmly by the hostesses and didn't have to wait long for a table. The service was very good from the time we got there until we left. Our waiter's name was Angel. He was friendly and very helpful. The food was good. We will definitely be back there again!"}
{"text":"the food was ok, been there a few times, the salad is recommended 
there are some orders that were to oily but from time to time it gets better and better
the eggplants roll's are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Olive Garden.  Pasta.  Need I say more?  I always order the same exact thing.  Fettucine Alfredo with chicken and pasta e fagioli soup.  The soup has a bit of pasta, beans, and Italian sausage; it is great.  Their fettucine alfredo is always satisfying, their chicken is so-so.  It isn't my favorite but I feel like it has to be there so I can at least say I am \"trying\" to be healthy, right?

Their kid's menu is fantastic!  Search and finds, stickers, coloring crayons.  It truly is the little things like this that matter when trying to decide where to go eat when you have kids.  Plus they have their tabletop tablet which does cost $1.99 for unlimited games (we have never done it it but may when she gets older).  She also loves that she can choose whatever shape pasta she wants with whatever sauce she wants.

Plus the breadsticks!  Breadsticks and pasta go together like peanut butter and jelly.  You truly cannot have one without the other.  

Olive Garden is always my first choice when deciding when to eat if we have our daughter with us.  I know we will all walk away happy with full bellies (plus leftovers!)."}
{"text":"We used to love Olive Garden but over the last couple years it has really went down hill. We've eaten our last meal at Olive Garden.

I ordered Chicken Parmesan and the chicken was extremely tough and dry. It was inedible and I left the entire second breast behind. I substituted Fettuccine Alfredo for the spaghetti and they charged me $3 to do that so my meal was $18 for two breaded chicken breasts and a small serving of pasta.

My wife had the Chicken Marsala and she couldn't eat it. She said it was tough and dry also."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the sample of red wine while waiting for the lunch rush to vacate, about 30 minutes. Once seated we had a couple of staff stop by our table to offer us another free sample, but it was the 3rd person who took our order. He was funny, attentive, and kind... When my meal had a salad and my friend's didn't he brought two salad bowls so she could \"steal\" some salad, too. 

The shrimp fettuccine was delicious; my friend commented that the zuppa soup had a different sausage than previously used in the past, that this time the sausage was less spicy.

I ordered the long island limoncello, was good, but not what I expected. 

I would definitely go back and would recommend to friends... just wait til about 230-300 in afternoon when the craziness dissipates :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with fellow yelpers Lynn W and Rand H. Well to start i had the Italian chili soup and it was very good not the best soup I ever had but up there. Then I had the never ending pasta bowl and it was good as well. The garlic bread sticks that come with the pasta are alright but not as good as as regular cheesy garlic bread. when we left i was full and happy so yes yay i am a fan."}
{"text":"I come here every so often for lunch because my work is close.  Every time I am here we are greeted by the friendly hostesses that open the door and help us right away.  We get seated right away and the service is always great.  They work in teams and it seems like we always get what we want.  The unlimited soup, salad, and bread sticks are always there until we are stuffed and cannot move anymore."}
{"text":"I understand that it's the day after Christmas and no one wants to eat ham anymore but me and my family decided to call in a to-go order to get dinner tonight. We called around 445 and was told 545 it would be ready. We got there at 540 to pick up our order and there was already a line for to-go. The employee helped one customer and then disappeared for 20 min. She then helps one more customer and leaves again for a long period of time. When she comes back she takes down about 5 people's names to go check on our orders. By now our order should have already been out and served to us. By the time we left and got our food it was 620. Way after the expected time we were told to pick up our food. There were about 5-7 other people that waited just as long as us. There was one customer that we saw actually talk to a manager. I don't know if he got a discount on his meal but that is not fair when there were many people waiting. Point being. We should not have had to wait 35 min to pick up our food after the time we were told. The customer service needs to be improved by at least telling us it will take some time especially when the hostesses don't even know why it's taking long. Lack of communication needs to be improved and I would totally understand if everything was communicated to us and our orders were a little behind."}
{"text":"Best waitress ever! Her name is Debs. My husband never had to ask for a soda refill. He usually goes through 4 or 5 throughout dinner and has to ask everytime. Not today! The only thing that took away 1 star is they no longer have ceasar dressing. Ask for her and tip well she is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Olive Garden I have been to. I am a frequent diner at Olive Garden, but had my first experience with this particular one last week. My server was horrific. Being a previous server myself, I can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night. However, this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and I the entire time. Our salads came not even five minutes before our food was sent out. I am completely disappointed. I don't recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Slow didn't ask how much cheese we wanted on our soup like normal Olive Gardens does been like 25 min still no breadsticks and still waiting for food it's ridiculous no tip needed here"}
{"text":"Good food, service, and time with friends and family. Definitely coming back. The steak fettuccine is soooo goood, never though steak and alfresco sauce went together until I tried it here"}
{"text":"While Olive Garden may be the typical Italian restaurant I visit, if you want good affordable Italian food, you can find an Olive Garden just about anywhere.

In January and February 2017 they now have their \"Never Ending Classics\" which is similar to their \"Never Ending Pasta\" promotion. \"Starting at $11.99\" means the Spaghetti with Meatsauce is the only option for $11.99.  They offer Lasagna Classico, Fettuccine Alfredo, Chicken Alfredo, Chicken Parmigiana as an upsell ranging in prices up to around $18.

When you upgrade, you get that food item, plus all of the items that are cheaper on the menu.  Speaking with a few people, the majority of patrons get the one cheapest item, Spaghetti with Meatsauce which comes with unlimited breadsticks, salad, and soup.  That's a very good deal!  

If you go for the most expensive item, hey, it's still only $18!  That's still a killer deal.  If you want to go carb-crazy, you can't go wrong.

I've traveled all over the country and been in all kinds of restaurants, and I will say that the staff in this particular Olive Garden were highly trained, empowered to help, and were personable and attentive.

The Bar area was not busy and they didn't mind me hanging out for a little bit and working on my computer.  I wouldn't recommend using it as your Alt-Starbucks office, but if you want to check your emails for a half hour (while they aren't busy), it's pretty convenient.

I did ask for a minor substitution which the waiter did accommodate me but said it was against corporate policy.  I can appreciate any staff member that's empowered to make the customer happy."}
{"text":"Not one that's typically into chains but I love the Zuppa Toscana soup and salad here. Service is always exceptional at this location."}
{"text":"I'm back and decided to branch out from my usual of the Cucina Mia (cavatappi pasta with asiago garlic alfredo for my choice) and got the cheese ravioli with marinara and the chicken and gnocchi soup. PLUS, I got a frozen strawberry margerita. Everything was phenomenal as always. Thank you Olive Garden, this girl is a loyal fan for life! 10/10"}
{"text":"I know Olive Garden as a company has supposedly turned themselves around but after a recent visit here I was not impressed. I haven't been to this particular Olive Garden in a couple of years & decided to go here instead of the new Texas Roadhouse that is open close by. I have been on a different Olive Garden in probably the past year just for a lunch. I only come to this Olive Garden when I am in Surprise to see my parents. On this recent visit it was a Saturday night & a 30-45 minute wait. I understand that & was ok with that. They offered us 1/2 price wine at the bar while we waited which we took part in. I think our buzzer went off about 20 minutes after got there. 

We were led to our table & before sitting down I had to wipe food off the bench seat. I hate when servers just wipe tables off & it lands on the seats & they don't bother to wipe the seats up. I mean would you want to sit on food & ruin your clothes? There was also noodles stuck to the wall next to the seat where I had laid my coat & luckily I had seen it before pushing my coat further into the seating & getting it completely dirty. Floor was filthy dirty. Service was decent enough. I just do not like the like Point of Sales units on every table. I think it makes them look cheap & like a trivia bar. Not that Olive Garden was super fancy to begin with but it just makes it feel even lower class in my opinion. 

Ordered the sampler platter with calamari & stuffed mushrooms. Ick. Looked horrible & tasted horrible. Calamari were all stuck to each other. Stuffed mushrooms were drenched in butter sauce & just mush. Everyone in my party agreed it was not good. I had the Chicken Gnocchi soup which is my favorite. This time I had a few gnocchi's in it as a couple of years ago I had 1 gnocchi in the soup & had to ask for a few more (I mean if you're ordered a soup with gnocchi in the name shouldn't you get more than 1?) On this trip I ordered the Lobster Ravioli which was one of their limited time specials. Not impressed. It looked horrible when it came from the kitchen. Sauce only on about a third of the ravioli's. I had to ask for more sauce to complete the meal. Plate looked like it had been nuked. When I received the extra sauce (which took forever to get) it was so hot you couldn't touch the dish which was obviously nuked. Didn't care for the flavor of the dish. Original order of breadsticks that came out were hard & chewy. Definitely not the breadsticks I remember from Olive Garden. Other's in my party ordered the Shrimp Fettuccini & the Grilled Salmon. Shrimp Fettuccini needed more seasoning according to it's eater. I tried a bite & wasn't impressed. Other person loved their salmon & the broccoli that came with it. I guess the Salmon eater got the best meal. I told my party based on my experience there that night I wouldn't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place thats why i gave it 2 stars. I shared an entree with her. Because I didn't order my own and we refilled our salad, I was charged for a salad. Its NEVER ENDING salad and breadsticks. We shared a $20 entree and we ordered an appetizer, and I'm STILL charged for a salad! That's ridiculous. Oh, and there was five of us, it wasnt like we were trying to skimp out. Our waitress also neglected to keep our drinks refilled. Just not a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I love myself some Olive Garden and have always enjoyed my visits and take out meals. I feel horrible that I didn't leave 5 stars with previous experiences, but this last experience deserves less than 3, however I can't do that to a place I love! I ordered take out, waited 90 minutes for it to be ready, and then another 25 minutes just to wait in line to pick it up...fail! With as busy as this place is, they need a better system in place or at least warn you when you order so you know to get there much earlier to pick up. I ordered the chicken piccata...um new FAVORITE from a previous take out order. I am not a huge fan of sauces, so this one excited me; not the biggest fan of capers so this go around I opted to leave those out....sadly I was not informed I would be getting 2 dry and bland chicken breasts if I left off the capers.  Leaving the capers off, meant no sauce and sun dried tomatoes. Anyhow, lack of communication was the problem here and after getting home I certainly wasn't going back to wait in another line. I of course will return, but I now know not to modify the meal!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service. Always seemsto be busy, but they get you seated quickly. Always have a good time.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Great place to take your family. We ordered from  the $ 9.99 menu selections. Fantastic value for money. In my point of view the best dessert was the Salted Caramel Tiramisu. As always, our waitress, Hearher, was very courteous and professional."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with some friends. Everything was great at the restaurant. Love the breadsticks, by the way. You can never have too many on the table! Cut to 5 hours later waking up at 1 am to spend the next two hours vomiting violently. Sea food + vomit = ROWDY!!! Maybe it was my fault for ordering sea food in the desert??? Would normally give OG 4 stars but just can't do it this time."}
{"text":"Service was excellent as always, and the food great, but it's very frustrating to be sitting in the bar area and still have to listen to children crying, remember the good old days when you had to
Be 21 to even go into the bar area? I miss that time."}
{"text":"I've always liked their house-salad and their calamari. They need to go easy on the salt with the bread sticks. Could never complain about their service. The new menu is good. Avoid holidays for this location, the wait is seriously a killer."}
{"text":"New building and wonderful architecture! Service was the best I've had at any Olive garden!! Ask for Justin! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Best service I have received at a restaurant so far! I forgot what excellent service was until my husband and I came here. We have been to other Olive Gardens in other cities and towns and have received good service, even tipped well our servers, but this location takes the cake. We had someone who got us a table and got us started on drinks, don't remember his name though :( He was very friendly and he came back to make sure we were well taken care of by the waiter after we were done eating. Our waiter Phillip came in to take our order, and he provided excellent service. And the place was packed being it was on a Friday night which impressed me and my husband for the above-expectations service we received. I think that many other restaurants and places where customer service is given need to take notes from this Olive Garden. And for the record, the food was not expensive, where you would expect this kind of service. We even spoke with the manager that evening about the two servers who took care of us. Definitely going back! :)"}
{"text":"I went here on a tour today with 13 children from kindergarten through 5th grade. Susan and Gino were SO incredibly amazing with the kids and the children had the time of their lives! Susan and Gino went above and beyond to make sure the kids had everything they needed and had a memorable trip to Olive Garden.  The kids loved seeing the freezer, chowing down on 5,000 breadsticks, and loved all the fun goodies in their treat bags.  They were so patient with the children and seemed to really enjoy their questions, comments, and just watching their reactions to things.  This was the best field trip we have been on this entire summer and I'm beyond grateful.  Thank you so so so much Susan and Gino (and Jason for letting us visit)!!!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden is always the greatest, but my server derrin was amazing. he was so sweet and attentive. he went out of his way to make me happy and he is doubtlessly an amazing server!"}
{"text":"Typical Italian restaurant.  Even thought it's a chain store, the food is still good and not water down like some other fancy restaurants.  Since they no longer associate with Red Lobster, you won't be able to use Red Lobster's gift cards at Olive Gardens anymore.  They don't take expired coupons at this location either.  They serve unlimited soup or salad and bread sticks with any purchases, so eat up."}
{"text":"I love having lunch here once a week with my youngest niece.  We  both like and love the soups they serve and that is pretty much what we get.  I like the soup with the sausage and kale and she likes the minestrone one.  The bread sticks are always good.  The server this day did a great job and I was happy with him too.  Like this place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ate here twice this weekend.  Once on Friday and the other yesterday.  Friday was a early dinner and Sunday was a late lunch.  

If you want to read something that is long and drawn out move on.  My reviews are short and concise.  If you really want to read something long how about lets do the amount of swamp cooling required for a ware house here in Arizona. Step one.  Take the base * width * max height of goods going to be stored.  100' * 50' *15'=75,000 cubic feet.  Divide that by say 4 ACM.  That is 18750 CFM  required for this space.  Okay that is just a taste we can go on and on some other time.  We are here for the food. 

Friday visit.  Sat in the dinning area and order the zuppa Toscana.  It was really good.  I love their breadsticks and have to limit my self to two only.  I did order the baci cake.  I loved it.  Who ever prepared it put a generous serving of the white sauce over it.  It was good.  The cake was a bit dry, but with the sauce it was good.  

Sunday visit.  Sat in the bar to watch the DBacks play the Indians I believe.  The serviced started out a bit slow.  The young gal told me she would be right with me and she was.  I ordered the same soup and dessert as Friday.  It was good.  The bread sticks were good too.  I like the olive garden."}
{"text":"No. No. No. Other than the hostess/ greeter looking completely stupefied upon our walking in and her cohorts unprofessionalism, it took quite some time to be served, food of which lacked flavor. Our server was slow with requests (such as requesting upon order and not being served with order, therefore had to request again), did not remove dirty dishes as they accrued, and seemed to lack basic customer service skills. We will drive further to other locations prior to coming here again"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong going to Olive Garden, but this time I had a few hiccups. First they didn't want to sit us at a booth. Then the Waitress didn't seem to happy, and when we got our order everything was right but the type of pasta we ordered. I am not to sure why the cooks couldn't read the order or why the waitress didn't want to fixed the problem too. Either was done. Even the salad wasn't the usually either. Must have been a bad night but I pretty sure I will not show up at this one again."}
{"text":"I want to recognize a server at your Tempe, AZ location named Evan. I am traveling for work and of course stopped into my favorite restaurant. Evan was friendly, attentive and was dealing with another table of a large and difficult party. He was patient and kind and I was very impressed. Left him a 100% tip because he was the best server I've had at an Olive Garden restaurant."}
{"text":"Good Evening,
I must say that with all of the restaurants that struggle to keep the doors open because of lack of business, making someone wait 10 minutes for booth seating at 9:30 on a Saturday night until you can find an available server just does not make sense when the restaurant is three-fourths empty.  I surely will not rush back. 
By the way, I am eating a one of your neighboring restaurants."}
{"text":"Your typical Americanized Italian restaurant.. How can one go wrong..? 

We went during dinner tonight, and it sure was busy. I was told the wait for a table would be about 30 mins, however we were surprised the wait was only about 10 mins..!

Our server was super friendly and attentive. Refilled our drinks right away, brought out a larger portion of the salad, and split the entree in 2 dishes since we were sharing. We didn't have the 2 for $25. We ordered the calamari, chicken marsala (for my mom), and tried the shrimp scampi for the first time. Overall not bad, it hit the spot for what I was craving tonight. 

The only downside is the location. It's a bit out of the way from my side of town. I live in the southwest; this location is in green valley. 

Overall I would recommend this restaurant and will most likely make a repeat visit in the distant future."}
{"text":"i wouldn't normally even review an Olive Garden. everyone's been to one and you think you know what you're going to get. however...
we were seated and waited 10 minutes before Hakim came to get our drink order. since we'd had plenty of time to look at the menu we ordered our dinners too. 
we ordered a sampler w/ fried ravioli, calamari and stuffed mushrooms. i ordered spaghetti and chicken meatballs w/ pasta fagiole soup. Danielle got a build your own pasta w/ salad. Hakim brought the salad out but didn't bring my soup so we had to remind him to get it. then our sampler was brought but without any dipping sauces, so we had to ask for those also.
the dinners were fine, though i didn't care for my meatballs at all. i ordered them because i'd had them at the Montrose restaurant a couple weeks ago and thought they were real good. these were just not good. don't know why. just a different taste. 
i sense that Hakim began to notice my utter disgust w/ our experience so he started to be a very little more attentive though not much. he was slow to do anything. drink refills took long enough that he could have gone down the street to refill our drinks at a gas station. 
the one thing i'll give him credit for is that he didn't charge me for the chicken meatballs since i didn't finish them. that was nice of him. 
we won't be going back to this location again, though, as we'd had another bad experience here a number of months ago and the staff and management just don't seem to care about making customers happy."}
{"text":"Service was great! Called same day for catering and they did amazing! Great price, tons of food and the staff was very helpful"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday. First off the buser sat us down on a table that was dirty. There were crumbs on the seat and table with the bill from previous customers on the table. Then it took forever for the food and drinks to come and they were not even busy. Lastly, we order  an appetizer( 3 sampler one)that was either very old or over fried which I never experienced at any olive garden. This is my first time at this olive garden I have been to many others that have provided good service and food. I will not return to this location for the listed reasons above."}
{"text":"Quick efficient waiter but he was so fast he forgot our bread plates (not that we ever use them anyways) lol.  Just stopped by fast enough to drop off food and off he went.  It was ok.  We were starved and just wanted our food anyways. ;)  I just loved it.  Great food.  Awesome time."}
{"text":"I would say the staff wasn't the friendliest and the servers were slow to come. The bread sticks were not of the best quality."}
{"text":"We were one of the 1st customers this morning and seated immediately. We ordered an appetizer and our food all together. It took about 20 minutes for the appetizer to come out however it was not steaming hot.  When we got the , food 6 of or 7 entrees came put. They said the 7th chicken alfredo would be right out. At that point the waitress left.  Thirty minutes later and the entire table was out of drinks and the meal still hadn't come. We had to flag the waitress down to check the status. She hurried back to the kitchen and brought it out. When we got the food it was wrong. We had to ask for drinks to be refilled. It was terrible! Terrible service, the food sucked! This was the 2nd time we've visited an Olive Garden in the past couple months and the same terrible service & food.  The manager did give us a credit on the bill and it was appreciated however our family will never be back to an Olive Garden again."}
{"text":"I picked up some dinner here after seeing their current promotion on tv. Buy one pasta (from the choices offered) and take one pasta to eat later for $12.99 plus tax. Make sure and tell them which pasta you want first so you get that one hot since the second one will be cold and intended to be reheated. I got the spaghetti and 4 cheese meat sauce and mezzaluna ravioli with 5 cheese marinara. The spaghetti was good but the ravioli heated up later was probably a dish that is better eaten right away rather than later since the ravioli was a but dry around the edges. I had some pasta e fagioli and it always reminds me of Italian chili... so damn good.

Make sure if you are placing an order for pick up or curbside to go that you ask how many breadsticks they will give you. This location likes you rip you off on the amount of breadsticks your supposed to get if you don't eat inside. I ordered a side of alfredo dipping sauce and asked for a couple extra breadsticks. The girl over the phone taking my order said she could only give me 2 with my meal and 1 for the dipping sauce. Seriously??? They charge $3.79 for the dipping sauce and barely give you any in the to go cup as it is and you are only going to tell me this crap? This girl was short with me and made me feel like I was bothering her for even placing an order. I asked to speak to the manager, who said I was allowed 4 breadsticks for the 2 pastas I ordered and 2 for the dipping sauce. The manager said she had no idea why the girl taking my order would tell me that and that she would talk to her. When I arrived to pick up my order the manager personally gave me my food and apologized again. She ended up giving me like 10 breadsticks and extra dipping sauce so that was cool. I wish I could give 4 stars because the food is usually good even for not being real Italian food but customer service is not always great and if eating inside or picking up a phone order it takes longer than it should.

{"text":"How can a group's excitement to eat lunch turn into bouts of awkward silence and confusion?  Piss poor customer service that's how.  I was tortured as I watched salad plates, soup bowls and water glasses run empty.  The repeated attempts by have them filled and apparent lack of urgency on behalf of the server to assist.  Every other server seemed to be keeping up with their tables....but ours......was out to lunch himself."}
{"text":"We had almost given up on olive garden. The last few times we've gone the service and food has been horrific. Tonight, Anthony gave us amazing service and the food was better than our recent visits. Thanks for reminding us of why we like the good ol' OG!"}
{"text":"Tried to make reservations for my daughters 34 th birthday on a Sunday night but was told they don't take reservations. So we were there at 6:00 pm and were seated at 6:30. I took my server aside And asked for a full terrimisu for our birthday dessert with candles to celebrate at the end of our dinner. No problem he said. Our dinner was hap hazard, slow, and at the end the second server plopped down 9 servings of terrimisu on a foil tray for our dessert! No plates, candles, forks. No bags for our to go dinners and just left. Got the manager over and he apologized for the poor service and the little dessert as it takes 2 hours to thaw a full plate of terrimisu. Long story short... Bad service for a large party. Do not go here after 5:00 pm!!!"}
{"text":"We were excited this restaurant opened by our home. The service we received HORRIBLE! We were seated promptly, it was busy, all the tables were full. No one came to our table...no drinks, bread, a hello...nothing, for 15-20 mins. I saw the hostess that sat us & said \"excuse me\" to get her attention. She looked up at me from the stack of papers she was reading but couldn't be bothered enough to walk the 10 ft to the table to see what it was I needed. I had to go to her because I didn't want to shout my request. Another server said he would take our order & help us for the night. \"Joe\" did well and we had no complaints. But, I will be taking my business elsewhere for the the time being & near future."}
{"text":"First, i have to say, our waitress was very sweet, patient, & checked on us quite often. 
We waited 15 mins for a party or 2!!!!!!! Dinner time, but that is ridiculous!!!!!
Our appetizers came out just before our entrees, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms. The garlic breads that came out was nice and warm, but hard, the zupa toscana soup was delicious, however my salad hardly had any dressing, more croutons and onions, then lettuce & tomatoes. We ordered a shrimp fettuccine, which hardly had any alfredo sauce, so it dried up pretty quick & didn't have much shrimp no more than 10 pcs, mind you, this is dinner plates! i ordered the take 2,  which both were the chicken broccoli with alfredo sauce. i paid almost 60 for food that was OK!"}
{"text":"The parking is terrible no one else had a park in their parking spot to take up a space and a half in a park all I wanted was a gift card for $10 and you don't have any parking at Olive Garden and please get rid of that pre-order pick up parking spots that's the worst thing ever to happen to anything"}
{"text":"My first 5 star review--- this restaurant, staff and it's food are impeccable. Servers have consistently been so sweet, and the store manager needed my party to relocate and gave us a gift card for doing so. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Great service but food was marginal. Salad had huge hunks of lettuce (mostly) and could not taste any dressing. Suggest they sample salad bowl at Rigatonis. Had the lobster/shrimp raviolis and found very little of either in 3 of them and what was there was dried and hard to identify. It was covered with Velveeta like sauce! The dessert was great though...."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE, NASTY, ROTTEN, ATTITUDINOUS, ARROGANT, COCKY. I came in for lunch in November and asked for Coke Zero with no ice and a glass of wine from a fresh bottle. IMMEDIATELY the server, also the lady who was acting as bartender, said they only keep the opened bottles for x amount of time, as though SHE GETS TO DECIDE how fresh I prefer my wine. That was my very first red flag that this server was an argumentative know-it-all who did things HER way and was right about everything, leading to the worst experience in dining that I've had in probably years, and the worst at any Olive Garden ever. 

So I asked for fresh wine and Coke Zero with no ice. I gave the server a $10 bill as a good-faith gesture of getting part of her gratuity up front by showing I am not some rude ass who stiffs servers with $1 gratuities. She came back with the \"fresh\" wine and my Coke Zero and I started to say, \"Oops, I guess I got you flustered\" -- well, she cut me off right there. Great listener, huh? I was going to say the talk about fresh wine musta made her forget that I ordered no ice in the Coke Zero. She broke into my sentence saying, \"OH, YOU CAN'T FLUSTER ME. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WAY TOO LONG.\" So then I finished, as she set down my Coke Zero with 200 ice cubes in it. \"Well, I was going to say you musta been a bit flustered because you brought all that ice out.\" At that point, I was the jerk. She took the glass and brought it back sans ice. OK. Then I ordered a \"trio\" (some plate with three items) and she asked if I wanted soup or salad. I said, \"WELL, GEEZ, why not do it as an unlimited soup and salad? You still do that, right?\" She said yes, so I said to go ahead with that.

So the soup and salad comes.

About 30 minutes later, she swings by and asks if everything was OK. I said yes, except for the trio not arriving. She looked at me with a hostile air this time. \"You didn't order that,\" she said. \"You ordered unlimited soup and salad.\"

\"No,\" I said, \"I ordered the trio, and the unlimited soup or salad on top of that.\" Obviously her first impression of being a poor listener had carried through to the meal ordering. At this point, she didn't say, \"Oh, no! I'm sorry!\" or \"Let me fix that\" or \"Whoops\" or \"My fault! I'll put it in right now!\" Instead, she scowled, turned her back and walked off with no words at all.

Next a manager came over and asked what was going on and confirmed the trio had been ordered. I said it seemed odd that he was suddenly at the table handling the ordering as if I had done something WRONG. No, he said, he was \"Just helping out.\"

So the trio came. That was fine. Tasty, even. And maybe 5 or 15 minutes later he brought the check. I put a card in it. Guess what. The check not only didn't comp anything for the rude service and errors, it ADDED extra soup on to the tune of about $5. I waited to bring this up to the manager and he didn't return for THIRTY MINUTES. At that point I was a little steamed. The server had disappeared WITH MY $10 UP-FRONT TIP, as though I were an ASS, he had taken over, and denied anything was wrong, and THEN left me sitting for half an hour waiting to pay. So I explained myself a little more frankly. \"Your server didn't get the order right and walked off like I was a jerk, you take over, and you NOT only don't comp anything, you charge me for MORE than I ordered, then leave me hanging for 30 minutes.\"

His answer? He didn't know I wanted to pay. I ordered the UNLIMITED soup and salad, he said -- that meant I could have wanted to sit there indefinitely. 

Really? That is a lie, and an insincere response at best. WHAT'S MORE: He never offered to BRING any more soup or salad to begin with.

Well, that time, he took the excess soup off the bill and I think the trio. Fine. I still waited probably 15 minutes to have the check processed.

Bottom line? Your server here is BETTER THAN YOU, and you'd better worship at her temple. And if you don't, she'll KICK YOU OUT of it and have some insincere liar kick you around further. I STILL left a few dollars in the check presenter. ON TOP of the $10 she made off with.

DO NOT GO.

People like these should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"I understand the place is busy, we were seated and then waited...waited...wIted..finally we had to grab a girl walking by just to get water. We then met our waiter who took our order, our bead and salad came out, we ate, our soup came..all while my 4 year old was still waiting for her food, finally I got up and went to the front waited for  a mansger, made a complaint. 
The manager did take off the child's meal which I was thankful. .. I want to do a SHOUT OUT THOUGH TO SOMEONE WHO WENT OUT OF HER WAY FOR US A SERVER BY THE NAME OF TAMEKA ..I might have spelt that wrong, she checked on us, and took care of us EVEN THOUGH WE WERE NOT HER TABLE.THANKYOU!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good...love their peach tea. Disappointed menu selection isn't as great as it use to be."}
{"text":"I stopped in there just because I was in the area.  The server was really good and the food was good.  My steal was a hair under medium, but good though.  I do not mind it.  The bread sticks could have been a tad bit softer also.  I did enjoy the food though.  I like and will go back to this place.  Food is subjective and I know I am getting their version of Italian food.  I like the little computer thingy so I do not have to wait on a server to pay the check."}
{"text":"Service has gone downhill in the past 5 months.  Waited 20 minutes to be sat in an empty dining room at 5:15 on a Thursday afternoon.   Then sat and waited for a server to come take our drink order for 5 minutes as other servers just milled around not doing anything.   Server at the table beside us walked past us, made eye contact and continued walking.  Very poor.   Going to be our last time here."}
{"text":"Great experience! Food was delicious and quick. Mark, our server was just as awesome! We enjoyed it from the moment we sat down."}
{"text":"I'm usually a big fan of Olive Garden. I'm disappointed to say I'll be avoiding this one for now on. I gave it a good try by stopping in a couple of times. But, sad to say, as politically incorrect as it is, even a typically reliable big chain restaurant like Olive Garden is not immune to the lack of quality that often accompanies a big demographic shift like has happened in this particular area. The service was poor and the atmosphere didn't feel clean. Even the manager I spoke to wasn't up to par. I told him the chicken in my dish was weird chewy. He said ya we got a bad shipment recently. I thought, and you still served it!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden used to be a favorite of the family, recently they cut back the menu extensively and many of our favorites are gone.  I suggest checking the menu online before coming to see what's left."}
{"text":"Danielle was the perfect server - always smiling and came around enough but not too much, made good suggestions and generally let us be silly, nearby table neighbors were great, food was fresh and tasty. I had the crab topped chicken which was juicy and flavorful. The man had ravioli something that was also tasty - fresh pasta and good meat sauce. 

The salad and soup and breadsticks are always wonderful. We also got the bruschetta which was really perfect - not specialty, not gourmet, just perfectly normal, fresh tasting tomato, basil and olive oil yumminess.

We also had a trio of their Dolcini desserts which made it perfect so we could have tiramisu and the limoncello and strawberry stuff!

Overall, even though it was really busy and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table (although 'waiting' in the bar having a drink hardly counts as waiting), with the excellent service and great food this place definitely gets 5 stars from me and for a chain restaurant that is definitely something!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my wife and daughter for some dinner. Food was fair and was covered so heavily in sauce that most of the flavor was just overwhelmed. We each had an entree with calamari appetizer and the cost was over $72. To me this is out of line with the quality of food and portions. No chain restaurant should cost that much."}
{"text":"Great experience! From the moment you enter this location, the wait staff do a great job making sure you are taken care of. If there is a wait, they can usually give you a great estimate as to how long it will take to grab a table, and offer you a seat at the bar until it is your time to be seated.

Once seated the staff is great when it comes to detail and answering all questions you or your guests may have. The prompt attention given to refill of our drinks also is another reason we cannot stay away from this Olive Garden location.

I would definitely recommend this location for any fans of Italian food, Olive Garden, or just great customer service in general. I will continue to dine here, as well as take family and friends."}
{"text":"This is a four star review for the OG.

I won't hate on this chain. Mostly because I've learned to appreciate the art of chain eating. I am a foodie, and that means appreciating culinary art at locally owned restaurants, but also indulging at chain restaurants that succeed on processed, frozen foods just because it's fun.

On this particular night, I was exhausted from unpacking my stuff, and wanted to have a fun meal out with my parents. We chose this location, and it lived up to my OG expectations.

Service was great, and the food was A-Ok.

Was it the best, most authentic Italian food ever? No. Did I expect that? No.

Did it do the job? Yes.

Come on guys, the salad, breadsticks, and mediterranean chicken makes for a pretty nice meal.

I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Can't find the right time
To go in when the service is good. Maybe it's not enough servers."}
{"text":"The food is always so good and the service is great... i love bringing my family and friends here..."}
{"text":"To be honest, I typically avoid these chain restaurants at all costs- I live in the city and love to explore new independently owned restaurants with good food and good character. However, the person I was going on a date with suggested this place and I respectfully accepted. We went here on a Saturday afternoon and I expected everything to take forever. On the contrary, I was seated right when I walked in and even was visited by the waitress twice before my date got there. In fact, the waitress during the entire meal visited our table maybe a dozen times. I would hardly ever complain about a waiter coming to the table too often, but I couldn't even talk to my date! Anyway, you know exactly what you're going to get when you go to the Olive Garden- the unlimited breadsticks and salad are addictive, so you're pretty much full by the time you get your food. Something that seemed quite suburban and a contributor to American obesity is they had a special where you could get two entire meals for the price of one- one to eat in restaurant and one to take home for later. While I cringed at this, my date encouraged me to get it so I got a veggie ravioli in house and could select any other entree to stink up my car on the ride home (which I unfortunately never ate)- and I chose the ziti. The ravioli was good and I generally had a good experience. I probably won't revisit this place anytime soon, but it is by no means due to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I really like this place and try to visit every time I come to town.  This location is FAR better than the one closer to my primary home."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at an Olive Garden in at least 20 years but I was meeting a friend over her lunch hour and craving pasta, so off we went.

The place was packed but we were seated quickly and our server was very nice, helping us to decide which items to order.

I appreciated that there were side items that could be ordered ala carte.  This made for a more varied lunch but also helped with portion control.

We ordered soup, salad, a tiny side of spaghetti and roasted asparagus, along with some yummy meatballs.  I also tried one of their lemon desserts, which was yummy!

So overall, this was a good meal.  It wasn't haute cuisine but the price was right.  I get why chain restaurants do well...consistency and no surprises are comforting for some diners.  

Olive Garden appears to be moving to attract a slightly different diner.  They now offer happy hour items and pricing.  The ability to customize by ordering add-on items is another value add for diners.

I don't eat pasta often but this lunch was good.  When OG adds more variety to the menu (sauces, specials, appetizers), I'll consider eating there more often."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, however I docked to stars because our waitress was extremely slow and very forgetful!"}
{"text":"I stopped by to see a relative after a wedding out in the area.  I just had the soup and salad.  I sat at the bar.  The server was good and stayed on top of my drinks and brought me soup as I needed.  I like the potato soup they have there.  It has some good flavour and reminds me of a soup my mother used to make as a kid.  I like the olive garden for a quick and convenient place to eat."}
{"text":"You know going in that the food isn't going to be incredible, but you'd at least expect the staff to be friendly. This particular OG is very hit or miss. I've had both good and horrible dining experiences due to the waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"The food was good, but our waiter got our order wrong twice. My friends and I had to wait three times to make sure we got our correct order. 
Atmosphere is lively and great.
Cleanliness is what you would expect for the big chain restaurant.
Service was sub par.
Food was above average.
Value for the money, was middle of the pack."}
{"text":"We were seated but never served. After the ladies took our name up front at the hostess stand Monday night we waited just a couple minutes for a booth. We were then seated in the boots right beside the bar we were given menus and told that the server would be right with us. After several minutes went by we had plenty of time to look over the menu sit back and discuss about what we were going to order we watch the server come in the little room drop off food apologize to the people behind us for the wait I watched him drop off refills. Now about 15 minutes has gone by he has seen us he made eye contact with me never once stopped and apologize for the wait or said I'll be with you in a moment just completely ignored us. So at this time we've now decided that we were just going to go to another restaurant I had stopped up front and let the hostess know that we sat there for about 15 to 20 minutes no one ever approached us no one ever got us drinks and no one ever said we'll be right with you. The hostess said well I can get you a new server and I told her no it's okay. I really wish the server would of just swung by our table and made some kind of contact with us and told us I'll be with you in a moment or send up buster over to get us some drinks. Extremely disappointed in the service that we never got."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love to take the occasional trip to Olive Garden and this was our second time at this location. I want to say his name was Jonathan but I am not 100% sure. He was so helpful, energetic and very friendly. Our food came out very quickly and we always had our waters refilled when necessary. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have gone to Olive garden for years, and maybe for lack of other Italian style restaurants....well now there is Romano's, Buca, and so forth.
I've gone in high school for military ball, for my child's birthday (at her request!), and just for dinners...
This time we went just for lunch, specifically for soup, salad, breadsticks lunch. Another unbeatable lunch combo, and we were literally in and out within 45 min. Food is really good here, especially since I'm a sucker for all things pasta.
They have great cocktails and wines, and there is a bar in here if you just want to go have a drink and no food.
Also the coffee specialty drinks are great. SO is the tiramisu. 
I think it's getting a bit pricey, but honestly it's competitive to what else is out there for the same type of food/atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love the soups and the house salad. We had the Shrimp and Chicken Carbornara along with the Portobella Ravioli, we couldn't pass up dessert but had to take that to go because we had to digest our fabulous meal. Charles was a fantastic server and was very attentive to our needs!"}
{"text":"The waitress was rude and incompetent. I was waiting for 15 minutes after I asked for breadsticks (which are complementary). Not a good place to eat, DO NOT EAT HERE EVER. ESPECIALLY WHEN JACQUE IS WORKING!"}
{"text":"OMG, here again at my daughters  request !
Waiting to be seated !
Ok, seated, nice waiter, got a glass of wine and ordered !
Well, all food was delicious !!

Service was good, waiter was Bill."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome anytime I've been here. I've been coming in more and more lately, craving chicken and gnocci soup bread sticks and salad! Oh and peach tea!! I've been here twice in the past week for lunch.  The only thing I question is if the peaches are frozen? They are kinda weird lol otherwise I can't complain. Servers Shannon and Carolina waited on us and they were great! Whatever your doing keep it up Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is 5 stars! Always a pleasure when dining in or curb side to-go! Love this place"}
{"text":"Worst Olive Garden experience of my life.  Service was awful, soup was awful and i came to enjoy my favorite soup.  Ziti had so much cheese I couldn't mix it and coat all of the noodles in sauce...did I mention the service was awful.  Thank goodness others are better."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with how much better this location has gotten! Food is Wayyyy better than it used to be. Service was great! Awesome job in turning things around!"}
{"text":"Hands down the friendliest OGIR that I have ever been in."}
{"text":"By far the best experience I've had at ANY Olive Garden !!! This will be the new go to , no matter how far the drive ... We will make it !!!! I was so pleased with the service tonight with it being so busy and they even gave us a free dessert!! Our server was the absolute best ! We need one of him at every restaurant in phx lol I wish I could remember his game but he was a very contemporary, respectful, personable, and hard working server ! Little bot older but he was AMAZING, hands down! We will be back just because oh him!!!
Date on this day was 2/13/16"}
{"text":"Great foood, great service.  
THE RESTAURANT STINKS!
Smells like vomit.
I think it may be the carpet; full of years of ground in food. The smell made it hard to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Were there last night four V-Day dinner and it was fully packed. At 8:40, we were told that the wait time was an hour and 45 minutes but we got a table in almost 30-35 minutes. They definitely need to work on the algo that determines Wait time.

Ordered Tour of Italy, which i think does justice to it's name. 3 dishes in the price (and portion) of one. Alfredo Fettuccine could have been better. Barely had any sauce. Parmigiano Chicken and lasagna were good.

The hubs ordered a stuffed chicken masala and he enjoyed his meal too.

Their bread and salad are a hit always but i don't understand why they no longer serve salad as soon as they sit their guests. Salad was served only a few minutes before the main course."}
{"text":"Set was great.  Jennifer was the name put a great face to the company .  Good service busy sat nite had table with in 5 min. About 8:pm. They were kinda busy at first but my cup was never empty Cutlery passed the wife clean test and food cane fast and hot. They split our plate to two ( we shared) . I love my wife.      Good all around I would come back.  Clean new look for the Olive Garden.  Waitress was great"}
{"text":"If you like OG, you'll like this one.  Good service to boot."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden, BUT!! This particular place has a very weird smell...
Front personnel aren't always nice - they treat you as if they were doing you a favour instead of hosting.
My amount of stars is solely for the food and the waitresses that we had."}
{"text":"Brian and Valentina (our waitress) was amazing. The service here is impeccable! My twin sister and I came here for our 22nd birthday... the service was fast and friendly. When I requested a little more sauce for my pasta Valentina did not hesitate to fix it. She moved with tenacity and with a purpose. She made me feel important and as if she cared about my meal even with having other customers. Towards the end of the visit, Brian (her boss), came over and made causal conversation about our birthday. He even bought us dessert which was very sweet and thoughtful!! *Everyone MUST try the cheesecake! It was amazing.* 
I will definitely be back again with family and friends... hopefully with Valentina as OUR server"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place to go. We were here (usually in a fairly large family group) several times a year. Lately the food and service have not been as good as usual, but the last straw was when I called to let them know of a large group we were taking and I was told no. They refused  o accommodate the group because they are too busy on Saturdays. That was my last straw. Good luck if you try to dine here."}
{"text":"I ordered To Go soup and salads for 930pm pick up time. I arrive at 931. My house is right across the street, when I'm all settle in to eat, I open up my food and it's cold. I quickly grab my phone and see how long I've been lolly-gagging and the time reads 9:45. I call and the manager states we can remake my food, I ask for a refund, she says no worries! I go in to pick up the gift card and happen to meet the hostess, Nataliya. She greets me and I state I'm here to pick up a gift card, I tried to get my name out and the reason and she cuts me off, stating that's for a manager, not her, as another hostess, Amanda, comes running up and interrupts her focus to complain about their co worker. I turn to go sit down and wait for them to finish their conversation before she gets her manager. As I say to wait for the manager, I ended up hearing more gossip! (Which unfortunately, weighed heavy on the customers coming in and the quality of work the two, well three, as I didn't catch the guys name, we're giving ) I thank Shelly for her kind service, but I'll never be coming back to this location. Cold food and bad customer service aren't getting my hard earned money!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner. Chefs were about to accommodate my dietary restrictions. Very impressed with all substitutions. Waitress was amazing. Even offered breadsticks with no butter & garlic. She went above & beyond to check ingredients on my meal."}
{"text":"Your usual Olive Garden Italian dinner, but good decent service. 

Had the chicken scampi. It promised a creamy garlic sauce. It was good, but when I think garlic I think GARLIC. I have been spoiled by eating at smaller Italian places that don't hold back on the garlic I guess. Like I said though, it was good. 

This would be a good safe place to bring your family and friends. Just don't plan on being impressed by the food."}
{"text":"Great all around customer service. The waitress name was Rachel. She was fast and friendly. Very peaceful environment not to fast paced. I didn't feel rushed while I was eating. The decor was Italian style however it was a tad outdated. 
The food came out quick and I liked that. Everything was fresh with the exception of he fettuccini noodles. My husband order he endless pasta. I order he your of Italy. I would not recommend the endless pasta. It does not compare to red lobster endless. It was served on a very small plate for the refill. That was very unappealing. The meat that was provided was skimpy for the refills as well. The tour of Italy was amazing though. The chicken was crusted perfectly and seasoned great. The lasagna had just the right amount of meat sauce.
All and all the experience was good. I would recommend this particular Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Will never come back. Waiter took forever to come and take our order, didn't receive salad/breadsticks until 25 mins after sodas were served. Waiter served 5 tables (that came after us) instead of us. When waiter noticed one of the guests on our table - she then started coming over to our table and refilled all the empty drinks & brought salad over. 
I let the waiter know that we had been waiting over 40 mins for our food - she snapped back stating \" I know and I don't know why it's taking forever\"
Food came out 10 mins later ... waiter came back and let us know that she spoke with manager and offered free dessert. Some food orders were wrong- we didn't bother sending it back because they would've probably taken another hour with the food."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurant.  Todays visit was really bad.  Burned food, over charged, missing mushroom in portabello fettuccini, unattentive server.  She only replaced the burned portion of my order instead of taking in the plate and replacing it with a new one.  Have to take out the food caused it took a long time for the food to get served."}
{"text":"Disappointing - Big Fail!  I do not recommend going in the evening.  They have a policy that you cannot leave the restaurant after 10:00 pm - meaning that if you want to step out to your car or go outside to get some fresh air that they will not let you back into the restaurant. 

We went in with a large group of over a dozen people around 9:00 pm and at 10:00 pm a couple of our guests stepped out and the staff refused to let them back in. We explained that we had been coming there for many years and that our guests did not speak English and did not understand their policy. 

Martin E., the manager, refused to allow them back in - effectively forcing our whole group out before finishing our meals and ordering dessert.   The only thing he repeated was that it was a corporate policy that he had to enforce. Purely ridiculous. 

Olive Garden (corporate) should  invest in teaching its managers common sense. (The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the waiters were very apologetic about the whole thing). 

Not planning on returning until they decide to value their customers."}
{"text":"I know everyone likes to make fun of Olive Garden.  Some say that it isn't authentic Italian food, and they say some things get microwaved.  I cannot really speak to that.  All I know is that I like the food quite a lot.  You can call it Pseudo-Italian or whatever you like.  I call it delicious!  Their alfredo sauce is incredible.  All of the dishes and appetizers that I have tried, have been great.   This location in particular is really good.  The staff is friendly.  When I tell them that I am at a restaurant to enjoy the service of a waitress or waiter, and I don't want to use the dumb table kiosk, they say, \"No Problem.\"  I really like this place and I will, and do, come back often."}
{"text":"It was our first time taking both kids with us to Olive Garden. We came here several times before with friends. This place is very kid friendly! We got seated right away as soon as we asked for a table. The kid activities books was well made, and it kept my 5 year old busy for a good 20 minutes. Our waiter was pleasant. Food came out very fast. 
I like it that we got soup, salad, and breadsticks to start. My two boys love the chicken and gnocchi soup. They dipped the breadsticks in the soup, and it was so yummy.  To make it even better, unlimited refills on breadsticks, soup and salad . Salad was simple, and refreshing. We ordered calamari, chicken margherita, chicken and shrimp alfredo. (I forgot the name of this dish). Calamari was good. Portion is not small. The two of us couldn't finish the whole calamari order. By the time entrees come, we were already 70% full lol.  The breaded chicken in chicken margherita was very good. The breading was airy, crunchy, and paired well with the tender chicken breast and marinara sauce. 
It was overall a great dining experience with quick service, yummy food, and everyone was pleasant."}
{"text":"Lunch time and lunch menu is a winner. We had a large party from my workplace celebrating about 4 birthdays. Our waitress and waiter were very nice. They helped each other which is always good to see. The bread sticks were continuous, they were quick to bring additional items like oil and vinegar for dipping. The drink glasses remained full and the bowl of lemons for our waters were refilled when needed. The food was very good, hot and nice looking. The birthday people enjoyed using a special coupon for dessert. Boxes arrived in a timely manner along with checks. I liked that they gave us the option of paying at the table or having it taken to the register. Everyone wins that way. The restroom was clean and well supplied. I think the evening menu prices are way too high, but lunch prices, service and portion size are great. 
Pizza bowl, quesadilla, soup and salad were all excellent choices."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Waited around 10min before the bartender acknowledged my presence to order a glass of wine that I then waited another 15min before receiving that glass. The bar was essentially empty and yet remained without bussing service for over 20min - bartender just pushed it aside. Additionally, I did not receive the food I ordered. After ordering the Scampi Frittata Spicy, I received the non-spicy version and it was definitely cool in temperature. When brought up to the bar tender she suggested she would take my dish back and get I tossed in spicy sauce, since she had not heard my request. I refused - not wanting my food to go behind closed doors and back. Too much work for one person!!

Update: bartender did come back with an offer to reorder."}
{"text":"Here it is a year later and even though I have brought my large group every 3 months or so to this Olive Garden since my last review, the food is still delicious, the salad is very fresh, the bread-sticks are warm and the service is amazing.  I would like to thank Manager Steve Johnson, Stephanie and all of the servers and other employees for making our visit tonight of 30 people a yummy and fun time.  The service was fabulous and every employee makes you feel like you are part of the Olive Garden family.  The buy one take one home meal is such a great value.  A year later, I still highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Health board should be notified. First a dirty coffee cup. Then after 20 minutes waiting to get a clean one my wife decides to us the paper cup they provided. She make her coffee, stirs it with the teaspoon and looks at the spoon and realizes the spoon has dried food on it also. I could only imagine what the dishes that our food was served on looked like before they put our food on it. I then talked to the manager on the way out and he offered Nothing. Only said they would not know if I didn't tell them. Sad Sad Sad and disgusting"}
{"text":"Not Shabby. I did the pick up option. When I called the hostess, she seemed to be a sweetheart, but when I got the food the person was a short white man with a spotty beard. HUH??? When i opened the packaging it did smell like crap but tasted pretty good. I slurped up the spaghetti pretty quickly but not as quick as I wanted. Anyway a pretty great experience!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a bad place. Most often a great experience. However , Tonight the cook messed up our meal..the server had him fix it. The cook apparently just rearranged the plate because the chicken my BF BIT INTO was on the \"new order\" it was hilarious but oh so wrong. Thankfully the manager expresses how appalled and embarrassed he was ,which i would be too and comped our $50 meal. Very appropriate to do so...great management!"}
{"text":"I'm much more a fan of the Olive Garden than I used to be! We had a very nice experience here. We came for the \"all you eat pasta, salad and breadsticks for $8.95\". Service was quite fast and very friendly. I had a glass of wine and hubs a draft beer. All of the plates, glasses and silver seemed newer and more sparkly than prior. 
The portions are pretty big, so the all you can eat aspect ended up being one helping of each there and a helping to go. They actually put our second pasta right into to go containers with fresh new breadsticks and bagged it right up. 
I felt kind of like a cheapo getting the second to go, but they offered to just do it that way without us even asking! We accepted and had a great lunch the next day as well!"}
{"text":"Ate here the other evening with some out of town family members. Justin was our server and what a pleasure. He really offered great suggestions from appetizers to our entrees into our desserts. It was a great dining experience for all of us."}
{"text":"This had to be the saddest and worst Olive Garden I've ever been too! The asiago garlic alfredo was overcooked and under cooked... The garlic was too cooked and too soft to the point where it just melted in my mouth! There was no sauce for the alfredo too! Very dissapointed! Even my wife, who loves Olive Garden, found it very disappointing! We will not be visiting this location again..."}
{"text":"If you ever come to this location and they ask if you'd like to get a table at the cafe area, decline it and wait for an actual table because the servers will almost never come to serve you, let alone clean the table from the previous guests that sat at the table... Waited a good 10 minutes for a server to clear it. Even the manager didn't do anything about it but talk to the old people to the table next to the table my fiance and I sat at. Very disappointed with this visit."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go, won't be doing that again. I placed my order online, then arrived after the designated time, then waited 27 minutes for my food. I got a soup and salad, I could have made it from scratch faster."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the Olive Garden! Out waiter was great and went out of his way to make sure we were fully stocked with breadsticks and of course the zappa toscana soup!  The main dish the chicken lasagna special was definitely solid! I actually love the table top payment system gets me out in a hurry when I'm ready to hit the road.  As I've heard real Italian men say \"manja\" I don't know what it means but it think it's good!  Don't over think it og is on point."}
{"text":"Great location. I have never had to wait too long at this location and service has always been great! Make sure you go during never ending pasta bowl or during lunch for soup and salad! Often there are coupons in the paper as well. I enjoy their zuppa tuscana, Alfredo dipping sauce and of course, the breadsticks!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Olive Garden, and this is a pretty standard one. They are all set up the same way, aren't they? Lunch special is cheap if you can get there before 4pm ($7.99 endless soup, salad and breadsticks). The lasagna frita appetizer is so delicious - make sure you try it! And try subbing ranch for their italian salad dressing - it's my new favorite (why don't they sell it at the grocery store too??)."}
{"text":"A chain place of eating that I do enjoy eating at. This location's service can be sub-par one visit and pretty good the next. It all really depends on the time of day that you go and how many servers are working that day. 

The food is well chain quality italian food, but yet comfort food to me. If you are in the mood for Italian and want to go to a place that is well comfortable and you know what you will get...then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Ugh! I just can't eat here anymore. I love Olive Garden, possibly more than the average person but on three different occasions in the past 12 months I found hair in my food!!! One time I told a waitress and she said it looked like mine! It was a short brown hair and I have long blondish-brown hair. I don't think so. 

I am so totally grossed out by this location. I will make the trek to Norterra or Old Town because a girl needs her soup and salad every now and then, just hold the hair please."}
{"text":"Pretty average food. Good service, unless they are busy--then it's slow. I like their soup, salad, and breadsticks."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Always. There has never been a time that I was disappointed in the food at Olive Garden. I went to this location for my Father's Day dinner. It was extremely busy, and my one and only tiny little issue was, I felt like the wait for my breadsticks was entirely too long. The waiter was amazing, and I would have tipped thirty percent for sure, but as it was not me paying, I think he only got the customary twenty. He deserved better! I'm going to go again, and give him a huge tip to make up for it."}
{"text":"This place was very popular when we visited soliciting a 30 minute plus wait. We were lucky to sit immediately in the very nice bar area. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food is as good as it always has been and is consistent as it always is in every location throughout The country.  Took advantage of the $10 build your own option making it a great value for the money."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden but this location needs some improvements. It's a bit older, dirtier, and messier than some others. It seems the food is just OK compared to other locations for some reason unknown. I'll be back again some day and I will give an update."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, clean restrooms, staff is always very friendly, and for as busy as they are they do an excellent job. 

Because of the area, demographics, and now the cheap $25 special they have you do hear crying babies and other loud noise that previous I didn't see as much in Olive Garden. 

Toscana (sp?) soup is amazing, I add red onions from salad and if any left the banana peppers. Mussels are small, but most places are.. All in all it's white Italian food as long as that is what you are expecting you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden. Like a lot. I've been to this specific one a couple times this year like this past Valentine's Day (2014). I was expecting a mad house since I didn't call ahead but to my relief the wait was maybe 15 minutes since it was just my boyfriend and I. Not just that, but we got a really nice, somewhat secluded, and low lit booth away from the families and kids dining in. It was just a section with quiet couples. Amazing. Their food is the best Italian that I can always count on."}
{"text":"I love Italian food. Never visited an Olive garden before. My wife had a $25 dollar gift card, so I took my wife here to use the gift card and try out the olive garden. 
  My first impression upon walking in was not good due to the bad smell. Smelled like stale Parmesan cheese mixed with the body odor of several people that havent taken a bath in a month.  I sat down and was given menus. The menus had dried food smeared all over them from previous customers. 
  The waiter had cookie crumbs on his shirt, and what appeared to be salad dressing stains on front of shirt. 
  I was tempted to walk out, but decided what the hell, lets use this gift card up. 
 Ordered the special   unlimited bread sticks, soup, or salad, and pasta with sauce for me and wife. (9.99 each)
 Waiter brought a basket with a whopping 3 bread sticks. I got the salad, wife got soup. The salad tasted pretty good, but mostly had just 3 green salad leafs. The rest was mostly salad stems, onions, croutons and other junk. They give you a big bowl of salad and it is mostly stems. I could have asked for more salad, but I might have to argue about not finishing what was brought to me. 
   The pasta seemed to have been sitting around for a while before I arrived. It was dehydrated and not fresh. had to use knife and fork to cut it up. The marinara sauce had an off smell and taste to it. I could only manage to force myself to take a few bites. What crap!!!! The back ground smell, and the pasta smell and taste almost had my stomach churning. 
    the fun part was when the waiter brought the check. The total was 28.39, I gave him the 25 dollar gift certificate, and 3.40 in cash. had to wait for 15 minutes for my change., and waiter tried offering us dessert, which was included. I declined desert, as the deserts were probably crap too. I took my penny of change and departed with out leaving a tip. Needless to say I wont be coming back there. The prices are a bit high, and the quality of the food is terrible. The staff seems friendly and attentive, but jeezz the smell in there just makes you look at at the dirtiness around you more, and makes you wonder how clean is the kitchen."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours to be seated. They don't take call aheads or reservations. Food was cold. Dinner was over 150. Service okay. Waited too long to be seated."}
{"text":"We were at the Olive Garden just off of 95 and Cheyenne in Las Vegas about 3 weeks ago for dinner.  We have only had good experiences.  Its not always the good experiences that get written about.  We had a short wait in the lobby and then brought to our table.  We started off with the appetizers and we normally order the appetizer trio. and we picked the stuffed mushrooms, calimari, and cheese sticks.  We like to take our time so we always tell the waitress to take her time with bringing out the food so we dont get the apps, lettuce or soup and and entrees 2 minutes apart,  we like to enjoy.  Well the soups and drinks came out  with no breadsticks and had to ask for the breadsticks again before we couple take our 4th spoonful the apps were at the table and stilll not breadsticks.  We asked again and finally got them.  when the apps came, the protion size was smaller the usual.  Less then a handful or calimari, 5 stuffed mushrooms when there was 6 and the cheese sticks.  I made a comment when the waitress was there and she said nothing as if ignoring what i said.  I told the waitess to hold the main course until she saw that we were almost done with the apps.  Telling her this was like talking to a wall.  Within 5 minutes the main course was brought out and we were not even done with them.  To top it all off, I ordered Chicken parm and you would normally get 2 nice size pieces with a crunchy breading.  I was very dissapointed and I did call the company that owns them to tell them.  They sent a small gift card and asked that I call the next time we came in.  i did forget the mention that when they would put down a plate it was like they were intentionally banging the plates on the table.  Well we did go back and i will tell you what happened in my next review."}
{"text":"Great just like many other Olive Gardens.  The food was good, came fast, and our waitress Rebecca was great"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Olive Gardens for years.  This particular location has always been good, but not great.  It often appears to be rather disorganized - especially trying to figure out what tables are open, etc.  The food is good, but often the service has been on the slow side - seems too few waitpersons for the number of tables.  I'll recommend them, but only if you have plenty of time to eat.  I would not recommend them if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Oh Olive Garden...you really impressed me with your new menu options and I'm very happy to write this review!

It had been a while since I've visited and OG, mainly because I was tired of always ordering the same thing. But my parents were in town and wanted to stop in for dinner so I figured...why not?!?

We started with the Moscato, what I love about the wine here is that they always let you sample prior to ordering a glass and now they offer a glass and a half...whoooo hoooo! The Moscato is sweet, fruity and crisp! One of my absolute favorites!

Our appetizer was the lasagna fritta which is Parmesan breaded lasagna pieces, fried and served over Alfredo sauce topped with Parmesan cheese and marinara sauce. I must say this was a very delicious way to start the meal! The fried pieces of lasagna were hot and crispy and the two sauces and cheese were a perfect compliment! I would definitely recommend this to anyone! 

We also had the Zuppa Toscana which is spicy sausage, russet potatoes and cavolo greens in a creamy breath and salad. For the meals we had Tour di Mare which has three small portions of their creamy shrimp Alfredo, shrimp scampi fritta which are a new item of lightly fried shrimp tossed in a garlic and white wine sauce! They were very good the mix of favors offers a very unique taste! We also tried the Bucatini with meat sauce. The pasta is a little thicker that spaghetti noodles but equally delicious! 

Our server was outstanding and our food was delicious, I am absolutely looking forward to going back and trying some more of their new menu items!"}
{"text":"My fiancé came everyday while he had the Never Ending Pasta Pass and bragged about the Centennial location... the cleanliness and staff. We just recently visited together and the management team and staff is absolutely wonderful. Kacie was an absolute delight and made us feel like a family. She's an amazing manager! Highly recommend coming!"}
{"text":"Things I liked
- Put out little snacks for people waiting due to long line
- Portions were very large
- Can't beat breadsticks/salad
- Waitress was nice and accommodating

Things I didn't like
- No toilet paper in the men's bathroom
- They don't take reservations
- Chicken in the fettucine alfredo tasted like it had been frozen and the fettucine was stuck to itself
- Herb grilled salmon was overcooked and the parmesan garlic broccoli did not have much parmesan or garlic, this dish was essentially a piece of salmon with  1/2 a pound of steamed broccoli"}
{"text":"I use to love coming here as a kid. I feel so sad that this restaurant went down hill. Sometimes I crave coming here and I'm hoping it will be the same as it use to be but every time I come it's not. The food is not that great for what you pay for. The breadsticks are hard and cold, the soup is cold, salad is old. My waitress was rude and me and my family had to take our food to go because we felt uncomfortable. Had a better time at home! I hope Olive Garden steps it up."}
{"text":"The service was good, our waitress was very pleasant and attentive, and I enjoyed my custom Tour of Italy. The salad was better than it was last time...it was very good! I enjoyed my visit very much. Good job O.G."}
{"text":"Ok, it's Olive Garden so expectations weren't high to begin with...but...

My grandson wanted Chicken Alfredo and that's why we came here.  The hostess was surly. The table we were seated at was chipped and old,  the entire decor was tired and in need of freshening.  
Our server was sweet and attentive and seemed a bit apologetic about the condition of things.  
I ordered the soup and salad which I've had many times at other locations.  Here the salad was brown and the soup,  served in tiny bowls,  was a salt bomb and the gnocchi was just flour and gooey.
Grandson thoroughly enjoyed his Chicken Alfredo so that was a win but never again will I darken the door of this particular Olive Garden."}
{"text":"It was around 2 o'clock so there was no wait...we got seated quickly...the beginning of the service was great. Asked our drink orders and for appetizer...we decided to go with the two meals for one deal ..the one you get to bring one home with you...

We decided on the endless soup with our entrées. Our first basket of breadsticks...seemed over cooked or old because they were kind of hard. Nothing I can't deal with though...got our first bowl of soup...after we finished our soup breadsticks and drank all of our water we sat for a very long time....even turned on the server light on their IPads they have sitting at the table no one came....we sat dry and empty for over 15 minutes. 

Waitress finally came back and she had our actual meals and apologized by saying she was in the office...she then asked if we wanted more soup (because it was supposed to be endless) and breadsticks...we said yes...some other waiter came and gave us one bowl of soup and some breadsticks. The waiter said nothing about where the other bowl of soup was.

After one of us was all done with our meal she came back and said she was sorry they were working on the second meal to go home and they didn't have any of the soup ready for the one they forgot to bring out....granted she did fix it by sending 2 bowls home with us. But the whole experience was very slow, drinks ran out and were not even filled within 10 minutes of being empty, didnt have some of our food we had asked for with no explanation till after the meal was done...we were there for over an hour ...which shouldn't have been the case. 

I do love Olive Garden but will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"This is the first time we've been to this location. We have been to one other location since moving here and I was sure that I would never go to an olive garden again. I must say this was a game changer. we went around 7 o clock and it was a full house! I expected our service to be not so great. This was hands down the best experience I have had at an Olive Garden anywhere! Every single person we walked by welcomed us....as well as thanked us and said to have a good night. our waiter was AMAZING!!! His name was Matthew V. I thought about it after I had already left, but I wish I would have spoke to his manager to tell him what a spectacular job he had done. He was on point from the drinks, to getting our soups, breadsticks, refills, entrees! Very personable and professional! We felt he went above and beyond in his job...so I hope a manager reads this and let's him know just how much we appreciated the service tonight!"}
{"text":"Not recommended. We had the worst lunch here today from start to finish. The server brought our drinks and spilled my whole drink on my lap and inside my purse. Management did not even come over to apologize and they did nothing to comp our meal. I say there with soaking wet pants. The food was not enjoyable either. We all ordered the four cheese ziti al forno and it was watery on the bottom. There wasn't much sauce on it..just chunks of tomatoes. The meal came right after she put the salad on the table. Needless to say we won't be coming back to this Olive Garden. I would rate it a 0 if I could."}
{"text":"Blah....over the years, has gone downhill. The courses look like they are portion controlled. We had the Chicken Marsalla, which over the years has been our favorite. The last time we were there, was about a year ago, we walked out equally disappointed. Service was slow as well. Damn, used to love this place"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS!  they had 20 take out customers waiting for over 45 minutes past the promised time. Non apologetic.  Manager was like a deer in the headlights. Poor management.  Poor staffing."}
{"text":"I have been comming hear ever since i was little the food is always amazing and so is the service"}
{"text":"Me and my fiance ate at this location tonight (07/08/2015). The food is always amazing here but tonight the service made the whole experience even more amazing. Our server was Monique G. She was asolutely perfect! She made us feel welcome even though we came pretty close to closing and made our experience seem unique and unpracticed. A great person serving great food, excellent vibes here at the Olive Garden!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Olive Garden. Your service is amazing like always. I don't have any complaints. I totally love your restaurant. I recommend it to every one of my friends and the Toscana soup. 
I have nothing but good things to say about everything in your restaurant. I think it would help if maybe you could make the restaurants bigger. I go to Olive Garden a fair amount of times and when I go, most of the time I find it to be a hour wait and when I finally sit down it takes a long time. The environment on the restaurant is really nice and comforting. The servers are also really kind and respectful.
I haven't really had a bad experience at Olive Garden. It's always my go to when I'm in the mood for soup. I would favor it more if I had more coupons and deals to go there. Again I'm a big fan. I love Olive Garden"}
{"text":"Terrible. The meat sauce was absolutely tasteless. The meatballs were just, not worth any amount of money. They are literally just a ball of beef that's been boiled. It's sooo bad. If Olive Garden wants to rebrand they should focus on keeping all of their branches on the same page."}
{"text":"Cold food, poor manager customer service.  Too much money for just a salad since the rest was not edible"}
{"text":"We waited to be seated while watching the wait staff filling each other in on their evening prior...no hostess, lots of tables.  We were told it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait.  Then were left alone to listen to the wait staff stories.  We left.

Thought we would try it again, today.  This time told 15 to 10 wait, or the bar.  Went in the bar, tables open but dirty.  No one gave us a menu; no one said hello.  WE waited and waited while the bartender looked right at us as he swept the floor.  I spoke up and said we would like to order - no response and went right past us to another table.

After discussing with my guest, we gave him 5 more minutes to at least acknowledge us, to no avail.  We left.

Not going back..."}
{"text":"This location was a huge disappointment. I usually have nothing bad to say about Olive Garden but from the beginning, things went wrong. First off, the hostesses waited for forever to seat us while the front of the restaurant kept filling up. Their boss had to come up and get the ball Rolling for them to seat people. Our waiter was the only good part about the entire evening. Very attentive and nice. But it took FOREVER for our food to arrive, longer than 45 minutes, which seemed pretty ridiculous. Then to make matters worse, I found a hair in my food about 1/3 of the way into eating. They didn't comp my meal just gave me free dessert. I probably will not ever come back to this location, even if it was the closest to me at the time"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!!  Had the chicken topped with crab over mashed potatoes and spinach...yum!  And our server, Joey, was perfect!  He gave us our space and didn't pressure us but was always close enough to be at our table when we needed us, tank you Joey for being so laid back and efficient at the same time."}
{"text":"This was the worst food experience I've ever had at an Olive Garden.  Even though the waitress was polite, friendly, and nice I had a hunch that she was disappointed in the food too.

Here's where it went wrong.  
1. The lasagna fritter appetizer was an embarrassment.  It's mostly fried bread with little resemblance to actual lasagna. This was pushed to the side.
2. The entree was served, literally, one minute after the appetizer hit the table.
3. The eggplant parmesan was frozen and I don't mean temperature.  FROZEN!  

This meal was purchased with a gift card and I wish I could get them a refund.  I will not eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Very rude and gross food...I will never go here again...don't waste your money!!!! I wish I could give 0 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"It's been such a pleasure to try Olive Garden for the first time and it was really nice. MILO from Serbia was our server and he did a very good job. Felt home and very delighted.. foods were great just delicious in every bit. We ate and took some home."}
{"text":"Took a while for someone to come and serve us which can happen on a holiday but once our server Philip arrived it was smooth sailing. Got our drinks and food out fast and hot. The food was ok. The service was great."}
{"text":"We tried it again...

I have no understanding why getting in is such a mess every time. We got one of their remote beepers with an expected wait time of only 15min. We waited outside the restaurant and when the beeper came up it took us less than 2 minutes to show up just to get told that our table was gone already.

We were not amused as you do not need beepers if you have to stay in shouting distance of the ladies at the front-desk.

When we finally got a table and wanted to sit down my company jumped up from her chair completely soaked. Someone obviously dropped a glass and the water as well as the broken glass was not cleaned up.

The server cleaned up the mess and exchanged the chair. During our meal our server dropped a glass again while serving a refill and my company was almost spilled a second time.

Highly unprofessional front-desk service, highly unprofessional server and poor management as there was no real excuse at all for the soaking or spilling. Did the manager show up? What do you think?

Another chance - another fail."}
{"text":"One of the best experience I've had with a waiter at Olive Garden. She was quick and always around. On this visit I had the shrimp primavera and the zuppa. The shrimp primavera is one of their healthy options but was a little on the bland side.

The service was what won me over and if I'm inclined to go to any Olive Garden, this one will be one of my choices."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Olive Garden that I've visited thus far! I started out with the stuffed mushrooms and if you haven't tried them yet you are missing out.For my soup I got the chicken & gnocchi. The soup was good and creamy! I decided to order a soup since when I got a salad the last time and it was their regular bowl still even though my friend ordered the soup.

To begin my entree I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs so nothing too fancy but delicious none the less. To finish off my meal I had the apple crostata, which was good. The best part to me was the ice cream. I don't know what ice cream they use to top it off but it was good.

This Olive Garden hasn't let me down yet so I will be there again! Both times my waitress has been Brittany and she is great so if you get her expect to leave a good tip lol."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Mother's Day, bad mistake, very bad mistake. The wait was 30 minutes so I can only imagine what the wait would be for dinner.

My favorite part of Olive Garden are the bread sticks and they did not disappoint as they were hot and ready on our table. My friend ordered stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer. I tried them and they were delicious! Next time I go I'm going to make sure I get my own order. I would recommend anyone to give them a try at least once especially if you like mushrooms. 

Service was of course hectic. It took at least 15  minutes for our waiter to get our drinks. Then another 10 minutes for her to bring our straws. It was about the same amount of time to get our checks and our cards back. I was going to order dessert but I decided to skip out in risk of being delayed in Mother's Day Mayhem. 

I ordered Chicken Alfredo and chose to have a salad instead of the soup. I'm always a fan of Olive Garden's salad but this time it was lackluster. The pasta was a little on the bland side but I'm very picky about my pasta and there honestly isn't a lot of places that can get it right. Regardless of the mayhem I still expect for the quality of the food to not deteriorate."}
{"text":"This location is horrible with large parties. Second time coming here with our family and will definitely be the last. They take forever to seat us, so ad we wait we look through the menu so that when we sit we're ready to go. That doesn't help, the food doesn't arrive for another hour. Waste of time, 2 bad visits too many"}
{"text":"Diaappointed in the Chicken Parmigiana. What used to be daily breaded fresh chicken breast has changed to pre-breaded frozen chicken. Please bring back the fresh chicken."}
{"text":"We were a large-ish group without a reservation and they were very accommodating, with a comfortable semi-private space. Joey was seriously excellent. He was especially attentive to the two children in our group, and it made it easy for them to order food comfortably for themselves. Say what you want about chain restaurants, but we were having a crap day and needed a comfortable setting where everybody could order something they would like and then turns out we had a really great experience with professional  and upbeat servers (Jade too!)."}
{"text":"While I am not a huge Olive Garden fan, this trip exceeded my normal experience with this chain restaurant.  I chose the chicken and dumpling soup with my meal and it was EXCELLENT!  I could easily have made a meal just from it!  Breadsticks were on the money this time and plentiful for our party of 8 and our 2 waitresses rocked it out for service!  I had the stuffed Chicken Marsala and substituted Tuscan potatoes and bell peppers for the parmesan mashed potatoes that I don't like with no trouble! Our glasses were never empty, our wait was only about 30 mins for a large table and everyone loved their menu selections.  Even for Concord Mills area dining, this was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Dear Olive Garden,
When I dine at your restaurant I pretty much know how the food will taste; just okay. The only reason I go there is because the kids like it.  If you are going to let auto mechanics be waiters there,  please ask them to wash their hands before placing my drink on the table with their fingers on the rim of my glass.  Oh, and the other waiter who was seen smoking out back and then delivered my food with an open wound was also very unappetizing.  No one ever checked up on us the entire meal.  They didn't forget to bring the check though. And no, I didn't touch my food or drink.  FYI, there are health codes in Nevada."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian dish I've had in a long time!!  Lobster Ravioli with Jumbo Shrimp with sun dried tomatoes 
The flavor profile is amazing and the service is awesome"}
{"text":"As another reviewer stated this Olive Garden is great! I have been to many and this one is just better then most. The food is always hot and fresh as are the bread sticks!"}
{"text":"We went early on a Saturday evening (4:30) and had to wait 20 minutes, which was crazy because we could see empty booths from the foyer.  Once we were seated at a booth in the middle dining area, there were empty booths and tables throughout the restaurant.  The ONLY bright spot was our server, Toni, who was extremely pleasant.   The food was good, but as we left, all of the tables in the middle section were empty, and so many people waiting in the front, we had to weave our way through the crowd.    I'm not familiar with the ways of running a restaurant, but it makes NO SENSE to me why you have all these empty tables and booths and have people waiting for 20-30 minutes.  I wish I had taken a picture of all the open tables to show the folks waiting.  Next time I will."}
{"text":"We went to the Olive Garden restaurant on our way to visit our children in Ohio . It was posted on the interstate. We like going to national chains because we trust them and know their menu . We really enjoy our local  Olive Garden in Westminster Md. The service was quick. Our waiter was brilliant, polite and knowledgable of the menu specials. My wife always request specially prepared foods. They were very accommodating . Plus everything came out prefect. The location was about 10 minutes off our travel route. We would have drove much further knowing what we know now. Well thank you Olive Garden , Mat Perozich manager on duty , Peter our server.  And all the employees for supporting the front of the house staff. Btw the facility looks like it was brand new.  
Respectfully 
One more satisfied Customer 
Steve Ageloff"}
{"text":"By far this is the best Olive Garden we have been to. The service was great as soon as we walked in the host Loreita greeted us and walked us to our table while giving us all the specials, super sweet lady. Our waiter Freddie was so attentive! The food was delicious!!!! I order the same thing every time but this time they were not cheap on the amount of meat they put in my soup! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner at olive garden. Walked in with a headache and was greeted by a pleasant server. Arianna was perfect for me and my girlfriend. She gave us plenty of time to chat and delivered possibly the fastest and the most attentive service I've ever received. The fact I wanted to leave a review with a splitting migraine should really say how great Arianna was for us."}
{"text":"I'm usually a Olive Garden fan but our experience the night before was horrible. We were seated quickly and drink order put in as well as food order our waiters name was Ramon or something with an 'R'  I wouldn't remember being as every time we saw him it was brief. He put in my food order in correctly by putting the chicken marsala as my main entree which I am 100% sure what I had ordered sounded nothing like chicken being that I don't even eat poultry and when I had noticed the mistake I pointed it out to what I had ordered and he proceeded to tell me it was the shrimp ravioli that I had ordered and every time I answered back he kept changing his answer to what each item on my plate was.. It was pitiful he wasn't even comprehensive of what the food on the menu was supposed to look like he only filled our drinks once  we ended up fixing my order and taking it to go, because by then I was over trying to get decent customer service out of him he was way too concerned with all his other patrons that were pretty much finishing up... Don't be a waiter if you can't multi task and definitely read back the persons order if you didn't get it the first time it saves the and definitely food... We will be taking our buisness to the cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Olive Gardens across the country and this one by far has me most unimpressed of all. 

Our server, Derek A. (tall, bald guy), was hopeless to say the least. He didn't mention any specials, didn't get us our drink refills in time and never offered any additional bread sticks or salad. Finally waited forever to ask for a to-go box and our check, only to hear him whine to another person right behind us about how he can't seem to catch a break and how he can't even pronounce my name. Ahem, ok, but don't say it right in front of the customer?? :)

Food portions were great and entrees were yummy, but breaksticks were not warm as we've come to expect from Olive Gardens. And did I mention that we didn't get any extra? :D

Anyways, horrible experience. Maybe he was having an off day, but I'd suggest asking to be waited by someone else (everyone else seemed wonderful!) and I believe your server's attitude is directly proportional to your dining experience."}
{"text":"The only down side to this location is that it is always very busy.  The waitresses are usually always attentive and helpful.  The food is always delicious and the alfredo sauce to dip your breadsticks in is always worth the $3.95."}
{"text":"It's been remodeled inside. All new look. Same menu.

My GF and I stopped dining-in at this place due to poorly behaved screaming running fussing yelling children because nobody knows how to teach their kids how to behave in public, so we do carry out, or we used to.

One poor idea they had was for people getting carry-out. With the old layout you walked in, ordered and waited then picked-up all at the bar. Not any more.

Now there is a tiny ordering kiosk along the wall by the bathroom door. Tell the hostess you want to place or pick-up an order than wait for someone who knows how to operate the terminal to arrive, then stand there and wait and wait. No chairs, just lean against the wall. 

Before the remodel if you wanted carry-out you could sit at the bar, even order a water or something and be comfortable, now you're isolated by a bathroom door like some sort of restaurant refugee, not good enough to actually walk past the hostesses. 

Very poor plan, very poor design. Who dreamed up this design? I believe it is safe to assume they are trying to totally end carry out service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just recently had a marvelous lunch at Olive Garden on the East side. It was splendid! Our Waiter was so attentive and the meal was devine. The meat was so tender and the spices on the pasta were postively mouth tingling. Just really made my day to have such a nice experience!"}
{"text":"When the family needs a carbohydrate overload, we go to Olive Garden. My family of four all had the never ending pasta bowl promotion. The salad and breadsticks lived up to their OG reputation as did the pastas and sauces.

We have visited this location many times with varying levels  of service ranging from poor to great. My review stars are more for the service on our most recent visit. Our server was Sara (not sure of the spelling) and she was attentive and very personable. The restaurant was very busy on a Saturday night, but she didn't make us feel rushed and she took the time to actually speak with us. If you go, I recommend asking for her."}
{"text":"For some reason, this location always seems to attract loud teenagers. I've been here several times and none have been a particularly good experience,  but just okay.
The service was nice enough but slightly forgetful. I probably didn't need that glass of water anyways,  and I think he decided on my behalf that one salad was enough. Silly me, wanting to much. But he did make some nice food suggestions and keep the coke full.

The entre was a smaller portion than expected,  but quite tasty. The salad was nearly ruined by what can only be described as \"the bottom of the bag\" of croutons being dumped on top and smothering the bowl in bread crumbs.  Sadly, it's usually the salad we come for. Bf says his seafood Alfredo was good but thrown together, cheese unmelted.

The location is convenient so we might be back, but you do have to steel yourself for the noise level."}
{"text":"Well we always come here and today 2/10/18, they aren't serving Lobster ravioli, out of the pasta chip nachos  too. Our waitress had an attitude and was so slow.  If we ask for more soup she acts like we are asking for the world. She was worried about the people behind us. 
This was one of the worst services ever."}
{"text":"Wow. Great service and very accommodating staff. My kids ordered pizza with fries on the side. They were out of fries so we got mashed potatoes that my picky eaters didn't go for so they exchanged for grapes my picky eaters wouldn't touch so they exchanged for......wait for it..... handmade fries from the kitchen. (Thanks Larry) Which were really very tasty and DID get touched from my picky eaters. Breadsticks are always a success and tried zeppelinis. Thank you Rome for excellent service"}
{"text":"My brother and I came here for dinner about 5 days after they initially opened  and everything seemed fine until suddenly he stops eating and moves his plate away from him.  It wasn't he explained that there was something on his plate that he thought did not belong in his salad that I took the plate and looked at it.  Lo and behold there was a dead fly on the remainder of his salad.  Obviously I was not happy about this and called for management.  They had comped our meals and was apologetic which was fine, we weren't going to make a big deal out of it or make a scene, however, we left with an uneasy feeling and hoped that the next time would be better than that visit.


We jump to today as we decided to give it another go as we wanted to celebrate a family event and the Cheyenne location was too far away from our residence.  We should have just gone the extra distance!  While the food did not contain any unwanted critters or \"special surprises,\" the service itself was displeasing.  Drinks were forgotten, drinks came too late, our entrees came about 45min after we had finished our appetizers, no refills were offered, and how many times could the other people working there possibly ask OUR server to come back to the table for us to get To-Go containers, our dessert orders, and the check?!  It was totally ludicrous! 

I love going to Olive Garden.. We enjoy going there to celebrate events or just because.... However, we will surely pass on going to this specific location for the time being.  Perhaps they need to re-evaluate their staffing or management for that matter."}
{"text":"The remodeling they did really brightens the place up! And the fact that have the limited time never-ending classics is great!"}
{"text":"Love it, probably the most friendly staff I have ever encountered. The food is amazing especially the salad and bread sticks. I would recommend Olive Garden to anyone who wants a nice sit down restaurant"}
{"text":"If I was able to give a 0 star review for my evening tonight, I would. My husband I decided on this restaurant because it's typical that we have a great time. Aside from our server who did a great job tonight, I have never been so DISGUSTED by what we were served. We've come to this location for years, and to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary, we came here to do so. We bought a bottle of wine, and in every glass we were given, there was old food on each one. Water glasses, dirty. And then we get our forks, and there is still food on them. We get served our food and we decline because as petty as it may sound to some, using dirty dishes is just as equivalent to finding hair or bugs in our meal. You would assume that we would have been greatly discounted on our bill but for only consuming wine and breadsticks, we still received a 50 bill. I'm just disappointed. That seems incredibly unacceptable. I have never left a review before, and this evening was just so terrible that I had to. Shame on the managment in this building, it wasn't just dirty dishes you served to us, it was also an awful evening you left us with and a long time customer that you've LOST."}
{"text":"First impression when I walk into the place is the smell of dirty carpets. Gross! We get seated right away. Usually it takes forever since everyone in the area seems to like Olive Garden?! 
So it took 10 minutes to get our drinks, then almost another 50 minutes to get our entrées. The food in my opinion is so commercial. I really don't get why people come here so often. I guess everyone is so used to their McDonalds and microwave dinners. 
 I ordered the cheese ravioli with tomato sauce. I literally could taste the package it came out of! There is nothing fresh about Olive Garden, not even the salad, which is soaked in house dressing and stale croutons. Other than the food which was lacking, so was the service. Our waitress took forever to refill drinks and notice the obvious things which we needed. 
The only reason why I came here, was because it was my niece's bday dinner and she wanted to try it. I really don't miss this place nor will I ever crave anything here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this Olive Garden.  Maybe the sit down part of the restaurant is better, but the to go section was not.  I got the lasagna, and it was very good, if kind of a tiny portion.  The baked bread was good.  But the salad, boy that sucked.  It must have been pre-packaged days before.  Wilted lettuce, ugly tomatoes,  and generally disappointing.  I asked for blue cheese salad dressing and all I got was a tiny thing of Italian dressing.  If you get the to go, choose the soup!"}
{"text":"This Friday night we received exceptional service! 

Our server, Sudragon, was AMAZING! 
Food was delicious and came out quickly and we received a sweet thank-you card upon departure! We had a perfect dining experience! :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I dined at this location last night and she got food poisoning. She was sick and miserable all night. Definitely the last time I will be eating here."}
{"text":"I have worked for Olive Garden for 6 Years!! And decided to come to the one closer to my own home (since I moved). The worst experience ever! Surprise location sucked! As we entered we asked for a table for ten and the hostess so kindly said 20-25 mins which to me I'm like wow on a Sunday ? Table of 10?.. so I was happily waiting.. then we ended up waiting longer than that estimated time the hostess gave us. As we waited, my party and I noticed that other parties that arrived after us were being seated. At that point we asked the hostess again how much longer it will be. She then told us that the estimated wait time was actually 40-45 minutes. And a server came up to us and said that for a party as large as ours would be a 2 hour wait. Well of course that irritated us. We asked for the manager and he came out talking to one of the guests of our party, he was very hostile. He wasn't letting my friend speak. Came out as a bullet instead of letting us explain."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is amazing. I always go with my kids because they love the pasta more than I do. The anti-pasta tastes so crisp and the bread sticks are endless. I'm such a fan of the eggplant parmigiana that I get it half the time I come. Great place to bring my family."}
{"text":"Although I was kept on hold for almost 10 minutes for the seating times, Jim was very accommodating for us.  It was a special birthday celebration and we had a party of 10.  Our table was ready when we arrived!  The food was amazing as usual.  The breadsticks tasted as if right out of the oven!  Yum!!  We had two servers taking care of our table.  Not sure if (I think her name was Jackie?) was in training but Faith was very helpful too.  \"Jackie\" was offering the wine sampling before we were all seated.  I asked her to wait and to please speak up as she is very soft spoken.  I explained the group was a bit rowdy!  It didn't help.  I was under the impression Olive Garden has rules regarding facial piercings!  Jackie's were very distracting.  The evening was a great success!  Thank you Jim, \"Jackie\", and Faith!"}
{"text":"Third time with carry out and third time with issue.  
Time one promised via online at 645p but got at 710p. 
Time two got home at one of our zuppas was a ministoni  the food is good always but the service is terrible.   This third time I counted 7 employees all at the host/ carry out stand.  I stood there for 3 minutes before someone came from kitchen and could tell I was irritated and asked what I was waiting for.   I arrived at 723 for 720 pickup and I am writing this review as I continue to wait at 733p.  The management seems to be the problem as the employed are apologizing to everyone.  I overheard two ladies before me who have been waiting as well.   My suggestion get out of the online order business as u can not handle it with the normal business."}
{"text":"Over priced small portions, rushed out to you under cooked. Friendly servers though. Needless to say we didn't eat our food. Also my silver swear napkin was dirty, looked liked someone's shoe print was on it.
Upon leaving, went to the restroom, bad idea here. The ladies restroom was smelly and dirty, with both soap dispensers empty. When the condition was brought to their attention, the employees just turned around as if to figure out what to do, but nothing was said nor done. We said thank you and have a good night... crickets. Rude much? Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The service not so much. Our server barley came around within the first half of dinner. We had to ask help from another server as our salad had no dressing. Our main meal came before the appetizer we ordered. And when the bill came it was all messed up. Our table had 3 checks but some meals where on others and beers not on the correct tab. We also had a 20% off coupon but the server said she'd take it off when she rang us up. So i had to calculate on my own what the bill should have been with the coupon so i could pay the correct amount of cash."}
{"text":"Horrible service, the hostess and waitress were both extremely rude. I can understand we went at a busy time but I still think the lackluster service was unacceptable. I guess that is to be expected from this restaurant chain these days. We will not be back, which is a shame because this is the only location in Summerlin."}
{"text":"This has been one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a very long time. I eat out a lot and don't really expect much from...Olive Garden, but this visit has been ridiculous. The bar is DIRTY...and I had to swat at gnats while I was eating!! The bartender is obviously overworked, he simply can't keep up. Meanwhile, there are 5 girls and I'm assuming the manager just standing there twirling their hair, leaning, having personal conversations while I sit here with no knife and fork for my spaghetti and meatballs!!! If you walked in here right now you'd probably turn right back around and walk out. The bar is the first thing you see and it's filthy with half full drinks and dirty dishes that have sat here for literally the last hour and a half....yes it took an hour and a half for wine and spaghetti! I'm not saying that Olive Garden isn't a good spot, but this particular location might ruin it all for you...so just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars because Brody the manager was very helpful, nice and professional. I accidentally ordered olive garden from here when in California. I ordered through uber eats and even though uber eats was giving me hell, Brody handled everything for me and I was able to get my money back from uber. I will definetly go to this olive garden when I visit my sister's in Vegas again."}
{"text":"I really like the Olive Garden. I know, I know...people say it's too commercial and too expensive. But I've never had a bad meal. Others comment on Babbo's in Surprise AND THEY ARE RIGHT. It's an amazing, small, neighborhood restaurant but sometimes I want something different and a little fancier. The only downside was our waiter who was overly gracious--it comes across as disingenuous. Oh and the non-alcoholic strawberry and kiwi drinks are yummy."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was lacking-refilled with wrong drink, and she didn't come back to the table."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for Olive Garden!! I love their dolcini's the best!! Tried the build your own pasta and it's great! My favorite dish is the Five Cheese Ziti Al Forno or the Ravioli! The salad is the best, and I love the dressing! The bread is a hit or miss I must say because I like my bread soft and sometimes it's a bit harder than my liking. 

Service is always good here, idk how they do it every time for me! They even moved my boyfriend and I when we got seated and there was a cold draft! 

Goodness I love it here. Definitely will go back again and again for years and years like I have been for over 5 years now!!"}
{"text":"By far the worst service ever. Waitress Maria took drink order and left. 15 minutes later she returned with drinks and took order.  Didn't see her again for almost 20 minutes. Came out with appetizers. About 10 minutes after that, we finally got salad and breadsticks. No drink refills during that entire time.  Finally got entrees and drinks about 15 minutes later.  Food was stale and almost cold.  She took off and didn't see her again. I finally had enough and got it to speak to the manager about her.  When she finally came back almost 15 minutes after I complained, she was made because I \"told on her to her boss\". Well, do your damn job and maybe I won't be such an ass and need to get your manager involved.  

Cold food, horrible service = my birthday party ruined. Thanks a ton!!"}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden, I love their salad & bread sticks. My boyfriend took me here on one of our 1st dates years ago & it became a place we eat at frequently. We both love the chicken Alfredo & the fresh grated parmesan cheese they top it with. When they have the never ending pasta bowl special he likes to go & get spaghetti & meatballs or sausage. For a big chain place its ok, I know it's not \"real\" Italian, but it's still good."}
{"text":"I had a to go order ! Food was delicious warm and all!!! Great taste ....everything was neatly packed, great customer service '!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this Olive Garden in a good while.  I arrived to see a GORGEOUS makeover had been done.  The atmosphere is stunning, relaxing, and reminds me of my days in Italy.
When the server asks you if you would like to sample the wine, you should take them up on it.  I was pleasantly surprised with a wine I probably never would have tried.
My favorite appetizers have always been the calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and spinach-artichoke dip.   Having them as a favorite, I never reached out to try new ones....but I finally did and am so glad I did!  The lasagna fritta is amazing!  It's fried lasagna noodles with ricotta cheese, alfredo sauce on the bottom and marinara on the top.  Delicious!  I had finally tried the fried ravioli and fried mozzarella, too.  Amazing!  So my decisions just became more complicated :) !
And don't be afraid to try the very delicious soups.  My to go soups have always been chicken and gnocchi and zuppa toscano!  But I finally tried the pasta e fagioli and minestrone.  Now I KNOW all of the soups are delicious!
What I enjoy most on the menu is the Seafood Alfredo.  It is fettucini with alfredo sauce, shrimp and scallops.  However, I recently tried the Ravioli di Portobello, which is ravioli filled with Portobello mushroom and has a cheesy sauce over it.  It's quite delicious!!! 
If you get the chance to have the Watermelon Sangria....I would recommend that highly, especially on a hot day!  It's light and refreshing!  I have always liked Olive Garden, but am especially happy for having the guts to try new things, because now I have even more to choose from when I go :) !"}
{"text":"We were on a staycation.. We had a nice hotel, and wanted a nice late lunch so we chose Olive Garden.  I worked at an Olive Garden decades ago.. It was even better today. Our waiter was funny, and so attentive.  My husband had the tour of italy, and I had a pasta with wine sauce.  Very good. Love their endless salad & bread sticks too.  I must remember to some back here more often.."}
{"text":"What I like about this location:  the staff is GREAT, VERY good service. The menu is standard as per the chain but always done well."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about.they serve the best complimentary chicken  gnochhi soup and bread.and they refill the bread too.i had stuffed chicken marshala and chicken scampi here.both are yummy. .also I had signature wine rosato rose.it was good too.service is quick.a good place to hangout with friends and enjoy some scrumptious Italian food.
Only thing is I feel like stalked by the waiter all the time.just a nano second after u finish ur food, the waiter come to take ur plate. How come!!!!! :p
Anyway nothing to worry about.will come here again and again for sure.:D"}
{"text":"My first time eating at an Olive Garden. The food was good, just like any home cooked meal. The services was amazing. Our server Justin made sure we were well taken care. We didn't wait long to be seated nor for our food. I can honestly say that I'm very pleased with coming to this location. I'm sure to come back one day!!"}
{"text":"First off, I would give this restaurant zero stars if I could. My dining experience with this establishment on the night of 6/4/17 was awful. After this experience, I will never dine at an Olive Garden again. I attended your restaurant with a large party of 13 people for a family event, my brother had graduated that afternoon by the way. The night started out wonderfully with our drink orders being taken and casual conversation between the family about the accomplishments that had been made earlier in the day, then we ordered and it was all down hill from there. After waiting over forty-five minutes for our food to arrive, everything was wrong. Our orders were messed up and were given to different family members partially eaten, some were cold to the core, others were just plain wrong. After having to sort out the order dilemma ourselves, three out of thirteen family members were not given their remade food until after the rest of the family was done and were expected to pay the bill before even touching their food. Four out of thirteen members did not eat at all. I was disgusted by the rude service of one of your waitresses Emily W. Even though she was only helping out what seemed like a new server, Amber, it was unacceptable. Once again, I will never dine at this chain again, and thank you for ruining a special day for my brother."}
{"text":"Quick Summary: used to love it, but it's lost its luster. Plus I hate hair in my food.

Positives: 
1) plenty of variety of Italian cuisine
2) awesome, endless breadsticks
3) bottomless salad or soup options
4) good deserts

Negatives:
1) food doesn't seem \"made from scratch\" - another place that would die without a microwave
2) last three visits had hair in food
3) service quality is dropped.. Less friendly, less attentive staff

Final thoughts: this used to be one of our favourite places. Some things like their bottomless breadsticks, soup and salad are missed features I wish other restaurants would copy (in concept). But after consecutive visits with the aforementioned negatives, plus their primo prices... It's just not worth it anymore. 

Will try it again in the distant future."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is a respectable chain restaurant choice, but location-by-location experiences can vary quite a bit.  My thoughts on this location in particular:

Very quick, efficient and friendly service each visit, despite the weekend dinner rush.
Food is up to par for the chain, nothing overly outstanding but consistent with expectations for an Olive Garden.

On a side note for Olive Garden in general, the new low-calorie offerings are quite overpriced for the amount of food you get.  Unlimited salad and bread sticks is as awesome as ever.  

I'll give this location 4 stars, and only because I have a hard time giving any chain 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how Olive Garden's call ahead waitlist system works, but it's a pointless one. Called ahead at 7:00 told them my party of 6 would be there in 20-25 minutes, which I was told how long the wait was, then when I got here to check in for my call ahead waitlist I was told the wait was another 20-25 minutes. Here we are almost 40 minutes later and still not seated. Olive Garden should just get rid of the waitlist or find a better system."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this chain but this particular location has a lot going for it! First, the service is always very good- they are extra friendly here. Second, we visit for lunch, and my Wife works at Chase bank nearby, so we are always sort of in a hurry. They are really cool about processing the check during the meal so we don't have to wait for it until we are finished. Clean, friendly, lots of parking, fast, friendly, good stuff!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant twice, The second time being just as bad as the first. Ive experienced better service at Chevron buying a coke."}
{"text":"Usually we have pretty positive dining experiences at this location, unfortunately that was certainly not the case today. Our server David seemed either overwhelmed or inexperienced. Thank God our appetizer arrived on time, because EVERYTHING else did not, including the breadsticks. Yes, I repeat, including the breadsticks! After my daughters soup arrived, I thought, ok, maybe my salad is on his next run. Nope. David came by & offered my daughter a 2nd serving of her soup, in which at this point, I had to ASK for my salad & breadsticks. All I thought was at this rate, my salad is probably going to arrive with my entree & sure enough, that's exactly what happened and STILL no breadsticks. My daughter asked for a refill of her water & what she got was a cup of water that tasted like very watered down tea. So she ended up ordering a coke. On top of that, he made a mistake on her entree. By the time it arrived, she had completely lost her appetite. What irked me even more was how he seemed to concentrate all his efforts on this ONE table, and periodically tended to others, not by his own efforts, but by the patron flagging him for his assistance. All the while, I witnessed all the other servers running around, tending to multiple tables. And just when we thought it couldn't get worse, it did. He saw us paying our tab & came by to ask if we wanted some to-go boxes (sure why not, our entrees were barely touched). So he offers to pack them for us, ok nice gesture, but then grabs one of our forks by the prongs & uses it to scoop our food into the to-go boxes. Anyone in the culinary industry knows, that is a MAJOR no no! Your hands have been everywhere and the last place I need it, Is in my food! A COMPLETE waste of $$$! I don't think we'll be visiting anytime soon."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden sometimes has problems in the kitchen.  One time I visited they changed the pasta fagioli soup from a hearty meat based soup to a runny tomato based one.  The pasta fagioli soup is my only reason to get soup and salad for dinner because it's usually really good.  

So I wrote to corp through their website and they sent me a gift certificate.  I gave this location another try and thankfully it's back to normal.  So go with caution and be prepared to deal with lackluster performance.  I love OG on the whole and give most locations at least four stars, but this one has done it's best to tarnish their image."}
{"text":"I hate Olive Garden. It makes me laugh when they ask \"how is everything?\"  I wonder what goes through their minds when I say \"The microwave did an awesome job\". I'm in town for a few days, I'm hung over and don't know where else to eat. Olive Garden is just gourmet ChefBoyArDee. You won't find me at an Olive Garden back in New Jersey!"}
{"text":"Just had my sisters birthday at this location and everything was amazing, especially our waitress ayisha. She was absolutely amazing. She was curtious, and professional to all of us. I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"OG was never premier in Italian food, yet it was a notch above what we experienced.  The best part of our meals was the soup & bread sticks ( maybe we should have ordered just that)Our server was decent and the meal was just blah. We saw some new menu items and figured maybe the promotions would be flavorful. I see why they have all these specials. I will say the Steak Gorgonzola Alfredo is pretty good/used to be. I hate that I tried some new chicken dish.  At this location, there were about 6 servers standing around in a group and socializing. I know it was the weekend and you want your staff, but it was really dead for so many  hands on deck.  IMHO, OG need another facelift and try to focus on  having really good limited choices versus the opposite. I doubt I will be back to any OG anytime soon. For the bill and lack of quality, we wished we would have just ordered a gourmet pizza. :)"}
{"text":"First, the appetizers were skimpy. Second, it took 30 minutes for our salad to come out ! 30MINUTES !! I do have to say that they were very accommodating with my vegan diet. I will not go back to this location EVER! Horrible service when we actually got it !"}
{"text":"The food was great...everything else was not.  I have a mild addiction to the chicken & gnocchi soup and the braised beef & tortellini...  Always delicious...now on to the trainwreck part of the dining experience.

Our server, Esther, was very friendly and tried to do her job well.  The bartender took forever to prepare our drinks.  I could see her standing at the bar for quite some time and she gave up and did something else and again came back to wait for the drinks.  We ended up not getting them until after we'd had two bowls of soup and our entrée came. We sat in the bar area where there were 3 tables in a corner section.  She kept leaving the tray stand with big trays in the middle of the three tables even when the tray was full of dirty dishes. It wasn't appealing.

I think the doozy of the night was when I went to use the restroom.  There were 3 stalls.  The middle had no toilet paper and a mother and child just walked into the other stall.  The third stall was handicapped and it was occupied as well with someone who wasn't using the bathroom I assume (I heard no pee or poo...) but was instead yapping on the cell phone.  So, I waited for the mother and child to finish.  They do so, I go in and use the restroom and go to wash my hands.  Before leaving I said loud enough to this woman, \"It's rude to talk on the cell phone while in the bathroom as it interferes with the privacy of others. Please be respectful.\" and I walked out.  We were seated at a table in view of the restroom door so I waited to see who came out.  Much to my surprise, it was a hostess.  I was pretty annoyed by this so I asked our server to call over the manager and explained to the server what happened and she seemed greatly concerned.  When the manager came over I explained what transpired and he said that the hostess was off the clock.  I asked how he knew who I was referring to as I had not yet pointed her out.  He said he went and asked the hostesses prior to coming and talking to me.  He didn't validate my concern at all.  I still feel that it doesn't matter if she was off the clock.  She should go out to her car and certainly not take up a restroom stall.  She was still dressed as an Olive Garden employee so she was still representing the restaurant.  

Managers -- please take note:  When a customer complains all you need to do is listen, validate, apologize, and ask how they can make a situation right.  It's THAT simple."}
{"text":"The restaurant does not allow us to call an order for take out, apparently we must be present at the restaurant. Once we arrive we wait a good 15 minute for the \"take out\" person to take our order, apparently no one else can. I give it a star because the food is good but experience is not."}
{"text":"So last night I went with my family and we ordered some mushrooms, salad, soup, calamari, and the buy one take one. I don't know what went wrong but instantly I felt ill. I came home and took some medicine but it only hid the symptoms. Upon waking up I realized I have food poisoning and so does my father. We knew something sketchy was going on when a table of 3 took a while to receive our food when it wasn't that busy. Hugely regretting going there and will not try it again. Thanks for ruining my Easter weekend Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"I'll be the first to give credit where credit is due: Olive Garden's recent rebranding efforts, with the new logo and font, and some more modern menu options, are welcome and give a nice facelift to the company.

However, it may be too much change or not very well executed: menu now boasts a selection of \"italian tapas\" which are basically an extension of their appetizer menu, most of which are $5 or $6 and discounted to $4 during a happy hour special of sorts, offered Mon-Fri 3-6PM.
Tried the polenta and shrimp dish- four shrimp atop a bed of polenta with a tomato and olive sauce, good value with four shrimp, but sauce was overly salty and unbalanced with many olives. Server apologetically revealed that the dish isn't going over well.

Though they're most known for their pasta dishes (and, okay, breadsticks), I usually just come here for their unlimited soup and salad lunch special: $7 for as much of either as I like, along with breadsticks. Good value, and good flavors- I usually stick with the zuppa toscana, but the chicken and gnocchi is good for something different. 

In addition to the tapas portion, OG now has a small menu of featured dishes that are \"healthy preparation\"/lower-calorie than their typical pasta dishes. A few steps in the right direction, guys- now to work on the execution.

Additional note: never get a cappuccino here. It's not worth the $4. Drive through a Starbucks afterward if you must. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The new menu is great. Especially lunch. That wait staff is super. Watch out for the touch screen at the tables. If you have kids and they play with it. (Note that they are encouraged to do so) you will be charged a fee for it. Our bill had $1.99 added to it without a warning. The manager removed the additional charge when brought to her attention. But, you will be charged if you don't pay attention."}
{"text":"I would just like to state I am very easy to please especially when it comes to customer service. I was here this evening with my wife and the dinner came out before the appetizer that we ordered. The server states we will hold them in the \"heat box\" until you guys are finished with your appetizer. No manager ever came over an apologized for any inconvenience or ever even stopped by the table. He just took it upon himself to not have to deal with the situation and comp the appetizer. which was nice but would have rather had the situation handled with professionalism instead of laziness from the staff."}
{"text":"Cisco!!!! He was our waiter for the night. He had a great attitude and provided us the best service. We had a group of 10 and we were looking to have a nice dinner. Olive Garden was a great choice. The food was delicious (practically is every time I eat there). Cisco went above and beyond to get us whatever we needed/wanted. He bonded a little with the family which is a good thing! Overall the dinner and experience was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I got to the olive garden in the nw of las vegas. I really enjoy the warm homey feel of this one. It doesnt feel like your sitting out doors like some others. 

Of course the breadsticks are yummy. But the alfredo boat you can add to them makes them even better. What I dont get its, they often will an odd number of breadsticks when theres an even number of poeple at the table. But that isnt to big of a deal.

I used to add a ceasar salad because they were great. However they recently removed them. But wait its okay because you can have ranch on your salad. 

But heres the thing that bugs me. They added a new item, the pepperoni fettuccuni alfredo to the buy one take one. I asked for it the last visit. My server asked what item I would take home. I told him i dont want to take anything home can i just have the one I eat here. He said no. Why would you not do it? Im not asking to reduce the price, hell pick a second item and toss it. But why tell your customer they cannot try a new menu item?
Then to night on another visit this poor server is trying to explain the buy one take one and how its not just 12.99 there are up charges for different items. It sounded confusing to me."}
{"text":"The look of this olive garden is some much warmer than the older ones. Plus it feels more upscale. 
The place is super clean. We come here often and over the course of that time we have had a few issues. But anytime there was an issue the managers fix it quick and they are always coming by the tables."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews it seems  a majority of the gripes involve the staff. 
With this in mind I had a low expectation of the service my wife and I would receive. I arrived earlier than my wife and as soon as I walked in the host greeted me with an eccentric \"Welcome!\" And then a random comment that I didn't quite hear. He was friendly as was the girl behind the check-in booth. It was a Thursday night and there was no wait (other than my own personal wait for my wife). 
Service was fast, our waitress was not friendly but not rude either. Our food came out very quick. So quick that I was sitting with an entree and basically a full soup bowl. That's not a worthy gripe in my opinion just something to note. The capellini I ordered was decent, nothing too special. 
The one thing I did notice and wanted to mention is their prices on their menu are not what they charge. Every item on our receipt was just a little more expensive than what is presented on the menu. The capellini on the menu is 11.50 but our check said 11.99, the dipping sauce 3.75, charged 3.79, etc... Not a huge deal, and not even big enough for me to say anything but either their menu is outdated (which is unlikely since they just opened this location) or The OG has figured out a clever way of sneaking in a few extra dollars per ticket. Too subtle to really notice or even complain about. I don't know, you be the judge. 
Overall, decent experience."}
{"text":"Georgia was awsome! Came here as a last minute anniversary dinner for my parents and she offered them complimentary wine samples and gave them a free dessert to celebrate 29 years together! She was amazing and her service was impeccable amazing experience thanks to her! Will definately come back and ask for her!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Fast service. Excellent food. Highly recommend! Waitress kept checking on us. Refilled drinks without asking. Even manager on duty came and checked to see if everything was ok."}
{"text":"I typically would not write a review, tonight I will make an exception.

I arrived with my girlfriend at 7 p.m. and the restaurant was clearly not on wait. The two servers and two hostesses at the front did not so much as acknowledge us let alone greet us, for minutes. They seemed to be too busy chatting it up and giggling about everything but that night's service.  When they decided to acknowledge our presence a nice male host appeared quickly and seated us promptly. While walking to our table it was easily observed that while busy this establishment couldn't have been more than 75% seated. As we arrived at our table my girlfriend and I put our hands down on our respective booth seats only to draw our crumb covered hands back immediately. I asked if this table had been bussed (rhetorically) and proceeded to ask him if he could wipe down our seats. He did immediately and apologized, leaving us to sit in what were now wet seats (bring a dry towel next time you have to bus on the fly). My girlfriend used her cloth napkin to dry her seat while I was in far too deep and choose to deal with it as my golf shorts were black. The table was fairly clean and set with wine glasses cleaned well below par. After reading almost the whole menu, deciding on entrees, drinks and contemplating appetizers our conversation moved to how long it was going to take for somebody to come to our table. After discussing it for several more minutes we decided to leave (7:20 p.m.). As we were standing up a server attempted to ask what we would like to drink and my girlfriend informed her we were leaving. She looked surprised and another server wished us a good night and I replied in kind.

I've always liked Olive Garden's food and have never had a problem with this location. However, tonight's service was one of the worst experiences I've had at any establishment. I'm an industry employee and am forgiving of slight misses here and there. I understand the processes of turning tables and coming out of volume. If nothing else I hope the GM and DM are privy to this review. I wish you well Chandler (Germann) OG, but I WILL NOT BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Service is very good. I haven't had good service in any restaurant for a while so I'm pretty impressed. Food wasn't that great. Pasta was tasteless. Bread sticks was good though. And the soup is always good. Try their flavored lemonage!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here tons of times and the service is always great. They're very accommodating as well. The food is always good (as good as a chain restaurant can be). Never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"The only thin I get here is there ravioli de portobello. Never really tried anything else. But I'm a fan of that ravioli. 

Also alittle tip if you go for dinner you can still get lunch size incase you're aren't thy hungry and it's still lunch price. I have a feeling no one tells you that when you're ordering."}
{"text":"The five star ratings for this restaurant must  be fake! We have been fans of the chain for years. This was the worst experience we have ever had. The food was awful, my grilled salmon was over cooked and tasteless, my wife's sausage and pasta dish was
Inedible. I tried to get a fresh cup of coffee but gave up after the second attempt. Our waitress was uninterested and almost rude. Will NEVER return to this location. A real shame as I said we have enjoyed their other locations"}
{"text":"The Olive Garden is the only thing I truly believe that every state should have dozens of. We could use less Jamba Juice stores, we could use less 7-11's but we can not survive without multiple Olive Gardens.

And that might seem like an odd statement seeing as how I live in Hawaii where have no Olive Gardens at all. So if I just stated that we can't survive without one, why am I still alive?

Well, I live off of hope. Hope that one day I'll get to eat at Olive Garden again. Hope that I'll indulge myself in the breadsticks, salad and soup.

Thankfully in my most recent trip to Las Vegas, I was able to take my gf to Olive Garden. We were seated after a short wait and it was game time baby! Before we knew it we had breadsticks and salad on the table. I ordered up some of the chicken and gnocchi soup. The breadsticks were perfect as they always are. And the soup? The soup was awesome. Nice pieces of roasted chicken with small dumplings full of flavor. I added some pepper and it went very nicely with the spinach. It was all very satisfying.

For my entree I had the parmesan crusted steak. It came with mashed potatoes and it tasted like a small piece of heaven. She had shrimp over linguini and that too was also full of flavor.

There were a few hiccups on the service side. I was supposed to get unlimited refills on my strawberry tea but instead she filled it with regular tea. Our server also said that she'd bring us more bread but she didn't. By that time we were full anyways so it didn't really matter.

Please oh please god of Olive Garden.. please see fit to bless us with one of these in Hawaii?"}
{"text":"Overall it wasn't bad but some problems with food quality and hostess. We had a group of 6 on a Sunday afternoon. We were told it would be 15 minute wait but actually was a 55 min wait. Food was average. Seafood fettuccini was  nothing like photo on menu. Very few shrimp, all very small, and I don't even think the other tiny bits were actually scallops. Sauce didn't have much flavor either. Salad was fresh and good, as usual, but tiramisu was frozen. Icy. Not good. Couldn't even cut into it. Olive Garden doesn't have much competition in the area so it's usually crowded but they should still do better."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate at this Olive Garden for the first time on 2/23/2016 at 4:30pm (before the dinner rush).  It was nice to see the handicap parking spaces were nice and fairly level and that wheelchair access from the parking spaces to the front door was smooth and unobstructed.  The front doors were not power-assisted, but were light enough to open (for us).  We were greeted right away by a friendly hostess who moved the chairs away from the table so we could roll right up to it.  Our waiter, Michael T came right over to welcome us and get a drink order. He then took our full order and brought us breadsticks, soup, and salad while we waited, all of which was delicious!  The meals came just as we were finishing our appetizers and delicious they were as well!  I had the meatball sandwich with crispy French fries and she had the lasagna.  I had a glass of milk and she had a margarita.  The waiter checked on us twice and everything was perfect!  We finished, paid, talked to the waiter for a few minutes (friendly guy), and left as the dinner rush was coming in.  We WILL be going back to this location in the near future:)"}
{"text":"Went to lunch ere a couple of weeks ago with my daughter and I forgot to leave a review. The potato soup was great as usual so was the pasta. The best part about this visit was our waitress. I wish I could remember her name. The hostess sat us behind the most obnoxious kid I have ever been around and his parents were useless letting him act like a complete animal in public. The waitress saw my distress and moved us to another booth. 

Note to parents....if your children can't act like humans please do NOT take them into public and ruin everyone's else's lunch. Get a babysitter or get it to go. Or teach your kids how to behave. It's not that difficult. I have three none of them kick seats, scream, jump around or act out of control in public."}
{"text":"Just good. Nothing different from what I've got in other places. Customer service should be honest and naturally polite. Sometimes I notice fake smiles from far away. I know its their work to be smiling but some of them just exaggerate. Price its fair. Its too cold inside there though."}
{"text":"My niece just celebrated her 10th bday here and we all received phenomenal service!  Even my 2 year old behaved the entire dinner.  My 10 year old enjoyed his steak tuscano very much along with the bread sticks.  Did I mention zeppoli (Italian doughnuts) Yum!  My all time fave is the Tiramisu.

Staff were amazing....humorous...on top of everything from pre bussing, refills, up selling.  For a party of 10, yes, up selling refills on alcohol and desserts could add up. ;-)  They deserve the auto grat though...and then some. ;)"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave a low rating was because the wait at this location is absolutely horrible. I have tried to come here between 5 and 6 pm on Saturdays and the wait was over an hour. That is not acceptable. My husband and I will never wait that long for Olive Garden. That said, we do like their food. The steak gorgonzola Alfredo is by far our favorite dish. My husband got me hooked on it a few years ago. We also enjoy the soup, salad and breadsticks deal for lunch. If you don't want to wait more than a 1/2 hour, get there by 4 pm on weekends."}
{"text":"I took my family here for lunch yesterday, and we were sat in Judy's section. I have 2 small kids and right away Judy was so sweet to them and us. She was always smiling and on top of everything. Our food came out in a timely manner and was very good. We had a coupon for a free app so we tried the fried artichokes. They were good, but we probably would not order them again. All in all, the food had great flavor. The seafood pescadores was not our favorite, but it was good at the time... We will definitely come here again, and hope to be sat with Judy again too."}
{"text":"I went her last Monday for lunch, and expected to have a great time as always.... I was there in a party of seven, So we were seated and introduced to our waitress and waiter. Throughout our entire meal, we only received service for the waitress. Her attitude was very distasteful for an Olive Garden employee. She seemed bother the whole time, and even took our salad plates while we were still eating from them! When I asked for more salad she seemed repulsed that I even asked, we even had to ask for more salad plates since she had taken the others. She brought us the \"never ending breadsticks\" once. The food was delicious, but the service was awful. When the bill came my husband put the money together, which I then asked to see it, because I usually decide the tip, which I discover he was leaving a $15 tip. Our bill was 95.76 So I left 103.00 and kept the rest. I usually tip quite well when served well. While walking out the restaurant our waitress came out saying we were short! Lol to my mistake I look at the Total, not the Subtotal haha which was $104.00 so I paid the full amount, and then the waitress continued to state how she didn't even charge a gratuity fee! All I could think was \"You don't even deserve one!\" haha but in the end she only was tipped $5. Serves her for being rude to me!"}
{"text":"Lunch time service and food is awesome. Dinner was ok when we were here a week ago. This time we came for lunch. The food was amazing, the service was so friendly. We told them about our last visit and we had dessert tasting and one was warm and she took it off our bill. The portions are smaller at lunch but you can upgrade if you tell them. I'm only coming here now for lunch."}
{"text":"Great time spent with friends. However, server guy was terrible. He rushed us. We just got soup, salad and breadsticks. Never asked if we wanted refills on soup or salad. Told the manager. She did comp us. I don't ask for stuff like that. I give my opinion either good or bad. This was BAD. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Long wait, but well worth it!  Our waiter, Roman, was the BEST!!  Very knowledgable, friendly & made our evening.  We were well tended to & he made the evening fun!  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Nicole for making this experience awesome! Great server! Great food! Had a great night out with all of my friends!"}
{"text":"I honestly started going to the Olive Garden because of the television show 'Clone High'. We always have a good time eating the amazing unlimited Soup, Salad and Bread sticks, so good. And the staff is always friendly, have a good time."}
{"text":"I am writing this as an updated review.  I am not sure what happened, but since my last review, things have gotten significantly better at this location.  

My family and I have been here twice since my last review, and both times I was impressed, and pleasantly surprised, to see changes made.

First, we have been greeted by the manager both visits asking how our meal was.  

Second, there is a noticeable change in the quality differences as described in my original review.  Our soups have been fresh, hot and not watered down.  Our breadsticks have been hot, and seasoned.  The dinners have been hot, sauced and appropriately sized compared to the other locations.

I cannot express how happy we are that these changes have been implemented...and I hope they continue to stay that way."}
{"text":"The food is okay. Typical chain fare. The problem we have in EVERY Olive Garden is the way they pace the service of the meal. I do not like getting my entrée 3 minutes after being served my soup/salad. I want to be able to enjoy my soup without the entrée getting cold. When I remember, I have asked the wait staff to hold off on the entrée and they'll do it. 
It is apparently the way they operate to quickly turn the table. Unfortunately it makes us feel rushed to get out of the place. 
Not good."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time we have been to this location and each time it gets worse. The first time we sat in the bar and our waiter could not have been more disinterested. The second time our waitress forgot to put in our order until she realized everyone else had been served except us. Tonight we were sat for 10 min before they took our drink order. Again, poor service. We will be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to this location for lunch today. The waiter smelled like a pack of cigarettes, the salad was soaked in dressing. There was hardly any lettuce in the salad as well. We had to ask the waiter 5 times to bring some garlic bread, he finally did when we were almost done eating. My sons lasagna was cold and my ravioli was a cold congealed mess. I have had to many bad experiences at this location in Pineville and will never return again. We're not even sure we will go to any Olive Garden again."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant but what happened to David???  He was the heart and soul of this place ... kept us coming back.  We miss him terribly."}
{"text":"Went to the Glendale location on a Sunday night and it was pretty busy so we sat at the bar. The two male bartenders were friendly, efficient and helpful. We both had the rosemary chicken which was just all right . Basically chicken breast ( kinda foamy tasting) in a garlic and lemon-buttery sauce with garlic mashed potatoes over raw spinach. $14.95. Would have been much better with the spinach sauteed and less sauce. It's hard to find a meal not drenced in sauce at Olive garden and I ordered this meal thinking it would be lighter but it wasn't. Service was excellent and food mediocre."}
{"text":"Oh my, what a disaster. I will simply say that I should have known better. I thought to myself, \"how bad could it be?\" 
    Perhaps they should actually serve the food the way it looks on tv. I see the commercials often enough that I assumed it comes out to the tables looking delicious and colorful. It was beige on beige with a random color here and there. I think I had seven pieces of a diced tomato in my dish. 
     Perhaps I shouldn't have expect a quality meal two hours before they close? But that doesn't explain why it took close to two hours for us to get all of our food. I kid you not, our appetizer took 50minutes. Then another 50 for the entrees. You would think the entrees would have been quicker since they knew the app had problems, it was taken off our check. 
     Perhaps the service could have been better? I'm still not sure which one of the five people constantly wandering behind the bar making chocolate milkshakes for the staff was the bartender. 
     Perhaps I shouldn't be writing such an openly honest and deadly accurate review. It may cost someone their job. 
     Perhaps that person will be the district manager who clearly has no grasp on this store."}
{"text":"Service is great when you are not being pressured into wine. 3 cheese marinara with crispy chicken and cavatapii is delicious. Chicken gnocchi soups is great. Chicken parm sandwiches are extremely small. Ron is great"}
{"text":"I rarely go to an Olive Garden anymore. It just doesn't seem to measure up!

While in Vegas I saw this restaurant and the parking lot wasn't full--and we had very little time to be adventurous. We went in and were pleasantly surprised to have good, fast service and decent grub. The noodles were even cooked al dente!!! It felt like we hit the Olive Garden Dream! They should be a training location.  

There was one shortfall... only one sink working in the restroom; and it only had cold water. So, OG almost rolled the elusive 5...but, 4-Stars is much better than I thought going in. I expected a 3 at best.  

If you like OG, they'll hook you up! EXCEPT for hot water in the men's room."}
{"text":"Olive Garden has always been one of my favorite restaurants over the years. When I came to this location for my birthday, they really treated me like a queen. The service was great with an entertaining waitress and bar tender and the free dessert was even better! Thanks for making my birthday special!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Very good selection and price choices.  Service was quick and efficient. Food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Food was good abd our waitress was nice. Took a party of 9 and all orders were correct which is a big deal to me :) 
Took a little while for the check though. Besides this, everything else was great!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Olive Garden and I was very disappointed by the service. The server that catered to us was just horrible (Not to mention any names). He came to our table at least 3x the whole dinner and took about 7 minutes to retake our order because we wanted something else. I am very generously giving them 3 stars as the food was really good. I ordered the Tour of Italy and the portion was plentiful. I couldn't even finish my  order and had to bring it home. But at least he sort of made up for by giving us a whole bag of that awesome breadsticks! I will for sure be going to Olive Garden again, but just not this one."}
{"text":"This is a solid Italian choice, decent prices and quite a good selection of all the staples of Italian cuisine. Endless breadsticks and salad are a crowd favorite, and if your not watching the waist line get a side of Alfredo for your breadsticks, it's next level. Pretty much everything I've tried has not disappointed, really good \"build your own pasta bowls\" and the \"Tour of Italy\" is a good taste of some classics. All in all a great choice for Italian eats."}
{"text":"So many better places to go.  I don't think these folks get much business.  You could tell the soup was probably sitting for days.  The oil used to fry was a bit old.  All in all, if you want good italian food, just search Yelp and you'll be directed to some bangn' spots."}
{"text":"Annoying server Dino, who by the way never even told us his name (I had to look on his shirt to read it) kept coming to \"check\" on me and my sister while we were trying to eat. Every time he would come to the table I would have food in my mouth, obviously unable to answer, yet he would still just come to the table and sit there. When the time came to pay our bill he took my card out of my hand and basically gave himself a 20% tip. He pressured us and was extremely rude and pushy about it he made us feel that he was entitled to the tip when all he did was annoy us the whole time. He deserves a demotion. 
If I could rate 0/5 I would
Do not recommend this particular person the rest was because he ruined our dining experience, other than that the restaurant was ok."}
{"text":"Olive Garden soup, salad & breadsticks are always on point but we had the best waiter ever! William M. was absolutely outstanding. He was at tentative, friendly & he even wrote the date & items on the to-go boxes. He refilled drinks when they were half way & is the reason we will come back again."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that I frequent here as often as I do. Anyhow, I've been trying new dishes as of late. Today I tried the garlic grilled chicken on spinach with mashed potatoes. 
The sauce flavor was perfectly balance. The mashed potatoes were not too fluffy-- and the chicken was nice and tender."}
{"text":"The olive garden is one of my favorite restaurants. But on Sunday the service wasn't so good. We got seated and the waiter asked us for our drink order. When it was my turn I ordered a screwdriver, I got the strangest look which mad me feel uncomfortable. So I  said you wanted my drink order right and he sad yes and left the table. Every one else at the table got their drinks and mine came about 10 minutes after and tge waiter tell me he didn't know what a screwdriver was. And sad he was sorry it took so long. The food was good. But then I looked at my water glass and it had a crack in it. Another person at the table asked for more water and never got it. Over just poor service. .. In Calif. When paying our bill we would get chocolate mint but didn't get it here. I don't know if they don't hand them out in Az or not. It was always a nice treat at the end of meal so hey Az. Get some mints."}
{"text":"If you want to order takeout I suggest calling WAY ahead of time.... I called while I was still several miles away and was on hold for so long I was still on hold when I walked in the door! Not even an apology for the long wait..."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Olive Garden. The quick service, the large bowl of endless salad, and breadsticks took me by surprise! Literally, I was amazed by the huge bowl of salad! I ended up getting the classic lasagna. It was amazing! For 12.99, I got more food than what I paid for! They even offered us free sample of wine. Our server, Jeremy, provided us with excellent, attentive, and quick service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their endless breadsticks, they're the best part! The food, customer service & the atmosphere have always been 100% every time I have enjoyed a meal here. 5 starts Olive Garden, keep it up :)"}
{"text":"I used to eat at Olive Garden as a child and it used to be my favorite place to go. I decided to go with a friend and we both ordered the shrimp scampi with salad and soup. Our waiter was extremely polite and attentive, the venue was so so so loud. I don't know if it's always like that on a Monday night but it was not what I had expected for a dinner setting.. the large party next to us was heavy drinking but we're terribly loud but none the less we we're enjoying the soup and salad. It was exactly as we remembered! And the breadsticks!! Amazing. We had our soup and salad for about 2 mins before the subpar barely warm shrimp scampi came out. Just looking at the dish I was turned off. I had all of 4 shrimp I though I located another but it was just a tail. Our scampi was supposed to come with asparagus not asparagus ends! Each was hard, tough and bitter and the shrimp seemed to barely be seared. I tasted the pasta and it was the most unseasoned dish I've never had in front of me. The pasta was covered in olive oil with little to NO SEASONING. Major disappointment"}
{"text":"Clearly this location cares more about their sit down customers because I saw one pull into the to go parking spaces so bad that I then had to park at the back of the parking lot, these people walked right in and got seated. I ended up having to make two trips with everything because none of the staff could be bothered to offer to help or ask the other customer to please move their car. 
Not to mention they forgot the forks, guess we are going Ethiopian style."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden location is very good for a chain restaurant. I drive right past the Arrowhead location on my way here.  The Food and service are much better."}
{"text":"Service was MIA. Hard bland breadsticks. Half full salad bowl. Marinara dipping sauce was nothing more than canned tomatoes. So so experience.   Won't be returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Went recently with my cousin and aunt. The first question I asked was about the never ending pasta. That was last week...the server said that promo was over. This week it's back again...just saw the commercial. She proceeded to hand us 3 different menus. I asked about an entree and she told me that was only Monday through Thursday...so why give me that menu? It was a very busy Friday evening...I guess if your name doesn't end in a vowel you really don't know Good Italian Food. The salad was all lettuce. We asked for extra onions tomatoes and peppers. The potato soup was watery.... I'm just not an Olive Garden Fan. Too many other independent restaurants that have much better food. It's been years since I have gone to one... it'll be many till I return. Save some money...go somewhere else and get a much better dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered the baked ziti to go and it was more than I hoped for. Service was fast, Employees were very friendly and beautiful might I add... I recommend the baked ziti, try it out...and those breadsticks are to die for....prices are worth the quality and the service."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was fantastic.  The only reason I have to rank this one low is due to a sewage stink that is literally right outside the front door.  Not only could it kill your appetite before you get in, but it could make you lose a fine meal on the way out.

Sorry to have to say it, but it's the truth."}
{"text":"Celebrating my daughters student of the month. Proud mommy.  Love the salad and bread sticks. Tatiana's favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Jonathan was such an amazing server. My fiancé and I sat at the bar and had a great time talking with him. He was attentive and was very well informed on the menu. I had more than a few questions since I'm very indecisive. And he helped me pick a delicious meal. I love this location!"}
{"text":"Our server was amazing. He attended to our needs very promptly. Our meals went smoothly, except, at the end of my mom's meal, she found a hair in her pasta. This grossed her out and ruined her meal on her birthday. Boo!"}
{"text":"I don't know what their deal was, but most places don't have an issue seating 2 even on their busiest times. The is absolutely no excuse for a wait for 2 people at 4pm on a Tuesday. After waiting 10 minutes we left.  Normally 10 minutes isn't a big deal, but again, it was 4PM. On a Tuesday. The place was practically deserted. The real kicker was being completely ignored while being the only people in the waiting room. No explanations, updated wait times, just nothing."}
{"text":"I normally dine at the location on sunset but today I had an appointment on this side of town so my 2 children and I stopped in. Food is great as always. I love the chicken and gnocchi soup and lemon dolcini, yum yum. I was impressed with the speed of service here. Our server was quick and efficient. At the other location I'm always having to ask for everything and service is always so slow. But today definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Today was the second time I have eaten at this particular Olive Garden this year. Service was fine, as usual, but I thought I had found a few small changes that I'm not sure I'm a fan of. I usually drink the house Moscato, and it seems they've changed brands to something not quite as crisp. I also felt like the breadsticks were extra salty this time. 

Not a huge deal, but the changes were enough for me to notice. 

Beyond that, food came quickly, server was very kind and prompt, and the food was tasty. Four stars for a good meal, with some changes I personally wasn't a fan of. I'll be interested to see if Olive Garden is making those changes everywhere, or if its just this one."}
{"text":"I've never been so disappointed in Olive Garden. I'm one to try different plates wherever I go, but at Olive Garden my go-to is ALWAYS Braised Beef and Tortelloni. The sauce is to die for and I crave it on a regular basis. I ordered this as usual, but this time...no sauce. Totally dry. How sad is that? It tasted like noodles and beef with no added flavor. My husband got the lasagna and it was literally half the size of a piece that I would cut for myself at home. For $15?! Not cool. You never want to be hungry after ordering from a restaurant, but boy is he. Lastly, the easiest thing, breadsticks! Totally tough and impossible to chew. I will not return to this location. Which is so sad because it's the closest one to me and it's fairly new! You'd think they might put a little more effort behind their cooking. In case you're wondering, I'm giving an extra star because my soup was really good. Thank heavens."}
{"text":"I went to this spot 4 years ago and had the best service and food from an Italian waiter guy. This time I went and the staff is now totally different. very hispanic and the salad wasn't chopped up and the dressing was very acidic. My waitress was nice but the food wasn't up to par like I remembered."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant for a decent meal. I love their soups and salads options as well. and the salty bread they offer at the beginning. good price for the amount of food offered."}
{"text":"Went to your restaurant Saturday for my sister's 50th from the staff at the front door to the bar tenders to waiters and waitresses what a fantastic experience Dave the manager is running a top notch restaurant we walked in 15 of us and have never been treated nicer way to go keep up the great work it truly shows thank you and we had a great time"}
{"text":"The service here was HORRIBLE. We went for my friends birthday and our server Amber P was less then helpful. There was about 11 of us and we were treated like 5 years olds. Amber was rude and acted like we didn't know we were in a restaurant. The food was great! However we were rushed through our meal. She told us we were getting to \"comfortable\" with our salad so we were asked to order. After we ordered and got our food to go boxes were put into our friends shoulder to pass out to everyone. When we received our checks we were told that it was our jobs to take care of our waitress and tip. I'd rather drive to the McDonald's."}
{"text":"Our experience at this olive garden was mediocre at best. 
The only reason they received a two star rating is because our waiter Tyler P. was absolutely fantastic. Let me start by saying they were ridiculously busy, however we couldn't have been sitting at the table longer than ten extra minutes when they kept coming by and asking if we needed anything else, as if to rush us out. Finally, we took the hint and went to sit outside on their benches. Can you believe at least four different servers went outside to ask us if we were waiting for a cab or needed anything else (our server included)? So I asked if we were not allowed to sit there and Tyler said he didn't care what we did because he was off the clock, not rudely though. So we continued to sit there and talk, when a heavier set white woman walked outside and asked us if we needed anything else inside because she was about to lock up. We said no, then about ten minutes later my friend asked if she could go inside because she just realized she lost her key and this woman wouldn't even open the door to let her in to look. She spoke to us through the door as if we were criminals. The staff was rude, unprofessional and happy to take our money but annoyed that we sat OUTSIDE on the benches to talk. I was visiting from out of town and had not seen my friends in almost six months and won't see them again for another year or so. They ruined my experience and when I come back into town I'll be sure to let everyone know this particular location isn't worth the time of day.

UPDATE: I called the manager the next day to tell him about my experience with his less than professional staff, and his exact words? \"That Sucks\".  He seemed like he didn't care so I took the gift card he offered with all my money back since I can use it at any location.  Maybe losing business will help them care more.  All in all, I could not care less about $20, I just need them to get their act together."}
{"text":"I just don't get how anyone can eat at Olive Garden....Over cooked pasta, frozen entrees, way over priced, crowded...I will say service has always been decent the few times I've been forced to go there."}
{"text":"Been around a long time.  A franchise, so the food and experience you get here is pretty close to the same as other places.  The Champaign location, however, seems to have good service consistently.  This, despite being very busy at peak University events.  Graduations, home football games, you name it, this place is packed, but still provides a consistently great experience.

Most of the wait staff I have spoken with are students at the University.  The management at this Olive Garden seems to do a great job identifying the responsible students and training them so that they are always pleasant and spot on.

Overall, a consistently great meal and experience."}
{"text":"The Olive Garden across from the Concord Mills Mall is absolutely the worst Olive Garden we have ever been in. Today was our second visit. My husband and I had hopes that our first time was just a \"bad night\". Unfortunately that was not the case.  When our salad arrived our waitress placed a clearly dirty plate in front of me. We pointed it out and asked for another plate. It never came. I then had to ask another waitress to please bring me a salad plate. Our Waitress did finally return to apologize for forgetting my plate. I ordered the tour of Italy. The lasagna was burned. Not just burned but the entire bottom was absolutely black. We finished our first glass of wine. We were never offered another glass, more salad or bread. Terrible Food and worse Service.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went right when they opened the doors for the day. The staff was very nice and we were seated immediately. The waiter was great and personable. We did not have the special but got the stuffed chicken marsala with garlic parmesean mashed potatos with nochi soup. Wonderful and fast to serve. The bread sticks were always fresh and hot. We had dessert. I had the strawberry white cake seasonal. Not very sweet just right YUMMY. My husband had the Lemon cake. It was tasty but, mine was the bomb!! Well worth going and perfect to go and get out of the heat for a while."}
{"text":"The wait to be seated was as expected, about 25 minutes. Decided to try the Chicken marsala. Not impressed. The chicken was alright, but it was served with over roasted potatoes. Instead of the traditional Garlic Mashed potatoes, That would have made the world of difference."}
{"text":"well this was an epic fail of Olive Garden, wait staff, management and operation of the place.  This was by far the worse service i have ever gotten at a restaurant.  My folks and I got there we had to give our name.  i then saw at least 10 employees standing looking at us and another couple, and one of the workers says who is sitting tables.  5 mins later we finally get seated at a very small table.  we sit there for 10 mins and finally someone comes by and puts these little green coasters on our table and leaves.  10 mins we get up and walk away.  we were never greeted at all.  as we leave the door person says have a nice day.  My mom says we won't be coming here again to her reply says oh if you wait i can get a manager.  we aren't wasting are time at this establishment and it is my recommendation that you don't do the same."}
{"text":"I used UberEats to get dinner from this Olive Garden at Cheyenne & Rainbow in Las Vegas. My order was incorrect. I called and was placed on hold for five minutes waiting to speak with a manager. Jessica the manager stated that I would need to contact Uber directly to rectify the problem. Any other restaurant that I have contacted regarding a wrong order via a delivery service have offered a credit for the next time that I come in. I am not impressed with the customer service at this location."}
{"text":"Five stars for a wonderful staff and manager who went out of the way to help us retrieve a lost birthday card."}
{"text":"Can't think of a reason to give anything less than 5 stars. Yeah, it's a chain but every time I visit, the menu selection is really good, the food is good, the service is great, the prices are reasonable, it's clean, good atmosphere and ample parking. What else to say?"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Manager came around greeting guest and asking if meal was good."}
{"text":"Service is always great.  We have never come and received bad or mehhhh service.  Food as always the same as the other restaurants.  I think the ambiance and servers make this place the great experience that it is."}
{"text":"I have been to a Olive Garden three times and today was by far the best service ever thanks to our server Kalisha.  She was not only hard working but extremely pleasant and made our experience a very pleasant one.  If I was living here I would come here just to give her our business.  Thanks Kalisha for your amazing service."}
{"text":"I had grilled chicken tuscano...so dry I couldn't cut it with the knife they gave me.   my husband sent it back and the second plate had half the risotto as the first   risotto was great   chicken was crappy frozen breast with a horrible sauce that had no correlation with the rice   cost me 14. dollars  felt like the worst offense of quality food at a restaurant EVER....sutter home wine ..half a small glass for the price of a bottle from ANY store..."}
{"text":"Took my mom and grandma back in june. Service was not as i had experienced in other olive garden locations but the food was good. I assumed it was a one time thing.
Took a friend to this same place and this time the service as well as the food was awful. They brought our soups, entrees, appetizers and wine all at once. The silver ware was not clean. It was the first time for my friend so i wanted him to have a good experience. He swears of never going to another olive garden again!"}
{"text":"It is a chain so you know what to expect. The service level at this location is exactly what I would expect it is busy on Friday night but on the whole I have never been let down here"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of big corporate \"Italian-style\" chain resturants, and the OG is one of my least favorites (behind Maggianos, Macaroni Grill, and Bucca di Bepo). I would never choose to go here over a locally owned place, but unfortunately, there are times that I find myself at one of these types of places for a work or social event planned by someone else.  

That is how I ended up at this OG location.  There were about 15 of us, and you would think a big corporate chain like OG would be well versed in serving large groups, but on this particular visit, the service was even worse than the food (which is not very good in my opinion).

The service was PAINFULLY slow and the server(s) kept forgetting to bring items to the table.  It took forever to get drinks to the the table.  Then,  I had ordered soup with unlimited salad & breadsticks... as did several folks at the table.  With so many eating salad, it was gone in no time and it took forever to get more to the table. A couple of people didn't get their entrees at the same time, so awkwardly sat at the table waiting for food.  

This attempt at lunch ended up taking  2+ hours - which is ok for a dinner event but completely unacceptable at lunch time when you have to get back to work.  The bad service coupled with the mediocre food just makes this place a big waste of time.  Next time someone plans an event here - lunch or dinner - I will just have to respectfully decline."}
{"text":"Recently went here to lunch and everything was pretty good. I had the unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks which you can't beat for 7 bucks. The waiter was friendly and fast bringing the food and filled our drinks numerous times without having to ask. The atmosphere was relaxing and there was no wait when we got there."}
{"text":"Called in my order at 5:15pm yesterday. Was told that my order would be ready in 25 minutes. Got there to try and pick up my order and should have known it would take long when the person in front of me was waiting for almost an hour for their order. No one acknowledged me for at least 20 minutes and when I finally got someone they at first said that they couldn't find my name and I told them again and they finally found it. I was told it was only a few minutes and it would be ready. After waiting for 30-35 minutes I still didn't get my food and I tried to get a manager and that took 10 minutes to get. Finally got my food at 7:30pm. Now on I'll go to portofino's from now on. Won't get my business ever again"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time in 3 years for my birthday supper only to be horribly disappointed by the quality and the manager Oscar. I ordered the berry spritzer and the first one was delicious, the second was nothing but syrup and when I sent it back a new one was not made just more was added to it still leaving it unbearably sweet. So I changed it for sangria and was horrified to find it still the same. My daughter ordered shrimp Alfredo and her shrimp was forgotten. The manager Oscar came over to the table and told me \"sangria is supposed to be sweet\". Because I've never drank it before in my 36 years. He never even mentioned the forgotten shrimp nor took off the sugar sangria that was not even drank. POOR management service!!!!!! Never ever will I be back. Thanks for a great birthday Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I came here with my family to celebrate my Auntie's birthday. The waitress was nice, but seemed really stressed and in a hurry. She only had 3 tables that she was waiting on because there was literally no one there since we came right when it opened. The food tasted good, but nothing that wowed me. The problem was that they had flies in the restaurant. It was annoying having to keep swatting the flies away when we were inside and not outside. That is a bad sign if there are bugs inside the place. We brought a coupon and our waitress forgot to add it so we reminded her about it and she seemed stressed out. The only reason I would say not to come here is because of the flies."}
{"text":"After we switched seats due to a loud baby (actually the kid looked 3), we enjoyed the usual OG stuff. Tried the new Italian quesadilla and it turned out good stuffed with chicken and spinach and cheese. The salad was standard and the breadsticks were nice and hot as usual. Nice staff on this day who helped us relocate. Still, only need to go here a few times a year, but it is good for lunch only."}
{"text":"I'm giving Olive Garden as a whole (company) 1 Star. The staff is always nice and the restaurant is clean. They have changed the menu over the years and removed the artichoke and spinach dip, which was amazing!!! So we stopped going. I recently saw it on the menu again and was very excited to have it. Well they have change the recipe. It used to be creamy with a little spice, now it's cheesy (like just melted cheese) and totally bland. The bread was also burned on the edges and it was a total waste of money. I understand that corporate has tried to rebrand their image but you do not need to fix what isn't broken. It discourages regular guest from returning."}
{"text":"They lost my debit card, then the manager became rude with us. I'll never eat here again...."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to dinner with a group of my friends. As we sat there joking around having a good time we see a cockroach climbing the walls, but giving them the benefit of the doubt decide to stay. The service gets worse, the endless soup apparently only entails you get one soup and the breadsticks I think we got only 3 baskets the whole night for 9 people. And as I sit here sick to my stomach wondering why I realize that is the only thing I had to eat today. is it a coincidence that there was a cockroach going around the restaurant and now I'm sick? Think twice before eating here."}
{"text":"Never got my \"endless\" soup salad and breadsticks. Hair in my pasta. When we asked for more salad and breadsticks she came over 15 minutes later and said would we be paying cash or credit."}
{"text":"Typical OG experience design with a twist, the waitress very clumsily spilled about three big gulps of sweet tea in my steak gorgonzola and then handed me the plate as if nothing to happened. Guess she thought it needed a little umph in the flavor department."}
{"text":"I tend to come here with the lady friend from time to time.  The atmosphere is a somewhat relaxing and staff is friendly.  Olive Garden usually has coupons and occasionally has specials such as the \"never ending pasta bowl\".  Place is clean and prices are fairly reasonable.  Prices for meals around $12-14 but for those who are watching portion size and cost, a \"lunch size portion\" can be ordered."}
{"text":"Had a small issue with my Togo called in to just let them know and the manager Bryan was great I will be returning because how he handled the situation."}
{"text":"Always a good place to have some lunch or dinner I don't really take this place as a \"fancy\" restaurant but it's not bad food is always pretty good."}
{"text":"The salmon was burnt and the manager was rude. My family will never go back. There are too many good restaurants around this area."}
{"text":"Had one of the pronto lunches with salad. As always, salad and breadsticks were delicious. The pasta came in a small bowl but was a perfect lunch size. Mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and I did rainbow penne with some type of tomato sauce and it was ok."}
{"text":"It's an Olive Garden so nough said... If u haven't been to one your not American.

I don't need to write about the decor or food then.

But I will say it smells like raw sewage every time I drive by going home down Osborn"}
{"text":"Olive Garden is a very commercial low end Italian Restaurant.
Gravy/sauce is right out of o can. Chicken Parm is precooked and is served with over cooked paste. However, service was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is one of our must stops in Vegas. I went to college in a town with an Olive Garden close by so we frequented the restaurant often. Unfortunately, there is not one where I live. So when we visit Vegas, it is a place were go to and I reminisce of my college days!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went to Olive Garden yesterday for lunch. The thing about chain restaurants is usually the food is the same no matter where you go, but the service is what makes the difference. Our server was Phillip and he was so nice! He told us about the options but what made the difference was his delivery.  he was fun and joking and very light-hearted.  My mom and I did the 2 for 25 deal and started with the fried zucchini and fried mozzarella. For some reson though, instead of mozzarella, we got the beef ravioli.  This turned out to be a nice surprise because I never would have tried these on my own, but they ended up being delicious.  For my meal, I had the eggplant parmesan and my mom had some chicken dish (I don't remember and neither does she). My dish was delicious and perfectly cooked. My mom's dish on he other hand was too salty. She sent it back, but when Phillip returned with her newly prepared dish, it was still salty and they figured it must be the sauce.
Even though her dish wasn't the best, she overall had a good experience and so did I. We will definitely be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"As always the service was good, salad was amazing, and entree was bad.
We ordered 2 appetizers (the sampler with the stuffed mushrooms & chicken wings and the smoked Mozarilla as 2nd appetizer) the sampler was a big disappointment espically the wings, but the Mozarilla was really good, as for entree we got chicken alfreado& steak Gorgonzola both fettuccine were under cook the sauce wasn't enough and it didn't cover all the dish.
I always keep telling myself to only order salad and desert, but I keep forgetting that :( , well not anymore."}
{"text":"It took ten minutes to get seated. I was given a free sample of wine right after arriving at our table (much appreciated). I got the Fettuccine Alfredo and unlimited minestrone soup. I had a bunch of parmesian cheese put in both just how I like it. The entree was good but seemed like it was a little dry hence the four stars, I felt like it needed more fettuccine sauce or something. The bread was alright, the butter made it taste better than it actually was. We had a kid at the table with us and he was able to play unlimited video games on a tablet for only $2, which was pretty awesome. The choice of music at the restaurant was classic and smooth, I dug it. Adaorah was our server and she was absolutely amazing. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Just ordered take out. Wife had chicken Parisians, I had the Tuscan Sirloin. Everything was great except they never gave me garlic mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"If you could avoid this specific location, please do. My family and I sat for nearly twenty minutes waiting for someone to take our drink order. We had multiple servers pass by our table and nothing- they were too busy drinking soda in their side stations. Good thing BJs was next door!"}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain, but a very good one. I like it because it's kid friendly and reasonably priced. The kids love the unlimited breadsticks, I has to move the basket so they'd save room for the actual dinner. Service is great, and not to long of a wait for food. Our group were all satisfied. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Solid, exactly what you expect every time.

I pretty much always have good service here. Only a few times has it been off.

The food is just kind of eh..I typically just stick to the basics. Their specials are a little over the top."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  It's been over a year since I have gone out for Italian, since I used to run Italian Restaurants for 7 years.  And we chose Olive Garden.   

Positives: Server is nice and wait wasn't bad.

Negative: I asked the server if she could substitute clams for shrimp in the seafood fettuccine.  I was told no, because all of the food is pre portioned for the dishes.  I don't think it is that difficult to take a pre portioned  bag of clams and place it into a sauté pan! 

Two thumbs down for management and Darden restaurants for allowing a server to actually explain that to me.  

Thank goodness the server is nice!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing but what made this experience a 5 star night out was the service we received. The waitress by the name of Mona was exceptionally attentive to our needs and went over and above when it came to customer care. Because of Mona I will recommend this location time and time again to family and friends."}
{"text":"I have been a pretty solid customer of Olive Garden over the years, (despite the \"local business snobs\" who scream and rant if anything smells of consistency, process, or predictability--3 things I highly value in foodservice)...... But it really seems to have started a downward slide.  
This visit may have been 75% the fault of our server, who was just an overly chatty middle aged woman who couldn't stop talking AT LENGTH every time she stopped to do anything for anyone, which made \"prompt service\" basically an impossibility.  

I first asked for ranch sauce with our salad (I always do).  This took her close to 15min & required a reminder.  When the food came my daughter's kid's \"fettucini w/shrimp\" contained no shrimp.  She went off on her extremely lengthy mission to rectify it, but when she finally came back half an hour later, all she brought was a plate of shrimp.  Does the cook not know that common sense & custom dictate, when you have messed up someone dish, you bring a NEW ONE so that they don't have to dump the newfound bits of shrimp on top of a now-COLD plate??  I mean this is a $5 kids meal, would fresh pasta have been so hard.  Does the server not know that when the cook behaves that foolishly, you question it and advocate for the customer BEFORE bringing it out?  

After forgetting most of our subsequent requests that evening, she finally brought the bill.  In my mind I expected them to have dropped my daughter's kids meal entirely, as that is custom when you have royally messed up someone's dinner.  But no - not only was it still on there, but they had accidentally ADDED a $3.50 charge for the very shrimp issue!??!  ... WTF, I thought, but I quite kindly informed the chatty server and let her go off on another rectifying mission.  (Did the server not know that servers usually give the bill a visual once-over on their way out, especially if the table has had problems, to see whether or not things look alright?  I know that just from experience as a consumer.  Surely she could have cobbled this knowledge together just from common sense and her own goings-out, much less server experience).

It wasn't just that things went wrong for her, she made a series of bad choices.  I don't know what it is about females working at service-oriented businesses; so often it seems they fall into the chatty-ditzy role where everything is about long conversations and loud guffaws & cackles.  The problem is, this is only charming to the person at whom it is directed (if that).  The other 15 people waiting for you are suffering, and your lounging about does not go unnoticed...Obviously the cost of the 15 outweighs what you may gain from chatting it up AT GREAT LENGTH with the 1......  This person deserved no tip, but I did leave her a bit."}
{"text":"Service was terrible...food would have been good had we got it in a timely manner... Waitress was on a natural high...felt like i was in Mr. Rogers neighborhood...i think i will be going to a diff. Olive Garden from now on!"}
{"text":"Seated promptly.  Didn't have the specials on the table.  When we asked the waitress, she seemed like we were a burden.  Really she acted like this throughout the meal.  Asked if I could give my toddler a few bites of my pasta and was told if I did that it would be considered sharing.  Um. really?  maybe three noodles?  Forced to buy him a $6 bowl of soup that he ate maybe 3 bites of.  Never got any more bread.  Glasses were empty the majority of time.  Refills took over 30minutes.  Pasta was mushy, overcooked.  Not a good experience at all.  Server was the worst experience of the entire meal."}
{"text":"it was a very long wait for a table to be set up for 5 people during non-busy times, there were about 4 to 5 hosts with no other customers waiting for a table. perhaps that team of hosts will need more training.

...the service was great once we got seated after 20 minute wait in a restaurant that wasn't packed."}
{"text":"Wish I could do less than 1 star. I called today to place a to go order and the lady that picked up the phone acted as if I was requesting her to move a mountain. It was such a pain for her to take a to go food order at a RESTAURANT. She hung up on me and then I called back and she said I need a better phone. I repeated myself 2-3 times and she said \"omg WHAT?\" Like she was doing something else and didn't have time to do her job. Then she said it would an hour?!?!? Are you kidding? To prepare 2 dishes? I asked \"really that long?\" She said \"uhh yea what do you expect?\" Hahaha this is about par for the crap concord mills area.... This place and area has gone down hill"}
{"text":"Very nice place! Lasagna frita is one of my fav appetizers! Service was good!!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The $8.95 endless pasta bowl with salad and breadsticks is phenomenal.  Great price, even better food, and our party of 30 was well taken care of.  A solid recommendation for any occasion."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately. Server was knowledgable and pointed out the menu's newest items. It's hard to pass up the soup and salad...so that is what we ordered. Soup was delicious and salad was fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"Met one of my dear friends here today for lunch...YAY for lunch specials!
I'm a huge fan of their salad & breadsticks, so I was happy to see the \"salad, breadsticks & soup\" for $6.99. I wasn't truly inspired by the soup offerings (I loved their Italian wedding soup they used to have), I went with the Pasta e Fagioli. We didn't wait long for the salad; however, it took a bit of time to receive our breadsticks & our entrees (my soup & her pasta entree). The soup was extremely hot, but very hearty & had just enough spicy kick. The breadsticks were so yummy & soft. The salad was just \"ok\", just didn't seem as tasty as I remember; very light on the dressing. 

Our waitress was nice & she wasn't overbearing. The restaurant was clean.

Plenty of parking & easy off & on 85."}
{"text":"What can you do with a 5 dollar bill? Have endless soup, salad, and breadsticks for only $5 at Olive Garden!! Sometimes our budgets can't handle a $20 meal, however Olive Garden's endless breadsticks, salad, and soup is a great alternative. Their Zuppa Toscana, Creamy Gnocchi, and Italian Chili are just a few of my favorites (another bonus: you can get a different soup every refill!) Olive Garden also has a wide variety of delicious pastas with sauces like carbonara, marinara, fettuccini, pesto, etc. They even have a \"Build Your Own Pasta\" option where you can choose a meat to throw in such as, shrimp, meatballs, chicken, beef, etc. This certain location has speedy service, courteous wait staff, and awesome cooks. Overall, Olive Garden is one of my favorite restaurant chains. Whether you're looking to penny pinch with endless soup/salad, or enjoy a luxurious custom pasta.. this place is for you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant on July 6, 2009, The waiter was unhappy that he only had a few tables to wait on, yet this seemed to many, he was getting the tables orders mixed up, and forgetting the order that people were sat down. It took over 30 minuets for us to get our salad, and if you have ever been to an Olive Garden, that's the easiest thing to get. Now if that wasn't bad enough, there wasn't any dressing on the salad, then to top it off we sat there for 20 more minuets after we were done waiting for a bill. The meals was OK, not the greatest, yet I think the over all, food was good, service was terrible."}
{"text":"How many things can go wrong on a Sunday afternoon? Salad came out with multiple items that we said to exclude. My kid's order came out without shrimp that she ordered and was not entered correctly by the waitress even when I held up the menu and pointed at the items. When we complained to the waitress that it had been 12 minutes since being back in the kitchen getting corrected, she said that the kitchen was backed up. Then, the manager stopped by and said the same thing. How long does it take to cook a few small shrimp to add to a plate??? Answer: Over 15 minutes. To top it off, my kid's order was entered multiple times into the check with only one being taken off by the manager. Took another 10 minutes to get that correct. Now, this restaurant is on my banned list."}
{"text":"Quiet a nice place, friendly staff, well decorated place.  

Quick service, great food.   Strange though, i went one Saturday evening and a whole section was empty."}
{"text":"Very clean Olive Garden. GREAT service - very friendly"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. Great atmosphere! Half price wine ! AWESOME! I love coming to this olive garden always so friendly."}
{"text":"What should have been a nice family dinner out before the holidays (which we don't often do) was quickly ruined by the waitress. Our order was placed and I asked for the soup to be brought out at the same time as the apetizers. I mentioned it would be for my child and we would get the second one after we finished that one. She then said well if I bring out another one Ill have to charge you $4.99. I explained to her I always share my soup with my 4 year old. She said well your not suppose to. She then continued to explain that if my husband were to share his salad with me or my kid she would have to charge a separate salad. I immediately asked for my soup to go and the 2nd soup at the additional price.  I sat there while my husband and child enjoyed their food and took mine home. I had no appetite after that. She must have mentioned it to her supervisor as she was walking around asking everyone in our area if everything was ok. Just a horrible experience. I didnt say anything and quickly paid for our meal. Almost $70 for a bad time. 2 stars because at thr very least service was fast. Meals were brought out on time. I understand protocols but it was unecessary, really unecessary."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden location was fantastic. The decorations were standard design by Olive Garden. This location was clean and their staff friendly and efficient. We enjoyed our visit very much.

If you're craving Olive Garden - this location is great!"}
{"text":"Dirty, staff is unmotivated and poorly trained. Wait for tables too long with many people seated ahead of my party despite them arriving after. Response to complaints to management was half hearted and poorly executed.

The food is sub par - never going to this or any of the others again."}
{"text":"We came in for soup and salad ($7.99). We were surprised that they had pasta and salad lunch specials for the same price. So we all got sandwich meals with our pasta and salad. For starters, I enjoyed the chicken and gnocchi soup and the pasta fagioli. Two in our part enjoyed the house salad. Remember that it is unlimited, so if you want to take your meal home, you can definitely do that. We enjoyed the delicious breadsticks as well. Tip: The server is always happy to grind some fresh Parm on your dishes. The sandwiches were a nice size. Chef needs to be careful about how the sauce is plated because the fries got soggy from sauces. Also, the bread used was too soft and becomes mushy when the sauce is added to the meats. My Catabrian sauce was too spicy for my palette. The meatball sandwich was on the dry side. My daughter enjoyed her Fettucine Alfredo. We got more food with the specials, but once again, we enjoyed the soup and salad best."}
{"text":"I honestly come to Olive Garden because I know I am going to get pretty good meal here. 

We ordered the create your own pasta ( angel hair, shrimp, alfredo)  and the chicken and shrimp carbonara. Both means we're very hot and pretty good. There was plenty of meat and lots of sauce. The Alfredo was a little bland but with some extra cheese was better.

We also had the unlimited salad and chicken gnocchi soup and they were both great.

The best part of the experience was our server Edwin. He was super nice and attentive. He was already there when we were looking for him. He did an exceptional job."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this location and had a great meal and time! There were 9 people in our party and they assigned us two servers. The food was fantastic and the service was friendly, helpful and on-the-mark the entire time! I would recommend this location to everyone I know.

A solid 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Satisfying soup! After a long evening of performances, my daughter and I dragged our tired bodies to Olive Garden. We were surprised that there were so many people in the restaurant at 8:45 pm. We chose to sit at the bar because we didn't want to wait 15 minutes. Our bartenders were great and hooked us up with water immediately. As much as I craved a Tanqueray and tonic, I refrained because I had to drive. We chose to eat soup. I promptly ate 3 bowls: Chicken Gnocchi, Pasta Fagioli, and Zuppa Tuscana. My daughter started with the chicken gnocchi, then had the minestrone. Of course, we enjoyed dipping their signature bread-sticks into our soups. The freshly grated Parmesan cheese is always a nice touch. If you ever want a quick affordable meal, choose the tour of soups. Our dinner bill was under $16 with a YELP-style tip."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We had a fly in our salad. Then didn't get a discount had to get a manager and got only 20%. Paid with cash and got the wrong change due to the cashier not giving us the discounted amount and said that was the discounted amount showed us the receipt and wow it wasn't the correct receipt. Then we found the discounted receipt ripped up in the trash so the guy tried ripping is off. I would never come back to this place again and would not recommend this to a friend."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. Always know we can stop here and get a good quality meal for a fair price and wonderful attentive service.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I love me some Olive Garden - always have. Yes, I'm very aware the food here is as American as apple pie and not authentic Italian in the least. It's not a secret, and I've always enjoyed Olive Garden for what it is and nothing more. I'm particularly fond of this location since it's usually a little less crowded than the one by the South Hills Village Mall. I say usually because the last time I was here the place was paaaaaaaaacked. Apparently Tuesday nights are the night for pasta in Pittsburgh now?

In case you didn't know, Olive Garden recently(ish) overhauled their menu and cooking styles, and I've really enjoyed eating at Olive Garden since then. The best addition for me has been the creation of lighter fare dishes, which are what I usually order now. The chicken and tilapia piccata dishes have become my go-to items - both are served with parmesan-crusted zucchini, and both are prepared in zesty sauces that compliment the protein and don't ruin your calorie counting efforts for a month.

But of course, the salad bowl and breadsticks are still a staple here, and they admittedly kind of ruin all my healthy eating efforts after I order those healthier main dishes. But I could never skip them - not when they're such a key part of a meal here! Once I add in those, it's more like I'm ruining my calorie count for the week at worst. And...that's admittedly not a terrible price to pay for those beloved breadsticks!

Consistently good service and tasty cocktails are the cherries on top of a place that I've always been fond of. One day, I'll be back ready to splurge on one of those pasta dishes - but until then, piccata dishes it is for this girl!"}
{"text":"Congratulations on your new opening! Service was great.

Guess who's joined Westgate! We live binging at Olive Garden with their unlimited soups. The bowls seem smaller here but the bowls are wiped and presented beautifully.

Each soup is crafted here to perfection. Our favorite is the change Chen and gnocchi with lovely wilted spinach. Then also like the Pasta e Fagioli. It has pasta in a hearty tomato and beef base. Then I eat the zesty Zuppa Toscana with kale and sausage. If I have room, I hit the chicken and gnocchi again. All for under $10 and dip breadsticks in them!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten at this specific Olive Garden maybe three or four times. The first time I ordered the tour of Italy and found the food to be just ok, mediocre at best. I did however really enjoy their chicken and gnocchi soup. I went there for just that the second and third time. The staff is great and the service was pretty quick. I would recommend them although I was not a fan of what I ordered the first time."}
{"text":"First visit here w/ pasta pass. Chicken gnocchi soup was loaded w/ dumplings but short on chicken, breadsticks were old n hard. Pasta w Asiago and grilled chicken was superb. Nice server, very fast. Got refill w/ meatball = tasty.  Had take home box for another meal!"}
{"text":"Got the pasta pass, sat at bar, Bryon bar tender did most excellent job.  5 cheese marinara is best, grilled chicken tasty. Chicken gnocchi soup pretty good. Refill portion really tiny on breaded chicken though."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was all good. Huge salad. Just a bit smelly as we walked up in to the mezzanine section. Place could use a good steam cleaning."}
{"text":"Always good service and actually a darn good value. The salad and soup are endless. Also the food portions are perfect, not too huge, not too small. Come hungry, leave happy."}
{"text":"I've been coming here all of my life but this was the first time for lunch. Their duos are not only sized right but more importantly, priced right. The salad is what keeps me coming back, always delicious!"}
{"text":"Just as good as any other Olive Garden."}
{"text":"My friend makes me come to various Olive Gardens at least 1-2 times a month.  The food is always hot and fresh.  If I'm in the mood for it, it hits the spot.  My most recent visit I tried the make your own pizza instead of pasta.  It's not bad, but not the best I've had.   Of course the service was great and I have no complaints about this place.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my nearest Olive Garden and I have usually enjoyed it. But several days ago, went there with my date and experience wasn't as good.
Our waiter was a man named Derek(?). Very large and no hair. Never smiled once and was quite abrupt with us.
The food was good as always but a poor waiter can still bring down your evening."}
{"text":"Great dinner! We took my lil niece for her 8th birthday dinner & she loves this place! Our waiter Steven M. & he was awesome! Always there to fill our drinks, salad, soup & breadsticks! My niece enjoyed her dinner & the singing when all the waiters came with her dessert of choice & sang to her! Very good quality food & service! Thank you & big shout out to our wonderful waiter Steven M."}
{"text":"Super delish lasagna classico  !  Never ending classics.  W/ a moscow mule .Service is great."}
{"text":"Catered lunch

Beneath the breadsticks is chicken parmigiana, spaghetti, and salad with a tease of strawberry shortcake."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Friendly staff with good food. Fun for birthday parties. Nice atmosphere. Well-priced and convienently located."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden. 

Food and service were both okay. I thought that the special they have going on right now was a good deal, the dinner for two, as you get a lot of food. The smoked mozzarella chicken was overly \"smokey\" tasting - if that's possible, because it definitely was. The eggplant parmesan lacked flavor. 

The breadsticks satisfied my intense breadstick craving, and I enjoy their salad."}
{"text":"We tried out this place in spite of our earlier decision never to go back...
Service : just ok.
Food : free salad was ok. The fondue appetiser had a disgusting taste. The brushetta was fresh and light. The other meals were not special. 
Deserts were good.
Our waitress was friendly but too pushy for a tip.
Hate to say that this will be our last time to eat in an Olive Garden. Their good period is over."}
{"text":"Last night after a very long day at work my hubby decided to take me out to dinner we got there only 45 minutes before closing and were seated with Tom (our server) he was AMAZING! Didn't make us feel rushed and every order was out fast. The food was fantastic. We will continue to return to this location because of Tom and the amazing staff:)"}
{"text":"I love their pasta, breadsticks, and salads here.  Their food is top notch.  Too bad they charged us for every time I dipped my breadstick into marinara sauce, resulting in an extra fee just for sauce.  And honey, don't even think about having a birthday here.  They charge you for the whole shish-kabob."}
{"text":"I am NOT HAPPY. (If you order from here, please call to confirm your order, because they lost my pick up order... but MY time did not seem to matter to this restaurant's managers.)
OLIVE GARDEN SHOULD TREAT ALL ORDERS THE SAME!!! I felt extremely disrespected by the managers!!! The other staff were kind and apologetic... Thank you.
I was actually picking up a To-Go order and had to wait OVER 30 minutes. The order was placed at 6:17pm and I finally left the restaurant at 6:50pm.
Since I was picking the order up for someone else, I guess it's OK to just tell me to cancel the order... that way another driver will come get it. But wait.. one staff member told me to cancel while the other told me 5 minutes... not good business practice. 
It is NOT OK, I didn't cancel the order, I waited because I had already wasted my time... I was not treated with kindness. They seemed upset that I did not cancel the order?!?!
I know if the food were for me, something would have been done to adjust for this mistake, but because I am just delivering, I guess my time is less valuable.
I wonder if anyone there realized that, until now, I USED TO BE a loyal customer... GUESS NOT."}
{"text":"By far the worst service we've had in a while. Our service had zero priorities, zero multitask skills, and lacked organization. 

We ordered something fast and easy ..simple soup and salad unlimited. We kept having to ask him for refills on soda, bread,salad,soup...and it would take him 3visits to get it for us. 

We are so u happy with the service, this one visit ruined it for us. 

He tried to joke with us a couple times,but I'm sorry your personality can only go so far...hard work and great service is what gets you tips. Stop half a$%ing your job."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix a month ago and met with someone here. It's your average Olive Garden. The service we had was great though - she was very attentive and nice and wasn't impatient at all despite the fact we were there forever and a day."}
{"text":"I have been taking my 92 yr old neighbor to OG for several years, at least 1 a week. Always a great experience and great service until 16 Jan 2013. We were seated in Alexs' section, it was a terrible experience. She was not even friendly!! A couple came in after us and sat across from us, they already had their salad and bread sticks by the time we finally got our hot water for tea. The couplealso had their soup by the time we got our salad. Then Alex came by amd ask if we needed any more salad or soup. I clearly stated \"we just want our soup\" as we had yet to receive it!!! She still was in no hurry to get our soup, we will go back but will ask not to be seated in Alexs' section!!! I think OG neede to instill to be prompt and friendly when serving customers!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much what I expected from Olive Gardens. Consistently decent food, atmosphere, and price. Would've liked to be offered another bowl of soup, and don't like food arriving before you're done with the salad. Needs a little upgrade to the lighting."}
{"text":"Poor service, horrible food, 2 families had drinks spilled on them and their cell phones. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"OMG! Horrible! Ordered Shrimp Scampi and it looked like they used Top Ramen noddles. The pasta was very over cooked and the plate came out like a stir fry. This is my second trip to this place and both wee bad experiences. Forget the service it was what was expected for an Olive Garden but the food is just bad. Move on to somewhere else.  This place is consistently bad."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my mom. Everything was going good until my mother was done eating. I ordered soup and salad. The waitress took the salad away while I was still eating. Bowl half full of salad. Then we got the bill and my mother was charged the dinner portion. Explained she accidentally rang in the dinner portion. That was it, did not fix it in the system.  Thats not our fault you rang in a dinner portion. Im still kind of salty that she took the salad away while i was still eating. Felt very rushed (at 1130 am)"}
{"text":"Please stop calling Olive garden a restaurant. It implies the food is edible. It is just horrendous. It tastes like a heaping helping of Corporate. just stop...NOW. What the hell is wrong with people who find Olive garden good....get a clue...Oh wait same people who think red lobster is good...."}
{"text":"This place is super busy most nights & weekends. It's very loud and very cold.
I had to wear a jacket just to eat. 
I told the manager. They didn't help. U will usually wait up to 30 minutes to get seated. There is very limited seating inside the restaurant to wait.  So most likely u wait outside for a table. They dont take reservations. Not even for large groups or special occasions. The food is sub par. The prices for drinks are super high. Even for a coke or sprite. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"I usually like eating here, and maybe it was an off night, but really the only thing enjoyable was the dessert. Parking on a busy night sucks, luckily they have 5 acres of parking lot spaces to accommodate.

We opted for the 2 for $25. The salad was hardly a salad-white, whilty lettus, exactly 2 olives for two people, exactly 2 slices of tomatoes...I mean come on, the end of the world is tomorrow and i can't get just a couple more items to color my salad?

Although busy, the first round of breadsticks were barely warm, dry, and ends crunchy. The second round was better, fresh from the oven, but very salty. 

Got the eggplant parmesan. Too much cheese and marinara sauce on the eggplant, which made it very soggy. 

Ok, enough, what was good? The service was great, the spaghetti with the parmesan was great. The dessert...the tiramisu was excellent! As pricy as it is, it is well worth the $6 something if that's all you get there!"}
{"text":"Ask for the peach tea.  Very good.  $12.99 for a meal there and then another meal to take home.  Average pasta with no meat, but a really good value."}
{"text":"Haime was one of the best servers we've ever had! It was crazy busy tonight...I think a lot of people were celebrating Vday early, but even with the chaos she was on top of everything, we never had to look or ask for her, she boxed everything up...she even went to the bar (completely without our prompting) and found out what type of wine my fiancé was drinking because he couldn't remember what kind it was. She is a testament to this place...I wish every server was as good as she is! I will be calling the manager to compliment both her and the hostess Alyssa (very polite, friendly, quick, efficient--great face for the restaurant)! We will certainly be back because of these wonderful ladies!! AND the food was so fresh and absolutely delicious!! Thank you for a great evening, Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Bland, overpriced, and nothing special. The best part about my trip to this olive garden was discovering the italian-style interior architecture of the restaurant. I found the veneer quite entertaining, for the Italian walls were just like the Italian breadsticks, minestrone, and salad: superficially appealing. This place is like Madonna--it's all about the image, baby.

tl;dr: Italian Chilis"}
{"text":"The two stars are for the waitresses that served us. Both were very kind and wonderful. 

However, I got food poisoning after eating here on Monday, May 14, 2018. My mother and I dined here around 7:00 p.m.  My mother was fine, but I was extremely sick the next day. It must have been the mushroom raviolis I ate there (Ravioli de Portobella). Had to take off of work and spent the entire day sick to the point of vomiting up a bit of blood. 

 Be cautious people."}
{"text":"This is solely a review on the service at this location which was terrible. We were planning on seeing a movie after our dining experience and missed the beginning of our movie because of the lack of service. I literally had to walk over to the service bar and pick up my drink which I visibly saw had been sitting for over 15 minutes after it had been made because our server was nowhere to be found! The food was good as usual but had to wait ridiculously long for our server to process our bill and serve drinks, oh wait.. I had to get my own drinks. I recommend you visit the charleston location (4 stars) if you value service or simply don't appreciate being ignored. I live nearby this location but travel 3 times as far just to get good service."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is excellent, especially compared to the Cheyenne location. I had terrible service at Cheyenne location but enjoy the Olive Garden so we come here even though it's about 3 times as far. Either the servers are just better or management knows more about customer service because this Olive Garden is always great to us. Great server, hostess, and Management makes the longer drive well worth it."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for lunch, and not surprisingly, they were pretty busy. We were greeted and sat immediately. Our server came right over and offered us a drink, then appetizer. We had a couple of questions in which she was very happy to answer. Our food was a little late coming out, but our waitress and then the manager came and apologized for our wait. Very classy and professional! Everything looked and tasted great. We had ordered additional food to go, and that came out with perfect timing. On our way out, several employees thanked us and wished us a great rest of our day. Amazing job guys and gals! We will certainly be back and will tell our family and friends!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of those places you can't live without. I'm a huge fan of Italian food and this place is just an overall great \"chain\" business.  

For the quality and proportion of food, you can't beat the modest prices, gift cards offered, and great deals. Sure, I have moments where I might crave a Carrabas or Macaroni Grill but I feel that my money could be better spent supporting a local Italian joint with authentic food if I'm going that route.

I feel that Olive Garden is well balanced between quality and cost, but again, there is always that chain business component as well. Let me throw an analogy your way. Olive Garden is like Tex-Mex for Italian food, or better yet, like the Jersey Shore cast to Italians. 

Overall, I myself take advantage of those great deals and free gift cards. When I do, I always enjoy my meal. Especially at this location. Great food, great atmosphere, great service, & a great staff."}
{"text":"Went here with my family to stuff our fa---- er, that is, celebrate my Texan Grandma's 80th birthday. There was a short 20 minute wait in order to seat our group of 10. Service was excellent and even though the food wasn't blow-your-mind-amazeballs, it was homey, comfort food that everyone enjoyed eating. And! They had a couple of vegan options for me :). Which is more than I can say for that other pseudo-Italian chain that's inexplicably named after a US city (which isn't even known for their pizza?). Price was reasonable too. Appetizers, main course, drinks and desserts for 10 people, with the gratuity tacked on (I guess they do it for groups larger than 8, which is pretty standard for most places in the city) came out to roughly $35 per person. 

I went home fat, sassy, glad to be driving a roomy SUV and ready to tuck in for a long afternoon pasta coma."}
{"text":"The chick that's ALWAYS day bartender refuses to write anything down but NEVER gets an order right, even from cafe regulars who always get the same thing. She also never checks on you, even if she's just prepping bar (she's usually busy joking around with the manager, who also ignores her tables). Even when she messes up everything you asked for, she never tries to make up for it in any way - she doesn't seem to care. We stopped even telling her if something was wrong, her \"service\" was kind of a joke. We used to bet which things she'd mess up each time, but eventually you just want to get what you asked for. Now if we see her we just sit in the restaurant, but the older lady hostesses like to sit young couples in the middle of big groups with loud children, so it's impossible to have a pleasant lunch experience here if you can't just sit in the cafe with a better server. On a positive note, the expeditors and bussers who would bring out her orders for her were always very nice and much more concerned with the quality of our experience. I hope she tipped them out, but if she's as considerate of them as she is toward customers.... Noop."}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible. I will definitely drive to the Summerlin location and give them a try if I decided the need to eat at Olive Garden again."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick lunch with my husband.  We ordered soup and salad.  I have to say that this way the first time that I loved our server.  She was so attentive to what we needed and so friendly.  We ended up giving her a tip more than our bill."}
{"text":"It's exactly what you expect at Olive Garden. Food was salty goodness served at the right temp. There wasn't a wait even though it was noon on Saturday so that was cool. Service was a bit slow, they didn't give us any sort of plates to put breadsticks on. Silverware was dirty. Not really a good or a bad experience overall, just average, which is pretty normal for Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I have always loved Olive Garden and when I moved to the area, I was happy that there was one within a 30 minute drive of my apartment. The few times I have made my way out there have not been disappointing. I have always been greeted with a smile and have had some great service by the staff. Not only has the staff been good, the food hasn't disappointed me either. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Yes, we go to Olive Garden!  But only with a coupon. :)
For a chain, we always have a consistent experience here. 
The food is always hot and fresh,  the taste of the dishes are good, and the service is exactly in line with the corporate training.   What that means is if you like the place, you will almost always be pleased when you go back.  If you don't like it, well then don't bother coming back.  
Also for some reason this place is always crowded at certain times.  Whenever there is a long line, we just don't eat here.  It's not that worth it.  But if we're in the mood for a good generic Italian type meal along with some salad and bread sticks, we go here."}
{"text":"Since my last review I've been back a couple times with no complaints. Fast and friendly service and delicious entrees and can't forget the unlimited salad and breadsticks with the meal. 5 stars"}
{"text":"I said I wouldnt be back, I lied. Decided to take advantage of the never ending pasta bowl special they have right now. They only have it twice a year. So here's how it work. You choose your pasta (fettuccine, penne, linguine, angel hair, corkscrew) then pick a sauce (Alfredo, marinara, meat, five cheese) and any add-ins (meatballs, sausage, chicken, shrimp) for an additional cost. The first plate is regular entree size. If you finish that and want more, you can order the same as your first order or mix it up and order something different. FYI the second and any additional servings are smaller and served in a bowl. Also included with the meal is unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks. If you don't leave full, that's your problem. =) 

I ordered the angel hair alfredo with sausage and salad. Bf got the spaghetti marinara with meatballs and soup. The food was good. I tried one of his meatballs and I definitely prefer the sausage, but that's just me. BTW it's $2.99 for sausage or meatballs, but you get 2 each serving so it's a good deal. I ordered pumpkin cheesecake to go, and it was just ok. I wouldn't order it again and for the price of almost $8, not worth it. Our server, Juan, was excellent. He brought the food out in a timely manner, checked up on us often, and was really nice. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever look at the first pic this is there lemon drop Martini the second pic is the correct way to do a lemon drop Martini . If u can't make a lemon drop  Martini just tell me Dam !i hate going places and no one can get the Martini right"}
{"text":"Everyone who worked there seemed very welcoming even though they were very busy. It was a little crowed but that's a good sign. Anyway, my waitress was Toni and she was very warm and sweet. The food was delicious but very expensive. I love the Italian scenery."}
{"text":"Good service, good food!  Ordered the new pork scallopini with asiago-filled tortollini and portobello mushrooms.  Very delicious and lots of food.  Server Joshua was attentive but not intrusive.  Salad and breadsticks were great as usual.  I give it a 4 instead of 5 because they still don't have enough room for folks to sit and wait - and there is always a wait. This estaurant serves many retired folks as well as young families. They need to rearrange so there are more options than standing during the wait.  (the few chairs they have are always full)."}
{"text":"Our experience at this Olive Garden restraunt would have been ordinary and forgettable. Our server Ruthanne changed all of that. 
First our soup was slow to come out. Unlike other servers Ruthanne apoligized and followed up. As the evening progressed she was very friendly and attentive. She made an unremarkable visit a positive and memorable one."}
{"text":"Great food not great service. Came in a few weeks ago with my family for a birthday dinner. Waiter forgot to order one of our appetizers so the manager had to step in. Didn't get our salad and bread until 3 min before our main meals so getting them was pointless. My 14 year old cousin was given a child's size drink. Our appetizer that was forgotten got to us after everything so it wasn't worth ordering. If it wasn't for the kindness of the female manager and the well made food my rating would be way lower."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate my sons bday.  Order some appetizers 1st trough the self pad. we waited for the waitress to take the order came back with my family meals. Except appetizer and my dinner. Everyone eat.  Never come with my food. Plus he never apologize.  Super bad experience.  Don't come to the Cheyenne location."}
{"text":"My Mother's Day visit at the Norterra location was so pleasant, that I came to Arrowhead for more good eats! I was first surprised at how gorgeous the entrance view is, definitely more spacious and more luxurious looking than Norterra, we sat at the bar to admire out surroundings. It's easy to expect the service to be as luxurious, but Norterra definitely has this location beat. Our waitress Priscilla was super sweet and relatable, I just wish she had been more attentive on my tea refill (although I was hounding each cup down excessively) and just a little more attentive with check ins. It's really not a big deal at all, but it is something to note in comparison to the constant service I received the very night before at the Norterra location. The 3-5pm deal for lunch is great, we also took home two $5 pasta plates for dinner, AND we got Zippolis for dessert (just like the night before lol) and they were fabulous (LIKE THE NIGHT BEFORE). I appreciated the waiter at Norterra bringing us both raspberry dipping sauce and chocolate dipping sauce, I selfishly expected it at Arrowhead... maybe our waiter at Norterra was being muy extra. Whatever the reason, being extra can be highly appreciated. Especially when it comes to extra dipping sauce! Tea refills and being \"extra\" with service really aren't big complaints of mine, they are only things to note in comparison to the service I had received the evening prior. Anyhow, we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Came in for Mother's Day around 3:30, was busy enough to get a buzzer but was seated quickly. I was awaiting my party for 20 minutes past being seated, and the service I received during my time sitting alone was much appreciated. I think my waiter refilled my peach tea about 4 times before my family arrived. I desired refills and never had to ask for them, he was on top of it our entire meal. Gosh I wish I remembered his name! Anyways, I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was so perfect for me. Very light, flavor-able and hearty, didn't overfill me. Finished off with those sugar sprinkled doughnuts and a slice of Lemon cake for mum for dessert and my sister and I devoured those puppies. He even gave us both chocolate/raspberry dipping sauce AND extra raspberry dipping sauce, as he recommended it tasting great with the lemon cake. I don't particularly seek an experience this exceptional, he didn't do anything exceptional for us really. He proved he has great hospitality, and that alone makes for an exceptional experience."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, Veronica was an excellent caretaker of our table. Salad is always fresh and good."}
{"text":"Standard Olive Garden. Good place for kids. 
They now have tablets that are available for nominal fee. I think $2. 
I have one picture of some of the apps on the Tablet.
Food is like every Olive Garden, very good salad and bread sticks.
Can find lower calorie and lower carb options if you try hard enough.

Definitely can get crowded the later it gets
We normally eat early before 6pm so it is ok but once it turns 6pm it is pretty crowded and prepare to wait (like at most Olive Gardens)"}
{"text":"It finally opened and the waits are crazy!!!

So we went last night, friends got there 1st, placed the name on the list, got the pager and off to Toys/Babies R Us for a little shopping (they needed Diapers).  So we come back, waiting outside after the short rain and just when you thought we had more time, off goes our pager...  Plowed thru the very crowded waiting lobby and to our table.  

They were very busy, but the patrons seemed pleased, not unhappy faced seen.  Our server/service was a little slow, but considering how busy and new the place is, wasn't too bad.  Food was a tasty as we expect.  When the snowbirds go home (think Pebble Creek) the waits will shorten for sure!

We will certainly be back (love those breadsticks!!)"}
{"text":"My roommate, little sister and I arrived at the Olive Garden, 1261 W Southern Ave, Mesa, AZ 85202 location, on 4/10 at 7:35pm and were seated around 7:40pm. As we sat for 15min waiting for our waiter to even acknowledge us, we heard the long table in the middle of the room with maybe 4 adults and 4-5 children start to complain about how long they had been waiting. There were scattered drinks and breadsticks along the table to they had SOME service already. As they sat there we heard their complaints get louder and louder accompanied by a few slammed fists on the table. When the waiter arrived with their soup and salad, one of the women at the table said they didn't even want it anymore because they had ordered 20min ago and they were \"over it\". They then demanded to speak to a manager. Less than 60 seconds later, a blonde manager comes to the table to address the situation. She is then pulled aside by a different lady sitting at the table wearing a very fitting pink \"Birthday Diva\" sash. The manager and the Birthday Diva talked tucked in a corner for around 10-15 min (mind you, at this point we have only just put in our appetizer and drink order and it had yet to come). When the manager and Birthday Diva arrived back at the table, the manager declared how bad she felt about the whole situation and that she would be comping the entire table's meal. At this time the table continued to complain about anything and everything they could think of as a swarm of waiters came to clear the dirty plates and dishes from their table to make them \"more comfortable\". As this is happening, we hear the guests at the table continue to add things to the bill, have the food that was finally brought out boxed up to go, AND ON TOP OF THAT the staff came out and sang happy birthday! I felt terrible for the waiters and the expressions on their faces made it obvious they were feeling sorry for themselves as well. It's about 8PM now and we have barely been served our appetizer with drinks following another 10min after and our salad/soup/breadsticks and dipping sauce an additional 10 min after that. During the next 15min before our food comes out, we see the middle table ordering around their crew of staff like puppet masters, getting even MORE stuff added and comped off the bill, and interrupting another birthday song sang at a table adjacent from them (who had been waiting EVEN LONGER with no complaints). The drama with the Birthday Diva completely consumed the room and every other table was exchanging looks with each other like \"is this really happening\" as we all sat with empty glasses with melted ice and puddles of condensation  watching the middle table get completely catered to all while being embarrassingly rude. The final straw for me, and the reason I took the time out of my day to write this, was when the blonde manager came out and handed a gift card to every single person at that table. I understand if I was one of the people at the table how happy and compensated I would feel at that point, but as a fellow guest sharing the same space having my service delayed, interrupted, inconsistent and neglected BECAUSE of them, made us feel like chopped liver! We could not believe what was happening and just wanted to get our to-go boxes and leave. We weren't expecting our meals to be comped, but the manager never even approached our table to apologize for the evening's events or anything. The waiter tried to pretend it wasn't happening, but he was extremely stressed and frazzled the entire time because he was the original waiter for the middle table, which resulted in him being short with us and unintentionally rude. Some acknowledgement of our extreme patience is all we wanted. I could tell blonde manager was super sweet and genuinely felt bad (whatever sob story the Birthday Diva told her must have been a tear jerker) because she was bending over backwards to make the guests happy. However, in result of how it was handled everything that the middle table was complaining about ended up happening to us and EVERY OTHER TABLE IN THE ZONE. In conclusion we paid our $90 bill, but the events of that night remained with us throughout the entirety of our evening even after leaving the restaurant because we could not believe how things went down. 
In conclusion, I'm not writing this with attached demands in order to keep me returning to the establishment- that's not how I roll. I wanted to let it be known that the staff last night had a text book simulation on what to do when one table wants to control the whole place, and they failed miserably. We left feeling like we should have taken our money elsewhere, and knowing that's the last thing you want your guests to experience, I wanted to let you know why. You can contact me with any additional questions, but for now it's safe to say we will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I saw Brian F.'s review and decided to step in and stick up for a restaurant that has really blown me away the past couple visits. 
I've been at busy lunch/dinner times and have not had to wait more than 15 minutes either times. The service was AMAZING. Emika was our waitress during lunch ( 1 week ago) and Cindy was our waitress for the duration of our dinner experience (two days ago). Both were knowledgeable, friendly, and really went over and beyond. 
Always replenished our breadsticks and refilled our drinks without us even asking. 

During our last visit for dinner we got the 2 for $25 deal. Not one complaint. Before ordering from the menu I made sure to ask about the portion size and was reassured that they were the same as the regular dinner portions. ((( BUT, if you opt to get the appetizers instead of unlimited breadsticks and salad they would be smaller....we decied to go for the unlimited.) No disappointments with portions ( I got the Fett. Alfredo... classic...amazing...can't go wrong) It was so much that I had my leftovers for lunch the next day. My boyfriend also had to take the rest of his spaghetti home too. 
The food was awesome and the service was even better. WILL BE BACK. 

*** before leaving (both times) we asked for extra breadsticks so we could take them home to have with our leftovers...and there was no faces...no if ands or buts...both waitresses said no problem and brought us 4 to take home. 

I highly recommend the \"strata\". it's a chocolate cake that is to die for."}
{"text":"Yummy food and good service... sat in the bar area and got thebar tender as a server and he,was nice   his name was beto ..great job... good food"}
{"text":"The only reason that I am giving this restaurant 2 stars is for the gentleman (Rome) that delivered our food! What a pleasant smile after being treated so oddly. He was very kind and went above and beyond to help make the rest of our stay a pleasure. 
We arrived here after driving 4 hours and was asked by the hostess if we would mind sitting in the bar area, she informed us that it was the same menu, same \"everything,\" she stated. We didn't care where we sat, we just wanted food. After a few minutes we were approached by a gentleman (our waiter) and asked if we'd like anything to drink, we all said water please. He seemed annoyed by this as we were in the \"bar\" area, mind you, we didn't ask to sit there! We then ordered and he later came with our salad with HOT PLATES, yes HOT PLATES, who the hell serves salad on a HOT PLATE, AND no breadsticks, ok, no biggie, maybe he will go back and grab them. Nope, our dinner came and still NO breadsticks! This is when we asked Rome for some bread and he said he would go get some. Our waiter came back and finally gave an explanation as to why we didn't get them to begin with, they were out! He could have told us that sooner. 
Food was mediocre (I had to ask for more alfredo because my pasta was so dry), entire restaurant was freezing and the atmosphere was just plain awkward. 
I've eaten at many olive gardens (as it's my daughters favorite place), but I can tell you that I won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"Went in Monday to use a gift card around 4:30 pm plenty of staff standing around yet on a 20 min wait. Finally when we are called we walk back to the area they were seating people which on the way to the back left corner dining area we passed two completely empty dinning areas.  The odor within the location smells like either their carpet has gotten very wet or someone urinated on it, it was very noticeable and i am surprised they have not addressed that issue.  The food is very small portions for the price and the bread sticks surely were not fresh as they where stale tasting and hard on the ends. This is my third visit to this location and the quality and quantity is certainly not worth a fourth."}
{"text":"Slow service asked for ranch 4 times and didn't get it at all the server was slow and had to wait over 50min for my food. I asked for my bread and salad before the food comes they didn't Bring bread at all and the salad came out with the pasta horrible place to eat at good luck eating at this place .. if I could give 0 stars I would !!!"}
{"text":"12/26/16 Not a huge fan of olive garden but we had a gift card so we decided to make a nice date night out of it. The place was pretty packed but we waiting no longer than 25 minutes and once we were seated the service was very nice. Our waiter was sure to let us know that the kitchen was a little backed up so we wouldn't wonder where our apps were.. but honestly it only took about 10 minutes for the apps to come out and everything else came out very fast too and fresh, i know it was not sitting in the window for 10 minutes .. from drinks to dessert, our experience was probably the best olive garden experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"Four stars for the two appetizers (calamari and spicy shrimp)' both were very enjoyable.  The salad was also very good.  
One star for the main entrees.  Both mine and the wife's were awful.  I had the tilapia with asparagus.  The asparagus was way over cooked the the fish was very dry.  Wife had a pasta dish and was very disappointed. The kids meals were okay.
Atmosphere wasn't very appealing since areas were dirty in the waiting area and the dining area near the fireplace.  Wait staff was very inconsistent, our waiter was very neglectful, while the waitress at the table next to us seemed very attentive to her tables and we had to ask her for refills on bread, salad and drinks while our waiter was MIA.
Bottom line, go somewhere else while in the Concord Mills area."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is plain ol' Olive Garden. It's definitely not on the level of fancier restaurants like Maggiano's or Brio, but it does make you really full especially if you're craving some soup and pasta.

I usually order the Chicken and Shrimp Carbonara with chicken gnocchi soup. The breadsticks usually come out hot and fresh and my friends tend to order alfredo sauce that compliments the bread sticks very well.

Some of OG's more popular items seem to be: zuppa toscana, children alfredo and the tour of Italy (lasagna, chicken parmigiana, and alfredo).

Honestly, I wouldn't mind coming to OG twice a month if it means I get to have the creamy chicken and shrimp carbonara.

Service is hit or miss, but most times it's done well."}
{"text":"My waiter was really well-mannered and I forgot to ask his name, but he has shoulder-length dark brown hair. However I had to wait for the entree for a looooooong time which kind of annoys me. The drink was extremely sweet for my taste, I only took a few sips and that's it, it gets to the point that it's starting to absorb the moisture in my mouth. Despite this the breadsticks were delicious, and it was nice that you get to have those for free."}
{"text":"Yes, folks, during my short stay in Phoenix, I somehow convinced Gabi K to come to Olive Garden for \"endless soup, salad and breadsticks.\"  

It's been a while since I've been, and they seem to have added a few soups to their menu, one, the chicken gnocchi. Very rich and probably fattening, but still recommended. So it was two soup, salad and breadstick combos ($6.95 each) and steaming hot mussels di Napoli ($9.25). Totaling out to $24.99 for lunch for two. And this location has a great staff, particularly our server Tony. Right on top of the water and salad refills. Gratzi, Anotonio!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden kind of speaks for itself. It's a chain that offers inauthentic \"Italian\" cuisine. And while this sounds harsh, these restaurants are usually nothing to write home about. Having said that, I will happily admit that all self control goes out the window when a basket of breadsticks and salad is set in front of me. Really, I cannot help myself! The pasta here is mediocre at best but something about the start of your meal makes it all worth while. Typically the service here is good and nothing tops of a faux Italian meal like one of their peach iced teas. It is always worthwhile to have dinner here when they are having their never-ending pasta bowl special. Go big or go home, am I right? :)"}
{"text":"Holy hell, this was quite possible the worst family dining experience I've had. It may be another 15 years before i eat at an Olive Garden again. Our server was a nice individual but was clearly in over her head. Maybe it was her first day on the job - if not, her trainer failed her. It took forever to get our food, the drink orders were messed up, water was never refilled, and the \"endless breadsticks\" ... we needed to ask for seconds... and they took forever to get to us - after we finished our \"meal\". This location is situated near other restaurants. Do your self a favor and choose another establishment. After reading the other Yelp reviews, and the overall poor service, it seems that management at this particular location needs to be upgraded."}
{"text":"I know better than to expect too much from restaurants that cook a constant menu across the country. Salad and breadsticks.....what can I say, it's really the reason I'll go to the Olive Garden. As for the menu, it's pretty much status quo from a couple of years ago with exception to a couple new entrées. The food is decent and as for the price.....it's gone up over the last couple of years and portions have gone down. Not suprised. What I can't understand is the line up. It seems no matter what time of week you go, if it's after 5 pm you will be waiting for a seat. There are better restaurants to go and wait for a seat.....all that said it was all okay, just okay, nothing to write home to mom about. 
What I will say is that if you are looking for a good meal for you and your partner, this is not the place. It was noisy, what you would expect from a family restaurant and it was extremely dirty, as in food all over the floor. This eatery had no ambiance, I found eating at home more relaxing. You can tell that this place is all about get you in.....get you out.....with a smile. 

Remember, if you can't pronounce what the food is called.....it's probably very good!

Cheers."}
{"text":"OGs has always been a favorite of mine and it remains so. Tried out the limited 3-course dinner special with Dad. Great value for the price and as always the food didn't disappoint. Both of us branched away from our usual type of selection; Dad going with the Tuscan Grilled Chicken (grilled chicken in a sweet red wine demi glace) and me with the Bucatini pasta with meat sauce. I rarely do red sauces. The meat sauce was good; not too acidic for a red and the blend of ground beef and italian sausage pleasing and flavorful. I'm thinking, even a repeat for me. Tasted Dad's chicken and liked the glaze on it. Moist, nice char marks...good chicken. Another satisfying meal in the books."}
{"text":"I had dinner there last night with a friend. I had the Garlic Rosemary Chicken and my friend had the Chicken Scampi. My chicken was very over cooked to the point of being very dry and tough but still edible. My friend said that his chicken was burned. I was also unaware that there was bread on the table. The bread was  hidden behind a wine list or some other written material that was sitting vertically on the table."}
{"text":"go here and ask for Chelsea she's the best waitress ever and so cute. highly recommend 10/10. go chelsea. also sorry for laughing"}
{"text":"Big shout out to my server, Katie, she made me smile and laugh on an evening that I was exhausted and just wanting some good Italian comfort food!"}
{"text":"This is by FAR. The absolute worst OG EVER!!! I called in a to-go Oder at 6:40 I was told to be here at 7:05, got here 10 minutes after that! It is now 7:30 and I'm waiting on a sauce I ordered when I originally called. The manager didn't greet me or say anything when I walked in. Stood there for about 5 minutes in the front before I was asked if I had been helped. I will drive all the way to goodyear because this location is ridiculous. I've been here before with a friend and the service sucked that time as well...."}
{"text":"I came for lunch at 11 when they opened and was told my party of 2 had to wait 10 to 15 min because the didn't have enough wait staff. There was only 2 party's ahed of us, not sure why we had to wait but it was kind of ridiculous. And the hostess was kinda rude about telling us to wait. Our waitress was wonderfull kinda helped to make up for the first empressions. Over all it made us feel vary unwelcome. Not sure if I will be returning!"}
{"text":"It has been years since I've been to an Olive Garden and I must say that it was a great experience!! the service was world class and food was even better!! great beer too!! although I wish they had more draft beer choices. all and all a great family dinner!!!"}
{"text":"It's not amazing or new, but it's always good. Knowing that this is a chain restaurant we expect that. The servers are kind, respectful, and prompt with drinks. The food quality is consistently good and I have even had the pleasure of meeting one of the chefs; very nice guy. Altogether, it's the perfect place to grab a quick lunch with an old friend or take the whole family for dinner with no complaints and no breaking the bank.

 The only thing I would change is the one thing that has; the tablet on the table used to order or pay your bill. I like having a server, I like paying extra for good service from people not machines. Please get rid of that distracting, unnecessary thing on the table. Dinner should be a time when we ignore those kinds of items and instead enjoy the people with whom we are eating."}
{"text":"I went here on Father's day with my family and we had a great time. There was very little wait time even though it was a lot of people there. Our waitress Taylor was the best and made sure we had everything we needed. My chicken was a little under cooked but still good. We were even offered a free sample of wine. I highly recommend this location as I will be returning often."}
{"text":"I received an email advertising their new endless pasta dishes for $11.99.   We went and I specifically asked the manager was it indeed $11.99 for all their dishes.  He said yes and then the we ordered different dishes and were then told by the waiter, that the prices were different for each dish and we could only request any subsequent dishes on only what we had originally ordered.  So you don't just pay $11.99 like the email advertising suggests and you're stuck with what you ordered.  The spaghetti is $11.99 and it jumps up significantly for any other dishes.  Not cool at all.  When we put in another order it took forever to get.  Oh by the way, it was lunchtime during the week and not busy at all.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Friend got a chicken Marsala and it tasted like TERIYAKI!!!  What a rip off. You're gonna make someone pay 18.99 that taste like Teriyaki! UNBELIEVABLE"}
{"text":"We had a 20 minute wait which we didn't mind . We were taken to the very back of this restaurant right by the back doors. Table was not even set up for diners. There were open booths and tables all through the restaurant. We clearly were not the target demographic that this restaurant caters to. I'm ashamed of this type of behavior and will never patronize this restaurant as long as I live."}
{"text":"On 01/02 - I took my 6 yr old grandson on his birthday to have a celebratory lunch.  I specifically inform the waitress there just that. First, after receiving our order [I had soup and salad and he had a pepperoni pizza], we never saw the waitress again until we were done - so to speak.  I say that because the pizza was so undercooked, he could not eat it.  So he had my soup.  The waitress finally came back and asked if we wanted the pizza boxed up.  I informed her the pizza was undercooked and to let the cook know.  No apologies, no nothing from her.  She then asked if the birthday boy would like a birthday dessert.  Of course, what little boy wouldn't?  So she brings over a menu for him to choose his dessert.  In the meantime, I noted on the table if you bought a $50 gift card, you would get a free $10 bonus card.  I informed my waitress that I wanted a $50 gift card.  After they brought my grandson his candle-lit dessert and sang happy birthday to him, I received my gift card, but not the bonus.  After inquiring about it, they stated that promotion was no longer running, even though the promotion advertisement was still on the table, and it did not state a date to when the promotion ended.  After speaking with the manager, he \"graciously\" gave me a $10 gift card.  I say graciously, because he certainly had an attitude about it.  But the kick to all of this, not only was I charged for an uncooked pizza my 6 year old grandchild could not eat, I was charged for his birthday dessert?  Who does that?  Who charges a birthday dessert for a 6 year old child?

Needless to say, we will never go back to that location."}
{"text":"No time management for the servers. Regardless if you're busy or not you should at least communicate the inconvenience to the customers in a timely manner. Not very fond of this location."}
{"text":"The only reason this place got one star is because I had to give it one. My husband and I took our three kids out for what we wanted to be a easy dinner on a Monday night. We got there early so we were immediately seated which was great! That's where the good things ended. We waited for our drinks for 20 minutes then ordered our food. Almost a hour later we got our food. By that time our children had gotten full on breadsticks. I then waited for a cup of coffee for another 20 minutes. The only reason I did not talk to a manager about our experience is because I could not get out of there fast enough! If you want a nice meal whatever you do avoid this place!"}
{"text":"We picked up food for dinner large salad. And garlic bread.chicken parmesan  was over cooked . The red sauce was sweet. But needed more seasoning . Meatball was .overcooked. Everything was very average.  The deserts were excellent ."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was the best part , always appreciate a good server being a server myself , thank you Jericka"}
{"text":"Better than others!
Inside just has a different feeling and setup, kind of feels like a foreign house? Its split into small eating areas giving it a cozy ambiance. Might feel cramped to some but I'm skinny and had no problem moving around.
Good prices and slightly larger feeling portions, I'm a pig but left STUFFED.
Service was alright but the waiter seemed to be faking an accent -_- but I did not mind leaving a nice tip for such a nice evening.
 In fact, that's how i would describe this OG, nice. Others feel like low end restaurants trying too hard or lacking, this one does it right, even the outside looks better than others! But still an Olive Garden in the end..."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this Olive Garden and go here for family dinners and lunches usually! I love they have gluten free pasta now! I would like this location to be a bit more clear on their coupon policies and if the coupon is confusing to the guests, the staff should still honor it."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an olive garden in more than 10 years so when a group of friends decided to go for lunch (lunch before the wedding day) I was kind of excited about the salad, soup and breadsticks.

I'm not sure what experience the negative reviewers had but ours was awesome. Our servers were extremely attentive and friendly. And the food was pretty good.

I LOVE the Zuppa Toscano. OMG .. that was lovely."}
{"text":"Everybody loves Carb garden unless your on a diet because it's so hard to come here and not fall victim of there breadsticks and pasta . Came here for there early dinner specials they had going on which were really good deals for what we got. This particular location is very nice and it was slow when we came so we were attended and seated quickly. The special we went for we found online but when we were handed the menus it was kinda hard to find and when we did find it, it wasn't very specific so I just based it off my knowledge from what I remembered looking at online. Our waiter was friendly, he offered a kid drink from another tables mess up drink(made two on accident),to our table which I thought was nice of him. Everything tasted like I remember from previous Olive Garden experiences so nothing has changed. I do recommend this place if your craving pasta you can never go wrong coming here but I would recommend on catching there specials because sometimes they have really good ones."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and our server was great! (African American gentleman from Atlanta working the closing shift on Sunday the 26th.) He was so friendly, polite and always on top of it offering more soup, bread, etc. This was by far the best service we've ever experienced at this OG. I wish I knew his name. This guy could easily be a server in a very high end restaurant. My chicken parm was pretty salty but the hubby enjoyed his chicken and shrimp carbonara. All I really needed was salad, breadsticks and wine anyway. :)"}
{"text":"Average food, sub par service, on more than one occasion our server forgot an item and stated,  \"Im sorry, I have to go back to the kitchen for that, give me a moment.\"  And the second time he forgot what we requested.  Coffee with creamer, and the creamer arrives 7 min later.  The salad and breadsticks were the only reason this review got 3 over 2 stars.  Go elsewhere, I DO NOT recommed."}
{"text":"Was just at the Olive Garden in Robinson for lunch.   Had their Tuscan Chicken w Rice !!!  It was very good and our Server was very nice. !!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. I was pleased with the pasta and sauce. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that the bread sticks lacked seasoning. Overall it was a good experience and I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"All I really have to say is wow, the staff here really know what they're doing. In an age when customer service has started to die out they still do things the way it should be. Customer always comes first and the customer is always right. Not that I had an experience where they had to say I was right in something but I get the feeling that they are that kind of place. If you're ever in the area you should stop by."}
{"text":"Service was ok except our server talks too much. Food was as usual a little disappointing. Alfredo sauce was more greasy than creamy. I think I will stay away from here."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was so-so. My dinner barely had any pasta on the plate , Luke warm and really greasy. Looks like Carrabba's will be our choice next time. Too bad, I used to really like Olive garden"}
{"text":"We come to this location every time we come to  Vegas which is often.   they have the best food and customer service of any Olive  garden.   try to get in Darrell\"s section for fast and friendly service.   he's the best waiter."}
{"text":"So I'll start off with the negative...the service was not that great. The waiter took forever to come to our table for drinks and breadsticks. So don't go when you're hungry because it's a wait. Other than that I loved the food! Their breadsticks are always warm and fresh. I also had their gnocchi soup which never fails to please me. I created my own pasta. I was very pleased they had whole grain pasta on the menu. So I had whole grain pasta and their parmesan pesto sauce with 2 Italian sausage links. It was a nice meal but as I said before it would have been nice if the server was around more."}
{"text":"Went here today with grandkids for lunch. Good food fast and we had a wonderful server."}
{"text":"Just had my moms birthday lunch!  We love it here!  Kristin is our favorite waitress which gives it a 4 star!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah... Olive Garden. You know pretty much what to expect. Chain restaurant food, pleasant service, reasonable-ish prices. That's what we got. One surprising thing was the number of \"specials\" they have. I swear, the menu inserts have inserts here!  We arrived in time to get some of the \"happy hour\" appetizers and drinks, so for $32 bucks for 5 appetizers and 2 drinks, I really can't complain about it. The breadsticks weren't as good as I remember, but other than that, everything was fine. The server was very nice and attentive as well. So, while I'm in no rush to return, I won't knock it, either!"}
{"text":"SPOILER ALERT!  IF YOU GET THE NEVER-ENDING PASTA BOWL AND ADD THE 'UNLIMITED' MEAT - BE PREPARED ON YOUR SECOND SERVING FOR A ONE MEATBALL LIMIT.  Second spoiler - it's unlimited soup or salad - not both.  Our waitress made sure we knew the TV ad was wrong.  The real entertainment came when our waitress went MIA for a good 15 plus minutes to cater to a large group, and another waitress there felt bad for us and took our order....  when our waitress found out, her face and attitude changed toward us and the other waitress... became like territory wars, and was made to feel like I made the mistake of not waiting for her to come back....  Then got to hear the run down about a group who divied their bill six ways as an explanation...  Service was okay other than that.

The pasta was watery, and you REALLY have to ask for sauce...  

This place did the reverse of what you would ever hope of a chain restaurant... food got worse and the price went up.   I agree with the review further down - they are lucky they have the marketing they do to generate business for such a washed up version of what used to be.  

Sorry, Olive Garden, but you lost me."}
{"text":"Ironically...this is a very small Olive Garden..so families that have a party of 8, take heed..there's no room for fat uncle Joe. The service is okay, no automatic water refills (we had to ask twice) and we had to wait for our breadsticks for over half an hour. It was a Wednesday night at half capacity.  The food was hot and fresh as a franchised Olive Garden can get but I would t go back here unless I was with my picky eating friends. Sorry."}
{"text":"I will never go back thanks to Lourdes. I was invited to dinner here last night, but refused. Lourdes is disrespectful & lazy. When she gets fired, I might consider coming back. I just can't believe Olive Garden hires people like her. She needs a new job since she hates this job so much."}
{"text":"So my husband and I have dinner here at least 3 times a month. But yesterday July 15 we didn't get the that great service that we are use to. And to top it off when we got the check it was just the receipt by itself, so I was very uncomfortable using my credit card since I didn't have a anything to put it in. So thankful I had enough cash."}
{"text":"I am going to start this review by saying I'm a little bias due to the fact that I went to Olive Garden (different location) for a recent Yelp event and had an amazing time!  The food was flat out delicious and the service was impeccable.  
With this is mind, I just had to go back right?  I've now been to Olive Garden THREE times in the past seven days! Suddenly, as my fingers are pecking the keys, I'm starting to realize how sad/compulsive that sounds....but I digress...

...In case you didn't know, on Mondays Olive Garden does this buy-one, take-one-home dinner special.  They offer a variety of pasta entrees to choose from initially, then you get to take a second pasta entree (of lesser value) home, plus unlimited salad and breadsticks!  I mean, I don't know about you, but that's one hell of a deal!  Had a chance to go there tonight actually, ordered the citrus chicken as the initial entree and got the spaghetti with meat sauce to go!  Oh, and if that wasn't enough, you also get a free Redbox rental when you check in on yelp once you're there.  

The service?  You know it was great.  You don't even have to ask.  Attentive -  feels like the appropriate adjective to describe the service.    

Want to spice up you Monday dinner routine? Allow me to suggest the re-branded Olive Garden...

...see ya next Monday!"}
{"text":"Mixed results.  New waiter.  Did OK.  

Tried sausage stuffed rigatoni, gross.  Could not finish it.  Pasta undercooked. Very little sausage, lots of bread crumb stuffing.  Returned and swapped for classico lasagna.  Manager made good on swap.

Loved chicken dumplin soup!  Even took order home for lunch next day.

We'll see next time."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this olive garden and can I just say wow the servers are amazing. There is a new guy here who has only been here 6 days it is his first serving job and he is honestly the nest server I ever had"}
{"text":"I was here last week for a friends birthday and now today for lunch time....came for the unlimited soup and salad both times. Today we sat at the bar for faster service. Each visit they will offer you a sample of their wine to try. Never really had a bad experience here. Great service from Hinemoa."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an insult to consumers. I reluctantly went with friends who seem to think it's high-class dining and authentic. It's crap. The salad that was served was nothing special. Big chunks of lettuce stems. Then came the Chicken Cheese Piadini. Obviously came out of a box and was somehow \"cooked\" in the kitchen. It was dreadful. Tasted of chemicals, bad flavorings. Where was the taste of freshly grilled chicken? The cheese was some processed stuff. And it was greasy. Then came the worst: the Apple Crostini. Ah, the server said it was an excellent choice. No, it was truly horrible. Like it came out of a cellophane wrapper at Circle-K, was heated in a microwave. Then something that was supposed to be ice cream was dumped on top. It looked NOTHING like the picture in the menu, but the menu might have had more taste. It reeked of trans fats and sugar. Where were the apples? This was worse than disappointing - it's a flagrant ripoff. My companion's dessert also was obviously commercially made and unwrapped in this place. Disgusting. I will NEVER spend another dime at this so-called restaurant. The Red Lobster next door closed down, same company. Lousy food, high prices."}
{"text":"Food...amazing. 
Wine sample....amazing and this is the first time we didn't buy a bottle and there's only one reason why....
Since when did Olive Garden start charging for dipping sauce for the bread sticks????
I mean really?
You haven't always done this, when offered, do u want dipping sauce, some Alfredo or marinara for your bread sticks 
When I said yes, I didn't know it was going to cost $8
Sneaky sneak. Won't be going back for a long time. Not because I can't afford it. Just because it's  sleezy. Like mcdonalds charging for ranch
At least they notify people first
Should bring a whole bowl of sauce for almost $4/piece. If we are paying $40-$70  for dinner, why charge for sauce to dip bread in...the same sauce that will be served on top of our pasta. Wow Olive Garden really!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Wednesday night around 7:20.  Was told the wait would be 35-40 minutes. After 45 minutes we checked to see where we were at on the list and was rudely told \"It's only been 42 minutes and we said it would be 50 minutes.\"  That wad flat out wrong.  I get that it was busy (ish) but the managers response was in my opinion rude.  Also a quick walk thru the place showed 5 empty tables cleared and ready. Probably due to understaffing which points back at management as 4 people stood at the front desk as hostesses (including the manager).  Our server Joy was absolutely great and the meal was good.  Had the manager been more professional in his hostility response I would have been more than please with our experience."}
{"text":"well it's Olive Garden... nuf said! 

Who doesn't love olive garden??? I think maybe once or twice in my life have I bothered to get an entrée. I prefer just getting a drink and chowing down on salad and bread sticks. 

I was so happy when this location opened up. It meant we didn't have to trek all the way to greentree. 

Now i'm back in Spain... I could really use an Olive Garden here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with some friends from out of town for food. To be quite honest this was the best experience at an Olive Garden I think I've ever had. We were sat in Noah's station and the service could not have been better. What a great guy, we were definitely treated like family. He recommended the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert and it was amazing. What a great dinner and great talking to Noah. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Hahaha !!! do remember when Olive Garden used to be good lol wow that was a long time ago. 
This particular location is the worst one I've been to. They can remodel it and try to fancy it up all they want but the food is still crap. Everything is so Bland and cheaply put together the soup is watered down and the sauces have way too much oil in them and cannot be reheated. They're trying to keep up with other Italian establishments on price and decor but what they really oughta be working on is their food. But if you don't mind overpaying for what you get and are without taste buds then this is a spot for you."}
{"text":"If you enjoy screaming children make sure to ask for a spot near the fireplace where they set up the family style seating."}
{"text":"I've actually been to this location a couple times now. My most recent was for lunch with hubby, I ordered the half size meatball sandwich it had yummy sauce, melty cheese,  and crunchy yet soft bread. It's served with garlic fries and of course choice of soup or salad, I had the minestrone soup. I definitely enjoy the pasta with tomato broth.  Hubby ordered the chicken parmesean also with garlic fries. I did have a bite of his chicken was moist and crunchy, melted provolone, marinara sauce,  the same fresh good bread as my meatball sandwich. We shared the appetizer fried lasagna,  always a good choice.
The salad I always enjoy,  to me the olives and peppercinis perfect the salad.

Something funny - for the name being Olive Garden,  the salad is the only item I seen on the menu that actually contains olives!!!  Having an olive bar would be a lovely touch.

However the staff is always welcoming and professional,  will return.  One day I will order one of their desserts!  I'm too full after the dinner to attempt it, the hard choice is deciding which to pick!"}
{"text":"The server was kind and gave us a sample of their wine as I'm sure they do with all customers.

The atmosphere was inviting, but a little crowded when we came in.

The food was good and affordable. They refilled our salads and soups a few times as requested.

Overall it was a good experience and will definitely be coming back again next time."}
{"text":"When you think of a darn good salad and bread sticks who else comes to mind. NOBODY!
And the appetizers who can find one they don't like. I love the stuffed mushrooms. 
My wife loves the soup and salad.
And I love the tour of Italy.
The only problem is you can't eat all of it because you've eaten two and a half bowls of salad and four whole breadsticks. And down a few glasses. 
But you leave there happy and full every time. 
And for the amount you money you spend there I'd like to get extra mints lol"}
{"text":"We were out shopping and decided to stop at the bell rd location in Glendale, az. Boy was that a mistake! First off no specials on Sunday, so I ask for water with lemon and the server brings me hot water, a lemon and a glass of ice?
We order the angel hair, garlic asiago  alfredo, and a meat. Salad comes hardly any dressing and a lot more of the core, ends whatever you call the throw away part of the salad a small plate full, breadsticks are OK not very buttery not hot and barely any garlic. When the food comes we both wonder where is the sauce, try and mix it up but I am ending up with just dry pasta, and you would think it stating garlic there would be some taste to this sauce. NOPE sauce flavorless (what little I had) Meanwhile this guy dressed up is walking around, not stopping at any tables so not sure who he is... When we finally get our servers attention I ask if I could have some sauce and we wait food getting colder maybe 5 minutes later we finally get a small cup of sauce, oh yeah the guy I over heard was a manager but keep in mind he walked past our table a couple times and never noticed I was sitting there not eating and like I said never stopping at any tables. Not impressed and so not a good experience. Don't let the commercials fool you, I think you would have more flavor out of a jar from the store or just save your money and eat at home!"}
{"text":"It's always at the very least a decent experience when I stop by. Meal was ok server was clearly not enjoying his day. I had to get up and get my own silverware. Took about 30 minutes to get a refill."}
{"text":"Frozen food, canned sauce try Cucina Tagliani on Bell Rd. 100% better quality and service."}
{"text":"Tonight was a terrible experience compared to the many pleasant experiences that I've had at this location before. I believe the name of our waitress was Shandel and she did as little as she could possibly do with an attitude while attending to us. She served our appetizer and tossed our appetizer plates to the side, served our salad without asking if we wanted cheese and didn't give us plates for our salad, we didn't get any cheese on our entree until we asked her to bring it and while grating cheese on our entrees she proceeded to grate cheese on our arms and clothes as well as leave clumps of grated cheese on our table, and to top it all off she handed us chocolates covered in what seemed like jam. I did speak with the manager to hopefully prevent another terrible experience such as this, but what made our night better and worth giving a 3 star review instead of just 1 star was the attention that another waiter named Micah gave us. Micah not only came by to ask if he could pick up the plates that we were done with long ago, but also helped assist us with ordering food when our waitress couldn't do either of those things without attitude or lack of attention to detail. He was completely understanding and always had a great positive attitude that really helped. I highly recommend asking for Micah!"}

and the warm staff is on point"}
{"text":"Yesterday April 6th me and my wife went to olive garden for my birthday. They said the wait time was going to be at least 10 to 20 minutes but not even 5 of waiting and we were called up. Our servers name was Cody and this guy was probably the best server Ive ever had. I only had to order my food and thats it. He was on the spot with breadsticks and refills and Me or my wife never had to ask for anything. Really great guy. I hope they give him a raise or promote him."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing! Everything always comes out fresh, every time I visit. Bread sticks and salad are fresh, our food was great! Our service was great! This is also, in my opinion, the best decorated Olive Garden I've seen! I recommend going to this location!"}
{"text":"We've been to this Olive Garden before, when we arrived it wasn't very busy (around 5 oclock) and when we left it was super busy (basically on a wait). So we definitely made the right decision there. As far as Olive Gardens go, I think this one has a really nice bar area. For seating, they have a lot more table seating than booth seating, which is great to accommodate large parties. Their salad and breadsticks never disappoint and you can always count on the consistency of Olive Garden. I ordered the Shrimp Alfredo and it was delightful and comforting. My boyfriend had their special of the chicken and shrimp carbonara and he really enjoyed it! He had never had carbonara before. Our server was very attentive and nice. She offered us wine before our meal as a sampling. She checked up on us often and brought refills of breadsticks. 

I don't really like how OG started using those little computers on the table for payment, because we had issues with it. Honestly would just like for the server to bring it out as normal"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I have been to Olive Garden and I had a gift card so decided to give it another try.  It did not start out well when my set of silverware was dirty and there was a gnat in my water.  We were not offered the wine samples while tables around us all were.

I had remembered Olive Garden being reasonably priced in the past.  That was not the case this time.  We ordered off the new menu and got stuffed pastas.  One entree was $22 and the other was $18.  I definitely think you can get better italian food at a more upscale restaurant for a cheaper price and where everything would be clean."}
{"text":"I'm not sure when the food quality dropped off from the last yelp event we attended at the Green Tree location and yesterday's visit to the Pleasant Hills location, but The OG is back to their usual, boring self save for the interactive table computers you now get to play with.  You actually order your own appetizers without any waitress interaction.  Wow, isn't THAT what you've always wanted?  Let's go out to a restaurant and listen to loud talkers & screaming babies while we quietly order our own food...  Nope, I'm NOT a fan.  

We had been craving pasta for some time now so when my wife suggested the OG last night, I said, Let's GO!  We were seated promptly as they weren't very busy but unlike other restaurants where they try to seat you NOT on top of other diners, here they led us, or as it actually looked, they HERDED US, into the back corner of the restaurant.  The front half was pretty deserted, but they wanted us to sit right up next to a table of 'fillers'.  You know the type- the people that sit down, adjust the table to their preference, spread their chairs out till their short dinosaur arms can barely reach the table, but so that their belly actually fits in between the table & their spine, completely inconsiderate of other diners...  Yea- the hostess tried to seat us butted right up against their table.  Nope, I don't think so.  We suggested another table, leaving that one as a buffer zone.  

Here a friendly waitress came over and made us feel very welcome.  She introduced us to 'table-tron' which I declined, and asked if she would mind it all that much taking our order herself.  She politely accepted but still had to enter our appetizer order into table-tron.  Then I told her we were even ready to order our entrees, which she said don't get entered into table-tron but get written down and hand delivered to the kitchen.  Let me jump ahead, if I may...  Why is it that restaurants NEVER ask you if you are ready for your entrees?  They deliver the App then mid-bite race back to the kitchen to pick up your entrees...  Our App was a combo calamari (which was DELICIOUS), crab stuffed shrooms and fried zucchini.  The shrooms were still bubbling from the broiler when delivered and the zucchini were as hot as molten lava.  We had just enough time to take a couple bites of calamari and I burned my tongue off on a zucchini when the waitress delivered the entrees.  Wow, that was a good thing because (sarcasm alert) I CERTAINLY didn't want to actually eat the App right there in the store.  

On to the Entrees...  Kim ordered the create your own pasta and added sausage links & meatballs, yes, I laughed because I knew she would be full even before the entrée arrived.  Hers came out looking like the angel hair which she specially ordered had been in the water SO long it was swelled to the size of regular spaghetti... but it was DRY.  Of course it had the sauce & sausage & meatballs on it but do they keep their pasta under a heatlamp drying out till someone orders it, then they dump it on & send it out?  The sausage tasted decent but the meatballs were straight from Sysco.  Why order them out when they taste exactly the same if you cook them at home?  
I order the tour of Italy.  Penne with some kind of orange sauce, chicken with moz & provo cheese and lasagna.  The chicken was some sort of combination between grilled breast and chix patty.  It was about as big as a fist but perfectly thin, about a half inch thick.  Do they slice it on a deli meat slicer?  Looks like it.  The lasagna was not what I was expecting.  Stouffers lasagna comes out of the pan looking better than this stuff.  It almost looked like they took a tablespoon of ricotta and plated it, layed a 4\" piece of noodle over it, added a little sauce & repeated one more time.  This display of non-Italian cooking would send every single REAL Italian into cardiac arrest.  Even my mother who has absolutely no Italian in her blood-line makes a Rolls Royce compared to this Hugo.  

The salad is the only reason I would return to this location, as the breadsticks are again disappointing.  They taste like Sysco as well, frozen not fresh, dense & not light & airy, warmed in an oven.  

Add the OG to the list of places not to go back to.  I'd rather spend the 3 hours in the kitchen with my wife making us exactly what we want instead of being disappointed with this 'Corporate Imitation Italian' ever again..."}
{"text":"Went to the Green Tree Olive Garden for their Buy One-Take One special.  Their Salads and breadsticks are the only real reason to go there anymore...!  All of their menu items are frozen, sitting in a freezer until you order them, then they're pulled out, microwaved and served.  I mean- if I wanted to eat microwaved food- I'd go to the freezer section of my grocery store and shop there.  Seriously- if you want good breadsticks & salad- go here... but that's the only reason.  I'd rather take the extra time & make real pasta at home, using my own sauce..."}
{"text":"Had a good meal there on Saturday with my family.  My sons love their fettuccini alfredo, the breadsticks were fresh & hot, the salad was pretty good.  My wife had the mussels and while they were a bit over cooked, she still finished them.  I had the spaghetti with marinara with the sausage.  3 big sausage links for $2?  Great deal... 5 of us ate for under $60...  We all left happy."}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite restaurant! We go about every month and let me say this place is to die for! I love to get the Cucina Mia! You can get your choice of soup or salad unlimited with unlimited breadsticks (which are literally do dang good)  as well! Also you get your choice of pasta, sauce, and salad for only $9.99!! The waiters are super sweet and the cool little tablets at the table you pay with are pretty cool! Also, the little Andes mints when u leave are a a nice touch! Waiting, there usually isn't any maybe 5 min on a regular night but on busier nights about 45 min. There is also a bar here as well. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"This location is under renovation. Food was ok. A little too salty for me. 3 stars is for Matt, our server and the manager that goes around asking people how their meal and service was. Matt came to our table multiple times making sure we had everything we needed and refilled our bread and drinks when he saw it was running low. Hopefully, their renovation will be done soon so your dining experience will be more pleasant and appealing to the eye."}
{"text":"So this is one of the nicest Olive Gardens I have seen from the outside. Very pretty and well kept.

The restrooms were not very clean at all, a lot of debris not only on the inside but outside the door to restroom as well among other things.

So good and service was good. We went on a Friday around 3... didn't think it would be really busy around this time but it sure took a long time for our food. We got our breadsticks a whole 20 minutes before our salad. Then salad and food after . 

Waitress was great though and managed to eventually get the refill, napkins and anything else we needed when we finally did see her.

Main complaint?? I have always held Olive Garden on a higher standard than others and was extremely surprised that at the big dining table next to ours , they were doing individual performance reviews on employees. While I'm dining with my family for Valentines I don't need to hear one of your waiters personal performance criteria/critiques. That he is at 63% with wine and needs to be at a 69% and sell that better and on point with his appetizers . I don't need to know what his goal for the night/ month is. That is extremely unprofessional to do in front of customers... 
 
I don't know how it works with restaurants as far as where these meetings take place but I suggest at least not in a busy Friday evening . 

Glad I didn't stay longer to hear anymore or I would have known way more than I needed to about this locations employees."}
{"text":"The Skinny: overcooked pasta, wilted iceberg are the result of watching too much TV (2) service was actually not bad considering (4) value: two never ending pasta bowls,$20... feeling like a sucker...priceless. 

This is the problem when you watch late night TV. You're watching old reruns of Star Trek Next Gen and then a commercial comes on advertising the never ending pasta bowl. The next thing you know, we find ourselves in front of the local OG. 

Curses. My susceptible mind is weak to the lure of salad and bread sticks. 

We both order the pasta bowl special for $8.95. We remembered Misti Y's tale about $4 marinara dipping sauce and vehemently declined the offer. (Our waitress did not disclose the cost to us also...sketchy...). My hubby starts with the chicken/gnocchi soup and I start mowing down my first salad bowl. The soup lacked dumplings and seasoning. The salad was limp from being out in the Vegas climate too long. 

My hubby ordered orrichete with Parmesan portabello sauce while I tried their Chianti meat sauce with whole wheat linguine. Subsequent order included a penne with the Chianti meat sauce. The parmesan sauce was bland albeit the portabello flavours did come through. The Chianti meat sauce has less acidity than their regular meat sauce but again bland. 

The pasta was not al dente and overly soft. The whole wheat linguine was broken down into 2 inch strands that wouldn't twirl on a fork. I speared a penne pasta and just watched it droop on my utensil . Gives a whole new concept of limp noodles. 

You know that you've been had when the best part the meal is the chocolate mint at the end. 

Overall there's a reason we haven't been to the OG for a long time. A 2 starred review."}
{"text":"Normally this Olive Garden is decent and even if the food isn't great, service and speed are generally good. Not tonight. Food was very poor, some sort of kitchen drama was going on and our server - while friendly - would disappear for long stretches. We were charged for playing the table game device to top it off. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I had such an amazing experience at this Olive Garden. The food itself was the standard level one expects from Olive Garden, but the service. I was blown away. Our server Nikki was unbelievably amazing. She was so good. From the beginning she was professional and super nice. She offered ideas on what we should drink and eat, she made sure our drinks and breadsticks were full. She refilled our salads and soups as well without any hesitation. She boxed up our meals at the end of everything instead of just tossing some boxes at us. My girlfriend and I loved the service and will only be requesting Nikki from now on!!!"}
{"text":"The service and food were great!!! Krystal was wonderful I had the salmon, very tasty 
And did I mention the food was great!!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We came to Olive Garden for lunch because we thought it would be quick and easy. The host did not make eye contact or look up from her computer before seating us. It took about 10 minutes for our server to greet us. We only got 1 water refill the entire 2 hours we were there. She forgot to put our lunch order in so we watched the table next to us, who sat down 15 minutes after we did, finish their entire meal and cash out before we even got our food. The food was lacking flavor and looked like the chef just scooped it up and through it on the plate. Our server never came back to ask us how anything was tasting. We finished eating and sat for 30 minutes before we decided to just order dessert to go ourselves on the tablet. We cashed out on the tablet as well. Another 10 minutes passed before our server came over and said she was tired. We asked for our desserts and boxes... another 10 minutes passed before a different server dropped boxes off and gave us our dessert to go. I'm not really sure what we were paying the server for. She didn't tend to refills and barely dropped food... we could have just ordered everything ourselves and actually received it in a timely manner. Never once saw a manager doing any sort of customer service or table touches. I serve for a living, so I know what it's like. I was just shocked by the lack of service in the entire restaurant. It was the biggest waste of money."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden the food is always awesome and the service for me has always been top notch. However the Olive Garden at this location is above the rest. You can count on excellent food at most locations, however from the moment we walked in we were greeted were treated like we were very important. The bar staff was excellent, smiling and friendly. Our server was friendly, efficient and over-the-top! If you get a chance to visit this location make sure you ask for Bryce he's an awesome server! Even the manager works hard and still maintains a friendly attitude. This location has it all!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and with me being sick the chicken knokki makes me feel better. My server was Ty. And he was awesome. With a family of 8 we were very pleased. We rarely get such a excellent service enough to do a review"}
{"text":"Ate at Olive Garden a couple of months ago when they had the all you can eat pasta. The bartender dropped some silverware on the ground and placed it on a try which looked like it had fresh food. After speaking with the manager they said she may have been taking an old tray of food to the kitchen. However, that's not what it looked like to me. Also, they did not charge me even though I insisted I would pay. Food tasted fine but I may not get this vision of dirty silverware out of my kind. Kudos to management taking ownership of the situation."}
{"text":"Came in last night to have dinner with my sister and niece. We were originally sat at a table that was right were everyone walks by from waters to customers. Not a fan of the table. We sat there for close to ten minutes and no one i mean no one came by to say hi, drink nothing. I looked at every service that walked by and they walked by like we were not even there. Then comes Jackie, she asked if he had been helped yet i sad no and asked to speak with a manager. The manager came over we told her the problem I asked if we could be moved and she made it happen. Thankfully she moved us to Jackie's section.  It completely changed my mood.

The only reason they are getting 4 stars is because of this server. Jackie  was awesome, friendly and sweet. When i go back i will make sure she is working first. Thank you Jackie for turning my night around."}
{"text":"Like every other Olive Garden. This time around the staff was super friendly and attentive. Not something I'm used to. Made th experience much better. Great location."}
{"text":"Same food same service in most Olive Garden locations. When we checked in we where given a pager and expected to wait for 25-30 minutes. Having to wait only 10 minutes or so was a PLUS! 

I sampled out the Moscato they had for the day and really enjoyed it! Our server was sweet and friendly took our orders efficiently and went about her business. Now once we got our dishes that had been served by the runners is when it became a bit of a waiting game. Drink refills, bread refills, the soup refill, Our server hardly served us once the order was placed. 

It was the Hubby's Bday so my daughter approached one of the hostess to see if they could sing happy birthday to him. We didn't want him to expect anything so they where all great to join in on this plan. After our meal they came out singing with a mini cake good enough for 10 slices! The cake looked good but once you took a bite it was so dry not even the kids finished their slices. They also charge about $9 to do the whole thing. Most places bring out a slice of cake and sing at no cost. I don't care to pay the extra charge but they need to serve cake that is at least edible. 

Finally when we had our left overs packed up by our server I was shocked to see her grab the breadsticks straight out of the basket and place it in the bag. I have never left an Olive Garden where they didn't package the breadsticks in the oven safe bag. They usual ask if we want fresh breadsticks to take home but not this time straight into the bag without proper packaging. 

I have had way better experiences at Olive Garden....."}
{"text":"\"Let's go to Olive Garden\" was NEVER in my vocabulary, it was always disappointing as far as food goes. However, at this location I received excellent customer service for a to-go order. While my card was being run, I observed the bored-looking, folded-armed bartenders before the rush and the really nice decor. The calamari I ordered was on the tough side, but the fried mozz was good. The stuffed mushrooms have an odd taste that's more masked by the stuffing; they're recommendable but they're not rave-worthy. If you love Olive Garden, go to this location for the exceptional and respectful service."}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago on a Tuesday. The place was less than half full, and my girlfriend and I were seated in the back corner next to a group of 6 or 7 people. 

After being seated we were given menus and waited... And waited... And waited some more. After 10 minutes of sitting down without anyone even taking a drink order, the waitress came back to our area and didn't even acknowledge us. She tended to the large group never to us, and never even made eye contact. After being there 15 minutes I suggested we leave the restaurant. We waited another couple mins, and we left. Never got food, drinks, or even talked to anyone besides the host who sat us. 

I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I've never been in a restaurant that slow, and not been served. 

I would post a picture but I didn't even get a glass of water in the the near 20 minutes we sat there. No one aside from the host even said a word. And when I left, not a single member of the staff said anything to us as we walked out. 

There are plenty of other restaurants in the area to go to. Take your pick, you'll get better service. The service here was so bad I'll never go back."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden: food is okay, prices are okay, service from the waiters tends to be great, but the wait to be seated is always bad. On my last visit, I opted to try out the Olive Garden app which allows you to add your name to the waiting list and provides an estimated wait time. It said 16-22 minutes, so I thought, awesome, I live 15 minutes away! I received a confirmation advising to let the host know when my party (of 3) arrived. I did just that once I got there. The host greeted me nicely, found my name and said we were next on the list and it would be about 10 minutes for our table to open up. I was impressed, took the buzzer she handed me and took a seat. I then watched 4 parties of different sizes get taken to their tables before us, so of course I felt a bit misled by the 'next on the list' comment and unsure whether checking in online was even worth it. A bit misleading, but now I know what to expect."}
{"text":"This was the worse service that we have had in a long time our waitress was real slow we waited probably a good maybe 20 minutes before we even got a drink then it was another Maybe 10 minutes fifteen minutes before we got our food ordered and then it was almost an hour before we even got our food.Service was awful asked for some Splenda for husbands drink and she never came back with it and we were almost done and she still hadn't come back with it the service was just atrocious it's just I've never had service this bad here in a long time. Had a coupon for 2 kids meals a 1.00 each.  They only gave 1 kids meal discount.  The girl only had 3 tables.  What was the problem."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about the 9.99 unlimited pasta, salads and bread sticks. I was in heaven! So much food staring in front of you and not having to worry about the supply! The service was decent but what can you expect. The only area of improvement I saw was it seemed impossible to get a refill of water. 
Are you in a rush? Not to worry Olive Garden is very tech savvy and has those new devices where you can order and pay your bill! They are giving us all the tools we need to be pleased, well done Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"OG has really gone down hill over the years! Nice place but terrible service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went this weekend and normally we love Olive Garden, but not this time.    My fettuccine alfredo was more like noodles with about a tbsp of alfredo sauce for the entire dish.  It wasn't hot at all, it looked like it had been sitting out waiting to be served to me, luke warm, sticky, not even enough alfredo sauce to cover all the noodles.   Make sure you toss your salad, because the dressing is all on the bottom, and our lettuce seemed a bit brown.  I also ordered something on the menue that said, \"New\" which led me to beliver they would have it, but no they didn't have it, I find that rather odd.  Our waitress, Brittany I believe her name was..... well she came by our table a total of 4 times before she noticed we needed more drinks, she asked her other tables how their food was, but not once were we asked how everything was, or I would have made it a point to complain.  I just didn't see the point of complaining, just wanted to get out of there.  It took forever to get our check and our box and then when she did box things up, she didn't give us the breadsticks.. so I put them in myself.  It would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted them.  Who doesn't want the breadsticks???  For nearly $13.00 for my fettuccine alfredo to get what I would call extremely poor, we wont be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Horrible experience for my sons birthday !

I was thrown off by both the unprofessional waiter and manager whom both cared less about the experience of the customer two other people walked out and under his breath he said something mockingly which almost cost him more then his job good thing I'm such a nice guy plus my kids were with me.  I will never ever go there nor do I recommend them"}
{"text":"I have always loved Olive Garden ever since I was little. However, tonight was disappointing. I expect to wait before being seated and that was fine. I was annoyed at the fact that a customer who was leaving gave us their table notification buzzer thing. My boyfriend and I wanted to return it and get our place in line. The lady at the front made it seem like we were trying to cut in line and that was NOT the case! Once we were finally seated all we wanted was some good service and good food. We had both ordered iced teas which somehow after she poured our third glass became peach ice tea? The servers need to pay attention to what their customers are drinking or at least ask before pouring anything into our glasses. The waitress had a bigger party she was helping and we were not helped as much as we were at first. The overall experience for tonight was terrible and I will not be coming back. The only reason I even have two stars was because the food was decent."}
{"text":"The meal was great, the staff was awesome, and the berry sangria was terrific! Thank you so much for an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience at this location. This past weekend, I submitted an order online, to pick up curbside To-Go, around 9pm. My order pick up time was 9:40pm. My family and I showed up about 5 mins early and parked in the designated To-Go parking spots. At about 9:55, we were still sitting there waiting, and no one had even bothered to come out to say anything/bring out our order/collect payment, etc. My mom went inside to see what was going on, only to be greeted by some rude lady, who told her they didn't do To Go orders after 9pm(which was news to me, or we would've just gone inside initially) and she didn't even see our car on the monitor anyway (which was a complete lie, because my mom said she could see my car on the monitor just fine). My mom asked if she could please just get our order, so we could be on our way, and it STILL wasn't even ready... an hour+ later. When we got home and took everything out, I opened the Alfredo dipping sauce I had ordered to go with our breadsticks, and to my surprise, there was maybe a whopping 2-3 tablespoons of sauce ($4) in the giant sauce container. Needless to say, I was super disappointed, as this Olive Garden is super close to my house, but I  will not be returning to this location. I'd rather make the drive over to the one on Cheyenne."}
{"text":"Andy is the best server here! Would rate a 10/10, great staff great service and had an amazing time. We will be back soon to enjoy our next dinner with him!"}
{"text":"Ok food the service is a little slow waited 15 minutes to get drinks refilled and also to get check at end of our night."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with Olive Garden! I placed my Pick Up order thru Yelp and I must say it was rather easier than I expected. I always and only get Zuppa Toscana Soup because my daughter loves it. I order the 12 Servings for just Myself and my 5 year old. Haha. I wanted to give 4 stars for One simple fact, Breadsticks SHOULD BE INCLUDED when you order soup. That's crazy that they arent, were they ever? Or  am I thinking of a completely different restaurant? Hmm. Besides that I decided they still deserve the 5 stars"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant this place is as good as it gets. The food is always good and even if they slip up on service they have always made it up to us by buying part of our meal or giving us coupons for another visit. Everyone makes mistakes, it's good to know that this establishment acknowledges that and they do what they can to get the customers back in the door. For example one night we were there and the power went out, they bought our meal. Another time my husband waited 20 minutes past the time they told him for curbside pickup, coupons galore. Once our food took a little longer than normal to come out, and viola half our bill taken care of. The food is always good and the customer service is great, we'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my two sons, sat and  waited as waiter and waitresses walked up back and around us! No one came to serve us. We stood up to leave and low and behold a manager claims she was walking up to serve us. When I said no one came to serve us all she could say is I'm sorry. Can't rate the food but service gets a zero!"}
{"text":"Every visit we find something new in our food. A bristle from a pastry brush, a label from a food can. We know this isn't really \"Italian\" food, as nothing is actually made here, but we shouldn't expect foreign objects in our food every time."}
{"text":"I am going to write two reviews for dinner here. First thing of the hostesses, named heather and jennifer. Walked in and had to literally clear my throat to get them to look up from texting. They told me the wait time and gave me a pager. Watching them interact with other guests was painful. They continually were ignoring guests, laughing loudly and texting. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I went here for Italian food, and I got water and Dr Pepper, and we got breadsticks and salad and no soup. I went with Amy and Larry, and I got the tour of Italy, Amy got the shrimp scampi, Larry got the pasta with broccoli, I am coming back!"}
{"text":"oh well we had waited several months before trying this place. 

An early dinner yesterday at about 4:30 pm. 

Not busy so we were seated straight away. A booth, yuck I hate booths. This one was hot for some reason so we moved to a table with two chairs, I guess a half booth. It was much cooler. 

I guy I forget his name was the server and he said at least three times I am going to take care of you real good and or well. 

Well the first thing we order is our drink, me water Gus iced tea. Well the guy waiter took only a few moments to get this to us, but of course placed the drinks opposite to who ordered. 

One appetizer, that being calamari. 

MY meal was the Tour of Italy Being Homemade lasagna, lightly breaded chicken parmigiana and creamy fettuccine alfredo. 

Gus ordered Pork Milanese 

Pan-seared pork scaloppini crusted with Italian herb breadcrumbs, served with asiago cheese-filled tortelloni pasta tossed in a garlic-butter sauce with fresh spinach. 

We had the salad too. 

So we get the salad, but the waiter wants to give a one soup and one salad. The salad was not really great. 

Appetizer is set down and about three minutes later the entrees. First off learn to pace the meal dude and try to remember who ordered what. Not once did he get it right even though he claimed it would be good service. 

I won't go in to each meal other than to say it sucked. Oh well another 53 bucks down the drain."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant to have a great meal and a lovely evening and must say we were not disappointed. The food was great,the service was fast and friendly but what made this visit amazing was our server Dean he was very knowledgable of the menu he greeted us with a smile suggested appetizers brought our food in a timely manner,he made us laugh with his funny sense of humor overall we had a wonderful time we will be back knowing that you guys have exceptional employees like Dean"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!! 

Went there on 7/18/16 for our anniversary because neighbor gave us a gift card. Place was extremely busy. We thought this might be a good thing - fresher food...?

THE GOOD: Waitress was friendly and fairly attentive, eggplant parmigiana was tasty (though the slices were the thinnest I've ever seen), house salad was the bomb. Wine was good.

THE BAD:  Our table was a rocker (waitress fixed), and it was located in a corner area that seemed to have no air-conditioning - had to keep wiping the sweat from my brow - not to mention that a woman at the next table had a walker that she refused to move even though she knew it was in the way of my husband sitting comfortably (he would've moved to another chair but table was so close to the corner the extra chairs couldn't be pulled out). Calamari appetizer was disappointing beyond words - no flavor and pieces were no bigger than my pinkie, though basket looked full, at least half of it was just pieces of the coating - no calamari in them! Chocolate caramel lasagna for dessert was awful! The layers of cake were so stale, it tasted like cardboard. 

THE UGLY: The bill --- Even with my free dessert coupon the total was over $59, before gratuity. One entrée (all I wanted was salad - which came with the entrée), 2 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine, over $59!!! I can hardly get my mind around that - not even 2 meals - almost $60. For that price everything should've been excellent.  

As I already said - NEVER AGAIN. Go here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Overall good food and good service. 

I came to this Olive Garden on a Friday evening with my family. We were celebrating a birthday. Our server, Adam, was very friendly. He was prompt with the orders and drinks. (He didn't introduce himself but I got his name from our receipt)

We ordered all sorts of entrees: steak Gorgonzola, seafood lasagne, shrimp scampi & chicken scampi. All the food was great. Salad & breadsticks were terrific as well. One member of our party didn't want cheese on her salad so when we asked for another salad bowl (with cheese) the server looked a little annoyed. One salad bowl for 5 people isn't enough anyway! We would've requested a second bowl even without the cheese request, meaning, 2 salad bowls should have been brought out initially (for a party of five)

Again, food was great, service was great. I deducted one star because they dropped the ball with a special request. It was the birthday of one of my kids. I was hoping for a dessert after dinner with a birthday candle on it & I wanted it to be a surprise. Naturally, I didn't want to request this with the server in the presence of my child (that would ruin the surprise) so I excused myself & went to the podium by the front door. I spoke to 2 gals there & explained my request. I even gave them my table # and said when the server brings dessert, if they could put a birthday candle on it. The 2 girls said they'd pass along the request to the server, Adam. 

Obviously he didn't get the message because when my daughter's dessert came out, it had no candle. I asked the server if he had gotten my request & it appeared he hadn't. So I was disappointed. I don't know who dropped the ball, but it was a little disheartening. 

However, overall it was a good experience and we will definitely be back, but maybe only for regular meals and not special occasions. 5 stars to our server Adam and whoever cooked our meals."}
{"text":"Price discrepancie from online ordering and store level. 11.99 in-store and $9.99 online with picture of trio sampler. Corporate refused to resolve this issue stating \"customer can deal with it\"."}
{"text":"I ,routinely, buy a \" To Go \" order of Olive Gardens chicken-gnocchi soup ( the only thing my Mom really enjoys!)
Recently ,I had an issue with my to go order ( spilling inside the carrying container it comes in)
When I explained the situation to the Manager ,on duty on Monday morning  June 11 ,2018 ,she graciously replaced the soup ,with a Complimentary order to go.
It is because of this \" Customer First Service \"  that I am a Loyal Olive Garden Customer. 
I ,also , buy the \" All -you-can-eat \" meal card ,when available. 
Great food / service ! I recommend this Olive Garden Location ,heartily."}
{"text":"Greeted at the door, Scott was our server. He was very simple and genuine. Took care of our order to the tee and checked up on us on every perfect time. Had a little conversation to make it a little extra special. Left a card in bill sayin happy birthday"}
{"text":"I'm really torn about rating the Olive Garden.  On the one hand, it's an Olive Garden, and while maybe they're not evil like, say, Wal-Mart, it still is not necessarily a business I want to promote.  On the other hand, I was really impressed with this, the first Olive Garden I've been to in 8 or so years.

I noticed a fully-stocked bar on the way in, so decided to order a martini.  It was not only good, but it was GIANT.  Now, I do not really need 2.5 martinis in a single glass, but I will drink it if that's what you give me.  Ignoring the waitress' suggestion of the ever-popular 'blush' wine, we ordered an Estancia Pinot for the table.  I was impressed because the bottle was less than 2x the cost it would have been in an Ohio grocery/liquor store (and a touch over 2x the cost in a CA store), so that was good.

The appetizer was good, but i cannot remember what it was.  I blame the large martini.

Ordered one of the monstrous \"Italian specialties\" for an entree.  It was not spectacular, maybe a tad over-salted, but it had an array of none-too-sublte flavors that went fine with the wine.  I was impressed, and happy I did not ruin my appetite with those salt sticks that pass for bread."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this location. However, the quality in the food and the service . has taken a dive for the worst    I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Half price on any glasses of wine during Happy Hours, I was so happy I ordered two! So good. They still give you a lot of food with unlimited soup and bread sticks. I always filled up on soup and take my leftover home for another lunch and dinner. Really, no joke!"}
{"text":"This place is where servers come to die. :| the service is lack luster but the Alfredo sauce must have msg! This place is always s comfort food joint.... Mmmm carbs and Alfredo sauce"}
{"text":"Service and food was good. But, I thought when it was your birthday they came out with a small cupcake or dessert & sing. Instead we were asked did we want to purchase a dessert & no song. Really....maybe my expectations were to high for this location. Next birthday we'll go to the Centennial restaurant instead. Oh well, I'm still a fan of the salad & breadsticks."}
{"text":"My family wanted to go here for Mothers Day and we knew it would be busy so I went online to see that they will put you on the waiting list online so you don't have to sit there so long. No problem, right? Very wrong, they will only let you do that for a party of 6 or less. They don't take reservastions. So we went sine the website said the wait time was 36 to 40 minutes. Yeah, not so, when we got there we were told the wait time was 2-3 hours. Seriously??? Why would they not take reservations for at least large parties??? We ended up at a small restaurant called Anzios on 27th and Cactus. They seated us right away and they were super busy. The service was great and so was the food. Pick another place to eat."}
{"text":"Last night my family came in and were shocked to see who was waiting on us. Nikki has been our favorite waitress honestly probably since she started waitressing as a teenager at her old jobs so it was nice to see her smiling face walk up to the table. I could tell she was fairly stressed out right after we were sat I saw she and another girl had a bigger table so I didn't wanna bother her to much catching up, but even though I could tell something was wrong she never let it get in the way of her amazing service, definitely gonna ask for her when we come in from now on. Oh yeah and the food was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Same thing happened to me that happened to Eva G. I have a four year old with sensory issues and was excited to see the online waiting list as an option.  I had even called ahead of time to check the wait time and the automated phone message suggested the online check in and it is what prompted me to take another 20 minutes of my day to sign up for the account to put my name on the online waiting list.  We went to Ross by the Olive Garden.  I held off having my son try clothes on as it was my understanding once we checked in for the 30 minutes we would be seated next.  I rushed from the store to the restaurant and was told it would be ANOTHER 20 minutes and I asked what the heck the point was to have an online check in when it's the exact same thing as walking in like everyone else.  Seriously?  Olive Garden has been in business for how many years and there is potential to be up to date with what we all want and as a Mother not wanting to sit and wait as her four year old hangs on her for 20 minutes I went to Perfect Pear instead and we didn't even have to wait."}
{"text":"this was my first time at this Olive Garden and let me just say the service was amazing, at the front door they opened the door for us and greeted my family and I with a positive attitude. Kiki was our server and she was great. She was kind and showed enthusiasm. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great service and food! I've been here 4 or 5 times now and I've always been happy when I left.

It's amazing how even after filling up with soup salad and bread sticks the entree still tastes amazing. 

Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys some Italian."}
{"text":"We know some people make jokes about the place but for a large chain it's very good, with good value for the money and the service is always good, the chicken parmigiana is great. And nice cold salad and tasty breadsticks served with your meal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good but I didn't like the music that they were playing. The salad was good, the pasta was a little dry but the portion was great."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us on Saturday and we got sat quickly but it was downhill after that . The only concern was to turn the table as quick as possible .everything was being brought at once the appetizer the soup and the salad we asked that the waiter slow the pace but 5 min later the entrees arrived and they were already trying to clear the table. The food was ok but the rush to get us out worked we will never come back."}
{"text":"Came here with family and this place is always so good. My sister was being picky but danny our waitress was super nice."}
{"text":"Decided to bring my fiance here for a suprise date. I guess its prom weekend because it was super busy but it was cool. The food was good and our server jj (im pretty sure that's his name) was very nice. He apologized for the wait and whatnot but i told him i know the struggles since I'm a waitress too. Hes a pretty chill guy lol made the expierence better.


Update: pretty sure i got food poisening with the stuffed chicken and potatoes. My stomach and my fiancés hurt so bad :(  they should check the chicken or the sauce"}
{"text":"Meh. Waited 10 minutes just for water.  My ravioli was dry, semi warm and had very little marinara sauce.  I asked for more marinara, which the server finally brought just as I was finishing my meal. My husband said his pasta was okay but nothing special. The bill was $38 for 2 mediocre entrees and 2 waters. No idea why this place is always crowded.  Pass."}
{"text":"I understand this is a chain and I wasn't looking for anything above and beyond, just good service. Our food was good. Just what we were expecting for olive garden food. We ordered the special on the table menu to after find out that it shouldn't have been there and it was not offered to he honored. The manager also came over to just tell us it wasn't supposed to be there with no apology or offer to honor it either.  Our server was less than attentive, which is very easy when you bring salads and pasta and don't need to do anything else for your table. The table behind us was having the same serviceless experience and when she told the server, the same as ours, Mason, that her dip was hard, cold and salty his response was \"yeah it's like that sometimes\". He walked by a tray of dirty dishes left right next to a table by ours and continued to walk by it after who looked like a shift lead asked him to take care of it. No check in from the manager, no check in from him during dinner. Never did he once ask how everything was or thank us for coming in. We paid on the kiosk and left. I work in the service industry for one of my full-time jobs and the other guest is a general manager. It takes a lot, or rather a lot of lacking, for me to leave that disappointed. I don't care if I'm at a five star restaurant or a cheap diner, service is service and when the manager sets the bar low you can't expect a lot from the servers."}
{"text":"Tonight was the best service at Olive Garden we have ever had. According to the receipt our waitress was Clarissa. I am hoping she get a to see this. You have the best customer service I think I have ever seen. You were friendly and smiled. It was really busy and you kept your cool even when my daughter sent her food back. You are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Still standing at the bar after 10 minutes and the waitress won't even make eye contact. I will never come here again"}
{"text":"A typical Olive Garden experience.

The restaurant itself is well-kept. The staff do their jobs well, and were gracious enough to accomodate our large party during the dinnertime rush. We were in town for a cycling event, so we had quiet a few people with us.

The food was delicious, as always, and the ambience was family oriented."}
{"text":"Reason being why I believe this Olive Garden is lacking is because of the cooks. The waitress was amazing and I will give her props. My mom ordered the tilapia and shrimp platter and I ordered the chicken shrimp carbonara. The presentation was not impressive and quite messy, but hey, looks are deceiving lol. My mothers tilapia and shrimp was messy looking as well, tilapia looked very bland as if was over poached. I bite into my dish and it's bland and taste nothing but heavy cream. 

Best advice is try to have higher standards on your cooks and make sure they serve you your money's worth !"}
{"text":"I am going to say yes, this was a 5 star experiance. The place has been here for many years now. They started good, went down, came back up ,and now they are great!
Yes Olive Garden has really improved a lot. I like the way they have decorated the place, all of them seemed to have a make over.
They have a great selection of wines, and the menu has all changed again.
One thing that is quite different than other places. Is they give you unless salad, and endless Soup, You can even trade the soup out. By having one bowl of one kind of the soup, then you can have another bowl of completely different flavor of soup.
All for the same charge,it comes with your meal.
You could never say you left here hungry.

The food is really good now. as well as the soup. I liked them all. The salad has a lot of dark green leaf veg which is another plus.
It is a really great time out. The staff is great,the food great, and the place is clean and even the restrooms.
Lots of parking in the lot as well."}
{"text":"I know that everyone will think ,\"oh this is a chain\" ,\"it cannot be good\". But, this place is really good. The staff is good and they are always busy. If you go on the weekend it is non stop , you will wait but, it goes pretty quick. 
We came on Wednesday this time. Still very busy ,but no wait.
Our server was great Joe. He was quick and while very busy, kept coming to check on us.
The food was great. The appetizer just so  so . We got the calamari and zucchini (fried). I won't get that again. Too much breading. But, as usual everything else was great.
They have some really great soup here. The wine was good. I had a Merlot mix that was a nice size and good temperature. T got the Chianti, also great.
Food was hot as well when it came out, which is great. 
Restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Olive Garden. I don't consider it to be an fancy restaurant but nice enough where I decide to wear something other than sweatpants.

On this particular visit, I had a Strawberry Fresco, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Chicken and Gnocchi soup, Shrimp Portofino, and Tiramisu. I literally took two bites of my pasta and boxed it up. I was beyond stuffed.

I enjoyed my meal and while I don't make a habit of going to Olive Garden all the time, I go enough where I walk away with no complaints."}
{"text":"I called in to order a to go order and was repeatedly placed on hold. It actually became a game to see how long they would let me sit on hold: 17 minutes. In that 17 minutes, I drove to the location. I was in the parking lot by the time they came back on the line to talk to me: and asked me to hold again. I told the gentleman I had already been on hold for over 15 minutes and really just wanted to order. He allowed me to order (large salad, no onions) and said it would be ready in 5 minutes. I am disappointed in the poor staffing- I understand the lunch rush is a rush- but not being adequately staffed to handle the rush is poor business."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding but I was not too fond of our server Keeley.. It took her 10 minutes from the time we were seated to get out drink order, then she took the order of the table behind us and talked to them for 15 minutes. Finally she put our drink order and and it was another 10 minutes before we got our drinks. Then when she brought our drinks out she served the table behind us when she took our order first! She also brougt the breadsticks, salad and dinner to the table behind ours first. Our food was good. I finished my dr. Pepper and I waited until she was done chatting with the otger table to get her attention for refills and more breadsticks. She then came out with a birthday cake cake for the other table instead. Wont be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I've dined at Olive Garden for many years. Not this specific location, but many others. I find that one's experience at this chain is either very good or very bad. There is no in between it seems. Went with (5) of my co-worker's for lunch. We got there relatively early so as to avoid the lunch crowd for what we thought would be about an hour dining experience. WRONG! From the moment our waiter arrived at the table, I knew this wasn't going to be good. \"Mike\" was brash and unfriendly. He seemed genuinely annoyed to have to wait on us, and it seemed like during the entire dining experience, he had much better things to do. 

It took what seemed like forever to receive our drinks once he took the order. Then as soon as he took our order, he literally disappeared. We didn't see him anywhere in the restaurant. This being Arizona and hot, our drinks were quickly consumed. No Mike. wait....wait....wait some more. Finally, a server who was not ours, asked if we would like drink refils. After answering in the affirmative, waiters who were not ours, showed up with the salad bowls and breadsticks.  Mike soon showed up, and delivered a few of the extra items we had ordered, but did not have the extra dressing I requested. I politely asked again for extra dressing for my salad, he again seemed annoyed at my existence, and left. No sooner had I served myself a bowl of salad, the entree's showed up. uh....timing anyone? Salad is served and eaten first before entree's are delivered. Again, this part of the meal was served by someone other than Mike.  I had ordered the Lasagne Classico, and the serving was much smaller than I remembered, but I ate it anyway. (certainly not worth the $9.95 they soaked me for).  Halfway through the Lasagne, Mike showed up with my extra dressing. (gee...thanks). It was obvious at this time we required more drink refills but off he went again to disappear.  We again flagged down another server to refill drinks.  My dining companions who had endless soup waited nearly 20 minutes for someone to notice they might like more and that our salad bowls needed refilling.  (the salad bowls needed refilling long before) However, someone who appeared to be in management had more soup brought out and another bowl of salad and breadsticks. 

Mike finally started coming back around and being attentive to our needs just in time to leave us our checks. Though I felt he had earned ZERO, I still left him a fair tip.

What could have been a nice leisurely lunch was essentially ruined by our server's careless and unfriendly attitude, and the lack of good service. It seemed like everyone but our server waited on us.  And yet, we essentially we had to ask for everything before we got it. I don't feel this Olive Garden really cares about their customers or doing things the right way. Surely we are not the first customers to complain about this guy's unfriendly demeanor and constant disappearing act.  

If my co-worker's insist on returning to this particular OG in the future, we have already agreed that if they attempt to seat us in Mike's area, we are requesting a different server. Personally...I don't think I'll be back. This place just doesn't seem to care, and the smaller portions didn't wow me. There's so much better out there to choose from at lunch time, and OG should remember this."}
{"text":"Took my best friend here yesterday for her birthday lunch, and the food was delicious. Our server, Stephen, was a very nice young man who was accurate and attentive. He didn't smile much, in spite of being conversant, but he was a good waiter and everything went fine. My tip for him is; Stephen, smile a bit more and put yourself out there. You'll find that friendliness coupled with good service, will get you far in the service industry. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden and their food."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went ther after work for dinner, we were seated right away but once we got to our table we sat there for over 30 min and waited for someone to even acknowlege us sitting there, plently of waiters walked right by our table, even the manager walked right by us and asked the table behind us how they were doing. We didn't even get water. We ended up walking out and as we walked out we told the manager that had walked by us earlier that we never even got waited on and he appoligized but the damage had already been done. We will never be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"good meal, medium price point. Service was good."}
{"text":"I usually come out here after the lunch hour rush. You would think its slow enough that you can be seated immediately. Not. 3 stars is all i can give."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is always consistent. We went the take out route on Valentine's Day with family in town. We tried placing via phone, but apparently the phones were down.

We placed the order at 5 for a 620 pickup. I arrived to pick up the food and it was packed as expected. Bar staff had a manager helping with to go as it was slammed. Manager explained the phones were down and everyone chose online, but the issue was the online system allowed 50 orders for 620. My food came and I was in my car at 635.

The beef tortellini and house salad and amazing!"}
{"text":"It's your classic Italian franchise family restaurant. I personally adore Olive Garden, this one has the friendliest staff, the best service and the atmosphere is awesome! The food isn't \"authentic\" Italian but it's good .My favorite thing in the menu is the tour of Italy, some hot fresh breadsticks and their delicious house salad! Their menu selections are endless and are generally the same for all franchise locations. They have amazing deals throughout the months, new combinations and dishes introduced weekly and it's family friendly both my boys love it here. Also, if they're super packed or you just don't want to sit and eat they have curbside to go and you can order online!!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  But the real reason for this five star review, the service.  I went with a friend of mine who is a certified pain in the ass when it comes to what she wants at a restaurant.  Special orders everything, and asks for all kinds of extras.  I mean she runs this poor server ragged.  Me and my daughter did a little bit too, so this guy was going for this and going for that, and they were busy too, so he had lots of tables.   And he never, not once, let us down.  All the way down to extra mint chocolates and bread sticks to take home.  Never sat without my drink glass full either, which is one of my pet peeves.   I know people think \"I don't go to OG because it is a chain restaurant\"  But I love this place.  And it is my daughter's favorite place to eat.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Food and service were great.  Lots of extras requested and got every single one.   My daughter, (who has Down Syndrome)  loves this place and so do I.   Maybe it's because of who she is, or maybe it's because the service there is top notch, but the staff there almost always treat Megan extra special.  Whatever she wants, all the way down to how many meatballs she wants and extra stuff on her salad.  Thanks Olive Garden, we will see you again soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite and drink.
Food was great but our waiter Austin was really great. He made the experience better."}
{"text":"This particular Olive Garden was great. I've been to another one but this Olive Garden I would give two thumbs up. We had a party of 6 and was seated right away (it was dinner time). The waitress was very friendly, constantly checked up on us to make sure our dinner was going great and on point with our orders. The food was amazing and very filling. I was a satisfied customer as well as my family."}
{"text":"Our server, Matt, was tremendous.  He answered my questions re menu items and ordering something special.  He was very attentive to our group.  Food was served promptly, was at a good temperature and tasted yummy.  Very nice lunch with friends at this Olive Garden restaurant."}
{"text":"Juan was an amazing waiter!!! It's always such a pleasure to have a waiter that listens, pays attention to detail and is accommodating!! Juan is all of the above!  I would go out of my way to go to this location just to have him as my waiter.

Can't go wrong with AYCE soup and salad!  Love all the soups and salad !"}
{"text":"Gerard was the best waiter ever! He was so kind, very attentive, and helped us with any questions we had. When returning I hope he's working and we get to sit in his section again. Thank you Gerard :)"}
{"text":"I frequent this location a lot because it is the closest Olive Garden to where I live. The service is hit or miss. When we went yesterday, we had a lovely (insert sarcastic sigh here) girl help us. She was extremely rude and seemed to be totally annoyed by our questions. When my friend asked if they had pesto sauce she rudely said, \"Does it say it anywhere on there?\" Oh and we didn't get any Andes mints at the end, which happens to be one of my favorite parts of eating there in the first place.

The only reason I gave them three stars is for the endless pasta bowl, which they have now for a limited time. Its like $9 and it comes with salad and breadsticks and all that jazz. If they didn't have that special going on I probably wouldn't eat here at all.

Oh and props to the cute host who took us to our table and made conversation with us. Maybe he should serve instead."}
{"text":"Everything pasta ! BuonAppetito ! So our first impression was we would be here awhile since parking was full. Surprisingly enough we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our server was prompt and informative and our first course arrived on our table less than 8 minutes from the time we ordered it! 
The salad had only one complaint and it seems to be a consistent issue with this restaurant - one that really doesn't make sense to me - olives ! There are two olives in the large bowl of salad ... If you want more than two olives, you have to ask for them - which is strange since their very name boasts of them ! Have found this to be the case each to time I've eaten here. 
Spaghetti & meat sauce was my meal and it
 was yummy.  Hubs had seafood Alfredo . He said he wouldn't recommend it again but it was just okay. 

Tiramsu was delicious and the coffee was fresh and piping hot !
No complaints other than the olive shortage ..."}
{"text":"Very good experience today. The limited stuffed something and shrimp in a white sauce is great. Even though they have cut back on the initial salad size, or so it seems, they are quick to offer a refill.  Service was very good and food was great."}
{"text":"We were a party of 3 and a high chair with a 30 minute wait time. The hostess with curly ponytail was great very friendly. But wait our server STEVE M was fabulous. I've been a server, manager and chef so I know great service. He started with free wine samples. I didn't come for wine but once we tried them we were sold great up sale. He suggested apps so we had the stuffed mushrooms great choice. My food was hot and flavorful and yes there was bread lots of it. My salad had a few extra olives that I requested. We order cheese cake with berries great as well . But the food only shined because my server was awesome. We came on 2/16/18 for dinner"}
{"text":"Love coming here to eat. We could probably eat their salad everyday. Servers are always attentive and respectful. Best of all they really take care of our Veterans!"}
{"text":"Visited this location to celebrate a friends birthday. We were greeted and welcomed by a friendly hostess and seated fairly quickly. We were then greeted by our server who took our drink order and allowed us some time to look over the menu. 

This visit I opted for the chicken scampi. One of my definite favorite dishes. Served with chicken fillets, bell peppers, onions over angel hair pasta in a light garlic butter wine sauce...omg droool!!! Still love the salad dressing. The bread sticks are a bit salty. 

Our server was great, he was attentive and friendly.  He was able to embarrass my friend by singing happy birthday to him so I was utterly pleased!!"}
{"text":"For the first time ever I had a terrible experience at this Italian restaurant.  We did the lunch thing on 1/22/2018 and got in pretty fast.  Went to the lunch menu and decided we'd eat soup and salad and I'd get a meaqtball sandwich.  Every thing was great until I opened my utensil napkin and notice the knife had a ton of garbage on it so I asked the waiter to exchange it.  He was a bit rude and took the knife but never brought a replacement.  Good thing the wife had one.  When our food came I again noticed both my forks were filthy with crude on it so I ended wiping them with my napkin.  Unbelievable how this place has gone down the tube since it opened, we've been coming here since then but I think we'll find another place to eat.  Not Happy!!!  On top of all that one thing I notice was the amount of tip the little stupid machine did to the receipt--it added a few cents to the tip I chose, WOW, for service that wasn't that good to begin with in the first place."}
{"text":"Such a good dinner! Our server Derek was great and really attentive to our table and making sure we had more then enough breadsticks and salad! Definitely would go again and hop to get Derek as our server again!!"}
{"text":"The women's restrooms were a mess today. 4 stalls and only one was usable!!! We did not even want to eat there after seeing the restroom and left and went next door!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, we said before on another review board that we would not be back here but hey - we are from Ontario and are you kidding me? An Olive Garden? Unheard of anymore back there! We returned to this Calgary location even though last time,a few months ago, the service was lackluster and we found a hair in our food. Management - well - I won't go there. We walked into the front door and figured it was a Tues night - would there really be a line up out the door at 7pm? Yep! Pretty much! We grabbed our little red buzzer thingy and sidled up to the bar. Kind of smelled like wet rags there but - where else was there to stand? The poor bartender was alone and really could have used some help. I was ready to throw an apron on to help him. He was out of almost all his red wine as \"they had a really busy weekend\". Wow. A 3 star restaurant that acts like a 5. The place is always packed, mind blowing! Anyways, we had our drinks (red wine and a beer), paid and were seated - in the middle of the busy aisle where our chairs were bumped constantly by servers - but that is OK, only mildly annoying. The salad today was FRESH and had more than one tomato and had 4 black olives instead of our usual 1! Score! The lettuce was crisp and cool and even our plates were cold. Lots of nice red onion too. The bread was just OK, the usual, not hot. I wonder if they will ever make whole wheat bread sticks?  I would feel so much better about consuming my pasta! Haha! Our server was OK, he tried his best but he was swamped. I ordered my usual Tour of Italy (I cannot stray) and my husband ordered stuffed rigatoni with chicken. In case you are not aware, the Tour is fett. alfredo, chicken parm and lasagna, a little bit of each one. Hubby gave his an 8 out of 10, he quite liked it. I tried it and it was good. Too full for dessert and as always took half my meal home for tomorrow which is always a treat. Took a bit of time to get the bill. Not the most romantic date place but the food was so much better than last time. I pity the clean up crew tonight, the place just churns the people in and out and you could tell."}
{"text":"My Special Day Came- My Birthday! And 2 friends asked me to choose a restaurant for lunch! Huge mistake choosing OG! As The saying Goes No real Italian eats at Olive Garden! I wanted to try this because menu here looked good! I am picky eater- I dont eat large meals so thought Apps& Desert only! Well I ordered Aracini Balls They were out of them? @ Noon?we went in when they opened for lunch? So I Ordered Calamari half overcooked half frozen!& they didnt have Stuff Mushrooms nor Artichoke Fritti- ended up bad birthday lunch for me.! My friends had soup n salad which Ill never eat since they use Bagged Salads from Mexico& I hate pre dressed Salads.! Do being Disappointed I said maybe Desert? Well Their Tiramisu was old literally it must been last piece in fridge it was stale and old looking! My friends apologized to me but none at OG no Were sorry Nada! I said to friends Next Birthday- How about Macdonalds? they don't deserve a star"}
{"text":"We got sick of salad  the soup was fine never again not Phoenix or Yuma Arizona never again we thought it would be because it cheaper for lunch   7.49 soups and salads that all we had  drink where fine my glass was not clean they give clean glass it loem lime drink it a half hour before I new one"}
{"text":"WOW has olive garden gone downhill or what?! Food and service horrible.  My family and I went here for dinner and when the host was seating us at our table she could clearly see the table needed to be wiped down from previous customers but chose to ignore it and sit the menus down on top of it all. It really grossed me out and I asked her if she could please wipe down the table and she did not acknowledge a word I said but just turned and walked away. I waited a minute and grabbed my purse for us to leave and here she came with a towel to wipe it down. We decided ok lets just stay and eat instead of leaving and waiting to get seated somewhere else. BAD IDEA! It took about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us or even say someone will be right with you. We ordered an alcohol drink and that took forever to get to us and I had asked our waiter if he could please bring us some water and he kept forgetting up until our food came. Salad plate was dirty and not clean. Wine glasses on table were dirty. At this point I was already grossed out. So out comes the food. UGH terrible! Terrible frozen food is what it ALL tasted like. It really was terrible and SO not worth the money we paid that night. Needless to say we will not be back. We will be making the little bit longer drive to RIGATONYS in Chandler for an amazing Italian meal. No more frozen high dollar food from Olive Garden for us!!"}
{"text":"Great soup. It was hot and had a perfect blend of spinach and chicken and dumplings. The two breadsticks were hot and tasty. The service was fast and gracious. I will be back again in the future."}
{"text":"Great experience eating here tonight. The soup was hot. The salad was delicious. We had a great server too"}
{"text":"We had to wait 30 minutes for food.My Grandson didn't get his drink for 20 minutes. My wife's food had Bacon in it when she requested no bacon..the waitress got money for check and assumed that my 17 dollars change was a tip. We had to tell her where is my change and she had someone else bring it over 10 minutes later. My wife didn't eat at all didn't want to wait 20 more minutes to eat..horrible job on mothers day."}
{"text":"Larry saw we were picking up for a large group,  but were having issues with the card online.  My girl, my son and I were sitting thete waiting,  but he made a bad situation better.  Thanks Larry."}
{"text":"This is a good location. As always, Olive Garden lacks authenticity and is overpriced. However, if that's what you're looking for, this one is great!"}
{"text":"Slow to no service. Waited forever, I had to call the restaurant to see where our waitress was. They put me on hold. Returned appetizer, tasted stale, even waitress commented, it didn't look good. However, she still served it. My martini was all juice. Food took forever, then our take out order was never placed, so we cancelled it to avoid another hour wait. Food was like a heated up frozen dinner. Ghetto from the get go.  Needless to say, this place sucks."}
{"text":"Don't come here often and when I do it's the darn commercials that get me. Good job Olive Garden promotional department! Now, if only they could work on their customer service.

The food is great, especially for their deals. AYCE soup and salad for 7.95 and AYCE pasta bowl or $9.99 (that also includes AYCE soup OR salad). 

The pasta combinations are endless an delicious. I always add their breaded chicken for an extra 3 bucks. 

The peach tea is amazing! Favorite part is the real half of peach inside that I love to nibble on.

Sounds great right?! Te problem is customer service. The waiter was rude, never once smiled and I swear he was a serial killer. Maybe it was the fact that my daughter spilled her sprite but come on, that was an accident! And yes, I did say no tomatoes on the group salad but that's because I'm allergic. Next, on the same salad I said dressing in the side but that's because our friend was watching her weight. I don't really think we were being difficult but still doesn't mean we deserve bad service.

Debating just trying car side to go because the pasta and salad is calling my name.. Yum!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both had spaghetti and meatballs.  It's was the worst meal we've had at Olive garden.  The only reason we sat and ate everything is because we were starving."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden is disappointing. I am normally a positive person and write positive reviews but after two bad trips back to back I don't think I will return to Olive Garden. Or at least this one. My husband and I used to love the spicy shrimp scampi appetizer but they put like no sauce on it making it not spicy and therefore not worth it for us. Second time in a row it has been tasteless. We were also forgotten about on the waiting list when we got there and after waiting twice as long as told, I decided to see how much longer since other people were coming and we had the same party size (2) and we're getting in way before us. We had a buzzer and the lady said I also allies your name. We were right by the stand and trust me I would have noticed! Then our server took over 15 min to even talk to us, and our food got to us after we waited an hour at our table. Ummmm....? They weren't even that busy and tables around us were getting food that ordered after us before us. We then got our waiter switched because our first must not have been feeling good and the second waiter was great. However, by then we weren't happy, he knew and a manager apologized about the server switching but that was not the problem at all. They didn't offer to take anything off and I felt that was pretty pathetic. Especially to have crappy service two times in a row a few months apart."}
{"text":"Their service is terrible! Took 15 mins just to get our drinks. And had to call the waitress to get our check. She didn't even realize that we already had our food. And another 15 mins just to get our check. Then she disappeared"}
{"text":"5 stars after 1 star at a previous location. I went in already disappointed thinking my service was going to be terrible like before at a different location. Food was great, fast and what can I say definitely a 5 star for the awesome customer service. My waitress was amazing. She was always checking make sure we had everything we needed. Didn't make us wait for long on anything. She was very talkative, her recommendations were great. She was jus plain amazing! Thank you Marissa for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden holds a special place in my heart. I will love it forever. Tonight I consumed about 1600 calories in one meal. Impressive, right? 
Zuppa Toscana, peach ice tea, and Stuffed Chicken Marsala... absolute bliss."}
{"text":"I visited Olive Garden today as part of an ongoing goal to do \"normal people\" things like going out to eat. Since I skipped out on this place for my birthday, I thought I might as well make it the first stop in the road.

I was pleasantly surprised. Our waiter, Andrew, was excellent; drinks never went empty and breadsticks always magically reappeared. The breadsticks were salty, and they were no doubt meant to be guilty pleasures. I didn't care... I ate five of those glorious baked goods. This aspect of the meal was good enough to bump up a would-be three stars to four stars.

Now for the rest of the food. I ordered the Lasagna Classico with a side of salad. The salad was fine but nothing to write home about. My mom could have made a better one in two minutes. Same goes for the lasagna. This cheesy monstrosity was decent, but I've eaten frozen lasagnas that could easily compete with what Olive Garden is offering. I would say that the entree itself receives only 3 stars, strictly for being decent.

Overall, this meal receives four stars for the stellar waiter and fantastic breadsticks. As for the other stuff... work on making your entrees stand out, Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Heartiest meal I have seen in a long time! Ample refills and great portion sizes."}
{"text":"Always good food even as the prices are going up...maybe I'm cheap(?)... $18 for half a dozen shrimp on a scampi dish...it IS really good and can't say anything bad about the endless salad and warm garlic bread sticks!"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I went for dinner. Usually we get dirty looks or problems because my husband and son love cheese. Ayesha (the waitress) was very courteous and nice about it. She gave them both all the cheese they could handle with a good attitude about it. She joked with us and was very attentive. They should definitely hire more like her! A+++!"}
{"text":"I always come to this Olive Garden. They are awesome. Love the food. Best place to get soup, salad and pasta. 

My favorite soup is pasta e fagioli. The salad is good but I always ask for extra dressing on the side because it feels like they don't put enough on. Also you must get the alfredo boat for your breadsticks to dip in. It's so good.

The best appetizers you should try are Parmesan zucchini bites(so delicious) & fried mozzarella I love

My favorite entrees are the tour of Italy, chicken alfredo, chicken parmigiana, & stuffed chicken marsala. 

They recently just changed their menu and it feels that they have fewer options to choose from. Also the kids menu they don't offer a soup or salad anymore, that's pretty upsetting."}
{"text":"When I got here it was extremly busy and the wait was 30 min. Or I could just sit at the bar with no wait. I sat at the bar of course. The unlimited soup and breadsticks are awesome. Although the thing that had gotten to me was the service. There were two bartenders taking peoples orders/drink orders. One was very good and the other just dropped the ball on every level. You already know which one I had gotten. Thankfully the awesome bartender picked up the slack and I went with him for the rest of the night and it definitely saved the experience. 

Food was okay. It wasn't as good as I remembered. I got some eggplant pasta and it was meh. Nothing particularly stood out. Awesome bartender is awesome and just a chill dude in general that defnitely knew how to provide a good experience which bumped this up to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Breadsticks and soup..breadsticks and soup!! I could just survive on this choice. 

I like the sgetti with meatballs!! 

Nice employees and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Olive Garden in quite some time. Not usually a Chain frequent patron. OG had and event for some elite members and I can tell you, they really rolled out the family love that night. 

We tried 15 or so dishes so I'll highlight. 

Bread and salad is still a great part of the meal. I know in years past I have dined on just that. Breadsticks are warm and good. 
Guess what they did with them?? Created a chicken parm sandwich kinda like a slider version. Wow. So, so good. I deemed it hangover food and I mean that in the most loving way. It was cheesy, crispy goodness that I definitely want after a rough night. 
They have a pot pie (two versions) one with red sauce pasta and one with chicken/broccoli Alfredo. I liked the chicken one better. If ordering this, I would definitely split it as it's quite a generous portion. 
On the lighter side the had a chicken piccata that was really nice with a healthier version of friend zucchini that was delish!
End the meal with cheesecake. Very light with a nice strawberry sauce. 

Go hungry as their portions do not disappoint."}

Dear Olive Garden,

Here are a couple FREE tips:

-Good salad doesn't start with iceberg lettuce.

-A real Italian restaurant doesn't cook pasta until it's soggy.

-Breadsticks are NOT supposed to be merely sticks of bread.

-Salt and butter are not \"secret ingredients\"

-If it coagulates at room temperature it's terrible for your body

-Review stars are awarded based on good service not the number of apathetic high schoolers per square foot

Your restaurant is a lot like the Mona Lisa. From a distance the smells and even the menu pictures are enticing. Only until you've met the food up close do you realize you've been mislead"}
{"text":"Great Food and Excellent Service. Our waitress, Sarah S., made our time a pleasant one. She really enjoyed her job. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"As with some of the other reviewers here, we had a fantastic dining experience tonight!  Our family-get-together party of 6 arrived before the dinner crowd on a soon-to-be-busy Friday evening and were still told it would be a 40 minute wait.  We decided that would be okay, but the next thing we knew, that 40 minute wait had turned into a 4 minute wait.  We were shown to a large private table where we could enjoy our dinner and conversation without too much background noise.

Our waiter was Derek, and he was amazing!  I used to train waiters, hosts and cooks for a large restaurant chain, and I'm pretty darn picky about the service I receive.  Derek was SO on top of everything throughout our stay, and extremely cheerful in so doing.  Then when we found out we were to have an additional person (one of my dear aunties) join us after our scrumptious soups and salads were already devoured, he graciously added her order to ours before her arrival.  When she arrived, she had time for a couple of bites of salad and then our dinners were served -- all at the same time.  She didn't have to wait for hers.  Everybody raved about the food choices that had been made.

Other servers stopped by occasionally to see how we were doing, too.  Salads were replenished, teas and waters refilled, and all of the proper serving steps happened -- WHEN they should happen.

The crowning achievement was when something happened that I have never seen before in a restaurant, and which was totally unexpected.  We had whispered to one of the serving staff that it was my auntie's birthday.  Derek showed up with a little birthday scoop of chocolate drizzled vanilla ice cream adorned with a candle which he lit in front of her, the gathered serving staff and our family sang Happy Birthday to her, and smiles were all around -- okay, a bit normal for a restaurant birthday, right?  But then, Derek handed her an envelope with a smiley face drawn on it, and inside was a cute little card with a dachshund riding a bike.  Inside, the serving staff had each taken the time to write inside of it, draw little smileys and such, sign their names and wish her a very happy birthday.  It really touched all of us that these hard-working servers would reach out with something so sweet.

A HEARTY 'THANK YOU' TO DEREK and all the others!!  It's a rare thing these days to be treated so wonderfully..."}
{"text":"Well-priced food, a wide variety of entrees, and good salad.  It's not gourmet, and it doesn't claim to be.  Our waiter did a really nice job tonight despite a throng of diners.  However, here is what needs addressed:

1.  The greeters/hosts in the front need to be re-inserviced on the importance of  the smile and how to interact with patrons-they seriously need a drink of happy juice.

2.Speaking of happy juice, there are two water dispensers in the lobby that were empty the entire 45 minutes we waited for our table.  Would it be too much to ask for the hosts to fill them up?

3.  The transvestite host/ess needs to get a better fitting wig and lost the five o'clock shadow. He was scaring the little children.

4.  People link the cleanliness of the restrooms with the sanitation level of the restaurant operation.  Get that out of order sink in the ladies' restroom fixed on the double and clean the area around the stalls and toilet bases with a serious scrub brush!"}
{"text":"Ordered the stuffed shells,shrimp scampi,salad and breadsticks. They took forever with my order. I had to get out my car and get it but the girl was sweet and my food was delicious. I love their salad and breaks sticks. Food was still hot when I got home. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Yep, it's a chain. Yep it's the but of a lot of jokes by the \"In the know\" set.  Yep, it is kind of inexplicable how long the wait can be on weekends. Yep, I know it's more politically correct to eat at a  locally-owned family restaurant.  

 But you know what? 

 I've never once had a bad meal there.  I've never once had less than top-shelf service there.  I find Olive Garden restaurants have consistently higher quality not only compared to the other franchise stores in it's price range, but also notably better than some family owned Italian restaurants I could name."}
{"text":"Luv Olive Garden, but this site needs some help.  Quick to wait on us but waited almost an hour for Luke warm food."}
{"text":"Out dated decor, and stains on all the chairs. Our waitress was way too speedy, slamming plates down, and glaring at all her other tables while talking to us. 

The food was decent. It may have tasted better if the experience was better."}

{"text":"We have not been to Olive Garden in awhile, last visit it was not good but thought we would see what if anything has changed! We both started with gnocchi soup! It was cold and watery and I couldn't find a bite of chicken, lucky for me I had 3 gnocchi, so okay put some parm on it! Ok decided to go for second bowl, it was warm, 2 gnocchi and hey a couple bites of chicken!  But was offered no Parmesan on top this time! Ok time for main course, chicken piccata, and zucchini bites, chicken was so dry and overcooked, sauce was tiny and weird taste! What can I say about the zucchini, it was raw, with Parmesan sprinkled on top! AWFUL! I love chicken piccata, I make at home, and have had other places, not sure what they were making! Left the zucchini on the plate, it was not good, believe me, the picture on menu is deceiving, not what I got! So to sum it up if I ever eat at Olive Garden again it will not be in Surprise!!!!!"}
{"text":"We eat here all the time, the waiters are great except for the guy waiter who nearly ran us over to get to the park next to the door in his piece of junk car!!! We were heading there he cut us off and took the spot!! So glad he was not our waiter! He ran in like he was late! Me having arthritis in ankles parked way out and did not run! Enough of that went there Thursday to have lunch tried the new chicken calzone, all I can say is unedible, hard as a brick, a little burnt on bottom, worse crust ever!!! But two stars for great waitress, and great salad !"}
{"text":"I have been to many Olive Gardens. I live right by this one. But, I am sorry to say, this is by far the worst in quality of food and customer service of any Olive Garden I have ever been to. I understand that the location caters to our snow birds, to whom my grandparents and many friends are included. We have been here three times. There is usually a wait, especially in winter. Service is at a snails pace. My kids had pizza once - it was actually black on the bottom and raw on top. I will say, they did not charge us - and looked upset by the quality. Other pasta dishes were unusually bland or seasoned with dry spices to the point of being inedible. The salad is hard to mess up - but it was actually watery - like they did not dry the lettuce enough. After the last time of waiting half and hour and still getting the worst olive garden food ever - we quit going. No one, including our seniors, deserves this level of food and service"}
{"text":"The specials are ongoing and the food is to die for. The waitstaff is very attentive. They are quick to exchange orders if the food does not meet up with our tastes. Not their fault. I was not aware how spicy it would be and could not eat it. They were very understanding. I don't go on holidays or during busy hours so the wait if any has never been more than 10 min."}
{"text":"We have always had a great experience in the past, but this time it was different.  I will start by saying the server was excellent, Collyn did his best and was the shining light in this experience.
My son turned 22 last night and requested Olive Garden for his birthday dinner.  I went to their website to see if I could make reservations.  The website showed me a great program (or I thought) called \"Wait List\".  You can't make a reservation, but you can add your name to the wait list.  I called the restaurant, only to hear, that's not how it works, you have to go to the website and do it.  Ok, I heard on their phone numbers voice prompts, I could do it on the phone, but the hostess told me NO, only the website.  Okie, I proceeded to sign up, go to the link and get myself on wait list. The website tells me, got more than 6 people, which I had 8, call the location and they can do it over the phone.  Grr, called back, and the hostess tells me, sorry it doesn't work that way.  I request a manager, Drew, who tells me, he can only put me in 15 minutes before I come. Hmm, not what the website says, nor did the wait time on the website match the hour I was told they really had.  Drew explained to me that the program was only designed for 6 or less people, or he could save me 15 minutes with more than 6 people.  Fine, we went to the restaurant, waited an hour and once seated by a different hostess, was told Drew wanted me to tell you, your welcome that he even got you seated on a Friday.  Ya!.  I gave Drew my opinion of the wait list program and we reluctantly began our order.  Drew decided to argue with me, politely, although not appropriate.  
The food was not good.  Our meals were over cooked, the bread sticks were hard and burnt.  At the end our waiter told us Drew wanted to offer us free dessert.  Great, but since we were there almost three hours by the time it came, we got it to go.  We got to Olive Garden at 730pm and left at 1030pm.  I will probably go back at some point, but not for some time."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the service was wonderful! Our waitress, Ashley, was the best. She kept us in salad and bread sticks but she also kept our water and tea filled and made sure we were good. We weren't the only table she was waiting on. She was friendly all the time and very on the ball!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress and food was great.. however they do need to make sure their kitchen staff is not under staffed."}
{"text":"So we came here for dinner with a bunch of friends and there were two servers. Willie was the main waiter and he help with Kyle. Let me just tell you that Kyle was on point. I would've given 1 star if our waiter was only willie. I'm giving 5 stars for Kyle's hard work. Willie forgot pastas and drinks while Kyle waited at our table more often than willie. Kyle was super helpful, very nice and even joked around with us. As for food, it's the typical Olive Garden food."}
{"text":"We recently visit this Olive Garden on a Sunday evening.  We where quickly seated .  All was good.  We reviewed the menu an enjoyed the atmosphere.  After several minutes our waitress appeared.  She took our order and left.  Not especially friendly or helpful.  After a reasonable wait our entrees where served.  The \"create a pasta dish of rigatoni, meat sauce and Italian sausage was served.  But my Italian sausage was meatballs.  I told the server (not my waitress) I had ordered Italian sausage.  Into,d him it was no big deal and the meatballs would be fine.  This server left and as I was finished my meal he showed up with a side of Italian sausage.  At the time I thought that they had tried to make it right and I appreciated the gesture.  This earned them a 20% tip.  I had the receipt emailed to me.  Later I came across the receipt on my email and was reviewing the ala carter type billing.  Guess what I find?  Italian sausage listed three times at $1.79 each.  So long story short.  They brought me the wrong meal and charged me to fix it.  Good bye Olive Garden and I will not be back."}
{"text":"My son and I ate here last Sunday and we wanted to mention that we had a wonderful server that needed to be recognized. The name on the ticket was Emily R. At first we noticed she was really busy and maybe it would be one of those experiences, but she came back quickly and never forgot us after that. She was always friendly and helpful.  Her attitude was one you would like from a waitress at any restaurant.  We both got the chicken garlic dish from the two for $25.00 we have ordered this dish before but for some reason this time it lacked sauce.  It really needed more sauce, and that was the only reason I did not give 5 stars.  Other than that the rest of the meal, appetizers and soup/salad were wonderful.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I always have a good meal at this OG.  
This trip was no exception. The food is consistent, and the service very courteous.  Our waiter, Jaimon, did a great job. Just the right balance of being helpful without overdoing it."}
{"text":"Exceptional menu options, always five star service and all at affordable prices. I've never had a meal there that I wasn't thrilled with. I'm first generation Italian-American. I grew up eating authentic Italian food from both parents and their families. OG is the real deal."}
{"text":"Starting off we called for reservations, \"sorry no reservations on the weekends.\" Huh? No wait however.  Waiter Josh was good. Food was ok to good. I'm not impressed with the table kiosk, sorry I'm traditional. Made it seem like it was taking a step towards fast food. Staff was friendly but overall just my wowed."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience food and friendly staff.. Wd love to come back again here.. Tried chicken parmigiana and stuffed chicken marshala and it was gooddd"}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Olive Garden for many years until yesterday in Goodyear. The restaurant was very crowded as expected for a Friday night. However, despite the line, the wait was only 10 minutes. My guest and myself had Lasagna and shrimp dish which were good, but not great. Of course the soup and salads were very good. I have to also say that the service was good and attentive. I joined their club and next time I'll get a free dessert or appetizer!"}
{"text":"A bad experience that was made good.

I enjoyed a late dinner with my girlfriend at this Olive Garden and the evening started off a bit rocky. After being seated by a nice hostess, we were introduced to our server. While she seemed competent, she also looked a bit busy. Now, the restaurant wasn't actually THAT busy, but the feeling we got was that she wouldn't be around much throughout the night. 

That turned out to be the case. 

After getting our drinks and taking our order, she never came back. We ended up getting another server (not sure he actually was one). He was nice, trying to make things better for us as he was clearly new to the whole thing. Because he came in during the middle of the order, he was unaware that we hadn't gotten our soup and salad when our main entrées came out.

When I noted it to him, he promptly went and got them for us -along with more breadsticks and drink refills. I appreciated his effort, despite the shortcomings of the server before and the mix up in terms of us not getting our soup and salad. We noted his good performance to the manager after everything was finished. 

A bad evening turned decent I would say. It could have been MUCH worse. I'm not sure if we will be back, mainly because of the location. But at least they turned a potentially bad evening into a decent one."}
{"text":"Our young waiter was flustered and angry when we arrived. It was Friday, at around 12:30-1:00 (lunch rush). When a server can't calm themselves and behave like an adult, they may as well just stay in back! He was visibly pissed off. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt but he never really made eye-contact, every time we asked for whatever he forgot, it annoyed him. He got 20% but Olive garden lost 2 customers. This was the 2nd time everything came backwards: His spaghetti plate first, his drink first. Then salad and breadsticks (without alfredo sauce that he made me order on our kiosk. But that got there after they were long cold & stale! If you're having a horrible day, we understand but please grow-up and don't take it out on people. Not happy. The manager eventually jumped-in to help but it was too late.
I'm tired of #OliveGarden treating it's customers like crap! It's your job to be polite! Come on! Ridiculous"}
{"text":"My husband saw the OG commercial about the braised beef Bolognese. So we headed out to Olive Garden, we both ordered it.. by far the best meal we have ever had. I absolutely loved it..I hope they keep it on the menu"}
{"text":"This is not a good place to eat if you only have an hour for lunch.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table even though the restaurant was not busy.  We all just ordered the soup, salad, and breadsticks and everything took so long to be served.  The salad and breadsticks were fine but very stingy amounts were served.  The soups were quite bland. We do not plan on returning since lunch took too long and was nothing special."}

{"text":"Aaaaaahhhh olive garden.... As always the food was devine. Our server, Becca was amazing! Our glasses were never empty and the food kept coming and coming! For once the wait was very short and thank god because I was starving!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review two years ago on this specific Olive Garden and thought it would be a good idea to update.  I went not long ago, my husband and I, for a little date night.  The wait wasn't very long for being the dinner hour and we were seated pretty quickly.  Not very long after being seated we were greeted by a very cheerful server, Stephanie.  She offered us some wine samples.  We didn't have to wait long for breadsticks and salad, shortly thereafter we got our food.  Everything ordered to perfection and hot.  Stephanie checked in with us from time to time but wasn't a bother.  She kept or drinks refilled and would clear the table as we finished.  Big pet peeve of mine when dirty dishes are left so I liked that she cleared them.  Overall a really nice experience compared to my last review of 2 stars... will definitely be asking for Stephanie on future visits."}
{"text":"Met up with some girlfriends for happy hour.  Very busy for a Thursday at 7.  Our waitress was outstanding.  Never had to wait for drinks.  Food was delish!  Everything was fresh.  Very happy with the level of service at this location."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried to go here once and never will again. Let me explain...

I was 8 months pregnant and craving some Olive Garden, which I always love. They had built a new building for this location and we saw people going in so we stopped for dinner. We were walking in and a worker asked if we had a reservation. I told her no not yet and she turned us away saying it was a soft opening and it was only for those with reservations. Understandable I guess.. I was sad but we left. Thing was... Not even twenty minutes later my husband gets a call from his work friend, Dustin. He said \"Go to the new Olive Garden location! They're opening for the first time and gave us free dinner!\" My husband told him the story of how we were JUST turned away and asked Dustin if they had had reservations. He said no they just walked in. I was appalled. If you're going to turn people away, that's fine. But turn EVERYONE away then. I was so mad. You lost a paying customer that would've gone back many times. Now I drive farther to the arrowhead location where I enjoy taking my business. And I was super pregnant! Give a girl some food!"}
{"text":"I always love Olive Garden, the food never disappoints. 

Last time we went though, (May 2013) my husband and I had an... interesting waiter.  We are a young married couple and I was very pregnant at the time. I don't know if it was because we looked young and 'cool' but he kept cussing (Which we are Christian and don't really enjoy being around that, especially when we are trying to have a romantic dinner) He kept forgetting things like our breadsticks which we didn't get until we were almost finished with our meal (I like to dip my breadsticks in my soup and didn't get to) and neglected to notice when our drinks were empty. It was a busy prom night so normally I would give him the benefit of the doubt.. But I noticed a table near us had complained about him and the store manager took over and finished serving that table to make sure they left happy. The main issue I had with our server...? As I said I was quite pregnant, which he noticed. I ordered a salad which comes in the big bowl. I finished most of it and asked for more. He said \"Sure! But just so you know, that size salad usually feeds a family of four.\" I looked at my husband with the most shocked look as he walked away. He's lucky I wasn't one of those hormonal pregnant woman that has a hard time accepting all that extra gained weight! I was appalled! He continued to make another comment when I asked for a refill of my soup. The ONLY reason I didn't complain to a manager was that he gave us fresh soup and salad to take home with us, free of charge. I don't LIKE complaining so I decided that he had saved himself. I only wish I remembered his name.. Rude."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years now and never get tired.Great place to eat! waiters are very friendly, they always checked on us if we needed anything. i would highly recommend this Italian restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 5. Before I got there, apparently the other 4 were led to a table but someone else took it and this happened twice! Then when we did get a so called table, we had a booth and a chair out in the isle. 

Our waiter had problems finding his pen to write the orders down. Then he finally (or so I thought) took our orders. When I gave him my order, I pointed to the picture of the item I wanted and he repeated it. Well, when lunch finally showed up I received something totally different from what I ordered and he proceeded to tell me that he repeated it to me and that is what I ordered. By this time, I was in no mood to argue with this person as to what I ordered/wanted so I took what he put in as my order. It was awful but there again, didn't want to send it back because I didn't know if/when I would get it or something else back. 

I am not impressed at all with service or the food. I understand it was a Sunday afternoon and they were getting busy but that is not my fault. They were not busy when we all showed up at noon and was trying to be seated."}
{"text":"Spent a couple hours here last night 4/23/2015 on a date with my new girl. I have to say the waitress (Patty) was the best ever keeping our drinks and salad bowls full and bringing our yummy food promptly. 
After dinner, I was filling my electric cigg with juice at the table and this huge, Loud, Abusive Paul Blart (Mall Cop) looking guy ( MATT CLASSLESS) ran over to our table and started yelling at me Very loudly that those were not allowed in this restaurant. Everyone in the restaurant was looking at us as if I using the bathroom on the floor or something. How rude due to the fact that I was getting ready to leave and was not smoking the Ecigg in the restaurant. This was a most embarrassing  end to an otherwise really nice night.
This guy should be publicly flogged for all to see. What a BIG ASS!"}
{"text":"We had Jonathan as our server. Most definitely the best server we had that Olive Garden so far. Food came out hot and fresh. He stayed on the refills. He was really personable."}
{"text":"Service was less than average.  The waitresses nails were realyl really long which I would have to question how clean they were.  My Ice tea was served with a
 teaspoon in it.  So I was grossed out and decided not to eat.  Just sat there and let my other fruends enjoy there meals.  Yuck!!"}
{"text":"Their food is just okay.
I'm not crazy about this restaurant as I used to be.
I think that the food should taste better & their salad should have a little more dressing on it instead of splashes of dressing like they use.
I don't think that this restaurant is the best anymore."}
{"text":"Eating here is always a treat. In the beginning we were served that had a signature sauce which was delicious & bread sticks.  I think everyone knows the breadsticks are the best.  I could live off these breadsticks alone.  I got the shrimp scampi which was delicious & the serving size was large enough for two people.  The workers are very nice, polite, & everything was served on time.  It was also my friends birthday & the waitress gave us a free molten lava cake.  They also give samples for wines which was great."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner to avoid the long wait my wife and I sat at the bar. I can't remember the bartender's name but he had black hair and I think it was Yuri or something anyways he was super nice and very friendly. Even though he was extremely busy he took great care of us. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Huuuuu... I just remembered why I don't visit chain sit down restaurants. I don't know what kind of world I was living in back in the day. Maybe it was because I was a broke college student? Maybe the food was better back in the day and they're slacking now? Maybe my pallet is a bit more refined? I don't know. 

The salad is like eating water and the dressing is aight. The combination of that and the bread sticks was okay. 

My food??? Huuuu... no bueno. We paid all this money for food that was Meh. 

My margarita was good though. I'm glad there was more mango than strawberry. The strawberry was too sweet. 

Maybe Carrabas would have been the better choice for chain Italian."}
{"text":"On Tuesday the 20th around 12:20, my friend I had lunch there and let me tell you that it was the best customer service ever. As soon as we went in we where greeted. Our waitress by the name Maria L., she was super nice and very attentive. I just want to thank you Maria and the staff there for having great customer service and the food and drinks where awesome."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at the Parma Olive Garden.  It's a chain restaurant so you're not going to get the fanciest meals with the best ingredients, but what you are going to get is decent Italian food with good service and great prices.  

The last time I was here, they had a special going on where you buy one entree and get to take a  second one home.  How can you beat that deal?!?  I had my soup and bread sticks along with half of my pasta and had another whole entree to take home so essentially I got 3 meals for the price of 1.  Can't beat that! 

My favorite part of every meal is the gnocchi soup.  It is so creamy and flavorful with big, fluffy gnocchi.  It's never-ending too, so sometimes I have to indulge and give in to the \"would you like a refill\" question.  Yum!

The service is always good... the waitstaff is very friendly and prompt.  They never leave you wondering if you're going to get more water or breadsticks"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for lunch with a friend and ordered the seafood Alfredo with Gnocchi soup. She ordered shrimp Alfredo with a salad and tea.

My waitress was very kind attentive and added a nice amount of cheese to my pasta but my pasta tasted like they didn't season it whatsoever. I added A LOT of pepper and not too much salt so it didn't taste like I was just eating butter and milk.

My Gnocchi was good even though it only had 2 gnocchi's in it.

My friend was very happy with all her food.

I ordered another seafood Alfredo to go for my boyfriend but he asked me why it wasn't seasoned at all. So, please season your pasta Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Sadly the food is just not that great. The customer service is lacking. Even after my shrimp cocktail was served, Frozen! The manager never bothered to come over. I sent it back, and refused any more. Even the mixed drink was terrible. No plans on returning,  just not worth it."}
{"text":"Okay, first off I love Olive Garden. This review is based SOLELY on the customer service from Brenda, our waitress. She forgot to bring us things we asked for, and was not pleasant either. The waiter who helped her out by bringing us boxes, extra breadsticks, and a bag was much more polite and helpful. If he had been our waiter, this would be a 5 star review. Sadly, I will not be returning to this Olive Garden because of the poor service! :("}
{"text":"Decided to go here for a quiet birthday dinner., Little did I know, it's prom weekend. It's packed. Lucky me and thanks to YELP.. You can checkin in advance and be on added to their waitlist prior to getting there.. So when I arrived, I only have to wait for 10mins instead of 50mins. Hooray. 

Ziarea G. Took good care of us. On point, polite and tentative. 

Food: salad: 4/5 the usual salad you alway get at Olive Garden 
shrimp scampi: 4/5 angel hair with shrimp, tomatoes, asparagus. Hearty but have light feel.. enough sauce but not overwhelming. 

My go to when I don't want any fuss. Comfort and familiar environment with the usual pastas dishes!"}
{"text":"This was the first Olive Garden I ate at! Hooray for me! Being from Hawaii, I wanted to eat at an Olive Garden forever! It was so new and exciting for me and my friends, we decided to eat there twice on our vacation in Vegas! I know, it's just an Olive Garden, but I thought the food was tasty and plentiful, wine selection was great and the service was amazing, our server kept on coming back to our table and serving us more of their sample wine, score!

The salad and bread sticks was everything I had imagined from the commercials, the pasta was cooked perfectly and we left stuffed and kinda buzzed."}
{"text":"Had my mom come over from San Diego and wanted to take her to her favorite restaurant as a thank you for taking care of the kids, so me and the wife could have a date night. Got greeted and seated as soon as we walked in, Deborah our waitress was amazing!!! Making sure we were happy and had everything we needed. Food and drinks where delicious, came out on time and plentiful."}
{"text":"Great place and price for family. I got the build your own pasta - Garlic Alfredo with Shrimp, it was pretty delicious.  Got the sampler appetizers, I did not enjoy it one bit.  Our server Maureen was amazing.  For what it is and the price, I'd give it a 4-star."}
{"text":"Alright, grand opening day for this Olive Garden location. Not so much a review as it is feedback/constructive criticism for management- 

Upon entering there was a wait, my name was taken and given a wait time: accurate estimate of 5-10 minutes. The hostesses could be more professional and more friendly- first and last impression of the restaurant and that should be taken into consideration by them- more smiles, eye contact are necessary as guests can appreciate that more and are more patient when the staff are warm, friendly, and sincere; speaking of sincere, the hosts attitude and voices are forced and far from meaning what they say (such as \"thank you\" or \"I'm so sorry\") being a host and previous assistant manager of a restaurant myself- the small details are what are pertinent. Mirror the personality of your guests to create a bond and interaction. The host that led me to my seat was more friendly and personable, smiling and explaining who my server would be, did not leave with a parting comment like \"enjoy\" or \"thank you\".  Also this is a casual fine dining atmosphere, slang and lack of professionalism should be no where near here. No one wants to hear \"ok, YOU GUYS, you're table is done and good to go. Follow her back that wayyyy.\" It's not \"do you want/if you want\" : much more proper to say \"would you like/if you would like to\". Or looking for a party by shouting out their last name through three sections of the restaurant \"BAXTER! BAXTER! BAXTER?! BAXTER?!\" Then coming back in saying \"nope, gone.\" It is in better interest to write a description of the party (if in the event the beepers run out, which I'm sure was the case here?), walk up to the party and greet using a salutation- \"Mr. Baxter, the table is prepared for your party of four; I do apologize for the wait. Would you follow me please?\" And then thank the party for their patience when seating them, give their servers name, and part with wishing them to enjoy their dinner. Lacking in class and most definitely smiles- focused is alright but please, ladies, do not look miserable doing your job- you set the tone for the restaurant!

My server was Devon. I waited 4 minutes to be greeted, not too bad. She looked rushed and frustrated, the table behind me was waiting for 15 minutes to be helped until a manager came to take the order. Employees, your managers are here to help; don't sacrifice the patience or enjoyment of the party you are waiting on because you are hurried, ask for help to greet or take an order, just a few minutes and you could lose a tip or a customer forever. She didn't offer wine or even remove the glasses from the table when I mentioned I only came for dessert, nor was she very savvy on the menus: I'm not quite sure if she even looked at one before because I asked a question about having another dessert menu and she searched frantically saying, \"lemme see if its on the back here.\" I told her I already checked and it wasn't. She was sort of shocked and said she would go ask the bar if they had one. Came back later, took my order and didn't collect the menus until half way through. Once she was not so rushed she smiled and made eye contact. Confidence is key employees, act like you know what you are doing, move with grace, don't let the frantic show on your face, and you will have us all fooled (in a good way). She waited to bring my check, didn't rush me, so I can appreciate that :) .

The Dolcinis- two were frostbitten/completely frozen (strawberry and tiramisu), the lemon mousse was perfect. Writing this review, I have been waiting for the other two to defrost enough to taste the flavor and not ice. 

Overall, the first day is bumpy but going well from what I see. All the rest will come in time. Thank you management! I wish you all well in your business and personal endeavors!

This was written on my initial visit to OG. 

I went back for a second visit for dinner and dessert.. And well, I don't think I would dare waste my time writing about the terrible service, lack of professionalism, bad manners, and unrefined management- even weeks after it has opened.."}
{"text":"I think it's safe to say that Olive Garden's food is consistent through all of their locations. Consistent, but not all that great, as far as Italian food goes. But it's the premier choice for Italian on a budget!

This particular location has great service! They were more than accommodating to the picky kid at our table and quick with taking orders, bringing food and doling out refills."}
{"text":"Wife and  stopped in for lunch today.  We expected a wait but were seated immediately.  The food was awesome today.  The service was great.  Honestly this was a great experience.  I have been here before when the service was not as great.   Today everything was completely in line.  Good food."}
{"text":"Ate at this location tonight 3/26. Our server was fantastic. It appeared he had a large area but was able to keep up with everyone as far as I could tell. Food was good ( I had the never ending lasagna).
Unfortunately I was put off by the guy clearing tables around us. Apparently the belt he was wearing wasn't sufficient to keep his pants pulled up meaning I got several views of his boxer shorts. I really dislike seeing this on kids though I'd argue this was someone in their early 20s - let alone this happening while I'm trying to eat my dinner. I realize this is just Olive Garden but shouldn't there be some level of professionalism? If our server hadn't been so great I would have left this at one or two stars. Totally put off. For the record, this doesn't make one look cool either!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love going to this location even though it's not in our neighborhood.  Very clean.  Great customer service.  We're always greeted right as we walk through the door.  Danielle is hands down the best server we've ever experienced; she's worth the 20 minute trip just to have her!  She's on top of her game, on the refills, friendly, and doesn't mess up our picky orders.  We were sad the last time we went and she wasn't working... the manager said he would give us the next best service but no offense, he wasn't even close.  She's the best.  Nonetheless, good service.  I also like how the managers will go around and check on customers; shows they care."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here to eat two nights ago (sorry for the late review) and we had a wonderful time. Nick was our waiter and he was probably the best waiter we've had at an Olive Garden. He was nice as can be to us and really sweet to my friends two year old daughter. The food was delicious but it's the customer service that really stuck with us. Next time we dine here, we'll definitely be requesting to sit in his section."}
{"text":"I went 3 days ago ... it was lunch time but no wait . Service was good. Food was okay. Everything was okay I might come back."}
{"text":"People always make fun of the Olive Garden, and I never understood why. But guess what? Now I get it! The other night I brushed my teeth for about a half hour and headed over to Olive Garden for dinner. I took one bite and suddenly all the Olive Garden jokes made sense to me. EVERYTHING at this place tastes like toothpaste. It's CRAZY!!! Neverending breadsticks? Yeah that's great if you like toothpaste bread. Ugh, and the pasta? That stuff tastes just like toothpaste. It feels so good to finally understand why everybody's always making fun of this place. Talked to some friends about it the other night. \"Hey guys I went to Olive Garden for the first time.\" I told em. They all laughed and said things like \"ewwwwww\" \"gross!\" and \"don't EVEN get me started!\" I chuckled and said \"I know right? If I wanted to eat toothpaste I'd just eat a tube of toothpaste!\" They said \"huh?\" One star for this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service from a waitress here, who kept forgetting that we were even seated. Since then, I have been back and there are new people working, and the service seems to have gotten better. Will try to stop by again and see if everything will be upheld in consistency. Old review I didn't finish and was a 1 star, raised from my second visit. Keep at it guys/girls!"}
{"text":"Well, that was certainly an experience. Hubby & I are Olive Garden regulars (like once a week) & dine at various locations in the valley. We typically sit in the bar because the service is extra prompt & the bartenders are always on point with service. Well, we went in on the evening of 8/21 & were served by Crystal, the baryender. I would never throw someone under the bus like that normally, but it was truly that awful. She literally hated us. It was so incredibly awkward, it was hard to sit through. She gave us zero service to the point where a server/bartender assisting in the bar had to close our tab & getting to go items from kitchen after seeing us sitting there for so long unattended with her a few feet away. She was right there during this entire time so it certainly wasn't like she was too slammed to acknowledge us for the almost 2 hours we sat in front of her. I mean, think about it...how hard do you have to try to avoid someone sitting at the bar right in front of you even if you are busy making drinks? We certainly weren't rude to her or deserving of how she treated us. In fact, we are regulars! We are actually the easiest type of customer! Well after being there for 2 hours, being ignored and clearly not wanted, I felt Olive Garden owed me money, but we paid and even tipped an undeserving 10% (normally we do 30%). Afterall, we sit in the bar to be in and out in a quick fashion with spot on service. Also, on a side note, as we left a woman at hostess stand (not in uniform so presumably a manager) thanked us for coming in and while she's saying that, I look to make eye contact & reciprocate only to see her speaking to us while looking in the kitchen. Who provides training for these people?! I normally wouldn't nitpick that greeting, but after the incredibly awkward, unwelcoming 2 hours I just had, it sealed the deal for me. Needless to say, Crystal truly ruined our evening and there is no excuse for it."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience EVER!! My husband and I, along with my sister-in-law and her daughters, went her for my sister-in-law's birthday. We were told the wait time would be 40 minutes. That was the biggest lie ever. We didn't get seated for an hour and a half. The manager, who did offer to pay for drinks and appetizers, was rude and insulting the whole time. He even squelched on paying for the drinks. This is not the place to go if you don't want to wait outside forever. The worst part is there was no handicap parking and my husband had to walk a long way to the restaurant. The hostesses kept telling us ten minutes, but it was obvious they didn't care if we sat or not. The food was adequate. It took us a half an hour to get breadsticks because they didn't have any ready. Overall, I would never  go back to this location."}
{"text":"Olive Garden locations tend to generally all be the same and one rarely stands out from another. The food is decent, the service is adequate, the prices are reasonable.

We met a friend for lunch here today and was surprised to find it packed at 1:00 on a Saturday. There was actually a 20 minute wait. The restaurant was clean and well lit but incredibly loud. My two guests had the unlimited soup and salad and I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken with tortelloni. We were asked if we wanted the soup and entree served at the same time and despite saying yes they were both on their second bowl of soup by the time my entree showed up. The salad and breadsticks here are always consistently good. Today was no exception. My entree was flavorful and there was plenty of it. They both said their gnocchi soup was delicious but refills were slow for both the soup and the drinks. The service could have moved along a bit quicker but we were in no rush so it wasn't an issue today."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was adequate.  What turned me off was when the person was setting the table beside us for the next group one of the napkins rolled around the silverware fell on the floor.  The person picked it up and then looked around and evidently thought no one saw and then proceeded to put it at one of the places.  I told our waiter about it so they could discreetly replace all the napkins as I did not know where she put it.  He said they would take care of it but when we paid about five minutes later nothing was done.  A waitress had taken their order in the meantime.  Seeing nothing was being done I told the patrons at that table.  We then left as we were finished.  I do not know what happened but am sure we will not return."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby decided to have a date night so we opted for Olive Garden since it's one of our faves!! I mean, c'mom salad, breadsticks and wine? Count me in. We visit this location more frequently then other locations. Every visit we have had at the Happy Valley location the food is always spot on and service is great! A special thanks to Andrew who made our evening so special and memorable I will always ask for him as my server if he's working! We obviously got salad and breadsticks and some appetizers to start and then for our entrees I got the steak Gorgonzola and hubby got the basic spaghetti with meat sauce. So yummy!! The steak was cooked to perfection. Then for dessert we got the Tiramisu. I'm a sucker for anything that taste like coffee! I definitely see a lot more date nights here in the near future!"}
{"text":"Kinda Decent service today. Had lunch.  Delicious lasagna fritta  and fried ravioli and fried mushrooms. 
Only downside bread was cold and stale. 
But it kept me from eating too much so not necessarily a bad thing. 

Anna brought salad and breadsticks before we ordered. 
We only ordered appetizers for our entrees. 
At the end of the meal we paid on the table apparatus   
Her appearance at our table had been spotty at best but luckily another server was around. 
She asked if we had paid. We said yes. 
She said in a huff...\"In the future know there will be an extra charge for the salad since we didn't order what they label as entrees\". And walked off never to be seen. 
We didn't order a salad OR Breadsticks  for that matter. She brought them. 
To get that upset over lettuce and to assume we were deceitful was ridiculous. Wish I could get back my generous tip. 
Not sure if we will be back to OG and def not to this location."}
{"text":"I have been to this Olive Garden a number of times over the past 20 years. It's Olive Garden, so the food is generally good but not great. I prefer local Italian places over changes, but my family is a fan of chains.

My most recent trip was for my mom's birthday (her 2nd choice after she found out her first choice was closed for the night). I was not thrilled with her choice, but it was her birthday.

The good thing is they were running their 2 entrees and 2 apps for $25 deal. For apps we got the fried mozzarella and fried calamari. My parents got a dipping sauce and toasted ravioli. The mozzarella was a little too thick and the calamari was a tad under done. My parents' apps were decent.

For entrees I got the spaghetti and meatballs and my wife got the eggplant Parmesan. As soon as they set down my plate, I could tell my spaghetti was over cooked. I knew I wouldn't be getting al dente pasta at Olive Garden but I was hoping not to get mushy noodles. The meatballs were okay but nothing special. My wife was quite happy with her eggplant parm.

I think mushy noodles are pretty inexcusable. Hence the two star rating."}
{"text":"Came for a business lunch with two others today. The three of us were seated rather quickly and offered a free sample of wine, which we declined. 

Our server, claiming it was his first week, was really the lowlight of the visit. Clearly he had either been with Olive Garden for years or was just plain whacked. His antics were cute for the first one-to-two minutes but he never stopped with the jokes, sarcasm and childish behavior. 

We each ordered our entrées, along with the calamari app to share. The calamari comes with two dipping sauces: ketchup and thousand. My lunch, which was Soup, Salad and Breadsticks, was excellent as always. 

Olive Garden is always a solid lunch spot, especially for a quick bite in the working corridor. The server tho?  He has got to go."}
{"text":"First return visit. Sat in the cafe/bar again. Waited 10 mins for a server to show up. Meanwhile six other parties sat down in the area, also waiting for service. 

After 10 mins, the server arrived with someone's salad. He dropped it off and then headed back into the kitchen without acknowledging anyone. 

I blew and went down the street."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.The service is Always excellent and the food delicious. It comes to the table hot and is attractive to look at. The portions are big and I usually take half of my order home for another meal. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I do like Olive Garden it's always very clean and the food is good.  I also love spending family birthdays or events here."}
{"text":"None of my stars go to our server; he did not even send water to the table or acknowledge us at all for at least 10 mins, and we constantly watched him standing around and just chatting with other servers after we asked for something like ranch, soda refill, dessert or the check. The other server seemed to be taking care of her tables in a much more timely fashion... My stars go to the manager, who comped the entire meal when we complained that the server was being sooo slow, not to mention he only had 2 [possibly 3] tables that he was [not] taking care of! And its not like we ordered apps & entrees... just the soup/salad lunch!

Then the server had the nerve to shoot us dirty looks after I complained. I wouldn't have complained had I not seen you standing around doing nothing more than 3 times, your fault not mine that you get in trouble for it!

* we just went back yesterday for soup salad lunch again, sat in bar area, service was impeccable!  Funny that we saw that [lazy] server from our last visit...... sitting on his phone, surprise surprise!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on NEW YEARS DAY and got incredibly fast and pleasant service!  Food was delicious and consistent as always. Really appreciate that."}
{"text":"First time back since the long overdue remodel. The restaurant itself is very nice.  Service however is still severe lacking.  We came in around 11:30, just before he lunch rush to get a table for 2.  There were 4 people at the Kiosk where you check in.  After being forgotten about and watching 3 tables get seated that came in after us someone finally noticed and commented that we were still sitting there.  She apologized and took us to our table. I commented that I thought we were forgotten about and her response was \"yeah\" and that was it.  The table was still sticky from the people before and again just \"sorry\" and wiped it down.  The food was ok.  Apparently they were having an off day because 3 tables around us complains that the food was wrong or some other issues.  Our food was right, we just had one of the new lunch combos.  However I don't like the new menu setups either. At lunch you apparently only get the limited \"lunch\" menu and it had been a while since we have been there.  There are no descriptions on the menu, and there were newer options we hadn't seen before. Our server was new and admitted they didn't really know the menu so we winged it.  Overall I'm glad we had a gift card.  I'll let them work out some more bugs before we try again."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my best friend and our server, Victoria, was the sweetest. Olive Garden is always are go to lunch spot and this was my first time at this location. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden so you never go in with high expectations, this is how you prevent heart break. Service is okay, the food is okay and the environment is okay. Before we were seated, I stopped into the restrooms and was completely disgusted at what I saw;   that was seriously the best appetite suppressant anyone could ask for. Moral of the story, only eat here if no other options exist and use the restroom at home before you make a trip over here"}
{"text":"Wow has this place slipped. I ordered the trio you see on tv.  Instead of the big bowl of ravioli they show on the commercial I got 3 measly pieces.  The chicken Alfredo tasted like a bad tv dinner over microwaved.  

Bread was good as was the second salad.  The first had almost no mix ins or dressing on it.   

Ive had worse, but not much.    With so many Italian places out there, this one is off the list."}
{"text":"I tried to go once with my friend and we were 15 mins late. Closing time. The second time was last night, a Friday night, and we made it around 830pm. It was surprisingly extremely busy when we walked in. In an effort to be seated as quick as possible we opted for a table in the back of the cafe. 

Its Olive Garden. I like it. Not love it. Although the cafe was way too bright! The lights in the back reflected off of the white spackled wall which just killed any chance of dinner ambiance. And we waited a long time for a server to just bring us waters. Although she was overly nice, maybe in an effort to overly compensate. Regardless her service was actually very satisfactory by the end of the evening. 

Decent drinks. I had Pinot Noir and she had Moscato. Food good as well. My choice, Tilapia over angel hair. Her choice--the usual, cheese ravioli with marinara. Can't go wrong when you know what you like. 

It turned out to be the perfect spot. Separated from the rest of the loud restaurant, out of the public eye, and a cute cafe-style table. 

Its Olive Garden... do what you will."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Olive Garden since I moved to Las Vegas from a desert town in California and decided to minor in Italian Studies. I'm not a snob, but Vegas has so many amazing Italian restaurants that my professors recommended. Olive Garden just wasn't on my list.

So it's been ten years since I went to an Olive Garden. A few months ago my kind mother gave me an Olive Garden giftcard. My husband and I put off going there until yesterday, when I heard about a buy an entree and get one to take home deal. So off we went.

First of all, we were shocked by the portions. We were pretty much satiated on a few breadsticks and the soup. Then the enormous portions came around. The food itself was decent, and they had a few vegetarian options. I had the cheese ziti, and my husband had the seafood brodetto. 

The service wasn't bad, although they were busy so it was a bit of a wait for seeing our waitress. She did an admirable job keeping our glasses and breadstick basket full.

So if you're looking for large quantities of food that's predictable in quality, go here. If you are craving local Italian food check out String's or Nora's."}

{"text":"My beautiful family was trying to seat 25+ in our group at Olive Gardens (the number initially was 32+). We waited an hour and a half and still wasn't seated. After speaking to management and learning they weren't actually setting up our table, 11 of us left. Before we left management was fully aware of us knowing their v review was already bad and we were about to kill their ratings. My group that left has gone to Red Robin, already seated, and drinks and appetizers already ordered. Thankfully the manager is personally seating the remaining of he 14 in our family. Thank you cousin for trying to do this for the family. You definitely didn't have control of this. This was one of the worst customer services I've had in a very long time. I drank two glasses of wine. My grandson needed water and my sick mom needed bread and water while waiting. I would not recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy. The management was aware I and my family is about to leave a bad review."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat, hot food, good service."}
{"text":"I do not know what is going on at this particular restaurant.  Twice in the past month, I have walked into the restaurant and it stunk so badly, a combination of bad seafood and bad produce.  The first time, it smelled bad and we left.  Last night, we walked in and turned around and was gagging on the way out.  We didn't even make it to the podium, the odor was absolutely horrible.  I guess there is a reason why there was hardly anybody in the parking lot.  We walked over to Red Lobster, seafood, no smell."}
{"text":"Last Friday we ordered Curb side because of a monsoon rolling in. I will never do that again. I love this place but apparently the food to~go doesn't get the same amount of love as when you dine in. My stuffed mushrooms & calamari were okay but the tour of Italy sucked. My alfredo was so gross. I didn't touch the chicken parm or the lasagna."}
{"text":"You know what you're going to get when you go to an Olive Garden. The food was good and it came out quickly. The staff was friendly and make sure my drink was always full. Overall a good experience and always had breadsticks on the table."}
{"text":"A friend gave us a gift card so we stopped by last night for dinner. It was a little after 7 on a Friday night and we were seated in under 5 minutes. Everyone was very friendly and the breadsticks were delicious as usual. Our meals were fine...nothing unique or amazing but it was a solid meal. I had the chicken Marsala and they were very accommodating in swapping out the roasted potatoes for mashed. My husband enjoyed his pasta and my son had spaghetti with a meatball. Dinner came to $40 before the tip which was not unreasonable. By the time you get through the salad, breadsticks and your meal you walk out of there stuffed!

We went back today for a late lunch/early dinner and for what turned out to be a very long meal. My chicken piccata came out as chicken parmigiana so I had to wait for a new entree while everyone else ate. My husband ordered the unlimited soup and salad and everyone else was done with their meal by the time they brought out his second bowl soup that he had asked for and we had already paid the bill by the time they brought out the refill on the breadsticks we had asked for before the entrees arrived. The food was ok but the service was way off tonight."}
{"text":"We came in on Christmas eve at 10 minutes before closing. The frontdesk didn't seem to be too happy but she said she'll take us in anyway. She warned us that if for any reason we to step out then we wont be let back in. I thought our evening will be ruined. We were hungry and didn't want to risk dragging two kids out in the cold.

To our surprise the rest of the staff inside were great. Our server (I forgot her name) was very gracious. She gave us time to choose and enjoy our meal. The food was served quickly, the main course came out right after the appetize was served.  Our server apologized for it and we said we actually appreciate the quick service because the kids are already hungry. 
There were still occupied tables of dinners finishing their meals. None of them seemed to have been hurried/rushed by their servers and neither did we.

We appreciate that so much considering that it was Christmas eve and they were already closing. With that we left a good amount of tip for their excellent customer service. Merry christmas!"}
{"text":"I placed an order online August 25th, my pick up time was around 9:50pm, I didn't realize how far this place was from my home. I probably picked up my food around 10:20pm. I got home, and my food wasn't fresh. I've ordered from Olive Garden several times and never experienced such bad pasta. It tasted like it's been sitting out for hours. I wasn't concerned about the temperature of the food as I was a bit late picking it up. The fettuccini noodles were so hard and chewy as if they were undercooked. The sauce was so thick and bland. My breadsticks were hard but that was expected because again I was late. Thankfully my salad was fresh. I'm pretty sure my food is old due to closing time at 11pm which was just unacceptable. I contacted a supervisor on duty, \"Long Dang\", I explained the issue and in the beginning he asked several unrelated questions as I did provide my order number and first and last name, which should be an easy find because this order was placed online. He then told me, my food was old because I was late picking it up and claim they've contacted me several times which him and I both know is bullshit. I don't have the best service but I know when someone calls, anyways he tried covering for his employees which is normal I guess. After   he offered to remake the pasta, I declined because at this point you've made me feel uncomfortable and I am not interested in ever eating at this location again. I told Long I will bring in the food and would like a refund. He agreed and apologized. Long seemed genuine by the end of the conversation. He assured I would receive a full refund and I did not have to bring in the food. I will give 3 stars because the situation was handled professionally and this is by far one of my favorite restaurants although I've received old food at this location. I suggest if you're ordering from this location to dine in for fresh food."}
{"text":"A good place for consistent dining and food. Service was great. Or server always made sure we had bread and drinks. She even brought us out a to go cup to take back to work. I love the buy one get one special. Mostly because by the time I eat the salad and brad sticks I am full. Luckily I live leftovers."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for our server Brooke D. She was absolutely amazing. She went above and beyond to serve our table. We were a table of 5. We had come to try the $8.99 Mon-Thur special but because we had to wait so long in line we missed it. Rather than just saying no she went out of her way to find out if we can still get the special. Unfortunately we couldn't but the manager on duty did offer us a discount on our dinner. Brooke noticed we had two children with us so she attended to them and was such a pleasure to have as a waitress. We never waited for anything. Our drinks never went empty. it was the best service ever. Thank you Brooke you made our night very delightful."}
{"text":"Worst Olive Garden experience ever.
Tasteless food. The bartender was friendly but so busy that it was hard to get any service. One server was leaning backwards in the bar window and his dreads were nearly in some kid's apple juice. Gross."}
{"text":"Horrible service I've been to this Olive Garden numerous times and the service I received today was so bad I walked out. I usually request for JASON and from now on if he isn't working I will not do business at this location. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This Olive Garden had great service. The drinks were delicious and the food didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"An Olive Garden is an Olive Garden anywhere you go. Service is always decent, BUT if you come to this location and get a server named IVORY, your dining experience will be relaxed and without want. Not once did I need to ask for anything other than place my order. Every need/ want was anticipated and delivered BEFORE I felt the need to ask. My Coca Cola was replaced before my straw found the bottom half inch of beverage. My endless salad bowl was never empty. We had more bread sticks than we could shake a stick at. 

At other Olive Gardens in Cali, the wait time for a beverage refill, more bread or a salad can be horrible. That lag can make the difference in how relaxing and enjoyable your meal is going to be. 

As usual, the food was great. And we sure appreciated the air conditioning that rescued us from the Las Vegas heat. However, nothing can make up for bad service, a thing you will not find here. 

Service is key. Many restaurants are lacking and need to take notice!"}
{"text":"Sarah was fantastic. What great service, Larry the manager also came around and made sure everything was great....   I was amazed by the wonderful service."}
{"text":"What can I say, its Olive Garden! I enjoy their food and never had a bad experience here. It's about the same as any other Olive Garden, sometimes there's a bit of a wait for a table."}
{"text":"This is probably the one restaurant in Pittsburgh we have never had an issue with. We are always seated right away and the waitstaff is always excellent. The food is always good and what you expect from OG. This is the main location we visit but we have also been to other OGs in the area and the service and food is always good. I know some don't care for chain restaurants but I think OG is the best of this category. This location in particular is great. We never hesitate to go there. Highly recommend if you want good service and good food."}
{"text":"Dirtiest OG I have ever seen, sloppy service and nobody helped. Like there was no manager there"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted some italian and shes been craving Olive Garden so we took the 20 minute drive over to this location.

We sat at the bar and was immdiately greeted. The bartender was very nice and helpful. We both decided on the buy one take one but we added meat (chicken and meatballs) to the food we were eating at the location. It was a extra 3 bucks each but not bad for two full meals each. We both ended up taking leftovers plus our take one meal. I like this location the best.

We ordered wine Roscato and I am not a red wine drinker but it was really good. We thought about buying a bottle but at $25.00 no way, we ended up going to Total Wine and got a bottle for $12.00."}
{"text":"MAX MAX MAX! He's your guy! He took care of my husband and I! We went on a small dinner date and Max was super attentive, funny and friendly. From now on I'm going to ask if he's working :) my husband dinner was a little dry and before he could say anything Max was like \"oh no you need some more sauce\" so he went above and beyond."}
{"text":"Darden Restaurants has recently made a renewed effort to improve the offerings of their Italian inspired Olive Garden. 

We were so impressed, we might be back soon. Really. 

Given the likes of Macaroni Grill, Johnny Carino, Carrabba, Buca di Beppo, Spaghetti Factory (to some extent Margiano's), they have all been stealing market share away from Olive Garden, the so called king of Americanized Italian food. 

Tired of being a late night comedy punching bag, Darden recently made a wholesale upgrades to their menu and I believe brought out their \"A Game\". http://investor.darden.com/m/#deepLink/%7B%22view%22%3A%22PressReleaseDetails%22%2C%22languageId%22%3A%221%22%2C%22itemId%22%3A%225f329c57-9e8f-469a-8482-758db3cc9d1f%22%2C%22year%22%3A%222014%22%7D. 

If you have somehow missed the differentiation for some of these Italian themed concepts, both Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill aim for a higher demo group. And not a lot has changed over the last ten years since the Times wrote: 

\"Carrabba's Italian Grill and Romano's Macaroni Grill, are both far behind Olive Garden in the full-service Italian restaurants... Although both chains are significantly smaller and are outspent by Olive Garden, they aim at a somewhat different customer: one who is willing to spend a bit more on a meal. Reflecting that higher-end positioning, Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill both used chefs to promote their brand.\" http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/25/business/media-business-advertising-spots-for-carrabba-s-macaroni-grill-try-pull-away.html 

Clearly there's no shortage of opinions regarding which one of these concepts are your favorite. http://www.disboards.com/archive/index.php/t-2641561.html. 

So with all this in mind, we decided to give this former Pillsbury concept another try.  

We arrive on a Friday night around seven-fifteen. Most of the families with small kids were just finishing their entrees. This restaurant actually has a section in the back, cordoned off from the regular patrons for families. Nice. 

We were seated pretty quickly. Our waitress Rebbecca greeted us, asked us about drinks and if we wanted water with our meal. 

One of their menu items, is a choice of six or nine ounce carafes of their house wines.  Rebbecca offered us a tasting from the bottle of Riesling she brought to our table. Clever marketing, very clever. 

We decided to share a 9 oz carafe, skipping appetizers and starting with their famous never ending Salad Bowl (see photo). It's still including in the price of your dinner btw, or soup if you prefer.

My friend Marvin A wrote about Olive Garden as...  \"Their Dreck will not make you ill. It'll simply remind you ...... what BLAH Drive-In Dreck taste like. SpaghettiOs® would of been a welcomed sight, last night.\" 

Prior to this evening's experience, we would have tended to agree.  

But the Italian Trio (photo) and Grilled Chicken (photo) were tasty and just as good the next day when we reheated them. LOL

In many ways, Olive Garden is still just a safe, standby type of place. But as you might have noticed, this is a Four Star review. Clearly Darden wants to be taken seriously and this is their best effort to date. 

So is Olive Garden better than Romano's Macaroni Grill, or Carrabba's? True-fully, I don't know. But we had a nice time and the food was good. 

So Four Stars and expect to pay around $30.00 each"}
{"text":"My wife and her co-workers went here for lunch.   While there my wife saw this sign inside their front door.  That took us back there for dinner.   When asked,  Kenzie, our waitress said we could not get this deal since it was on the board from yesterday.  No one cleaned it.   After dinner,  asked for manager,  who never came. We left disappointed."}
{"text":"Came up here about an hour before close. Only a few tables in house and another couple walked in the same time we did.  Our server finally comes to the table after standing around with 2 other servers  about 15 minutes after we were seated. He gives us a bit of attitude and takes our drink order. The table next to us mentions hes not a good server. We order our dinner and he brings us the salad bowl and instead of setting it down he just plops it down and some of the lettuce falls out and he just shrugs and walks away. Not great service at all. From there we were pretty fed up and decided that we would rather go next door then deal with this guy. Canceled our entrees and left."}
{"text":"A very unfortunate experience. 1. The greeter had to get the attention of the seating host because she was visiting in the corner 2. Servers were yelling things to eachother over our heads 3. A wine glass was dropped and broke right behind us 4. Our server seemed really preoccupied 5. Meal was just ok. With all the choices in Vegas, I won't be back to Olive Garden. :-("}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at Olive Garden.  Decided to treat myself and my boyfriend after a long week. Our server Shyanne was an absolute delight.  She was prompt with our food and was very polite and friendly throughout the meal.  The manager on duty Joe made sure we were well taken care of and checked on us and other patrons often.  The food never disappoints and our wait was less than 5 minutes (come early as this place is popular).  Would highly recommend and we will be back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with wifey on Monday.  All-in-all, it was OK.  We opted for the 2 for $25 meal.  We got two appetizers instead of one dessert.  The AYCE bread sticks and salad bowl is still basically the same and pretty good.  But they don't put any Romaine in the salad anymore, just iceberg lettuce.  I guess this is to save money.

The appetizers we choose were fried calamari and fried zucchini.  Both were not very good -- they were not fresh made and were the pre-made, frozen in the bag stuff.  So the appetizers were not-so-good.

My wife ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and meat sauce and I ordered the smoked Parmesan chicken entree.  My wife's entree was of good size and the meat sauce was hearty and good tasting.  They gave her two big meatballs too.  We both thought that her meal was more than adequate.  When I got my entree, I started to eat and then I started to think.......I said to my wife, why don't they call this dish Fettuccine Alfredo with a grilled chicken breast, instead of smoked Parmesan chicken.  Just then our server came over with a plate which was my smoked Parmesan chicken and said the kitchen gave her the wrong entree, and if I wanted she had what I ordered.  I told her that what I had was fine and she said OK, and that my Alfredo was a better deal for me since it is not on the list of choices for the 2 for $25 meals.  So I guess I made out here.  My wife said I should have told her that wanted the smoked Parmesan chicken entree too, and maybe we could take it home for our three girls (dogs) to eat.

Oh yeah, I ordered the big glass (9 0z.) of wine and that was $10.  The wine was terrible --- I am sure the retail price of a bottle of this two buck chuck couldn't have been more than $2.99 for the whole bottle.  Why is it that I never learn?  This kind of establishment always has crappy wines.  Even if you order a whole bottle off their wine list, the best you can expect is mediocre wine at best."}
{"text":"We were here for our typical Friday night dinner outting. We arrived at 5pm and still had a 30 minute wait. Not too surprised. It was very busy, but we were seated in about 25 minutes. I had the steak gorgonzola fettuccine. The steak tasted funny and as removed from my plate. Now the pasta on the other hand was WONDERFUL!! It had sun dried tomatoes, spinach, and a delicious gorgonzola sauce. I could of eaten that for the whole meal. Our waiter was very attentive and noticed that I had taken the steak off my plate. He asked if there was a problem and I told him the steak tasted bland and just wasn't really good. He immediately had the manager to the table and he was anxious to replace it with chicken, shrimp,or to recook another steak. I opted for the shrimp and I had hot fresh grilled shrimp to the table in about 4 minutes. I have always been a fan of the OG, and the great food and super service will guarantee my return."}
{"text":"Was quite amazed that on a Friday night our receptionist told us the wait was about 10 minutes. Ten minutes later we were being seated at our table. Nice! After that it kind of went downhill. Took about 5 minutes for a waiter to get our drink order. He also took our meal order at the same time. We all were having the great $8.95 endless pasta. Now if you have been to O.G. you know they have great soup, salad. and breadsticks. We were very hungry and it took 10 minutes to get the soups,salad, and the breadsticks. The salad was way over dressed to the point it was soggy. The breadsticks were semi-hard. I don't know how that's possible when it's so busy in there, but what do I know? Anyways, we had our soups, and salad for about 3 minutes and the waiter brings out our pasta! Now the table is so overcrowed with dishes it's hard to eat. Now that was the bad. The good......well it's O.G. The pasta was on point. It was served hot and it was good! The great thing that our waiter did was to grind the cheese that they usually grind over the salad,soup,and pasta onto a plate. What can I say, I LOVE cheese and I had more than enough! I usually ask the waiter to grind cheese onto my pasta until his arm hurts. LOL. Well this new way I got to put as much(maybe more) cheese on my food. Great move!"}
{"text":"I haven't made it to my seat yet, and will most likely amend my review...  But the atrocious treatment we have received so far is very disheartening to say the least... Stay tuned for more."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with my experience at Olive Garden. I took my boyfriend there for lunch, and I usually order their Make Your Own Pasta, because of how cheap it is ($9.99) and all the options. You can choose the kind of pasta you want, the type of sauce, and you can add meat if you want as well. Before my pasta arrived, the salad and breadsticks were brought to the table. I really enjoyed the salad because the dressing is tossed with the salad as you order it, so it does not arrive soft and soggy. The salad had a nice crunch and everything in it was fresh, the tomatoes, olives, onions, etc. The breadsticks were delicious as they arrived hot wrapped in napkins. They were soft when I bit into them and warm, and I would use them to dip in my pasta's marinara sauce. I ordered the regular spaghetti noodles, the traditional marinara sauce, and three large meatballs, a pretty basic entrée but a classic. When my spaghetti arrived the plate was steaming and it smelled amazing. The noodles were cooked to the perfect al dente. The marinara sauce was delicious, and they did not serve me so much that it drowned my noodles. It was the right amount to where there was a taste of it in every bite. I liked that it also didn't have an overwhelming taste of tomatoes, and that there were other spices included in the sauce. The meatballs were covered in the sauce and were cooked all the way through. They also had a nice crisp on the outside. I also ordered their strawberry limeade drink, and it came in this tall glass with a large, fresh strawberry on the rim. I never had that drink before, and when I tried it, it was the perfect combination of a sweet strawberry taste with a bit of a sour tang. 

The atmosphere of Olive Garden was very calming I think because of their soothing jazz playlist, not something you hear every day on the radio. The décor really makes you feel as if you're in a vineyard somewhere in Italy. Our seating was comfortable, as we had a booth next to a window. I liked that we were not seated in a corner by ourselves, rather around other people enjoying lunch. 

I cannot quite remember her name, but our server was kind and very prompt at bringing our food and drinks out. She always made sure that our drinks weren't empty and that we had enough cheese on our salad and pasta. She also made small talk, asked us about our day and our plans, which you could tell she went out of her way to do. We used the tablet on the table to pay for our check, which is rarely over $50, even with the tip. Eating at Olive Garden is affordable for the quality of Italian food you receive as well as the portions you receive. And who doesn't love their mints?"}
{"text":"Clean, and didn't smell moldy like some OG'a do. Our waitress was attentive and we never wanted anything -- she stayed on top of it all. Eggplant Parmigiana was a little over fried. However the portion was huge, and we should have split it - enough for 2."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice people and we had 5 people and the wait was less than 3 minutes during dinner on wednsday. Great place to eat. Great service and amazing salad! Bottomless salad. Yum!"}
{"text":"Hands down best experience ever. 

We got here about 9 p.m. - we had had A long day and we were  starving but didn't want to eat too heavy so we opted for the soup, salad, breadsticks. We ordered our food at the same.time as our drinks. 
Priscilla brought us out our drinks and a minute later all our food and was so polite and friendly and anticipated our refills before we could ask.

Best Olive Garden ever!  We r from California and the customer service at the OG we visit  does not compare.

Thank you, Priscilla!"}
{"text":"Our meal was super good. We used the deal 2 entrees for 12$. One that you eat at the restaurant and the second one that you can take home. It was delicious and the server was really nice."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm reviewing another chain restaurant. I've decided that there are a select few that warrant patronizing, especially for lunch. My last four lunches at Olive Garden (I had to exhaust a $100 gift card) have been a solid 3.5-4.5 stars. Hey, you have to give them credit for actually making iceberg lettuce taste good!! 

So, I met a girlfriend here for lunch today and we had a great meal and were not made to feel guilty for a hogging a booth for a full two hours. As always, the salad arrived fresh, salad bowls nicely chilled and bread sticks warm and buttery :) I proceeded to eat three full bowls of salad...I swear their croutons actually tasted homemade today, I must have been imaging it, but they were a nice touch. She had the Eggplant Parmigiana and was able to substitute fresh asparagus, broccoli and chopped tomatoes for the pasta. It looked delicious. I had the Capellini Pomodoro which, according to our fabulous waiter, was \"one of the healthiest things on the menu\" (I'm planning to splurge at Filiberto's tomorrow!). It seriously tastes very fresh and healthy (love fresh basil) and I couldn't finish it all.   I have to give honerable mention to the Chicken Alfredo Pizza which was ordered by my dining companion on a previous visit.  Although it probably contains more than 2,000 calories, it is AMAZING....if they don't give you enough buttery, creamy alfredo sauce on the pizza itself, they include a side order for dipping...YUMM!!!

Overall, great service, nice atmosphere and VERY good food. I'm just sorry that they're related to Red Lobster, what a shame. I will be back for sure....maybe soup and salad next time?"}

{"text":"(This is a follow up to a review on the 75th Ave Bell location.) After a horrible ordeal at the other restaurant we arrived at this location. We were happily greeted upon entering the door by several staff members making us feel so welcomed. The restaurant felt so warm and inviting a complete change from where we had come from. The place was packed but was not chaotic and uninviting like the other location. The staff here were busy minding their stations and greeting the guest as they walked by not standing in groups gossiping like the other place. We were promptly seated and briefly mentioned our experience and it is now pushing 5 o'clock. Taylor our waitress was so nice and went and got her manager and asked if I could get my soup at the lunch price because of what happen. Lynne came over to talk to us and after explaining what happen she graciously offered to buy us our dinner to make up for the whole thing. Now this is what I call being a stellar manager. Even though it was not her mistake to correct she went above and beyond restoring her company's reputation with us. As we sat and ate and laughed and had a good time we couldn't help but notice how the staff worked together to make sure all tables were taken care of and that the guest had what they needed. There were no employees hanging about or looking like they were miserable being at work. All of the staff members looked like they took pride in themselves before showing up to work unlike the disheveled mess we saw at the Bell location. Even the atmosphere was happier and the patrons all seemed to be enjoying themselves. All I can say is there was a huge difference in the way this restaurant operated and it showed. Taylor our waitress was outstanding and on point with her service and even went out of her way to write us a little thank you note at the end of our meal. I can not explain in words what an amazing experience we had coming from where we came from and for that I thank Lynn, Taylor and all the staff at this location . I will no longer be going back to the Bell location and will be making this location my new home for Olive Garden. I highly recommend eating at this location if you want great service."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with this review but I will say the one star is too high of a rating considering my experience. My mom and I met up for a late lunch arriving at 3:30ish and were seated next to the busy chaotic kitchen. I had a bad feeling about sitting in this area but went with the flow as not to be a Debbie downer. 3 months ago my mom had left her glasses behind so she asked the woman who sat us if she knew if anybody had ever turned them in by any chance. The woman was very rude with her response and I tried to brush it off. Then our waitress came by and took our drink order and promptly brought us our water. As she was about to take our order another waitress walks up to her and tells her very rudely I'm here to take over your shift....and something else I can't remember now. So the new waitress takes our order without introducing herself and with the shittiest whatever attitude and just walks away while I was still talking to her. At this point I am ready to walk out but my mom is talking to the manager and trying to find out what the hell is wrong with the wait staff. The manager assures my mom he will have a chat with the girls with the bad attitude so we decide to stay. We are both trying to be positive and let things go but then my mom caught about 6 of the waitresses talking about us on her way back to our table from a ladies room break. They never even noticed she passed right by them and they continued on making faces and staring at us from the middle of the restaurant. I am now full on uncomfortable, irritated and losing my appetite and I don't lose it very easily let me tell you. So now my back is tensing up and hurting and I am having a lot of anxiety and another waitress walks up and ask me if I am ok. I tell her no and let her know about the ghetto gossiping bitches and she tries to tell me they weren't talking about us. My mom then tells her that she knows how to read lips having had two deaf extended family members and her response was oops oh. I guess she went and told a different manager something because then he came out to talk to us and he too agrees to chat with the wait staff.  Now you probably think it couldn't get any worse IT DOES! We had finally received our food and I was just about to take my first bite of food and one of the gossiping girls passed by with a big tray of dirty dishes and dishing out some dirty looks at us as well. Well needless to say the dummy dropped all the dishes. I had little shards of glass on the front of my shirt and I am sure some went in our food. One very nice waitress came and apologized and told us she was going to make all of our food fresh because glass had gone everywhere but that was the last straw. We got up and walked out and went to the Olive Garden at Metro (my review for them will be on their page). I can not believe through all of that the managers did not try to even make the situation better they just let us leave upset. I will be calling corporate on Monday because something needs to be done about the ghetto girls they have working there. My suggestion is steer clear of this Olive Garden if you are looking to have a nice experience."}
{"text":"Food was alright but seems like the portions got a lot smaller. I had the Northern Tour of Italy"}
{"text":"Omg I haven't been to Olive Garden in about 5 years. Sadly must say one of the worse service. It's Mother's Day my server had an attitude. Slamming the plates and throwing the straws. It's a special day my mother wanted to come and eat here. Food took forever. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE what so ever."}
{"text":"Although, I only went for a to go order for lunch this location was by far the best customer service I've ever experienced (including other restaurants as well). I ordered the create your own pasta, which was your choice of noodles, sauce, protein, and came with complimentary salad and breadsticks of course. From the minute i walked in, there was nothing be smiles and polite greetings. After confirming my name, she notified me that the meal was in the hot oven still to make sure it stayed fresh, salad was in a refrigerated area so it could remain cool, and confirmed my order details to make sure everything was made correctly. She even made sure she opened the box for me to have a visual to make sure everything was correct. She offered extra dressings and suggested that I tried their ranch dressing instead of the typical vinaigrette. It seems all so simple but I really appreciated them going over the top just to ensure I was satisfied and tbh it didn't even seem forced like some places do. This is officially my go to lunch spot."}
{"text":"Not too much detail to this cause i feel as if most Olive gardens are the same across the board. I ordered something new though, the Linguine de mare. The server recommended it to me as one of their hidden gems and I must say that I agree. I never even glanced at this item on the menu but i guarantee that will change now. It was a good proportion of food to where I still had another meal the next day. I will say this is obviously not my fav Italian place because I personally prefer something a little more authentic but you can never go wrong with Olive Garden especially this location and I'm sure I will return."}
{"text":"I almost feel embarassed giving this place 4 stars.  It is Olive Garden for crying out loud.  My experiences with Olive Garden in California have always been an exercise in misery.  

Surprisingly this Olive Garden breaks the mold.  The food is respectable, the wines pair fairly well, the waiters are prompt and friendly, and the place is clean.  

Again not all Olive Gardens warrant 4-stars but I guess not all Olive Gardens are created equal."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Olive Garden in while but we had a busy evening planned and decided to go somewhere nearby. We both had the house Rosè. I had the chicken gnocchi soup, which was very flavorful, however, tasted more like chicken and dumplings   soup instead of what I thought gnocchi soup would taste like. Specially since I am obsessed with gnocchi. Either way, still tasty, just not what it's named after. That's just me. Also had the salad and breadsticks of course. Always just perfect for your meal. For the main course I had the steak with veggies. Most times I refuse to order steak at a pasta restaurant but it's a new dish so I'd go for it since you know I'm addicted to steak. It was so delicious. Tender. Super tender. Extremely flavorful and cooked to perfection. I was so impressed. My husband had the chicken scampi which oddly enough is what I always ordered in the past. And this time his plate was plenty of food. In the past we never have leftovers. This was absolutely delicious. He had big pieces of flavored chicken. Plenty of sauce and veggies. Needless to say, this was a great choice for lunch."}
{"text":"The 1st Olive Garden Mom and I have been to that was actually good. Beautifully designed, free wifi-how can you beat free wifi? Well, you can add great customer service and delicious food on, and you create amazing experiences. Everyone from the front to our table was sincerely friendly. Amanda, our hostess, was both friendly and attentive.

And it's in a beautiful location."}
{"text":"Not sure what was going the night my bf and I came here but it was pretty bad. We have been to this location before and received great service. We came her last Thursday night, we got seated right away but it was in the back of the restaurant. We thought it was a little weird to be in the way back with only one other group near us. 
15 minutes passed and our waiter was nowhere to be seen. Finally I had to push the button on their iPad express ordering system to get the waiter to come to our table and he showed up 10 minutes after I pushed the button. The waiter was nice he order our food but I'm not sure if there was a shortage of staff that night but he was taking forever plus it wasn't even busy that night! The waiter brought the first round of bread sticks they were stale, my bf salad looked soggy and my minestrone soup was kind of cold. The second round of bread sticks were actually fresh and my soup was actually warm. It took 30 minutes for our food to arrive at our table. Sadly our food didn't taste very good it was kind of cold. 
 We barely ate our food because we filled up with soup and bread sticks since it took forever to get our main dishes. We wanted to get take out boxes but our waiter again was nowhere to be seen. I paid with the iPad ordering system because we just wanted to leave. Finally the waiter came by and he got us to go boxes. 
 I'm not sure what was going on that night but we have eaten here before and experience great service and delicious meals. This time was really disappointing, I could have made pasta at home! It makes me sad because I love the Olive Garden and the food but this time it was ruined for me. Not sure if it's new management or lack of staff but we will be going to other Italian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Haven't been back to Olive Garden in years and tonight's experience was no different than it has always been - a solid 3 stars.  Probably because it's a chain, but food and service are always consistently okay.  The definite pros are the endless salad and breadsticks and wine sampling offers.  Otherwise, food is the usual mediocre pasta dishes especially if you're like me and get suckered into the Endless Pasta Bowl.  The dessert menu always looks impressive with many choices.  We ordered the cookie butter cake and black tie mousse cake.  They were delectable but overly sweet.  I don't usually take leftover desserts home but I just could not eat that much sweetness.  Server was still in training and great.  Always nice when they pack your leftovers for you. That should give me my Olive Garden fix for the next 3 years."}
{"text":"Celebrating my 31st birthday and it so happens that I lost my ID abut I have all the documentation issued by the DMW and I can't get a glass of wine so I get to see everyone else celebrate with a toast and I get to drink water. Even when I showed everything 3 cards, DMV paperwork, business cards and all and the horrible unpleasant manager said no. Thanks first and last time I eat here."}
{"text":"My wife and have been to this location several times over the years.
Every time we stop in its always busy every day of the week.
Plan on waiting 30-60 minutes to get a table.
Given the fact that this is such a busy location one would think that the management is experienced in providing  an enjoyable dining experience.
However this is not the reality,
I've never eaten a meal here that was prepared correctly or did not take a long time to prepare.
As a result we have received many free or reduced meals. So what is my complaint?
I just want a good meal that is not overlooked, cold,prepared wrong, or takes  an hour to come out.
The last time stopped in my wife's steak was ordered med rare and it came out well done and her veggies were cold and undercooked my egg plant was mush with too much tomato sauce.
Once again we were disappointed and received to old soft shoe as to why our meal was bad.
I wish that the GM at this location would read this review and try to make some changes.
I'll not dine here in the future and instead will go to Zappitelli's where I'll get a good meal and fairly good service."}
{"text":"I visit this location, when I'm in town for business and I can have a soup, salad for lunch, eat and be out the door in 30 minutes. Michael and Amber are amazing behind the bar; they serve you quickly during the lunch hour and they'll chat with you during dinner hour. Today I stopped in for dinner and I had the Salmon Bruschetta. 
It was delicious. Not heavy and full of flavor! Definitely not what I expected from OG.
You can't go wrong with service at this location."}
{"text":"Let me preface my post by saying I am not a fan of mediocre Italian food  (going by the past few times I visited other restaurants in this chain)...

It was a bit late and given the only other option was a McDonald's,  I headed to this restaurant. 

The restaurant had diners,  but had locked the door. I thought the door was stuck.

The people manning the counter kept looking at me but none of them had the decency to even call across to say they were closed  (and walking to the door to tell me that was obviously an alien concept).

I have learned my lesson and would rather starve than set my foot into an Olive Garden restaurant again"}
{"text":"Had the Italian trio last night and it was delicious. 
Service was great!! She was so sweet and aimed to please. 
Everyone in our party was more then happy with our food and service. 
Just one thing....Please turn the lights down or at least point them away from the customers. Way too bright!"}
{"text":"Me and my family come to this location often and never have we been treated this well. Our waiter Justin was insanely nice and helpful, it truly made the experience so much better. Definitely deserves a 5 Star"}
{"text":"Never again! The customer service we had was awful. To think that I wasted my time and money with my family here is disappointing. I don't even want to get into details on how bad the service was.   Olive Garden has forever lost my business."}
{"text":"What is there to say about Olive Garden? It's a chain and you can expect the same food, the same style of service, and the same atmosphere whether you are in Miami, AZ or Miami, FL. This particular store was no exception. Our servers were quite nice and were prompt with the delivery of our food. We had a larger party and they did their best to take care of us. The food was good enough. I had the parmesan crusted tilapia shared with a friend and it was tasty. 

Olive Garden is nothing to really rave about so I guess this is about all I have to say about this..."}
{"text":"It has been about a year since my last visit to this particular OG location. It just doesn't fit in with my lifestyle change and if I can't eat the ravioli portobello, what's the point? But I came here recently with a friend for Soup-Salad-Breadsticks for lunch. I skipped the breadsticks because I can't really have them but the soup and salad were the way they always are. I had the minestrone and the low fat dressing on the side so I can control the calories. Unfortunately, my friend couldn't say the same. She had the grilled chicken caesar salad and asked specifically if the chicken had any breading on it or coating at all and asked for no croutons as she watches her gluten intake. She was told no breading or coating at all on the grilled chicken and no problem about no croutons. What comes out? A piece of breaded chicken with grill marks on it. Fortunately, we got no croutons. The other problem is that our server disappeared after serving us so it was quite a while before she could ask about getting her grilled chicken fixed. Naturally this comes with it's apologies and then a visit from the manager. When the new salad came out, not only was the chicken plainly grilled, but now there were no croutons, no parmesan cheese, and no dressing. :( If I wanted to have another bowl of soup, it wasn't going to be forthcoming. This was a disappointing visit because the manager, Lynn, is super nice and has been here forever. I think it was just a fluke with our server. Either way...a basic visit to have basic food that was less than basic service."}
{"text":"Ever watch those cooking reality shows and think \"holy crap, that chef is waaaaaay too sweaty to be in a kitchen?\"  Yeah, that was totally my waiter.  When he wasn't hovering over me with threat of rain, we were treated to Forrest Gump-esque stories about his Momma and the long line of servers he was descended from.  Other than being a little weird, he was fairly prompt.  Oh, does anyone have any idea why I needed 15 freaking menus for lunch?  I felt like a tourist brochure rack had exploded on our table - and I couldn't find a reason for so much literature at an Olive Garden - unless they are starting a cult.

On to the food!  We split the calamari and the endless soup, salad and bread sticks.  It was a little odd when he brought the soup and salad out before the calamari - but perhaps he figured it was a business lunch and didn't want to hold us up.  The batter on the calamari was perfect!  Sadly, the rings themselves were a little too chewy and the batter slid right off - I ended up eating more of the batter than the rings.  They seemed to get cold really fast too.

The salad, well it was iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and some olives - and I think a few slices of carrot.  Somehow they managed to not get dressing on it, but since I've had on sale bagged salads that were more appetizing, I wasn't too broken up over it.

Are you wondering why I gave them 3 stars yet? First, it is OG - ya kinda know what to expect, but after the sweat hog, limp salad, and suddenly naked calamari, there are 2 things that saved the day: the soup and bread sticks.  The Chicken Gnocchi Soup was great - not too heavy, a good ratio of dumplings to chicken and soup.  Dipping those perfectly baked bread sticks was blissful. They also did a decent job with the Italian Soda, the mix was right, but a little smaller than I would have liked.

Overall, it was a decent lunch, but I don't feel like I earned an Italian stamp in my passport."}
{"text":"Four years since I've been in an Olive Garden.....now I remember why.  Worse service I have in a while, measly portions (I've seen better portions in an Ethiopian buffet) and horrendous quality and taste.  Even the breadsticks which could have been a plus were stale and cold.

Manager came over and did fix the portion issue which was a plus, but the temperature was still cold, and taste was bad....what was I expecting from the Applebee's of the Italian world.

Roaches and cleanliness were a visible issue as well I'm surprised it was as busy as it was.  

Check #42345 if corporate is curious.

This place is embarrassing.  I'm calling the health department."}
{"text":"Sadly I would of never thought I would be giving Olive Garden a 1 star. 

Found out that my favorite event at OG was going on and since we hadn't yet been into our neighborhood OG since it was new, it was a easy choice. We arrived and and were seated immediately by the front entrance.

 Nikki was our waitress and we placed our orders. I ordered the Asaigo garlic alfredo on angle hair pasta and the chicken noki soup. After the normal wait time our salads and soups were brought to the table. I kind of laughed as there was only about 1/4 inch of soup in my bowl. All broth and 1 piece of gnocchi. I started to eat it and about 5 minutes later Nikki stopped by to check on us. I asked for another bowl of soup, and she stated,\" I don't know why your filling up on soup when you ordered the endless pasta.\" Well, I was embarrassed and just told her I like the soup. She leaves and brings back another bowl of soup and it is once again only has about 1/4 of a inch of soup in it with no gnocchi  at all. Just the broth! I asked Nikki why this was and she said she had to scrap the bottom of the pan to get that much and that they were waiting on someone to bring them more.  Now I know this is just me, but the manager stops over with a big smile wanting to know how we are doing. I told him that I was put off by Miss Nikki and what she said to me. How awkward I felt. He said he would get to the bottom of it. Now out comes Nikki bringing me a full bowl of soup and asks me in a condescending voice, \"is that enough gnocchi ?\" WTF!!! I didn't even ask for that bowl! Now while she is there someone else brings out our food. So I have my pasta in front of me and I don't even touch the soup. 

I am disappointed in my service. I really did not enjoy my dining experience because of this particular person. I would much rather drive the extra 5-6 miles down to Cheyenne Rd and go to that OG. Because for the 7 years I have been going there I have had excellent service.

I won't be back anytime soon, as we are fans of Michoacan and they KNOW how to provide a good meal with great service,and it's basically in the same parking lot we will go there if we want to stay close to home."}
{"text":"Met my friend for lunch on a weekday around noon. Hostess was attentive and friendly sat me where I could see my friend arriving. We both order the soup and salad all you can eat and overall the service was okay. When we asked for more soup she seemed as if we were bothering her. At end of lunch she actually put our mints on top of the check presenter and tossed the mints on to the table. I was very surprised and shocked. 
I will say the food as usual is very good and truly enjoyed the food. However service was lacking."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Antonio was out waiter and he was as good as they get! 
My husband ordered the shrimp & talapia dish and my son enjoyed the chicken fettuccine Alfredo. I am a vegetarian and ordered the cheese raviolis. They were not up to par and I let Antonio know. He was super kind and apologetic. The manager Michelle came and visited the table and took care of it immediately and without question. Awesome customer service!
The servers were all great and helped each other out. I was a server for years and this says a lot about the team.
I would definitely recommend this place to others. It is worth the drive off the highway.
We will stop in again if we are in the area. We are traveling thru from Texas to California!
Great service & clean bathrooms! All the wait staff was excellent! Manager is on top of it!!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to go, I really didn't, but when we needed a \"team\" lunch the boss man ruled.  Oh well, I hadn't been to Olive Garden in maybe 5 years?

Service wise, it was a little slow to start but got progressively better.  I'm a water drinking, so when I'm without water for more than 5 minutes I get a little upset.  Anywho.  I had the soup, salad, breadsticks combo and it was surprisingly good.  The minestrone was lukewarm but flavorful and the salad had a little too much iceberg lettuce but was light on the dressing.  I won't be returning any time soon...but for what it was, it was A-OK."}
{"text":"i LOVE olive garden, sooo yummy all around. so i wanted to try the online ordering/take out option cuz i didn't have time to be in the restaurant.. so while the online ordering process is decent enough, but i hate the 'back to top' auto scrolling it does, the whole thing would've been totally fine and perfect if they hadn't messed up my entree.. i had asked for additional toppings in the options and in the customize parts, but didn't even receive the full original entree order! i got the customize ur pasta cucina mia? and i asked for meatballs, additional meatballs and sausage links, and i also got a side of chicken meatballs.. i have a thing for meatballs lol. but instead i got 1 meatball and 1 sausage link. so i had to add the chicken meatballs to my entree just so i'd have substantial meatballs lol, it was kinda comical in a way. *shrugs..  i already complained to olive garden and they said i'd be receiving a gift card to compensate for my order total. so i really hope that olive garden makes the needed improvements so this sort of thing doesn't happen again. it makes me wish i had visually checked it all myself, but i was in a hurry and trusted the take out person who verified my order's items w/ me... i feel like an idiot now for saying ok to it all when it ended up not being done right... but considering i paid for it all w/ a gift card and got the $5 discount online lol, i guess maybe i should just be happy i didn't have to pay w/ my own $...

i've also been here in person to dine in the restaurant and can say that it's pretty loud and very busy! i've been seated right by the area where all the staff r rushing in and out, doing the orders on the computer, grabbing glasses, etc. so it's a very busy and rushed ambiance in that area anyway lol. but i'll always say, the food i've gotten is always right on, and i LOVE the desserts!!! my fave is the zeppole :) but i did venture out and try a chocolate dessert which was delish too. and i love that they do tiramisu just how i like it, other places do other varied versions i don't like much... i joke a lot that i'd love to go there just for a desserts galore lol. it would be nice if they offered different salad dressings tho instead of just the italian.. but i guess that's just what u get when u go to an italian restaurant lol.."}
{"text":"Over priced inadequate so called Italian food. We got a GC for Christmas so we thought tonight we would use it to go have a nice dinner at Olive Garden next time I will use the gift for one of the other restaurants on the card. It is Monday 7:30pm no wait and not crowded we are seated right away the server comes over promptly and ask for our drink order and if  we want bread,  he comes back a short time later to take our food order never telling us (nor did we get the specials menu) that they had the buy one take one home for 12.99. I ordered the Tour of Italy my mom got Spaghetti with meat sauce and dad got Chicken Parmesan,  they both got salad I ordered zuppa toscana used to be delicious the past 2 times a bowl of mostly broth 2 potato chunks a few small pieces of sausage and some wilted kale yuck. The salad was good as were the bread sticks, when our food arrived I went to stir in my Alfredo sauce into the noodles and discovered they were dry and stuck to the plate my moms spaghetti was the same way dry hard and rubbery. I called the waiter over and told him and he brought me back a side of noodles with no sauce on them. We all said we will not come back to this location again if your main goal is Italian perfect pasta should be at the top of the list not microwaved junk. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"We're had a very pleasant experience at Olive Garden tonight. Our uncles are visiting from the mid West. Dan, our waiter was very efficient, personable and polite. He made sure everyone felt included and taken care of. The food was served promptly and it was delicious! We credit mostly Dan for our positive experience! He made a very pleasant evening for us."}
{"text":"Visiting the area from out of town.... Olive Garden is usually our fav restaurant. The food wasn't good at all!!! We had to send food back. The waiter was nice but seemed unknowledgeable and possibly new. Food with no silverware, drinks with no straws, had to ask for extra napkins 3 times, never got a refill on drinks, stem from a tomato vine in a dish that has no tomatoes, and the soup (my 3 yr old lovesssssss zuppa.... I go buy him a 1/2 a gallon once a month so he can get in the veggie he refuses to eat at home ).... WOULDNT eat the soup !!!! And this was the kid that ecstatic to go get his soup .... so sorry this olive was not very good."}
{"text":"I thought I'd reviewed this place before - it would have been a 5 star rating.  The customer service was ridiculously awesome, so great that we thought maybe they had hidden a microphone under the table.  The food was delicious and especially in this area the customer service was something that was very refreshing.

We should never have gone back!  It can't be helped but be disappointing after such a perfect experience.  This time it was Sunday evening.  Sure the service was there but it was the same as everywhere else where you're rushed about, pressured to get drinks, pressured to order appetizers and almost eye-rolled when you just want water and an entree.  It is 2014 and some people do watch what they eat btw, sorry it hurts the tip.  The breadsticks weren't as good as we remembered, they were slightly overcooked (both batches that we tried) where the ends were like crackers and there was a crunchy layer over the whole thing.  The salad wasn't tossed well, there was a goop of dressing at the bottom and about half a cup of bottom-of-the-bag crouton crumbs at the top.  

Ugh, so after such a lackluster service and poor show at the breadstick and salad that this chain is so famous for the entrees have to be great right?  Mine was ok, I had the sliced short rib and tortellini dish though the short ribs were dry and kind of nasty looking (frozen entree anyone?).  My friend got some steak fettucine dish with gorgonzola that was pretty pungent.  They had a balsamic glaze over the steak and the cheese was overpowering to the extent that I thought it was blue cheese dressing, not fettucine sauce on it.  We will most likely toss it.  

The manager came by and we told him what we thought about that dish (I couldn't hide it).  He asked if we wanted to replace it with something else but my friend said it was fine.  However, the leftovers are still sitting in the fridge for his dish and its now Thursday.  Here's where there is a difference between our last experience and this experience.  Last time, the customer service would be so ideal that he would have just brought a dish that he thought we would have liked since it was obvious we weren't thrilled with the one we ordered.  This way we would most likely have been more impressed with the establishment and the dishes and service would have averaged out to a higher rating.  

Anyway, I'm starting believe the naysayers and will probably stick with the local business."}
{"text":"Not impressed with my last few visits. Servers were crappy. Food was mediocre. I'm surprised people rave about this place. I've decided to not ever go back."}
{"text":"Blake the manager was very helpful and sweet. He let us use a coupon that was expired. Our server...can't remember his name (dark hair and a mustache) very attentive and quick. Hostess not very friendly. Overall I enjoyed my visit and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This restaurant has declined drastically throughout the past few months. It's now common to receive uncooked meals, small portions, cold sauces and bad service at this location now. It's in a convenient location, but I would much rather go out of my way to an excellent Olive Garden about 15 minutes from this location."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. Everything that I order here is prepared very well. The food is always hot and fresh. Out of all the locations that I have been to, I would say this one is the best. The chicken scampi is absolutely delicious as well as the chicken Alfredo. The only problem that I have experienced is paying $4 for extra Alfredo sauce. I don't believe that's fair considering the amount on the pasta was nowhere near the usual amount."}
{"text":"I really want to give 3.5 stars...Yelp when will you allow 1/2 stars? I particularly like this location because their recent remodel makes the place look nicer than most other OG's. I also love that To Go stuff is right up front when you walk in. I like how they bring the food up and then put it in the bag in front of you so you can see that it is what you ordered.  They also bag things differently which I like. They put the little courtesy dessert mints in a tiny plastic cup so they don't get squished by bigger things in the bag or get on top of something hot and melt everywhere so they are destroyed by the time you get to eat.  They just seem to take more pride in doing a quality job than other OG's and their people seem friendlier in this location too.

I've also sat at the bar and while all the servers were super friendly, my meal took forever. There was some snafu in the kitchen and my meal just got overlooked. I had to finally ask about it when I saw other meals get served to people who came in well after me. All I got was an apology. Not a discount for my trouble or anything else to make me feel better. I sat for over 40 minutes waiting for my dinner after finishing my salad.  Then when I got my meal, the portions seemed much smaller than usual and this was the more expensive Tour of Italy meal that I ordered.  I was highly disappointed by this experience.

Overall I recommend their To Go service more than anything else. In the restaurant can be hit and miss."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly. I have never been a fan of Olive Garden, but it was better than I remembered. I got the build your own Tour of Italy and was pleasantly surprised by the Spinach Ricotta Mezzaluna Ravioli with Pesto Alfredo. It is clearly an Americanized version of Italian food, duh, but it has vastly improved since the last time I was here. It hit the Italian food craving quite well. 

And then I started throwing up three hours later. It hasn't stopped all night. :("}
{"text":"I would not order to-go from this location. For as much as it cost... Pretty disappointed. 

Not only did they push me aside for a customer with a higher dollar amount, but the food was weak. 

$9.99 for a cheese dip & bread... There was 1/4 of a cup of \"cheese dip\" ridden in a congealed pile of oil. 

$2.99 for extra marinara dip... 1/4 cup of basil with a small amount of oiled \"tomato\" sauce. 

...at least they gave me 12 breadsticks instead of 6? 

And if you order plates that SHOULD be separate- expect to get them crammed all into 1 small plastic container. 

Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Worst location I've ever been to. Parmesan pesto make your own pasta was disgusting. Salad was taken away after one round and server never asked if we wanted more. Bread sticks were awful-no flavor and almost completely plain. Extremely slow service. Never coming back to my this location."}
{"text":"My trip to Olive Garden began with anticipation for warm breadsticks, yummy salad, and a delicious entree. Unfortunately, I left utterly disappointed and enraged. My friend, Pat, and I began eating our soups. Pat had the chicken gnocchi soup that was accompanied by a little extra protein........a bug. The bug had a round body and approximately 6 legs (not sure if two of the legs fell off in the soup or not -.-) When mentioned to the server that a critter was found in the soup, she apologized and took the plate to the manager for further examination. A few minutes later, the manager came strolling by our table and as he squatted down, he let out a big \"uh ohhhhhh!\" As Pat and I looked over at him, he half-heaertedly apologized for the bug and asked if she wanted more soup. MORE BUG SOUP?! No sir. 

Pat and I weren't ready to give up yet. We had faith that the entrees were going to make up for the unwelcomed critter. However, to my dismay, the entrees did not meet the mark. My Parmesan Pesto pasta was one of the worst things I have ever tasted. It taste as if it were bad or spoiled. 

When the server finally came back, she asked if we wanted boxes. Seeing as the meal was far below the standard, we did not want to take it home. I politely informed the server of my entree tasting expired and asked for the checks. When she came back, she came bearing 6 andes mints (hooray!) and she informed us that the manager had covered the cost of our meal. Pat and I were thankful that they covered the charge of the meal and things were looking up. But then.........................the server began to talk about us to another employee with harsh tones and big hand gestures. Pat and I scurried out of the restaurant and have no intentions of returning again.

Bugs+spoiled pesto+slander= :/"}
{"text":"I was the bad table tonight the manager was joking about when she asked a table a few feet away from mine what the problem was the reason we were described to her as that was the long time in between the food and drinks served we didn't get everything at the same time soups came out but no bread sticks till we were well into our on trays and even then by that time drinks had been dry for a good 5 minutes maybe more after getting upset with how long this was all taking my wife decided she would not eat her meal so I had asked if we could return it and cancel that order the Waiter said it was fine and he would remove it from the bill but when I went to pay there was the charge for the soup and bread my wife had asked why it was there if she had canceled the meal and the Waiter seemed to be annoyed with the whole conversation and stormed off not returning at all and sent the Manger looking for the bad table she was very kind and understanding and even offered to send us home with a meal at no charge I was a little relieved after that since my wife didn't get to eat anything after all it was my birthday and with all the stuff going on with us I didn't want to stay for dessert"}
{"text":"For once in my life I ate at a restaurant alone so I sat at the bar. The bartender was fast and helpful but didn't make casual conversation. I'm not sure if it's different in the mainland compared to Hawaii but back home I make conversation with my solo customers to help make them feel less awkward for dining in alone. He was very quick with my drink. Salad and bread sticks came out quick then shortly after my entree, stuffed chicken Marsala, came out. Everything was great. He didn't ask me if I saved room for dessert which was a little disappointing. Even though his serving etiquette wasn't amazing I still tipped him $6 on a $20 tab.

Tip- everyone should tip servers AT LEAST 18% off of the original tab. If that's too hard to figure out just do 20% or use your CELL PHONE to figure out how much tip to leave. Servers tip out other workers and make little to NOTHING on hourly pay. Be kind to your server!! They bring you food and drinks."}
{"text":"While the food has remained consistently good at this location, the service has gone down hill. Disinterested servers who are focused on anything except doing their job have made this location less than enjoyable. While some of the servers are excellent, it is a roll of the dice as to whether you'll get one of the good ones or one of the horrible ones that brings down the location."}

{"text":"My CC was put on hold. Saturday Knight, prior to the game because of multiple swipes. CC prevention services for my bank did the right thing. I guess it's a matter of taking my CC out of my sight. Then, swiping my card multiple times. This is what makes me think twice about olive garden employee intentions. I spoke to who I thought was a Manager, to find out, this employee was a server. Overall not an ideal circumstance. I personally don't wish this instance on anyone."}
{"text":"Our experience was...odd.  There were plenty of tables but we still had to wait 10 minutes to be seated, the hostess literally didn't look up at us once. She just kinda grunted that it'd be a minute & to have a seat while we wait...okaaaaaay. When we finally got to our table our server was very sweet. Food came fast & tasted great. It got a little weird when I needed a to-go box. The table next to us & I both asked for boxes, she went to them, put their food in the boxes, put the boxes in a bag & sweetly handed it to them...us...well, she just kinda set the boxes on our table & walked off. I found it really odd that she so sweetly bagged up their meal but couldn't even wait 2 seconds to say, \"here you go\" while putting them on our table. I just found it very strange & a little rude."}
{"text":"I have always had nothing but good experiences at the olive garden. I know its not \"real\" Italian food but I don't care. I love it! I was at this location most recently and had beyond excellent service. Also the portions on the kids menu are huge! My son had enough left for an entire lunch the next day"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see all these positive reviews.

Everything started out fine.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  Employees were friendly.  

When our server brought out the salad and plates, something smelled awful.  My daughter realized it was the plates.  They smelled like an old mop.  It was making me gag so I had to move the plates away from our table and call the server.  He brought us new plates after a few minutes.  I figured he was having a hard time finding clean ones, but I appreciate his effort.

Salad was good.  The breadsticks had a weird flavor.  It was as if they were expired prior to cooking, or if they'd been sitting in a cooler with rotten food and absorbed some of the yucky smells.  I was half expecting Ramsay to come out and close down the restaurant.  

Our entrees arrived.  They were tasteless.  I had the smoked mozzerella chicken - which tasted exactly like the fettucine alfredo.  I didn't understand how you can make sauce without ANY flavor.  And I mean absolutely NO flavor whatsoever.  It was mindboggling.

Mystery solved when we received our take-home entrees.  Their foods are frozen and prepackaged like a tv dinner.  As simple as it is to boil some pasta and make simple sauces, they don't make their foods in-house.

Received a round of refills at one point but they didn't bring mine. I had to steal my daughter's drink.

I expected this level of quality from Fazolli's, but expected more from Olive Garden.  I guess that's why we haven't eaten there in 6 years.  At least the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"Speedy service and friendly staff. I've taken food to go several times from here at lunchtime and it's always been fast and fresh. I do the soup and salad combo - great deal even to go!"}
{"text":"Omg! What a fantastic waitress we had! Excellent personality and service, food was good as usual. GO see Kalina at Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Woo, sorry folks, this unit is not quite on point.

I've been here several times to formulate this review.  There is nothing glaringly deficient here.  Instead, everything is underwhelming.  The whole facility is a little dingey.  Don't look too hard at the carpet, or at the seating in the lobby/waiting area.

Service is usually fairly friendly, but gets really slow at times.  Maybe it's just me, but I feel like there's a weird vibe here, as if the staff were told \"nobody really expects too much here, let them wait...\"

To be clear, the food is not bad.  It's less good than I find at a better Olive Garden.  And the general lack of pollish makes me wonder what that kitchen looks like..."}
{"text":"I will preface this by acknowledging that one should not expect a 5 star dining experience from a 2 star establishment.  But when the experience is substandard to your already low expectations, you know it's REALLY bad.  Decided to grab a quick lunch here with coworkers at about 2pm on a Wednesday.  Sounds, easy enough right? It was everything BUT \"easy,\" and we even ordered from the Quick n Easy, or whatever they call it, menu.  So, why did we sit there for nearly one hour and fifteen minutes when the section we were seated in only had two other tables occupied? HORRIBLE SERVICE.

We ordered Soup and Salad. How difficult is that to get right? Well, my salad never came. Our soup arrived cold because it took so long to get to our table and our server seemed inconvenienced when we requested breadsticks and a refill on our soups. After our second bowl, she brought us the check - which we had not yet requested.  When I brought it to her attention that I never got my salad, she then asked if I wanted to take it to go? Yes, that REALLY happened. 

What went from an already \"bad\" experience got worse.

I did ask to order a slice of cake to go as I wanted a late night snack from my hotel...but she didn't offer to bring utensils to eat the cake.  Isn't that standard? Or, at least standard to offer?  Anyway...the server was quite possibly the worst server ever.  And, if I honestly felt like complaining to management would have made a difference, I would have. But, it was clear by looking around that there was no sense of urgency.  Just to test our theory, we hit the call button on those lovely new devices at the table - but it took over ten minutes for anyone to come, and it was our server with our cold soup. The girl had THREE tables. THREE. I would hate to see what happens when it is actually busy. And, why have call buttons if you're not going to pay attention to them? 

Ugh. Olive Garden - set higher standards. Market share is tough to keep these days.  Okay isn't good enough and HORRIBLE like what we experienced is detrimental.

As far as or soups go - since this is a FOOD app - they would have been better if they were served warm.  After all, we didn't order gazpacho."}
{"text":"Dinner with the family at Olive Garden. Who doesn't love the bottomless salad and breadsticks? I always get a side cup of the salad dressing to dip the warm fresh bread sticks in 5/5.

The salad was good and fresh. We started with some mozzarella cheese and marinara dipping sauce 4/5.
I had the chicken parmigiana with pasta and meat sauce. 
Always a tasty choice 4/5. We also enjoyed the lasagna 4/5 and the pasta with meat sauce 4/5.

For dessert we split a slice of the lemon cake, delicious 5/5. I usually alternate between the lemon cake and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. 

Pleasant service and always a good Italian meal 4/5."}
{"text":"Pleasant online ordering experience. Had never tried ordering Olive Garden to go and was surprised by the ease and structure they have in place.

We researched to see which Olive Garden was closest to us and proceeded to place the order. There was a coupon spot at checkout so we tried a code from an email I had received and it worked for 15% off the order. TOGO15. Not sure how long this code lasts, but if I can help another family enjoy some savings on Olive Garden food, I am happy to help. We ordered a build your own pasta with meat sauce and meat balls, chicken giardino and some soups: minestrone and chicken with gnocchi and always some of the fabulous breadsticks which of you can believe it are even better when dipped in the salad dressing! Lastly, we finished up with a delicious lemon cream cake.

I received the confirmation email and off I was to go pick it up. The wife prepped the wine so the Italian meal could go down upon my return. I arrived at Olive Garden and they had plenty of designated parking right up front for TOGO orders. I walked in and they have a wide counter next to the bar with two employees working orders for just TOGO. The cold dessert was placed on some warm food so the manager replaced it with a fresh one and gave it to me for free. They also put another bag of 4 breadsticks and salad dressing in the bag. Thank You! Quick to pay and back on my way. 

The food was packed very well and everything was nice, fresh and hot; and of course the bread was scrumptious dipped in the dressing! Truly a great experience!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden, the place that Hawaii peeps first go to once they come to vegas and never been. Why we ain't got one in Hawaii Still???

Well this time it wasn't my choice. My friend who moved to vegas for 2 years still hasn't been to Olive garden so we decided to go.

The best thing about Olive garden is the unlimited soup/salad with your entree choice. On Monday thru Thursday between 3pm to 5pm there's a special dinner duo cost for $8.99! That's a steal even if you gotta choose the 5 entree on the list. We got there 10mins before 5 and our server was very nice to trying to get in the order quick. 

We also ordered 2 choice appetizer to share, we got the stuffed mushroom and fried zucchini. The stuffed mushroom has small clams inside and drenched with butter and cheese... I wasn't a fan.. but I liked the fried zucchini. 

I ordered Eggplant Parm, this is my go to dish everywhere!!!!! I love eggplant parm. I got soup to go with my entree... forgot the name but it was pretty good but lots of basil. Loved my entree and I was amazed I finished it all. 

My friend ordered the 5 cheese ziti and soup... his soup looked more creamy than mine and the ziti was oh so cheesy! 

Service was great, our server was very tentative and wonderful."}
{"text":"Not really good value for your money 
$175 for a family of 5
Ordered 3 plates of Calamari for the kids, it was well undercooked, white & rubbery
Should of sent it back but the kids said not to 
The salad was nothing special, iceberg lettuce & a few fill ins
I had the Chicken Margherita and it was not 2 big chicken breasts as in its menus picture.  It was 2 small chicken thighs & they were tough & bland.  The toppings of pesto, tomatoes & zucchini were delicious.
The sangria's were ok.  I doubt that their made their locally.
My husband had the $25 Salmon Piccata.  He said it was ok, nothing WOWZERS 
My son had the Fettuccine Alfredo...portion size was good but there was no garlic in the sauce......who doesn't put garlic in an Alfredo sauce?????
My other son had the Cheese Ravioli, the meat sauce was not made at restaurant level, there was no melted cheese on the plate as stated in the menu


Bread sticks were enormously salty, we needed to scrape off the garlic salt

Our server was Tiana and although she seemed a bit upset initially when we asked for our salad and bread sticks together, she got over it.  My generous husband tipped 15%.

We had 2 birthday people at our table.  They provided a small dessert and the waitress did light a candle on each and wrote happy birthday on the plates with strawberry jam - nice touch.

The waitress did charge us an extra $6 for my one son who did not order an entree but had some salad an appetizer and an ice tea.  That was not cool.

We've been there 3 times now & it's just not worth the $200 (includes tip). 

We won't return.  The menu is stupendous but nothing is made there at the restaurant level.  Take yourselves to a nice Italian restaurant in Calgary, there are many"}
{"text":"As someone who is in the business I feel the need to express my disappointment in my recent experience at this Olive Garden. My roommate and I decided to come in after running an errand together and we arrived just as they were opening at 11:00. We were promptly seated but then it went downhill from there. We sat for FIVE plus minutes before we were even GREETED by our server. It was so long we got up and started to go into the bar area. The server made the (lame, in my opinion) excuse that there was confusion as to who had what stations and what tables. As someone in the business.... most host or managers have the server floor chart done prior to the doors opening. Shame on the server if they did and she didn't even look. Strike one. We then ordered and my roommate wanted fettuccine Alfredo with a double order of grilled shrimp and the chicken gnocchi soup. They brought our entrées out and her fettuccine had the baby fried shrimp on it instead. Strike two. While the server offered a what seemed a half hearted apology and the dish was sent back. My roommate had some soup left still and asked for a container for it while we wait and the server actually asked if she wanted one for the meal also...I would think not! Strike three for me. I felt so bad for my roommate and we had a small child with us with a limited attention span (as they do at their age) so time was precious. One would think that maybe they would have made an offer of desert or something on top of remaking my roommates lunch (not to mention us sitting for over five minutes which is bogus before we were greeted) but when I got the check.... not a thing. Should have stuck with our original plan and gone to the Arrowhead location since we were near there but because we live here and it would be near opened by the time we got back down here we came here. Sorry OG Goodyear, my roommate came come back if she wants but unless I must...I will not b"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the waitress.  I seriously did not need to know it was her first day back from having the flu, and I really did not enjoy being soaked when the server dropped a tray of waters on our table and all over me. 

No one apologized, and no manager came when I asked for one."}
{"text":"Our kids like this restaurant and we go there regularly for dine-in and take out.  We have no complaint for the food but this time our service was not so great.

The server had a poker face and basically took the order in cold standard way.  I told him we are celebrating a birthday today and he said nothing.  During dinner we asked for another soup, it took a long time for it to come out."}
{"text":"We were absolutely happy about service we had. Melissa was a wonderful server. We went to have a dinner. We sat at a bar side. After we had our drinks we got things to take care of, so we had to leave quickly. We didn't have our dishes yet so we asked her to pack our foods in ToGo box when they are ready. She made sure she put everything we needed. She was such a kind and helpful server! We appreciated her hospitality!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Manager Seth is great and our server (i believe her name was Brianna) provided some of the best service we have had. Would highly recommend and will absolutely be going again!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that if you're reading a review about Olive Garden, you're not looking for anything about their food cause it's the same as any other because it's a stupid mediocre chain. So this review is about their service. With that said, I enjoy going here because of the soup, salad, and breadsticks deal because everything else is really just Americanized Italian food, at best. After three other crappy experiences with this specific location, whenever we felt like having Olive Garden per the request of our children or any others we would be with, we would skip this one and drive a little further to Norterra, but it was in the area and not busy so I thought what the heck. My family and I, part of six with one being an infant, got in literally right before a huge rush. We checked and and we're told it would be \"just a few moments\" and we didn't need a pager because it was just a few moments. 

Then comes the rush. Immediately after us there was a party of 7, then a party of 5, then a few parties of 2, then another party of 6, then a couple more parties of 2 and 4. What was supposed to be \"a few moments\" turned into over 20 minutes while we watched the party of 7, 5, and 6 get seated in front of us. The party of 7 was a bachelorette party of some sort and knew a worker as we discovered as he frantically tried to make any accommodation he possibly could to have them seated ASAP. I was right next to the host stand so I heard everything. After that my husband asked how much longer it was gonna be and replayed the initial conversation we had when we first got there, before everyone, about it just being a few moments and they told us there was another party ahead of us which we witnessed check in after us. After they got seated we decided we had enough and we were going to take our craving for mediocre Americanized Italian food elsewhere so we cancelled our spot in line, to which the manager who happened to be right within ear shot decided that a table just our size was conveniently ready for us right that second. How convenient! I have never had good service at this location, from slow service to food taking way to long when it wasn't even busy, to having to ask other waiters for our waiter because they would disappear. This place clearly doesn't care about customer service and the only thing consistent about it is their lack of it. Not coming back. Ever. Not recommending this location to anyone. Ever."}
{"text":"Our go to OG in Paradise Valley.  We usually hit this place up for lunch once a week and the service is typically friendly and fast.
Food is standard Olive Garden fare which I am sure is a matter of taste, I personally enjoyed the Tuscan menu.
The mini-deserts are really good!"}
{"text":"The food was lukewarm and over cooked. The service was mediocre, and I think the highlight of my meal was my water with lemon."}

The quality was indeed TOP NOTCH! 
I told my wife, 'I'd eat here EVERYDAY, if I could! \"
A definite must return!  Thank you!"}

{"text":"Please bring back the chicken meatballs. I love them and I used to always order them until recently when they were taken off the menu. I don't like that the beef is always mixed with pork so the chicken meatballs are perfect."}

Ordered two entrees and a bottle of wine to go and left a decent tip for just a take out order.  I got a drink at the bar and got involved in the tv program.  Someone sat next to me about 30 minutes into my wait and got their meal in 10 minutes.  I looked around and the managers were on their cell phones. Finally, I went to the counter and asked why my buzzer hadn't gone off. The girl said my order was almost ready.... and then took it out of a warming oven!! I placed my order at 5:59 pm and left there with (an incorrect) order at 6:45pm. Wtf. Never getting take out again."}

Olive garden is never a top choice for me and will never be..."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here for lunch, I have been to many Olive Garden's and I always order the chicken alfredo(my favorite)! I have been to this location twice now, and the service was great dont get me wrong. The food on the other hand was not so great. The portions are smaller,  and the chicken alfredo barely had chicken. Along with, the chicken alfredo was missing something. It was tastless. Maybe they changed cooks? I'm not sure. But not great to me."}
{"text":"Went to Olive Garden today and had an awful experience. First off our waitress was terrible. We were there for over an hour and a half and never got our breadsticks until the end. My mom nor my grandma got refills and my boyfriend and I had to flag her down to get ours and I just had water. She stopped by our table on her own maybe 3 times. To take our order, serve our food, and bring the check. It wasn't even busy. Then the food was awful. None of us were satisfied. They also have these new machines where you can place your own order and that's how you pay your check right at the table. That is so low class and with that really why have a waiter or waitress? You can do everything yourself other than bring out the food. To top is off while we paid the check at the table the waitress hovered over us and it was uncomfortable leaving a tip with her watching. You can't ask for steakhouse prices with McDonald's service. We will never be going back to Olive Garden again. I have celiacs disease and the gluten free menu was a joke. We can go to the Cheesecake Factory get better service and food and have more options for gluten free and pay the same price or less. Olive Garden is a joke."}
{"text":"If you enjoy waiting 50 minutes for a pickup order consisting of a child's ravioli and breadsticks, then this is the place for you! Especially paying for items you did not order, such as a mango smoothie and the take out girl crumbling up your receipt instead of giving it to you. 
As a server myself, it's hard to take the extra step to formally complain about bad service, but this was a new low. 
Unacceptable."}

{"text":"You can't beat the unlimited soup, salad and bread sticks for under $7, even on a weekend!  The food was good - as expected.

The service at this location was not good though.  Friendly, which was good but SO SLOW.  Had to wait 5 minutes to be seated even though no one came in right before us or after us.  There were plenty of empty tables for a Saturday at lunch.  The waitress would take at least 5 minutes to come back with an answer or a refill, etc.  

I would not go back to this location if I were in a hurry."}
{"text":"I placed an online order to be picked up at 5pm. I got there at 5:06 and the hostess shameia, advised she would go check on it, I sat down. She never addressed me again.. at 5:23 I got up and walked up the hostess station as other people had walked in and were picking up food. At this point shameia asked \"what's yo name again?\" Ok... so you don't even remember my order? That you were supposedly checking on?? She came back again and advised it was being put together and should be 5 mins. This time I stayed standing to make my presence known. She came back with someone else's food (who had walked in after me) and again stated she would return with my food. I can see into the kitchen, there were at least 5 servers standing around laughing and joking. She finally returned with my food and began packing it up. As she was, my gf grabbed one of the containers to insure the food was still hot, shameia stated \"they keep it in a hot box so it's warm\" soooo which is it?? Was my food sitting in a hot box? Or was it freshly made?? Welp I found that out soon as I got home, the chicken parm was completely dry and my pasta was cold. The breadsticks were hard as bricks and tasted stale. Don't understand why it took 30+ mins for this! I called the restaurant and have now been holding for a manager for 12:57 after speaking with mozel who advised he would get a manager.. I'm not hanging up. This is ridiculous! I won't be back to this location again..

Update: so after 15 mins on hold we decided to call on another line and low and behold mozel answers! We advised him we were holding on another line for a manager, he went and got Mr. STEVEN CARTER, who claimed to be the GM.. well I never spoke to a GM who was POLITELY RUDE, when I told him I was holding for 15 mins, his response was \"ok\" then he launched into a speech about how they had a party of 40 and the kitchen was behind...1. I don't want an excuse 2. A APOLOGY, is how you start a customer complaint call and 3. I'm not upset they were busy, I'm upset that it wasn't communicated to me. Mr. Carter cut me off repeatedly and went on a rant about how busy they were for a few minutes.. he was condescending in his super sweet voice (you know that person who puts too many words in a sentence \"I am truly, whole heartily, terribly sorry\") but really he thinks your an idiot? Ha! He promised to mail me out a gift card Monday, or Tuesday or \"sometime this week\" so we shall see.. it'll be someone's Christmas gift because I won't be back! And I'll be calling corporate."}

{"text":"I haven't been to an Olive Garden in years.  We used to go to the neighborhood one when I lived in Chicago.  We decided to try this one with friends for a casual dinner.  While the food was very tasty, the bread sticks seemed a little tough to me.  I remember them being very soft and cushiony.  This batch was chewy.  Not sure if they are supposed to be this way, unless it has been such a long time since I had one.  The salad was good, and my husband enjoyed his soup.  The pasta was also nice and the spicy sauce was delicious.  Our server on the other hand must have been having a bad day.  She seemed preoccupied and almost annoyed at having to do her job.  She wasn't always present and asking her for a glass of water almost seemed like a chore.  Perhaps she was having a bad day, and I totally get that, but this is your job and sometimes you have to put on a happy face even though you don't want to.  Other than that, the meal was great!  A good time was had by all."}
{"text":"3 stars because I am chief cook of rich and hot/spicy food in my own kitchen, so eating at OG was fine for our first evening out. Having just moved here, our first dinner out in Phoenix (Glendale location) was the soup&salad dinner combo, Alfredo and bread-sticks, with a glass of chilled Porta Vita Rosato (Rosé), although we could have done without the Acqua Panna Spring H20 (hard to refuse after server has opened the new bottle for a 'sample'). The service was fine, (nothing spectacular to write home about) considering it was the busy dinner hour. We ordered each of 3 soups (Fagioli, Toscana, and Minestrone), and they were adequate, but definitely not spicy like I make them at home. The salad was cold and crisp as it should be and plentiful, with some of their famous tasty dressing. Over all, it is a nice place to eat out when the mood strikes again."}
{"text":"I had an enjoyable experience at the Olive Garden in North Olmsted, Ohio.  The restaurant was fairly empty when I arrived in the evening, and a friendly hostess directed me to a comfortable table near one corner of the restaurant.   
 
This restaurant is clean and well-decorated, and the ambiance makes for a nice experience.   This is the typical high quality that one generally expects with any Olive Garden restaurant.  
 
I started my meal with the breadsticks and salad that is offered for free with any entree.  They were a wonderful introduction to my meal, as always.  For my main course, I decided to get the Northern Tour of Italy, which was also pretty good.  Three items are included in the Northern Tour of Italy - chicken lombardy, asiago tortelloni with meat sauce and fettuccine with creamy parmesan portobello sauce. 

My waitress was attentive throughout my experience, and checked on me regularly to make sure I was satisfied.  Although she was quite professional, she lacked the friendliness that I would have preferred.  

Overall, I had a great meal at this Olive Garden, and a pretty good experience.  Although this restaurant could make subtle improvements with their customer service, I'm sure you will enjoy your meal here."}
{"text":"I had an average experience at the Olive Garden in Middleburg Heights, Ohio.  The restaurant was fairly empty when I arrived in the evening.  Upon entry, a hostess directed me to one of the many available tables, near a busy intersection in the restaurant.  I kindly suggested another nearby table that was more quiet, but the hostess implied that this would be a problem.  I reluctantly accepted the table she suggested even though there were many other more preferable options available.  Whatever my experience would be at this restaurant, I could tell that it was off to a bad start.  

This restaurant is clean and well-decorated, and a quiet ambiance would have made this a nice experience.   Excellent cleanliness and ambiance is typically delivered at any Olive Garden restaurant.  
 
I started my meal with the breadsticks and soup that is offered for free with any entree.  For my soup, I selected the chicken gnocchi, and it was delicious, as were the breadsticks.  They were a wonderful introduction to my meal.  

For my main course, I decided to get the Tour of Italy, which was also pretty good.  Three items are included in the Tour of Italy - chicken parmigiana, lasagna classico and fettuccine alfredo, all with homemade sauces.   

My waiter was attentive throughout my experience, and checked on me regularly to make sure I was satisfied.  He was professional and fairly friendly.    

Overall, I had a great meal at this Olive Garden.  If the hostess was more willing to accommodate my request to sit at a different table nearby, this would have easily been a four-star experience for me.  Although this restaurant could make subtle improvements with their customer service, I'm sure you will enjoy your meal here."}

The last time we ate at this Olive Garden it was a horrendous nightmare. My husband ordered soup and I ordered salad. We were not offered another round of soup or salad any time soon, despite many attempts to get our server's attention. We were starving! It took close to 15 minutes (post-asking our waitress) to get our second servings of unlimited soup and salad. 

When our entrées finally did come out, 40 minutes later, we noticed that the table beside us had already gotten their food, even though they sat down after us. Our waitress must have noticed that WE noticed, because she came up to us and explained that the MANAGER wanted her to let us know that \"your raviolis need to be re-tossed in the sauce because they're still cold, so it will just be a few more minutes\"... who openly and willingly admits this?!?!  

The breadsticks were stale and not prepared to our liking. It tasted like a frozen breadstick that was zapped in the microwave, then placed in a basket with a white linen cloth over top, to make it look like they are fresh out of the oven. In reality, whatever \"garlic-powder-oil\" concoction that they are supposed to brush on top (you know, to make it actual garlic bread), was not done better than my one-year-old niece could have done.

Meal was horrible. I wish I could lie to you folks, but I simply can't. The lobster ravioli was so salty that there is really nothing I could say or do to extract any more excitement about this matter. On a scale from 1 to Salty, it tasted like the cooks caught a lobster straight from the Atlantic and stick it right on plate without rinsing it off. Needless to say neither me or my husband, who ordered the same dish, could finish our meals. It tasted SO BAD. Do I even have to tell you that the lobster ravioli was mostly void of lobster, too? 

Before we left, I attempted to evaluate our experience on the electronic key pads that they now have attached to the tables. The only problem was, our waitress distracted me (which I'm convinced was intentional) by sharing with us the way to make the \"best brownies ever\" by using the Olive Garden chocolate candies. She tried to excite me by this recipe so much, that the electronic computer timed out in the middle of my survey completion, and I was unable to rate our experience. 

So instead, I wrote a letter to the store manager. I hope your experience is better than ours was. I guess we have to go back now, since we landed a coupon... Unless anyone wants it? ;)

\"I am writing to apologize for the poor experience that you had at our restaurant. You are a valued guest to us, great food and great service is something we pride ourselves on. We unfortunately failed during your most recent visit and for that I apologize. I will follow up with our management staff, the server and the line cooks on duty to ensure something like this does not happen again. I am going to have guest relations send you a gift card for 40$ and would like to invite you back so that we can give you the great dining experience that you deserve from the Olive Garden. If you have a chance please reach out to me at the restaurant so I can make a connection with you and let you know that we truly value your business and feedback! Have a Happy New Year!\"
--General Manager response to complaint letter 


UPDATED REVIEW-

We went here to use the coupon we received here the last time. I have to say, it was an absolutely amazing experience. Our server (who's name I can't remember, although it started with a K) was outstanding. The meals were hot and prompt and our server checked back constantly (but not in an annoying way) to ensure we had everything we needed. We were unable to make room for dessert, but we got 2 apps, waters to drink, and 2 entrees for less than $40! Lots for your money, I think, and when it's awesome service, the full experience can't be beat. Happy with our turn-around experience, for sure."}
{"text":"I normally love dinning in and eating here but today I ordered for pick up and it was horrible. I got a chicken alfredo and salad. When I went to pick it up I asked if they could give me the little packages to put cheese on my food they said yes. So I paid and went back to work arriving at my work took out my food and noticed they didn't even give me any silverware. The chicken was cold and the noodles were disgusting. Now I know to never order for pick up AGAIN."}
{"text":"I love this place, Our server Jessica was super sweet and attentive without being smothering. Her service will keep us coming back and referring our friends to join us!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the portions were big ! My server was nice but clueless at times , the clientele was a bit ghetto"}
{"text":"I love olive garden. Always have. Best salad and breadsticks. We go maybe 6 times a year. This time was very off putting. The seating was horrible. Party of 5 seated at a booth for 4. We refused so we got slightly better seats. Our salad came out, enough serving for 2, dry and lacking vegetables. Wanted to order my favorite chicken marsala but after seeing the price increase of almost 4 dollars I declined. Ordered the never ending pasta bowl and by the time the fettuccine Alfredo came out it sat to long so it was cold and thick. Then I stir it around and come to find a thick black HAIR in my pasta. DISGUSTING. They replaced it but who wants to eat that again. Overpriced mediocre premade Italian food."}
{"text":"This place is always packed. But still I love going here with my family. The food and drinks are really good. Most of the employees are very friendly. One of my favorites is the braised beef tortelloni and the chicken scampi."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Olive Garden in forever. I chose the create your own pasta dish. The portion size was good, and I enjoyed the Italian sausage I had added to my dish. They were juicy not dried out. My mom didn't enjoy her alfredo, but the salad and bread sticks were good. We also purchased the fried lasagna appetizer, which was yummy. I still enjoy Buca but kudos to Olive Garden for the great lunch."}
{"text":"I do agree with most of the reviews that OG isn't in my top 10 places that I care to dine.  As this location is directly in front of Carolina Place mall (right next to a Red Lobster), there is ALWAYS a wait at peak times, and on the weekends, fuggedaboudit.  I was making a trip to the mall and thought some salad and bread sticks would properly fuel me for a shopping battle.

I arrived right around 5:30 on a Monday, so there was no wait then, but as I was dining, the place began to fill.  I was promptly greeted by my friendly waiter, who kept the drink refills coming throughout my meal without being asked.  They have a current special with soup or salad, plus a selection of entrees, plus a small dessert, for $12.95, so I got that.  The salad was an OG salad, iceberg with various onions and such thrown in, but I do like their salad dressing and the salad was ice cold, which is how I prefer it.  I got a basket of 5 bread sticks for just me, and it was all I could do to not eat all 5.  They were soft and warm and quite tasty.  I got the bucatini with meat sauce for my entree, and it was fine - as expected.  I knew it wasn't going to be the best Italian(ish) dish I had ever had, but it got the job done.  The dessert was a small cake with a strawberry sauce layered in it it (I can't remember the name) and it was fine as well.  It tasted like something from the prepared food section at HT, and it was a sweet finish to my meal.  

The waitstaff was friendly and attentive without hovering, the food was fine and as expected.  It was A-OK."}
{"text":"as soon as I walked in I had a great experience, I got greeted by a beautiful young lady with amazing makeup, her name started with an \"A,\" the hosts  in the front didn't look to pleasant and very non welcoming, but my server was absolutely amazing, it was clean and so wonderful!! The food was the best and freshest I've ever ate, really recommend this location, I will be returning."}
{"text":"Once again, not a big fan of chain restaurants.  I attended a group outing on a Friday night with 7 friends.  We were seated in a separate alcove (which was nice).   We ordered cocktails.  I had the Sangria, which was just ok.   We then ordered 2 sampler appetizer platters which included a selection of fried \"stuff\" including ravioli, zucchini, mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, calamari and also stuffed mushrooms.  This was also just ok.   We received the complimentary salad and breadsticks.   I ordered the stuffed chicken marsala, substituting the side of mashed potatoes for fettuccine.   The chicken arrived (the filling was kinda non-descript) tender and flavorful covered in marsala sauce and mushrooms.  The fettuccine was decently cooked and covered in the marsala sauce, as well.   All-in-all, this was an ok meal.  The bright point of our meal was definitely our server Dondre.....he was very accommodating, patient and professional."}
{"text":"Pretty good service though our waiter did forget to give us breadsticks.  I like that they give you a free sampling of wine before your dinner.  Love the Zuppa Tuscano soup and the salad.  The eggplant parm was just so so."}
{"text":"Ordered on \"Postmates\" got a text about ten minutes later saying my order was canceled because the \"merchant\" was too busy to take orders. Lol awesome way of saying don't come back again basically.

Post mates also had a processed debit on my card for six days until it fell off as well. 

In the future I'll consider another place to eat!"}
{"text":"I arrived here today and realized that the customer service is ultimately horrid. When we first came in, they told us it would only take 20 minutes... we watched every party that arrived after us be served before us. I briefly considered defenestration as a solution. We ended up waiting for an hour. My daughter brought two of her friends along. We informed the waiter that we ordered kids meals on the kiosk, but the waiter kept asking if we sent it when we clearly did. At the time when the salad and bread arrived, the waiter promised to bring us plates and never did. The bread was doused in oil, so much so that I couldn't bear to eat the bread. When the food arrived, they switched up our sides. My daughter ordered broccoli but was served grapes instead. Overall, the customer service has made me and my family (sans husband) livid. I shall never torture myself by coming back here."}
{"text":"Out on the town, had a mice time. Our server Daniel was great. The food was good. As my usual i eat to much of the zuppa Toscana and bread sticks. Ticket price for my wife and i with tip about $40. Not bad for eating out. The one thing bad would be the sound levels get too loud. But maybe not as loud as around the table of a big family. (Like the Waltons). Divertiti! Mangia bene."}
{"text":"So I've given this Olive Garden two chances, both times my experience was sub par. 
Tonight, I ordered via their \"curbside pickup.\" It's just like Applebee's car side to go - they bring the to go food out to you. I was told my order would be ready at 6, by 6:15 no one had come out to the car so I just went inside. Apparently they were getting a rather large to-go order together, but still 15 minutes outside waiting seems long. 
All of the food was good, aside from the bread sticks. For some particular reason this specific location has the nastiest bread sticks. Other locations I've been to in CA don't have that stale, microwave taste, with hard ends; however, this location has had stale bread sticks both times I've been here. 
The servers were nice, but seemed overwhelmed and under-trained. This is the fault of management for setting their servers up for failure! They were so behind and I felt badly for them. 
Overall, the food is inconsistent, but the servers are nice."}
{"text":"I got the chicken marsala and the sauce tasted like it was made from a cheap powder packet and rancid garlic was added to it. The chicken was cooked but was not appetizing. This was the first time I've ever sent food back in my life. The manager let me choose something different so I ordered the Venetian apricot chicken to go which didn't look or smell any more appetizing. It looked like dried herbs were just thrown on top of the whole thing, but the dish ended up being pretty decent."}
{"text":"Ok the food tasted good.  We are not impressed with the lunch portion size.  It's tiny and for $12.95 it's a rip off.  The service was ok.  Felt like the server just wanted to get us out of there.  We ordered extra salad and she made us feel like we were putting her out.  She brought the check while we were still eating and as she sat it down she offered us dessert.  Don't plan on going back as it's not worth what you pay."}
{"text":"It tastes good, but it's not authentic Italian food. They are very professional: good service, big portions (you can repeat soup and salad), good bread as courtesy. I like their Fettuccine Alfredo and minestrone in special. We went there a lot of times and there was only once the server wasn't very nice. We like their food in general and the price is fair."}
{"text":"Excellent everything !! I love all of olive gardens appetizers and main dishes including their desserts. Come to this location and request Alex as your waiter. Perfect customer service. Would definitely recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight after a long time away. This was a superb experience. All of the food was fresh as could be and very tasty. Also our server Dakota was on point and went the extra mile to make sure we had a pleasant time and meal. There is not much I could say that would help improve this establishment because nothing was wrong. Job well done and thank you."}
{"text":"Now yes I know it is yet another Olive Garden but I really felt it necessary to comment on this location.  I frequent this location when going to my families lake house in Portage.  I must say this location really stands alone.  The staff is outstanding and the service and food is always top notch.  If it was closer to Chicago this staff could easily go and work at any of the top restaurants here in Chicago."}
{"text":"Service excellent food mediocre.  I've been to this location at least once a month for years sometimes more and there is no consistency to the meals.  sometimes there is more food sometimes less last night it was less and I literally had to stop for food on the way home since his plate didn't satisfy my son.  Sometimes the bread sticks are perfect sometimes they are over done my point is this a chain restaurant and I shouldn't have to be concerned about the food and a every visit basis this used to be the place my family and I would go to for family time dinner but I may be rethinking that.  Now our server last night was amazing she made the borderline food more tolerable"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at an Olive Garden.  Service was very bad, our waiter acted as if he didn't really want to be there, our food was the worst...cold, over done, missing ingredients, or just never came.  If I could give it negative stars, I would...giving just one star is being generous."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden isn't bad,service is really fast,never had any problems! Ordered a bread cheese dip,now I'm hooked!! Will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I am very much unsatisfied . The food wasn't up to my standards and the service was bad . The table service wasn't up to my standards . My waiter was not good at all she couldn't get my drink correct an when I asked for the correct one I ordered she gave me an attitude . The salad was welted an the bread was cold. The calamari was cold and hard . I spent a total of 30mins in here. My waiter took a long time before coming to ask what we wanted and to greet us. This isn't the first time I've come here and had a problem with this location . They just reminded me on why I don't want to come to this location"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and to the point.  Our waitress desi I think I don't even remember her name because she never checked till about the end of our meal and at the end.  Anyways she started off nice then disappeared.  Then I waited forever for my refill of pasta I was tired of waiting and jus wanted to leave.  Finally got my to go box but common sense she did t bring me a bag or the bread bag to go.  She had an attitude so her tip went from 25% to whatever dollar bills we had."}
{"text":"We were greeted by Elizabeth the moment we walked in - she was so kind! I was there with three other coworkers and two of us are named Elizabeth so we all laughed about that. Our server Alyssa was one of the most attentive ladies I've ever met. She kept coming back to check on us and make sure we were happy. She brought us more breadsticks before we even had the chance to ask! We ended up staying way later than intended (15 minutes after they closed in fact) and everyone was very polite, not once did we feel like they were upset or rushing us out.

We were heading out when this man was arguing with an employee through the front door. From what I understood, he placed an order with Uber Eats at 10pm -when they closed- and was angry that they didn't keep the order on hand for him? He walked off angrily saying he would leave them a bad yelp review and I said, \"...but they're closed.\" He was still angry and said that he placed the order at 10 but they threw out his food. I reiterated that they were closed and he responded with, \"did you not understand me?!\" My coworker said, \"she did understand you, they closed at 10.\" Guy got in his car after that.

So if there's a review on here from that guy, he was a jerk who didn't read the company's hours. If Uber Eats didn't post their hours, that's not Olive Garden's fault.

Go when they're open, and this place is GREAT! :)"}
{"text":"I went here for my friends birthday and immediately got a seated with our table of 4. The waitress was super nice and made sure we were taken care of the whole time. I've always been to olive garden at night time so what I usually get wasn't on the lunch menu. My friend and I got the 2 for 25 meals and got some shrimp pasta and unlimited salad and breadsticks(of course)  My drink was never empty and that's my biggest pet peeve when it comes to restaurants and especially on how much I tip. Delicious."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden is just like every other Olive Garden - standard and awesome.  I am the first person to claim they hate chain restaurants, and proudly, but I must confess...The Olive Garden is a guilty pleasure.  It's pretty reasonable, as is any chain, and I always wind up with too much food and a food coma to show for it."}
{"text":"You will be pleasantly surprised by this Olive Garden location - make sure to stop in and see the recently remodeled dining area and sample the new menu offerings! You are guaranteed great service by a very dedicated and friendly waitstaff - I felt like I was at a friends house while dining here, the servers really make you feel welcome and well taken care of! 
Olive Garden is one of those places where almost everyone has been at some point in their life. Their breadsticks, salad, soup and pasta are traditional standbys that make a hearty, comforting meal any day of the week. Kudos to the OG for keeping their approach to family style Italian food fresh and up to date! 
Some of the new offerings that are a must try : the friend mozzarella appetizer - light, Cheesey and delicious. I would describe this app as \"moreish\", because I'm left wanting more! 
The Chicken Picatta is a flavorful chicken and zucchini dish that is filling but not too heavy. A must try! 
To add even more to your dinner, give the Italian Margarita a try. It comes with a sidecar of Amaretto and is sweet, fruity and deliciously tangy. Another great drink choice is the new Head to Head Red wine that will pair well with just about any choice on the menu. 
For dessert, don't forget to try the dense, rich and heavenly Sicilian cheesecake. You won't regret it! 
Thank you, Olive Garden, for a memorable dining experience! I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"When I used to live near here, this was a regular stop for the family...always had good good and pretty good service...this most recent visit was no exception...our server wasnt perfect, but she was always smiling, very friendly and someone that if I came here still regularly,  I'd be glad to be served by again...just wish they'd bring back 3 meat ravioli..."}
{"text":"Not bad. But a little bit slower service than most other Olive Gardens when equally busy. The food was good but not great & the bartender & servers act as though the customers aren't a priority & have no sense of urgency in there."}
{"text":"They are really trying. I have been here & had incredible service & incredibly bad service. But if you let any member of the staff... Especially a manager know that it isn't going well... They will take over your table & make for damn sure everything else goes Perfect. I only wish I had started with the management & not had to encounter the poorly trained & barely capable servers that began my experience. But all in all the best Olive Garden food & service I have ever had in 25+ years of Olive Garden dining. Damn Good place that earned those 5 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"Warning: I found a metal piece on my shrimp scampi, I told the manager and she replaced it for me and the second time tastes horrible"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! I love the unlimited salad and bread sticks with a boat of Alfredo sauce! So cheap and so worth it! Trust me you can get full off of all those yummy, warm bread sticks!"}
{"text":"Ok so we ordered ravioli Alfredo lasagna the pasta was over cooked and had a chared peice of lasagna kinda up set my meal and we also ordered chicken parm lasagna it was great but we had a salad and it tasted old and lacking dressing 
Staff was great happy and cheerful attentive and pleasing 
Over all not to upset but not fully satisfied"}
{"text":"Best location on the North side because of the service and food quality hands down! Our server was so so so attentive and was constantly coming over to refill our drinks, breadsticks, and soup. I ordered the parmesan pesto with crispy chicken fritta on top, my go to order and was as delicious as ever. We had the zeppoli for dessert and it was so yummy and the chocolate sauce was nice and warm. Overall great experience and excellent service."}
{"text":"I used to love going to olive garden for their huge proportions and they had the best muscle appetizer. However, i went last week for the first time in a while and I noticed they changed menus to have less options and the food proportions where a lot smaller than before.Would I go again? ehh"}
{"text":"Slow service took almost 10 minutes to even get water. Food was not very good after waiting 25 min for regular order on a not crowded evening. Very disappointed to get home with the incorrect takeout order."}
{"text":"Fabian was our very diligent and attentive waiter. He did an awesome job; anticipated refills with great accuracy and speed of service. The food was served hot, fresh and  delicious. What an outstanding exemplary job they did... just like the good ol' days."}
{"text":"Went to Olive Garden yesterday to celebrate a birthday in the family. The servers were great, especially with our party of 15 people. 
The food was good, but the only thing we found odd was one of the salad bowls that was brought to our table was only half full. The salad bowl they placed in the middle of our long table was only half full compared to the other two bowls on the ends that were filled quite generously. Maybe they need to work on their consistency when filling their bowls. We didn't bother asking for a different bowl because the rest of the table offered theirs when we ran out. 
Other than that we had a great birthday brunch at Olive Garden in Summerlin."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Very friendly staff along with standard OG fare.


Who doesn't like endless soup or salad?  Who doesn't like the ability to get one entree for dinner and one to take home for just $12.95?

Hey, OG will never be confused with Carmine's in NYC, but it's reasonably priced pedestrian Italian, good enough for the entire family.

The best part about this store is the friendly, helpful staff.  Un buon posto per gustare un pasto Italiano medio a Cleveland!"}
{"text":"My family and i have gone 5 times in the last 4 months or so, every time we get the same waiter. I think his name is adam. He is so nice, funny, and puts up with my 2 kids making conversation with him. He is super attentive and has the nicest smile. I really appreciate how kind he is."}
{"text":"If you wait an hour to get seated, the food and service better be good.  Well the service was pretty poor.  At least the food was good once we all got it.  Also we were there for a birthday and the waitress knew it, but did noting special for it.  However she blew us off when we needed something to go and sing at another table."}
{"text":"I've always gone to this Olive Garden but this visit was very lackluster.  Halfway through my lunch I found a hair in my food.  They made me a new dish to go and didn't charge me for it which was nice.  I get things happen so i tried not to make a big deal out of it.  But then our drinks stayed empty most of the time, waitress did not check on us very much.  Had to ask a different waiter for my to go drink after we waited.  And the restaurant was not that busy.   Also got a to go order for my husband.  Stuffed mushrooms looked like they were literally just tossed in the container.  Service has fallen way off here."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the service (very friendly and attentive), food (tasted amazing!) and the atmosphere (fun and inviting).  It was a very pleasant experience.  I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and my husband ordered the Classic Lasagna.  Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Waitress forgot the wine and we have been waiting for our entre a long time."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in tonight for dinner and there was an open table in the bar area,  we sat at a booth and were greeted by Rome.. he was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! His personality is wonderful.  He is upbeat,  genuine,  friendly, fast, and honest!! He messed up my drink (I had no idea) and he not only admitted it,  but made me another on the house.  What a great person.  He literally made our day. I waited tables for a long time and Rome is definitely one of the best waiters I've ever had.  Thanks Rome we will definitely be back to see you!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Olive Garden, but it's still Olive Garden. People, don't get ahead of yourselves. 

This review is for Valentine's Day, 2010. This Olive Garden doesn't take reservations, like most Olive Gardens, so we waited an hour for our table like the rest of Summerlin. I took this as my excuse to get some alcohol in my system.

There were three bartenders on staff, which is not enough when you consider they were also mixing for the house. I am understanding, and felt my bartender gave service above and beyond, considering. I did not much care for the pom margarita, but it got the job done.

Which is basically what you can say of the food. It's good, but for the price we could go to a non-chain Italian place and get better food/better service.

I've been to this Olive Garden dozens of times. We'll go back, because this is where my parents like to eat, and this one has good service and food despite being the mega-church of Olive Garden. But there are better choices in this neighborhood for the price."}
{"text":"Don't like that the old faves from the menu are gone. Potatoes don't go with  Marsala. Server was not good. He rushed us."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and servers (sky and Richard) were awesome!!!!! 
They were professional, attentive, and great at their jobs as they had a full section including our table of 8!
When we had to settle the bill, we were redeeming a coupon for a free appetizer! 
The server informed us that the manager had to adjust the bill.
When the manager (JON) came to our table, he informed us that we could not redeem our coupon because it was not printed. We pointed out on the coupon that it reads \"to print OR show to server\" he said, \"we needed to show the entire email, or bring in a printed coupon.
So rather than being rude and surf my email in front of my guest. We settled our bill and took care of our excellent servers, however, we all agreed that the manager handled the situation very poorly and single handedly turned  a wonderful dining experience into a unpleasant embarrassing experience  we will not likely patronize again!"}
{"text":"Rotating Italian specials of all kinds, unlimited breadsticks, and unlimited soup make this a quite nice place to go eat. Breadsticks are quite yummy and addicting ... careful that you don't go overcow on them cuz you still have a meal to eat."}
{"text":"Call me unsophisicated if you want....but I love Olive Garden!  The lemon cake and the braised shortrib pasta are some of the best dishes I've had!"}
{"text":"Although, I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, I'm so impressed with the exceptional service at this location that I visit often with my family. Tonight, we were served by Jacob and he absolutely exceeded our expectations. As a family with 7 children, 5 under 7 years, servers are typically less than enthused to serve us. Jacob didn't skip a beat; he was committed to keeping the kids fed and entertained. If you're looking for a family-friendly environment, I highly recommend Jacob!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden used to be my most favorite restaurant. On a Wednesday night, the wait for two people was 30 minutes.  We chose to sit at the bar and got seated right away.  The nice part about sitting at the bar is the two TVs they have mounted, which were playing an NBA game. The bad thing is that you have to sit next to strangers. 

Service started out pretty well, we got our drinks, salad, breadsticks, and soup rather quickly. We didn't get our meals until much later though. It even tasted like our pasta was reheated; some parts of my fettuccine Alfredo were already stiff, not soft. Additionally, we never received our appetizer. I had to ask if they were working on it as we were receiving our entrees. The waiter stated that he thought we already received our appetizer. We decided to cancel it, but he said since the kitchen already started it, he would just take if off the bill and give it to us to go.

While this was a very nice gesture, I still didn't appreciate the wait and the reheated pasta. Olive Garden just isn't as good as it used to be, especially in regards to their food. I don't know if it's because I am a more choosy eater now or if their food has gotten worse. But, I didn't get food poisoning and the service wasn't the worst, so I'll give it three stars."}
{"text":"Reasons I go to Olive Garden: 

There is only 1 in CGY and it's in the NE
Waiters are nice and cute to look at 
Unlimited breadsticks and Salad
I like Italian food 

My current fave is Eggplant Parmigiana - comes with 4 strips of eggplant and a side of spaghetti with tomato.  I can't eat too much tomato so I order Angel Hair with Garlic Cream sauce..  ohhhhhhhhhhh so yummy!

Desserts are to die for:   I went with 4GF's and we ordered 4 desserts. Check out my pic: 

Zeppoli - Italian Donut
Tiramisu
Lemon Cream Cake
White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake

My favewas the Zeppoli"}
{"text":"I had the chicken scampi which was excellent . My mom ordered chicken Toscana that she loved.  Great service."}
{"text":"Wow ! 
We went here for my birthday dinner on 2/19. Our server was Vicki . She was amazing! From the start she was so nice and when my friend asked a question about an entrée she went into so much detail down to each kind of pasta he could order and how it is shaped. 
The food was amazing. My husband ordered the 4 course meal for 15.99. The breadsticks and salad alone can fill you up. The entrée was the mozzarella chicken and it was so good. I shared with my husband since I can not eat a whole meal and we still had leftovers to bring home. I will definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"I am very blessed and  fortunate to have had some great mentors in my life.

People that took the time out of their busy schedules to invest their knowledge, wisdom, talents, and resources on me so that I could better myself. 

I owe so much to their generous investments in my life. 

I am not arrogant enough to think that I am all that, knowing that it was humility and mentoring that got me to where I am at today.

It's 2017, and one of my long time mentors contacted me to catch up on my progress and to see how my family and I were doing. This gentleman has been in business for over 50 years, and is highly respected in the business community. 

His reputation and character are impeccable, and it was through him that doors of opportunity were opened for me to meet many of the who's who in the Valley. I definitely owe much of my good fortune to this gentleman. 

And the fact he contacted me directly as his friend, and didn't have one of his secretaries do it, was a great honor for me.

We could have dined for lunch anywhere, but since he was on his way to the west side, he chose a place that was easily accessible. That's how we wound up in this particular Olive Garden. No, it's not the Capital Grille, Eddie V's, Durant's, Fleming's, or any of the other elevated dining experience places. However, this establishment has a charm all its own.

The location is a little challenging to get to, even though it is easily visible from the freeway. There is no real frontage road entrance, and you have to cut through the gas station to get here; but its seclusion means less traffic to contend with.It's a typical Olive Garden, with a familiar look and feel. Inviting, but not ostentatious. It's an elevated family restaurant, serving decent Italian food with ample seating for many patrons.

Although, we had a plethora of meal options; we opted for the least intrusive, yet satisfyingly palatable. He had the salad, and I had a lunch portion spaghetti, and a minestrone soup.
I would be doing less talking, and more listening anyway (including taking notes); so I figured I better keep the portions to a minimum.

Our server was simply a delight, because she instinctively knew that we weren't there to really eat much. Therefore, she kept a low profile and interruptions to a minimum.

I didn't ask how the salad was because that was irrelevant. However, I will say that the soup definitely hit the spot on a cold day such as this one was in Phoenix. And the spaghetti was quite flavorful. It didn't taste like Prego or some other package concoction - which was a great surprise to me since I haven't dined here in ages.

All in all, it was a great dining experience, but an even great learning experience for me. It was definitely a great atmosphere for a lunch and learn!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden, ( or The OG as the nimrods call it) the food is a slap in the face to true Italians and foodies alike.  There are far better places in Las Vegas for traditional Italian food, you have to look outside the box and a chain restaurant is hardly the place to find great food. Olive Garden is just the Italian Denny's.  Try Roma Deli or Nora's Italian Cuisine for a true taste delight."}
{"text":"I use to love this place but the past two times I've been there I was very disappointed the food was cold it looked like it was sitting out  for a while. My frozen drinks where not frozen anymore when they brought it to my table it looked like the ice had melted already the presentation was pretty bad.
The service was not the best. I would not be coming back again at least to not this location even tho is 5min away from my house I rather do the drive and go to the Cheyenne location."}
{"text":"This my favorite restaurant. Staff is always polite. Food is delicious. And the prices are reasonable. How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Went to olive garden last night with the family and the service was incredible. We received our food within minutes and never had to ask for refills for our drinks the server made sure we were fine. Had the endless pasta corkscrew with the 5 cheese sauce with grilled chicken the first dish. The second dish ate maybe one bite and took it home. Woke up to enjoy my left overs and found a hair in it."}
{"text":"I normally don't like chain restaurants, but I do like eating at the Olive Garden in Greentree.  The food is pretty good here and the service is always excellent.  Although not my first choice, still quite okay."}
{"text":"We visit this location often. They are usually able to check you in quickly and get you seated.  The servers are well trained and efficient so food will be in your belly quickly.  The food is standard Olive Garden offering's with deals and specials being offered through there email and text programs. I recommend signing up to see if any deals might influence you to check out this location."}
{"text":"I'm usually the one to write a negative comment....but I had the wrost service tonight with everyone I came in contact with....
1st start off with the call...
I called around 5:45pm (got placed on hold for 5mins) the girl came on the phone I told her that I had a party of 9 coming around 7-7:15pm...she told me they don't have a reservation list but they will put my name down on the wait list so when I get there, there might be a little wait....me being in the industry I understand I just wanted them to know what's going on...it was my sisters birthday and I understand, it's someone's birthday everyday understandable.....but jeez lie to me...all she told me was it doesn't matter if they know or not....kind of thrown me off
The next thing
When I got there round 7ish....
I went to check in....Hostess told me they never got my name or my size of a party...so I told her I called she said it doesn't matter at that point my name is not on the list....I can either be on it or not??? She said I couldn't be pushed up on the list that wouldn't be fair? Ummmm I called....so I ended up getting on the list and got told I had to wait 50mins?! 
Next
We got sat around 8:10pm....hour later....server did not stop by til 10mins later...took our drink order...didn't come back til 15mins later with just half of our drinks only....while she's dropping our 1st half we told her whenever she's ready we are ready to order...she said ok...left came back with the 2nd half...still missing 1 drink BTW...she end up disappearing for 5 mins...finally came back to get our order....then 15mins later comes with our salads, 1 soup....with 3 soups missing?! Then another 10 mins 3 other soups come out.....we ask for a 2nd Bowl of salad...never got it...20mins later our food comes....1 of my guest order his steak...rare to med rare....came out well....he was fine....the 3 chicken Alfredos that came out end up being super dry....nothing was wrost til my dish came out...my chicken was raw...my stomach is the strong but not that strong....I had to run to get my bf so while they remade my food ....when I came back I just end up just boxing up my same food....same bc it's the same piece just burnt now....
At this point I'm over it....I had to leave before my friends....I had called 1 of my guests to get me a receipt...supposedly they can't reprint?! So 1 of my friend ask the server for a manager...she (Lisa) came over and ask my friend what does she want? She explained what happened to Lisa and she was getting all irritated and ask what does she want? My friend said she didn't know but she feels like I should of get something, anything ....it's not our fault chicken was raw....Lisa got mad and left the table and end up coming back and threw my friend the $18...beats the purpose.....my group didn't end up leaving til 1opm
So overall horrible ....."}
{"text":"I love this location.  Just finished up a wonderful dinner with the family, and seriously had amazing service.  Jerry and Nathan went above and beyond making sure we enjoyed our food and experience. It's great to see the staff working together, because it always makes the atmosphere more friendly and inviting.  Nate was awesome, made sure we left as full as possible and had everything we wanted- plus he genuinely made us feel like we were all old friends.  Jerry won my kiddos over, and for me -well-  you can't impress me more than when you treat my kids like they are important! The two of them were a great team, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good pasta place in the East Valley, avoid the Olive Garden at all costs. I just spent over $50 for a meal that was utterly lousy. I can't believe the amount of people that eat there and think the food is decent. The breadsticks and salad are the only good thing. I tried the appetizer that was fried like lasagna and it was terrible. Greasy and it tasted more like grease than the actual dish. I had chicken parmigiana and the taste was average and the pasta was the same. My wife had some type of spaghetti and asked if it could be made spicy and they said with the shaker stuff you put on pizza. She ate about a quarter of the dish. If you're looking for something cheaper or priced equally I can give you a list of names. I'm spoiled; I grew up with grandma and my mother making Italian stuff from scratch. At 80 plus, my mom still makes it. In Tempe, go to Vinci Torios on Elliott and McClintock. In Ahwatukee go to Arrivederci on Chandler Blvd. If you're in downtown Chandler, go to Crust or LaStalla. All of these places make Olive Garden taste like fast food"}
{"text":"I recently received a a Red Lobster gift card and it said that it could be used at Olive Garden.  I forgot that the two are no longer affiliated  (Darden sold Red Lobster last year), but I received the card this past Christmas and it still said it could be used at OG, so I planned to use it.  I ordered online and the site said my order would be ready at 7 and to pick it up at the hostess stand; neither were true.  I arrived at the restaurant at 7:00, waited 5 minutes at the hostess stand and then was directed to the bar area that a small \"To Go\" sign that was not at all separated from the bar patrons.  There were several couples in there who said they were doing a bar crawl from Red Lobster to OG to Applebee's to Hooter's.  Wow, only in Charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl.  One of the patrons tried paying with a Red Lobster gift card and it did not work.  That's when I realized mine would not work either, but I feel it should still be honored since it says it on the card.  

Anyway, after waiting another 20 minutes for my order (almost a total of an hour and half since I ordered it) and listening to screaming children and crying babies, I realized  why I haven't dined at an OG in years (besides the ridiculously long wait times).  

The food was actually accurate.   The iceberg salads were huge.  It's OG though, so neither were anything spectacular.  It saved me from cooking and doing dishes though.

Again, there are just too many real Italian restaurants in the area without screaming babies and hour long waits that serve flavorful food at reasonable prices (Portofino's and Docle come to mind) to deal with Olive Garden.  I would go for a to go order IF I had a gift card, but that's about it.  I will never go to OG on my own accord.  If I were going to a corporate chain Italian restaurant, it would be Carabba's.  Food is fresher and  they don;t have as many loud kids."}
{"text":"Our server was really nice. I have no complaints about the service this time or last so I think the chain has improved a lot in that department. They constantly offer new desserts and entrees so the brand is developing in the right direction. I love zuppa toscana. The gnocchi soup is pretty good as well. The linguine with mussels and shrimp is a new seafood entree and it was pretty decent"}
{"text":"I love food. I especially love Italian food and would jump for the chance to go to Carrabbas Italian Grill, however I am always up for new things.  On Thursday, April 12, my Soldier came home and Olive Garden was suggested. Of course I agreed being that it was advertised as great Italian food. This was not the thoughts that I left with at the end of the night. Olive Garden does attract many customers so it was unsurprising that we had to wait about fifteen minutes before being seated. Once we were seated we were greeted by a kind waiter who took all of our drink orders. At this time there were six of us getting something to drink so I guess this would mean it should take extra time to fill and serve all six drinks. I didn't think anything of it. He took our orders and proceeded to run away into the back kitchen. The food took an excruciating amount of time to get to us which is slightly annoying, especially where an 18 month child is concerned. Once again I brushed it off as soon as I saw him bob his head out of the kitchen and sat each plate with its respective consumer. I was dissatisfied, as was everyone else, with the food because it looked as though it had sat under a hot lamp for an extended period of time which indicates that we should have had our food sooner but something else most likely got in the way. At this time the waiter had also noticed our drinks were on E and needed to be refilled which was nice of him until we received them right before we wanted to leave. As he brought our drinks, we asked for the check. He must have really wanted us to be hydrated because we didn't receive our check until our second round of drinks was nearly finished. At this point it was already far passed the child's bed time and she was on the verge of throwing a fit. We still had food we wanted to bring home and were stupid enough to ask for boxes. It had gotten to the point where I would have gladly gotten up and found the to go boxes myself for us to fill and leave. Unfortunately, my Soldier would not allow me to do so. What I did do however was tip below 15% as the child was not the only angry person at the table. Would not suggest going during the night but I may try again during a slower day."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing. Our waiter was helpful and had a positive attitude, which is always appreciated. They offered us more breadsticks whenever we were done eating the ones we already had. They are respectful and do their job well. I love this place so much and have become a fan. Their food is delicious. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is welcoming. They have plenty of options on their menu to choose from. Some of their food is healthy too so that's a bonus. Their food is full of amazing flavors and is tasty. I would definitely recommend Olive Garden to people. Many people already love Olive Garden because of the food and service. It's a great place to eat.

Their breadsticks are great and so are their soups. The food is well prepared and always hot and fresh. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The service was fast. It's a good place to go to talk with someone as well. It's an enjoyable environment. I love going here to eat."}
{"text":"Been to location a few times. I'm Italian and love this type of food. Service is also great :) Thank u Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Yes...I know. Olive Garden is Olive Garden. We all know that and yet we all still go to this commercialized restaurant. We have been frequenting this location since 2007 and last night we had the best experience we have ever had at this restaurant. It is always hit and miss. Sometimes the entree is on but the breadsticks are off or sometimes the drinks are good, the appetizer is bad and the service is awful. Well I will say....last night this Olive Garden redeemed themselves! 
We had no kids so we were excited to go out for a quiet dinner. We decided to go a bit later than usual to avoid the mad wait.      We were seated at 8:30 PM. We ordered a glass of red wine and a mudslide...both delicious! Off to a great start. Then came the always fabulous salad and breadsticks. They were both on tonight! Fresh and hot breadsticks and a super ice cold salad. Then came our entrees...cheese ravioli with a meat sauce and cheese ravioli in a white Alfredo sauce. Both right on and superb! Our server was Jessica and she was great as well! 
We know we can't always count on a great experience every time but we will definitely give this restaurant another shot in the near future."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here before. Never had a bad time but no good times that we could remember. Until tonight, we came in on a busy Friday night and were seated almost immediately. We were seated in Olivia's section, she was very nice and what a true waitress should be. We wanted for nothing the whole time we were there.  After having so many bad experiences other places the simple caring attentiveness we received blew us away.  As a mater a fact it seemed like all of the waitresses we encountered while eating were super polite and a pleasure to be around. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just ok- headed here to meet my wife and daughter on a Friday for a quick dinner. Got there at 5:30 on the dot and there was a 15 -20 min wait , which turned out to be only 15min . 
Our server was very friendly and nice however she didn't come around much and the food took extremely long to come out. I have worked at a restaurant so I can't blame her for the slow food  its usually the cooks. The menu is not very impressive either it's over filled with chicken - it seemed like there was an over abundance of chicken entries. I opted to get the grilled tilapia and shrimp which was very very bland. The shrimp was very small and the tilapia was pretty dry. So at the end of the day-- friendly but slow service, poor menu and poor food quality."}
{"text":"really nice family restaurant or for a not so expensive date ;) 

we came a party of 4 plus a baby after shopping in the area, with no reservations. and waited about a half hour because of their popularity. but it was worth the wait!!! i have only eaten at olive garden less than 5 times but this time i wanted to try an entry other than appetizers. i ordered the chicken and shrimp carbonara. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! had a very creamy sauce the noodles were thick and soft, the jumbo shrimp and and grilled chicken complimented the thick creamy sauce and top of the dish, there was crunchy bacon bits and my favorite sun-dried tomatoes!!!!! yuuuummayyy! i also go to try the zuppa soup which also rich in flavor including the kale, which i didn't know tasted so good! the staff was very kind and we're prompt with service. they kindly ask for refills of water, bread and also checked up on us and our meals just enough times. lastly, upon receiving the bil, you get complimentary Andies mint chocolate! mmmm!"}
{"text":"What is it?:
The Olive Garden is an Italian-American resturaunt chain. This specific resturaunt has tables, booths, and a bar. Mostly booths, though. It has takeout but no delivery. The Olive Garden's bar and tables are not like ordinary resturaunt bars and tables. While there are some dinner specific tables in the resturaunt itself, there are several \"cafe\" tables right near the bar. The bar and these tables are both waited on. You can order your food while sitting at the bar or at the tables! This being said, if you can compromise slightly fancier dinner tables for a \"cafe\" table, you can save yourself quite a long wait. I would suggest that if the place is crowded, you ask to get a table near the bar.

The Menu:
At the Olive Garden, they serve mostly American dishes with Italian accents. However, I decided to skip all the fancy Italian crap and go straight for the meat! A wonderful 12 oz. steak with \"Tuscan\" potatoes and bell peppers under the menu name \"Steak Toscano.\" You might be thinking: \"Where can you go wrong with steak?\" Well, you can't really, but I have had better. I wouldn't advize Olive Garden to pride themselves on their steak, but it's certainly nothing to be ashamed of. The potatoes weren't outstanding either, but they were definately a good complement to the steak. Being the picky eater I am, I held off on the bell peppers. For every meal you can have either soup or salad and breadsticks are delivered as a default appetizer. The breadsticks are unlimited, but I'm not entirely sure if the same goes for the soup or salad.

If I went again, I would try their \"Mixed Grill\" which consists of \"Skewers of grilled marinated steak and chicken with a rosemary demi-glace, served with grilled vegetables and Tuscan potatoes.\" Sounds good to me!

The Wait:
If you are hungry and need food NOW, don't come here. Since it's located in rural Pittsburgh, which has an enormous rate of Italian descent, the place is always busy. Maybe I'm a little bit biased, but why do people need their food RIGHT AWAY anyway? I'll be happy to stick around for up to an hour to recieve my food. In France people go to a resturaunt at around 8:00 PM and eat around 10:00 PM. For them eating is an experience, not just a way to fill your belly.

Overview:
All-in-all, the Olive Garden gets 4 stars out of 5 for their slightly over-standard food and on-par waitress/waitoring. I've been visiting this resturaunt throughout my whole life and I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal here.

Sorry for the boring review, I'm just too lazy to really spice things up today."}
{"text":"Love all the options
We had the all you can eat soup and entrée deal for $7.99.
Had the chicken soup, remind me of my grandma's chicken and dumplings, yummy. Hubby had the sausage soup, he loved it. And the breadsticks omg they were fresh and good.
The Mediterranean flatbreads was good as well as the chicken piadina.
Get there early to avoid the lunch time rush."}
{"text":"First things first, I LOVE Olive Garden. I've been told that's sacreligious because I'm half Italian, but good food is good food.  Lucky for me, I got to try twelve rounds of Olive Garden delicacies in this newly remodeled McIntyre Square location as part of a Yelp Elite event . I am SO glad I wore stretchy pants. I'm surprised I didn't have to ask my fellow Yelpers to roll me to my car when we were finished!

This was my first time dining at this particular location, so I can't speak for what it looked like previously... but I can tell you that the new renovations are wonderful.  It's bright and airy but still has that authentic rustic Italian feel to it.  

Now for the food: we started off by sampling the new appetizers -- I think my favorite was the fried mozzarella! The breading is very light and didn't overshadow the oozy and delicious mozzarella inside like some fried mozzarella apps do. I also enjoyed the shrimp fresca, which is served with a dipping sauce that had a lovely little kick to it, and the chicken piadina app, which was like an Italian quesadilla. My favorite dish overall was the chicken and broccoli pot pie entree. A pot pie at an Italian restaurant you say? Yep! The delicious golden crust blanketed the cavatappi, crisp broccoli, tender chicken, and that aaaamaaazing OG alfredo sauce. I would definitely consider ordering this as an entree. It's a bit difficult to share just because it's hard to transfer a spoonful from the serving plate to your own, but who said I was gonna share it? :) 

We also got to sample the new Northern Tour of Italy, though by this point in the meal I was rather stuffed and only able to pick a few bites from the trifecta. Needless to say, when they placed the grand finale in front of me, the Sicilian cheesecake with strawberry sauce, I miraculously found room for a few more bites. Definitely do yourself a favor and order a slice of this ricotta goodness.

If you haven't figured it out yet, the new menu items are amazing and Olive Garden continues to be one of my favorite restaurants. The staff at this location are nothing short of rockstars: from the managers and corporate representatives that were on hand to the wait staff and kitchen staff that we had the honor of thanking at the end of the night.  Five stars all around!"}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden. And when I get a soup craving, I always choose the chicken gnocchi. Went in this evening for a quick soup salad and breadsticks combo. It took about 5 minutes of standing at the host counter before I saw anyone that worked in the restaurant. After I sat at a high top in the bar area, no one approached me. I attempted to order from the kiosk but you can't order anything besides apps and desserts so after 10 minutes I left. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything about our visit here was good. We stopped in after some shopping and were promptly seated and server came right over to get drinks and take our order. Food came out quickly as ordered and both were pleased with our meal. Always been a Olive Garden fan and this was no exception as everything was delightful"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Really wish we had one in Oahu! Our servers were on it! Thank you for working it out and fitting in our party of 9!"}
{"text":"The Chianti braised short ribs.
Yummo!

You can be a chain restaurant and a good restaurant at the same time.
And Olive Garden proves it time and time again.

I love how often they change up their menu and I almost always try the \"something new\" they have to offer."}
{"text":"I have loved Olive Garden for years. I love their Fettuccine Alfredo, chicken parmesan, salad and bread sticks. I usually never try anything new, but I did. Their Stuffed Cheese Ravioli. Sorry, but it was gross. Hard and way too much plopped in my bowl. I took one bite and all I could taste was hard pasta. It was sad. I was sad. I'll never order that again so I'll stick with what I like. One thing that bothers me is when they sit a couple next to a huge party with crying babies. Can't hear the music playing or enjoy our meal at all. But hey..we can't always get what we want."}
{"text":"Service was really good and food was typical Olive Garden.  It was hot, fresh and served quickly.  Very much enjoyed & appreciated the excellent server Dustin."}
{"text":"This is a good OG, it gets busy in the evenings and on the weekends but it's a standard shot."}
{"text":"An upgrade from their previous Metro Center location.  Atmosphere is brighter and very family friendly.  Food was excellent, and there is always enough variety on the menu to keep it fresh and interesting.  Our waitress (Abra) would receive 5 stars if yelp would allow it.  The entire wait staff at the restaurant worked as a team to ensure customers were served quickly and courteously.  The restaurant was immaculate from the dining room to the restrooms. Chocolate Mousse cake was to die for!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Olive Garden for quite a long time, but we were not disappointed by coming back.  The food was hot and delicious and came out quickly.  Our server was Brittany and she was great.  She was very friendly, helpful and knowlegable about the menu.  We will Definately be back again!!"}
{"text":"To start off we were sitting for over 20 min waiting for our server and to greet us for drinks and then my wife orders a glass of 661 pinot nore wine and she was given a cheaper wine! So she asked him to get her the rite one! Then we ordered our food and we ordered a full size order of spaghetti for the 3 kids to split and asked for extra plates! Well my order got to the table and he brought a kids order of spaghetti and no extra plates then he said he would bring out the rite one! Then he grabbed the cheese shredder and asked if I wanted shredded cheese and started to grind it and dumped it on to the floor and filled up my new shoe with cheese! Then everyone at the table had empty drinks and he walked by our table 3 or 4 times without asking if we needed a refill so we had to ask for a refill! Very poor service and my kids always look forward to the minute they give you at the end of your dinner which we also never received or an apology for any of the mistakes! We will probably never come back to this location! We have been coming here for over 10 years and I would not be surprised if everyone that Hugo serves food too does the same thing! I just hope that management does something about it before they lose any more customers ! Stay away from HUGO section!"}
{"text":"I dined here with co-workers earlier this year and i was very impressed. I have been trying to get my Wife to try it for lunch one day with me, but she refused. Our perception of OG from the past wasn't very positive at all, but it had been many years since we had visited. I finally convinced Alina to try it, and I'm happy she agreed. I don't like Italian food for 2 reasons: I don't eat red sauce, and I don't eat pasta. I do however like their salads, so I usually order that. Alina order the fettuccine alfredo, with the all you can eat soup and breadsticks. They have these cool boxes on the table where you can order your own apps and desserts, we used it to order the Spicy Shrimp Scampi Fritta. It was delivered quickly, along with breadsticks. I wasn't a fan of the shrimp, the sauce a little salty for my taste, but Alina must have enjoyed it because she sopped it all up with her breadsticks. My salad was good as usual, the lettuce was especially crunchy. That's a good thing. Alina really loved her pasta. Kind of made me a hero for bringing her. We skipped dessert, and when I asked for an order of breadsticks to go, the waiter (who was very new btw) left and came right back with an order in a 2go bag. 

Lunch was great, mainly because my Wife enjoyed hers so much. Thanks Olive Garden for scoring some brownie points for me, I can usually use them."}
{"text":"This is probably the best in town. Kaylyn helped me and gave me great service and she has such a great personality! Keep up the good work I'll come back and ask to see her anytime!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go from this location and was not happy. Both my pasta and my finances pasta did not have enough sauce and my soup did not have a single gnocchi in it, it also only had one piece of chicken. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because at least the food was hot and correct I guess."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for dinner kinda late about 30 min before closing We sat at bar and Kyle welcomed us! We got soup and salad and a glass of wine And were highly entertained  for over an hour never felt rushed! Kyle was awesome gave great service and even got us fresh breadsticks! Yum!!  ****Spoil alert*** he great voice!  Would def pick this olive garden over any other in vegas!"}
{"text":"A sucker for olive garden! It's yummy food. Today my waitress was jus great at this location."}
{"text":"If you find a server that cares... you can have a great time... if not... ugh!

Lunch served by Josh was a fast, funny, and he suggested a to go cup for my iced tea... he cared about what we didn't want in our salad and rattled off the soup options and descriptions with ease.

We haven't found a dinner server... from  Thanksgiving to New Years it's almost impossible to get a table anyway... with all the shopping in the area this seems to be one of the favorite places of grumpy shoppers.

The food quality has been going down hill... our last dinner I ordered shrimp alfredo and was horrified at the few popcorn shrimp that managed to make it into the bowl... we stick with the salad and soup now."}
{"text":"The food should look like the pictures. If I order cheese cake it should look like the picture and not like this. Purée vs a real strawberry sauce."}
{"text":"Best  Italiana Food, better than Magiannos on the Streep. Price, food quality and service!"}
{"text":"Great food...  Friendly Happy Fun Server Alison.  Great Time.  Definitely I would come back"}
{"text":"Food is always great I love going there during lunch. But just make sure you dint get Anthony as a waiter he is rude bring you the wrong food plate and tell you \"oh you ain't adventurist why didn't you eat it. \" He didn't gives us a copy of receipt and was mad because of no tip!"}
{"text":"From 6/6/15
After passing this Olive Garden location numerous times, we decided go in and get some pasta. For being a Saturday evening, it wasn't as super packed as we thought it would be which was nice because that meant we did not have to wait long for our food. 

We were seated right away; then our server came out with a wine sample of Chardonnay. Unfortunately, I cannot recall the name, which might be because I was not in a wine mood that night-  which is weird for me not to want wine, but I digress hahaha. 

We ordered the Calamari as our appetizer, for our main course my boyfriend got the Sausage Stuffed Giant Rigatoni; I ordered Lasagna. Everything was fantastic, and we were satisfied with out dishes.
Our server was awesome and checked up on us regularly, plus she was quick and friendly. We will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"love love love went again today...had famous bread sticks and salad and great ziti"}
{"text":"So I had lunch here today and ordered the soup
And salad. While eating the sausage spinach potato soup, I felt something hard in my mouth. 1/8\" and white. I figured, ok, soups good, got whatever it was out, maybe none from sausage. Didn't complain. Kept eating, waitress comes by and asks how everything is. Had a spoonful of soup in my mouth and just that instant there was another hard piece of whatever. I put it in my bread plate next to the first one and showed her. She said\" it's probably from the sausage.\" Took the plate with the two little chunks and left. Never heard another word. Glad I didn't bite down on them, would have been a dental bill for sure! I'm not impressed to say the least. Letting you know, so beware!"}
{"text":"This place hasn't disappointed me ever. Bigger portions compared to the W Charleston location across Red rock casino and my parents prefer to come here as well. I highly recommend the baked Parmesan shrimp, shrimp, pasta, Alfredo sauce and breadcrumbs sprinkled on top is amazing! I try to get something new every time and this time I got that plate. It's new so I hope they keep it on there for good. This place has extremely nice staff and everything is clean inside. The location is a little ehh but this restaurant is great."}
{"text":"We visited for dinner. The restaurant was not busy. We decided to sit at the bar. Multiple open tables but needed cleaning. We decided to wait for opening the table. While waiting some impatient kids tried to grab the table. Front desk was watching but didn't do anything. 

We appreciate the waitress who helped clarified and also provided good service. 

The front desk was unfriendly and not helpful at all."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious food as always. I wasn't too hungry and decided to go for the Unlimited Soup/Salad. The Chicken Gnocchi and Minestrone Soups were delicious for a cold night out."}
{"text":"Still waiting on my food 5:30-6:18 no food. Not sure what the problem is. 7 empty tables in my area alone. You can just have so much bread till you're over it. 6:21 arrived."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good time here last night. Free small glass of wine which was a full one for me because Bryan gave me his. Started with risotto balls which were pretty good. They were much more crunchy then I thought they were going to be. They were premiering a new menu so there was several new dishes on the menu. To go with my main dish i choose the chicken and gnocchi soup . It was a little salty but still good. The waitress also brought a bowl out for my little man which he was happy about. My main dish was chicken in a wine sauce with risotto. The risotto was a little under cooked but was still pretty good. Chose not to get dessert and will be having leftovers for lunch today. Wasn't the best italian I've ever had but wasn't the worst either. The waitress also brought us extra mints which was very nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I wen't out to dinner last, the wait was 45 minutes on a Saturday night. We sat out side as there was no waiting.....The host was way to talkie...He needs to stick to point and don't turn a simple Question in to a conversation... our app was wrong we ordered Mozz. and stuffed ravioli, they brought out the ravioli and calamari... I'm pretty sure the used   they used the same ravioli when they finally brought it out.... the ravioli  and the mozz. was not hot at all. The salad and bread sticks were really good, I had the pasta fagioli soup, and ordered the Penne di Mare, a pasta dish with shrimp and scallops.  They used baby shrimp for this dish, not a good choice. As for the scallops, they were barley the size of a dime. There were 2 scallops in the entire dish.. If your first 2 ingredients in a dish are shrimp and scallops, then it should be a dish based on those 2 items.  The soup and pasta were good, but it seamed everything on the menu was under seasoned. I would not have known this was olive garden, by the flavor of the food.  The service wasn't bad....but no one is known for their customer service anymore... Just another chain Restaurant, average food you pay for the name."}
{"text":"Love this place. Heather the manager made sure everything was great. Service and food was well worth the wait
Will make it back as much as possible"}
{"text":"Another great experience at the Tempe Olive Garden. We've been eating there for years and their great service and food is the reason why! Last night we just did take out and I'm always impressed by how quickly our food is ready and the presentation when we pick it up Love the salad containers with sections for salad dressing and parm."}
{"text":"We're still at 3 stars. 2.5 if I could. 

We were in over the weekend for Soup, Salad and Bread Sticks. It was an interesting experience. While our server was over the top nice, she was also over the top awkward. She tried so darn hard to be good but it left us all feeling uncomfortable. I won't go into many specifics but she needs to tone it down and just let us enjoy our lunch without a bunch of theatrics. (I will not leave her name)

We received our salad first and when that came my father asked for our soup as well since we prefer having them together. We all finished our salads and sat there for a while before we received our soup (despite hearing it was coming multiple times). 

When we left we all stood there in shock at how uncomfortable that lunch was. Between the server and a few other events. We will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"We had great service tonight from Charles. He warned us the kitchen was backed up but managed to get our food out quickly, in order, and at correct temps. 
     Our wait was longer than we were told it would be but Charles more than made up for that with excellent service!"}
{"text":"I never my first time having Olive Garden. You see growing up my parents always made my brother and I get Fazolis. There really is nothing wrong with Fazoli's however Olive Garden had given me high expectations with it's commercials over the years. I always wanted to go there, finally I did go there and I like it. (The east side on to be exact). 

Then I moved to Middleton and started dining at this Olive Garden. I've never been super impressed by the food to be honest. However the service has always been pretty good. They've been good about coming back and checking beverages in a timely manner which I appreciate greatly. 

I'd say go to Biaggi's instead, a little more pricier, but the food seems to have more taste."}
{"text":"Wow! Incredible catering service from Kalley & Beth who did a great job fixing an issue we had with our order due to website glitch. They set up beautifully with a tablecloth included! They were very nice, understanding, helpful & provided all around excellent service! I would highly recommend catering through Olive Garden & especially through this location with such great staff & management! Thank you both so much for helping us with a successful event!"}
{"text":"The good service at OG is inconsistent at best, IMHO but tonight was great. Josh was our server, fully paid attention to us, asked what was important to us to make our meal good and checked back with us frequently - sometimes would just check with a look. He was patient and respectful with all of us but especially with my 95 year old dad, a Navy PT boat, WWII veteran who may move slow but still worthy of respect. So Josh gets high points. So why the reason for the 4 instead of 5? The hostess was distant, aloof - not connecting with us. My soap box always is customer service - adopt a warm attitude, have a smile that includes your eyes and whatever the customer needs, no matter how busy it is or how trivial it sends to you, respond like it and they are the most important thing to you. Hey, Josh did it and made it look easy - maybe because he genuinely cares. We will be back and we'll all for this server."}
{"text":"One reviewer wrote \"what do you expect? It's OG\". And in a way, he's right. You know what you're getting when you come here, decent food, great salad and amazing bread sticks. I had dinner here last night, the first time at this OG but have been to several in my time. Last night was one of those perfect times in the restaurant, high energy, lots of conversations and positive vibes. Walking in, I knew it was going to be fun. And it was. And guess who my server was??? Think Spiderman, the comic book. Yes! It was Stan Lee. He looked a bit younger than I thought he would be but after a glass of wine, I could see it...When I needed to tweak my order and was hesitant, trying to think of how to say what I needed, he suggested exactly what I wanted. It's nice when the wait staff takes time to chat, not too long and at the expense of other customers, but enough to...connect. And he brought me extra chocolate which made the evening complete :) So go here, sit in a little corner and have Stan Lee regale you with tales about Spiderman and prepare to have fun. Thanks, Stan Lee!

Just as an added note, i have never worked in the restaurant industry. What I do know is the importance of recognition. When your hostess seats you, ask her how her evening is going. They don't often get to connect and it helps to acknowledge the work they are doing as well. But that's just IMHO."}
{"text":"I came to bring My sister here because italian is her favorite food. I walked in asked for a table an in 5 minutes they found us a table. We waited a few minutes for the waiter to come to the table but it was worth it. She had an amazing attitude and she loved children which was awsome since we had come with 3 kids. Food was delicious. It been a long time since I had come here and Im happy I did. Highly recommended  the place."}
{"text":"This place was okay. I was there on a Wednesday night for dinner, and I was in town for the first time for some business, but it took way to long to get seated as a single. There were a few couples who were seated before me that arrived after me, and one party of 4, which I think is BS.

The overall food was fine. The all you can eat soup/salad is good. I like the creamy one, whatever that is with the small dumpling things. Those were pretty good.

The servers were a little too polite, on the point of being obnoxious. I get it, you called me sir. I didn't ask you to throw rosepetals at my feet."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Olive Gardens for over 20 years and usually a minimum of one to two  times per week. I always love their food and the service is usually great.. it's a dinner we as a family all agree on! But the last few times things have not been as great as Always in the past. The first thing I experienced is they quit putting peaches in their peach tea. That was the one drink I craved weekly! It was the little extras that made it special. Then they stopped serving the chocolate mints which came with the bill. Our family loved those mints! And the final straw is when our family of four ordered four dinners and got a bowl of salad that was a quarter filled. The waitress was embarrassed and said she would put in for a refill right away but that was the rule from the kitchen... smaller portions and make them ask for the refill.. Really?  When our dinner came I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and they forgot to put red sauce and so by the time I got my dinner the rest of the family was finished and there I was... eating all by myself. I wanted a breadstick but the waitress never came back to ask if we needed anything else... and to end it she came back with the bill but never asked us if we wanted dessert... which we usually always split the lemon or black mousse tie cake, we had a very disappointing dinner and don't feel Olive Garden puts the special touch that made them so well loved  as in the past. Two stars cuz the food is really good even if they cut the portions."}
{"text":"Woooooow what a complete change!! I was sooo impressed. Husband dragged me in here with our youngest and I must say I dread even walking into this place because of past service issues.
  However to my surprise the server was absolutely amazing. He was very attentive,  extremely great customer service. Took time explaining certain highlights on the menu and didn't have us waiting long at all to get our food or drinks. This Olive Garden has done some serious changing in their quality of staff and customer service. Even the general Manager Michael was excellent and very customer service oriented. Great Job Olive garden for making these changes and turning around our past experiences. Our server Nathan great great job!!!!"}
{"text":"Very upsetting experience with the service last night, 12/23/17.  Checked in our party of 3 online. When I got to the restaurant to check in with the hostess, I verified my check-in information and she gave me a buzzer, told me my wait was 5-10 mins wait. Ok cool, I was expecting a longer wait since there were a lot of people waiting outside. Well 30 mins went by and nothing. Figured they were busy so we didn't say anything. After 45 mins of waiting we finally go to follow up and the hostess tells us we were called a long time ago and we weren't on the list anymore! (Umm hello! We still have your buzzer in hand!) We waited right outside the front doors and our buzzer never went off nor did anyone go outside to call ANY parties. 

We were finally seated and we decided to order our food right away with our drinks since we were way ready to order. We got our drinks in a reasonable amount of time (it was just 3 waters). However our soup and breadsticks took forever! It was finally brought at the same time with our main entree, which then was slightly cold by the time we got to eating it. Our chicken was pretty much burnt as well. Our waitress was okay, hard to understand her as she spoke so softly. She did refill our drinks and asked us if we wanted more soup. 

No \"thank you for coming\" walking out the door either. Almost felt ignored this visit. We get it, it's busy around this time of year and we try to be as patient as possible but service was poor. Not sure if to ever go here again or just drive a little further to 75th Ave instead. Never had an experience last this at Olive Garden before."}
{"text":"Great place for quick comfort food. Had Jason as a server and he was Grrrreat! On top of the refills of drinks, soup and salad. He even packaged the left overs and brought us a bag. Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"The food was good, service was horrible from both the waiters and the manager! They really need to work on their customer service. We went in today and there was a bitten tomato slice in our salad. The manager didn't believe it came out of the kitchen like that. Didn't apologize or anything. The waiter was upset because we told him to remove it from our bill, when we didn't even eat the salad after we found  he bitten tomato. What a shame that their customer service is BAD."}
{"text":"I come here a lot but today will be my last and not because of the workers but because of guest. My disabled son was not only laughed for having autism but he the race card was also played. All I asked was for the people to please keep it down and wow oh wow was it a fight. Your in a public family place have respect for the other families around you. I'm so over the race bs  and ignorance around us it's sad it really is"}
{"text":"This place has gone wayyy downhill. Ew. 


We never go to old chain restaurants like this, in fear of situations like this. My husband and I actually only went because we had received a giftcard for our wedding. Sure enough, we left feeling sick to our stomachs. 

The service was fine. No complaints. But everything else was poor. The salad and soup were just okay. Good dressing, but iceberg lettuce, which in itself tells a lot about the cut in quality of the food. 

The breadsticks--so disappointing. I used to LOVE those things. Now they have a weird texture and taste like they are just devoid of any flavor. It's so hard to explain, but they were gross. 

Then we received our entrees. You could tell they had gotten the steamed veggies from a bag, and the chicken. WHAT IS IT? It is not chicken, I swear to you. It was very squishy and didn't taste right. We were really disgusted actually and didn't touch it after the first few bites.

We paid for our meal in those new table tablets (don't know why you would spend money on that and take away from funding the food) and we had played a table game of trivia--$2.00 for that, unbeknownst to us. 

Waste of money, and now our stomachs feel gross. We didn't expect much, but this is just sad."}
{"text":"Olive Garden gets a solid three stars from me cause they are nothing if not consistent. I am usually never disappointed in the food. For someone as picky as myself they actually have quite a few dishes that meet my favorites criteria. Starch. Check. Meat. Check. Cheese. Check. What's not to like?

Admittedly it's a rather mundane restaurant chain but it delivers on what I need it to - enjoyable meals with my mom. Their calamari is crunchy, the toasted ravioli appropriately fun finger food, and the soup is surprising.  Why? Because my number one soup there is minestrone. And it's vegetarian and I am not. Not in the slightest. But there is something about dunking those warm breadsticks into that tomatoey broth that makes me slurp it up with abandon. Of course they have all the classics, and my favorite is chicken fettucine alfredo. Big white sauce fan (it's cheese!) Sometimes the pasta is a bit over cooked, but I am not expecting Mario Batali-like exactness from a chain restaurant.

I don't think I have ever had a bad experience at this Olive Garden. Mostly long waits on F/S nights. Our servers to date have all been pleasant and enthusiastic. Also nice that they are enthusiastic about having us \"taste\" the proffered wine ... several times."}
{"text":"I tried placing an order online for the last thirty minutes and their site wouldn't let me. I decided to call and place the order over the phone since their site was not working. The response I got \"Sorry, I cannot help you right now..we're very busy and I have to place you on hold since we are busy at the this location.\" The lady repeatedly told me this after I told her my situation. I asked if I could at least speak to the manager to report the site issues and she said \"no\" and hung up! I am furious!!!! Customer service is downhill at this location. It is obvious that they don't care for their customers. I will never return to this location. Go to the one on Chandler Blvd or Southern Road."}
{"text":"Love love love Olive Garden! One of my guilty pleasures here in summerlin ;) the moscatos and pinos are surprisingly super authentic and get a good buzz going after only a glass or two! The salad is always a favorite. I recommend the seafood Alfredo... YUM!"}
{"text":"Tonight had the potential to end badly, but the manager more than made up for it. I won't go into details about the issue as it's not as important as how it was handled. The manager who assisted went above and beyond which prompted me to write this review. It's so easy to tear down a person or organization for a simple mistake, yet I choose to praise how the management didn't allow it to become a negative but kept the evening rolling in a positive direction. Thank you for that. I will definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"After 5 minuets we got in we couldn't stay.. the whole restaurant smells very very very bed.. I've never smelled anything like that before and we just left."}
{"text":"The service was decent for dinner on a Saturday night, the food was quite well and definitely affordable."}
{"text":"Used to visit this location weekly. The food has always been great. We used to get an amazing waiter, cannot remember his name. lately the service has been getting worse and worse. We used to come here because of how great the service was and we keep trying to come back,but are now consistently disappointed with the server. We have had several different servers and I have noticed they do not seem well trained. A lot of the time our orders aren't written down, and the server will come back 2-3 times to ask what I ordered instead of writing it down the first or even second time. I go through my entire meal with an empty drink because the server fails to check in during the meal. I have gone during very slow, and busy days and the service seems to be the same so I know that is not a factor. I will try and see if I can find my old server, if not I'll have to start going to a different location."}
{"text":"It wasn't anything to brag about and haven't been back since. Server could of been better, our server was missing most of the time. Had to ask for refills. The food tasted plain, the breadsticks were cold."}
{"text":"The service was very good the food was ok. I had pasta with chicken and shrimp I just didn't like the bacon flavor. But because of the great customer service I will be going back to try a different dish"}
{"text":"Overall it was a good meal started out fairly good went to very good to a great finish 

They need to really work on their appetizers.   The stuffed mushrooms were lacking in flavor.  The Calimari was a bit undercooked but the aioli dipping sauce saved the day 

The Tour of Italy is always good I think their sauces are very good.  I'm partial to their five cheese red sauce.  

For dessert we had the Vanilla Panna Cotta.  It's only here for one more week.  Catch it while you can.  It's ahhhmazing."}
{"text":"Favorite Olive Garden location, I have never had a bad server here or a bad experience they are very consistent. I signed up to receive emails, rewards, and coupons and it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on curbside service. Wow. Super slow. Took over 5 minutes to even glimpse an employee and then that was only to help the person next to me. Finally they acknowledged me and I've been waiting ten minutes since then. So much for 20 minutes. It's been 35 since. Hope the food is better than this."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome!  But this particular Olive Garden has the worst mildew smell... we almost left after placing our order... I heard other people talking about it as well... please close down for a few days and paint, clean and disinfectant the place we would love to go back."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Friday afternoon- the restaurant was steady but not crazy busy.  Who doesn't love unlimited breadsticks, soup and salad?!   The service was okay but nothing to write about - the server was new and missed all the nuances that would have made it nicer.  We got everything we ordered, but had to ask for breadsticks, drink refills, small plates etc.  The food lived up to usual expectations and we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Greet me when i walk in.  I've been there twice recently and both times my greetings were lackluster.  

My server at this past visit seemed very preoccupied and our table piled up with our old dirty dishes.

The server from my previous visit was very new at his job but his heart was in it and he used great common sense.  I loved him, just wish I could remember his name... older gentleman... possibly Mike.

Anyway, the restaurant is always pretty clean but this time I had dried food on my fork.  yuck!  

The food was good,  The calamari was great as always... never a let down there.  The fried asparagus was a great idea but not executed as well as it could have been.  

I really enjoyed the Zuppa Toscano (sp?)  The salad needed more olives but other than that I was please and will return to this location in the future.  

Btw the manager check on our table both time I visited recently.  I like that, I feel like they actually care about my experience when they do that."}
{"text":"Think quick! When you think of the Olive Garden, what pops into your head? Lemme guess... bread sticks, salad, soup and long waits for dinner. Now, whether the quality of its quasi fast food warrants such a wait is debatable, but I must admit, I usually leave pretty satisfied and happy (and stuffed).

Now, I know I am regularly critical of large chains but I'm a sucker for those doggone piping hot, salty topped, buttery breadsticks and that big bowl of Italian salad with the black olives, pepperoncinis, sliced Romas and red onions. Add in the savory Tuscan Zuppa with potatoes and sausage and I've got a meal for $7.49, or at least a lunch. This visit our group also ordered the Margarita Chicken and the Angel Hair with Chicken, both were good but not great. This seems to be the case with rest ot he menu too.

Service was very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is always lively and the sanitation rating was 97. This location is also consistently well-managed. In general, the typical Olive Garden is no more than a 3 star restaurant, however I have no reason not to give this location 4 stars. Hey, I've never been disappointed here, what can I say?"}
{"text":"Great luncheon specials for family with kids, staff excellent, clean , friendly , great food , all around great !"}
{"text":"The lunch crowd was packed... The wait for seating for 2 was 15 minutes, but the service was good."}
{"text":"We went here last Friday. The server we had was Luna and she was fantastic! She really made our visit here memorable. She was so friendly and helpful. I believe she deserves a raise! She treated us like were old friends or family. Luna went above and beyond making this visit great. If we had a request she took care of it. I did only post a 4 star but that wasn't any reflection on her. I had the Chicken Piccata and It seemed overly salty, it was probably from the capers but I still liked it. Otherwise everything was good. The soup she recommend was the Chicken with Gnocchi, very tasty. When I visit again I am going to check and see if she is working."}
{"text":"Not a bad visit overall...the customer service could have been better...but overall good!"}
{"text":"The best part of our experience was our server, Barb. Every thing else was just average. 

It was Grandma's birthday and she wanted Olive Garden. What Grandma wants, Grandma gets. 

We made a 5pm reservation for last Saturday. 7 people including 2 kids - 8 and 10. Arrived at 4:55. Seated at 5:20. Ordered food at 5:40 and started eating at 6:20

It's easy for adults to wait an hour an 20 minutes for food - hungry kids are aren't as understanding, even with the distraction of crayons and paper. 

While the kids loved their spaghetti the adults found the food to be average at best. It wasn't terrible - just average. If A&W can makes a fresh and great tasting hamburger, Olive Garden should be able to make great tasting pasta. 

Our server, Barb, made regular checkups and did well to upsell us on celebration drinks but we had no intention of staying for dessert. If dinner was average, we assumed dessert would be too."}
{"text":"As of January 2013, Olive garden has this new section on their menu called \"Small Plates\".  It's basically italian tapas.  The last two times I've been there, that's what I've ordered.  The portions are perfect and the selections are really tasty.  You can order a couple of items and pair them with the ever-present salad and bread sticks for a night meal.  I really enjoyed the wide selection and felt that this was a great way to dine and sample a few different tastes, as opposed to the gigantic bowl of pasta option.

The location at Concord Mills is great.  They have loyal staff who I feel really do strive to create a happy experience.  As far as chains go, this is one of my top pics."}
{"text":"We called at 8pm to order a to go meals. The Olive Garden staff that answered the phone was clowning around laughing and joking kept asking me to repeat myself and hung up the phone. We did t want to allow that idiot to ruin our day and went to the restaurant and ordered direct. When the food was done the idiot dropped the bag on the table and said $14.95. We asked him to go through the bag to be sure it all was there. The idiot threw a baby tantrum pulling the food out of the bag being rude stating the name of each item and shoved it all back in the bag and once again said, $14.99. We told him no thank you, you eat it and that he had a horrible attitude and we went across the street to KOBE where the food is fantastic and cooked tepanyaki style and the service is impeccable. The problem with Olive Garden is the service and food are horrible. Could have been a bad night for that idiot at take out area but that's all it takes. If I was the manager I would read this scathing review and take it seriously because where there's smoke there's fire! The rude idiot at take out needs to be fired."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden: they thrive on consistency, friendly service, and value -- and this location is no exception. Our server was super nice and got the timing of our Toscana soup refills just right. The food was pretty good. I always like Olive Garden for causal dining. And of course, the mints at the end of the meal are yummy. Some servers surprise you with a handful of mints -- not this time but no complaints here since they are probably not \"allowed\" to dole out more than one per customer."}
{"text":"On 3/18/16 my family decided to meet up at Olive Garden for one big family dinner in honor of our Marine who is deploying in a few days. At first we were concerened with the wait and if a party of almost 20 could be pulled off. The manager himself came out to speak with us, confirm our party count and what they were planning for our dining that evening. The servers were great!!! Since we were such a large party we had two servers...a big thank you to you two ladies who took care of us that night! Nothing was missed and the food was delicious as always! The manager would come by to just make sure all was going good. When we found out grandma had asked about a military discount and that there wasn't one...we understood and still felt we have been given great service to be surprised when the manager personally thanked my son for serving for our country and that his meal was taken care of including desert. The memories we made that night at dinner and all of the pictures we took outside will be with us always but the service and attentivness will always be something that we will talk about..it really made our night and we are forever grateful for such amazing service!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this location have come for a few years now. At first I was a little disappointed at the hosts , they didn't seem to care and were very snippy while talking with me .But then a host named Jessica apologized for the confusion and long wait , she was very sweet. I had Cat as my server and she did amazing! Was very friendly and attentive. The food was amazing as always."}
{"text":"Denny's with Italian food. They are doing construction at this time so there are missing walls, and exposed dry wall and the smell of fresh paint. Super odd but this is where the party I was with decided to eat in advance without knowing it's under construction (March 2018). The waiter was super nice and talked me into the bottomless lasagna for a couple bucks more teaching me if I eat the one, he'd give me a second to-go, so it was worth it. The peach tea is super good as usual. Maybe they should give you a discount since the environment is a major mess. But it did the job and the food was good."}
{"text":"Today my family and I went to this location, we love Olive Garden, we love it that much that we have no problem in waiting around 30 minutes to be seated. Food is always good, the service is always ok too, but today we encountered a waitress that was less than helpful. She forgot our bread sticks, forgot my extra plate etc. But this is not why I give them a 3 this time. We got the $9.**  dinner, which includes unlimited bread sticks, soup or salad, an entree and dessert. My older sister ordered soup, my younger sister ordered salad. My younger sister asked to try some of my other sisters soup, literally just finished what my sister had left over like 3 spoon fulls. Anyways my older sister asks for another soup and the waitress rudely tells her she will charge her for the soup because she's not supposed to share!!!!!!!!!!! Wth!!???? now my sister can't taste my soup?????????????????????? I think she has company policy misunderstood because not in the 10 years we have gone to Olive Garden had this ever happened to us. And she actually charged for the soup. I just discounted it from the tip I was going to leave her. So she ended up paying for the soup she over charged. Anyways not a pleasant visit. I won't stop going though, their soup is too good but I'll make sure to ask for a different waitress"}
{"text":"Consistently, worst service EVER!! We go to restaurants at 3:00 to beat the crowds. Olive garden has a problem with seating customers at this time. We ask for a booth - they offer 1/2 boorh 1/2 table - then when we ask for a full booth, they take us to a tiny small booth when my husband is a big guy and all other occupied full booths are with 2 people. They are NOT busy and there are over 75% of their full booth not occupied.  They also put everyone together in one room with no spacing even though they have plenty of servers to space things out. Other people also comment on the seating. This happens ALL the time. We even stayed away for 6 months because of this and just tried again today and it was the same exact thing all over again. It seems they train them to do this. Not sure why - are they thinking to keep open for the dinner rush?  We would be long gone before the 5:00 on rush to fill up the restaurant. NEVER EVER again!!!"}
{"text":"This must be what corporate greed tastes like.  Thanks a lot Darden corporate a-holes for destroying my lifelong image of Olive Garden.

Wow.   Hadn't been to the OG in a while, so we stopped in for lunch.   It was never super special, but damn!

The first thing you notice is the smell... it's kinda like a mix between seafood and Italian kitchen smell... but definitely doesn't say \"Italian seafood\"... more like \"hmmm... what's that weird smell?

The next surprise awaiting you is the ziosk device waiting at your table.  Chili's?  Best part was when our poor server came over to take our order and picked up the ziosk and keyed in the order... awe.some.

We got toasted ravioli and zucchini for an appetizer.   The appearance was just sad and said very clearly \"we've stopped trying.\" (Check out the photo awesomeness). Fortunately, they haven't changed frozen ravioli vendors.   Still yummy.   The zucchini (yes, those little brown balls) was salt... no, not salt-y.  Salt.  Disgusting.

Entrees were chicken giardino and fettuccine Alfredo... for some reason, I remember it looking more appealing... don't take my word, look at the photo.  Other than the one-size-fits-all-menu-items chicken being a little tired, the giardino was ok-to-good.

The service was good, and I genuinely feel bad for the staff.  Hope they get jobs somewhere that isn't dying.

All-in-all, this was a saddening disappointment.  The processed food and some of the mind boggling changes they've made here defy logic.  Too bad.

Not sure who's getting what bonus at HQ, but someone has serious fuct this place up.

Darden board, wake up!  Ask yourself simple questions like how is that Texas Roadhouse can serve me handcut steaks with from-scratch sides delivered by dancing servers at the same price point?  Why is carraba's and macaroni grill able to operate open kitchens and cook fresh food to order that's so vastly superior to vacuum packed crap you serve for the same price?  Where does that money go?  How do you destroy a household name so quickly?

Feel like I went to funeral today..."}
{"text":"Good place for your last meal request before being killed where you can get the all you can eat and just be a glutton forever (thus never dying). I have read that certain locations of this chain where voted best Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. What does that say for the Italian in this region?"}
{"text":"Been here for a meal. That I had coupons for. If I was friends with HG Wells I would asked to borrow his time machine and changed my mind so I could have cooked at home instead. Good place for your last meal request before being killed where you can get the all you can eat and just be a glutton forever (thus never dying). I have read that certain locations of this chain where voted best Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh (may have even been this one). This place was packed! What does that say for the Italian in this region? Me thinks we need to raise our bar!"}
{"text":"To start off I wish I could give them zero stars. Unfortunately I can't so I have to give them one. I choose to cater with them for my daughters birthday, I ordered and payed five Days in advanced. My order came up to be close to $500. I told them I was picking up my food at 1:30pm Once I showed up to pick up the food, they did not know what I was talking about and I was informed that my food wasn't going to be ready until 6:00pm. Which makes no sense because the party was schedule to end at 4:00pm m.  anager was incredibly rude. Did not apologize even once. Did not offer a discount, coupon or anything at all. Managers name is ALLEN WEAR. He does not know how to operate the business. Will never do business there again. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Busy Sunday afternoon. They did the best they could to accommodate our group. Food was good. We were served by Manny and Sampson. Highlight of the night was the superb customer service of Sampson. He made sure we were taken care of and satisfied. Even hooked us up with salad and soup to go. He could also hold a pretty good conversation. Real down to earth, cool dude."}
{"text":"Went to this location March 1. They were busy as usually on a Sunday evening. We were seated in about 9 minutes. The rear area of restaurant was a little on the \"snug\" side. Very tight walking sections for patrons and staff to maneuver through. Nikkia was our server. Very energetic and polite. Salad and bread were good as always, along with the food. My wife's drink was late to come out, said they were having a problem with the machine.  Overall all good experience. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Extremely dissatisfied.  Just after 1 on a Friday, waitress first day with no supervisor helping.  Took 10 minutes to get soup without spoon. Another 4-5 minutes to get spoon.  Meatballs sandwich was bad.  Subway better.  Very disappointed with meal and service."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is Olive Garden.  What can you say?  

On this visit, I was with a group of 8 people.  It was insanity.  They sat us at two tables which made a weird shape.  A circle and a square?  The ability to converse was difficult.  Our server was so overwhelmed.  He should have had some help.  Then again, obviously, it is Olive Garden.  Same as usual."}
{"text":"Three of us went here for dinner at 5:30 on a Friday night.  Although the place was busy, the staff was good about re-arranging tables to accommodate people quickly.  Matt was our server and he was great--took drink orders and returned with them quickly, getting everybody's order distributed correctly.  He answered a couple of questions and took our orders, soon returning with salad, bread sticks, and water.  He served three different entrees, getting them all correct.  He suggested dessert and just like the entrees, everything was great.  I've been to several Olive Gardens, both here and in California, and this one is much better than most."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever encountered.  After waiting at the table for 10 minutes, our server finally took our drink order.  Then we were out of drinks before we saw her again with soup and breadsticks.  Never saw her again until she dropped off a few mints to try to secure a tip.  If it wasn't for another waitress in the area, we would never have gotten a drink refill.  We definitely will think twice before returning here."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant during the Christmas holiday during lunch. The staff was friendly and very outgoing. The food was delicious and the waiter made us feel at home. We had a party of 9 with 5 toddlers and the staff truest accommodated us."}
{"text":"To say this was a bad restaurant, would be an insult to all bad restaurants. The Olive Garden was one level below this...perhaps in a category called horrible.

I am not a big fan of chain restaurants but I know there are always some exceptions, but it was not the case here.  I went here because it was close and still open and I was hungry.   It says a lot when a restaurant's biggest feature is that they give you unlimited salad and breadsticks.  

If you want anything resembling Italian food, OG probably shouldn't be your first choice.  I chose Eggplant Parmesean, a dish that is so basic and is usually my barometer for decent Italian food.  OG failed miserably.  Soggy, greasy eggplant and tomato sauce with a microwaved cheese on top.  I ate a small portion of it and decided to eat more of my unlimited salad and breadsticks.  Maybe this is what happens when food is mass produced.  The quality is just not there.   I will say that the glass of peach iced tea I had with my meal was delicious.

A special note should be made about our server.  I can't say that she did anything particularly wrong in taking care of us...she never smiled - not even once - the entire time she was helping us.  I will give her the benefit of the doubt because everyone has an off day, but it just contributed to the ambiance.

I would say that if you're looking for good or even just decent Italian food, maybe you'd want to visit a smaller, mom & pop kind of place that actually puts some care into what they are doing.  That's what I'll do next time.  I should have known better."}
{"text":"Good but not Outstanding

My wife went shopping at Northlake Mall about a week ago and decided to go to Olive Garden for lunch.  Unfortunately the keep experimenting with the menu and serveral of our favorites were no longer availalbe.

It's a nice open atmosphere and we were seated very quickly. Service throughout the meal was very good so no complaints on that score.

I order Steak Toscano (Medium Rare) while my wife had the Stuffed Chicken Marsala. Of course we both had the prefunctory salad which was pretty god but still heavy on lettuce and very light on other ingredients.

While my wife liked her Chicken, my steak was anyting but medium rare. More like medium done and not a good cut of meat . Very tough, fiberous and dry which is the reason I like medium rare.

We've eated at this particular location on multiple occassions and generally have been very pleased but with the repeated changes in the menu, makes it a little less appealing as a dining option."}
{"text":"It is never ending pasta bowl season. Gluttons and bargain hunters take note.

For 8.95 you the the usual salad or soup and bread sticks. You then pick the pasta and the sauce. This year the special sauce is a \"creamy parmigiana potobello\"  There also are the usuals of marinara, meat, Alfredo and 5 cheese pink sauce.

Then pick the pasta, many shapes plus a whole wheat option.

Then eat, if you finish move on to another bowl of the same or any combo, Just note the 2nd bowl is much smaller as is the 3rd and any subsequent bowls."}
{"text":"Good food just like all olive gardens. How they replicate the chicken Alfredo all over north America I will never understand. Props to the Pepsi co. & The chefs or scientists that come up with the menu. As most locations biggest draw back is the crowd but that's a sign of popularity so it's acceptable. The issue with to go orders which are my favorite is they have a single serving of salad in all honesty I come for the salad dressing then the salads then the Alfredo. I have ordered multiple salads with my pasta and bit the bullet 8$ a salad the cake is definitely accessible when dinning in. Otherwise if u like salad as much as I do it's gonna cost u 24$ for a adequate amount of greens cheaper than cannabis but not as entertaining."}
{"text":"Came to Olive Garden to celebrate a birthday.
Located across from Red Rock Hotel, near by Costco, BJ's and Island (summerlin)
Restaurant is spacious. We were greeted and got a table right away.
Our waitress (Haimanot) was SUPER nice and very attentive to our request.
We started with a bottle of Moscato, love that sparkling wine, and some Cabernet (red)
We ordered some bread sticks with the Alfredo sauce (of course), some mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce, some  5 cheese fonduta that was alright, little greasy 
The waitress brought us the house salad. I used to enjoy it. I don't think it's anything amazing about it, they use iceberg salad so it's kind of plain.
I like that salad with no croutons but extra olives :)
tour of Italy where you have lasagna, Alfredo fettuccine and some chicken parmigiana  (by the way in Italy they don't have any Alfredo Sauce Lol) looks like the kids liked it. Portion is good for sharing
sea food Alfredo with shrimp and scallop. It was barely any Alfredo sauce and I could could shrimp and scallop, it was dry not moist :/ 
If you don't have a big appetite do not eat the bread stick because you won't finish your plate if you do...
They offered Bella her 16's birthday cake slice she could choose from the Menu.
2 co workers of our waitress came to sing the Happy Birthday! Thanks god Haimanot was sweet and Happy because the Co-workers looked annoyed that they have to sing Happy Birthday :/

Our Experience was alright, service was excellent but the food wasn't as I remembered it :/
If I have to choose between Olive Garden and Roma Deli (that place is real Italian), I will pick in a heart beat Roma Deli

An entree average $18 at Olive Garden!!!
Not sure I would come again unless I am invited lol"}
{"text":"I honestly just come to Olive Garden for their unlimited soup, breadsticks & salad for $6.95. I always get the Tuscan sausage soup. I've tried Tuscan soups in different restaurants & for some reason Olive Gardens always trumps everyone else's. 

Tuscan soup has a little kick to it. It's made in a thin creamy broth with ground sausage, kale, potatoes & delicious seasonings. They add grated cheese (at your preference), which makes it even better. Always gotta get their Peach Bellini as well! Bomb!

The beau got the Chicken Alfredo. Not a big fan of Alfredo but I always sneak a bite. 

They have some newer items on the menu. There's a special-- buy one now, take one to go for $12.99. Which is a pretty good deal for all the leftover Lovin fatties!

Olive Garden has one of the best Moscatos I've ever tasted. Also I tried their Roscato, which is a delicately fizzy sweet red wine. One of my new found obsessions. & I'm not a big Red wine drinker either. 

Staff is pretty ok here. It's kind of hit or miss. Today we had the pleasure of being waited on by, Lilibeth. She was pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Alright, here is the review that I have been vowing to do but kept putting off. I am bound to offend some of you \"Chain restaurant\" haters but here goes... 
Olive Garden has become the brunt of many jokes over the years and even had a clever and hilarious skit done on Mad TV years ago. The main complaint I have heard time and time again is that the food is not \"authentic.\" No comments about the food being bad or bland, just that its not \"authentic.\" Ok I will agree that the food may not be \"authentic\" from my perspective of what Italian food should be. My grandfather was 100% Italian and I ate much of his Italian food growing up. That is what I consider \"authentic\" Italian food to be. Here's the thing though... I have never been to Italy and I am sure that most of the people complaining about OG's authenticity havn't been either. So who are we to know that its not authentic in some area of Italy? I am fairly sure its not and you can bet that when I do visit Italy inside and out (which will hopefully be in the next year), I will be yelping another review on the OG just to say if it is indeed \"authentic.\"
One thing I can vouch for with Olive Garden is that most of the items I have tried there are delicious and their bread-sticks are like crack! Sure sure, laugh and knock me as much as you want but I know that everyone that has had OG likes at least one thing. You can slam OG but you have either liked their bread-sticks, soup, salad, or some kind of entree. Anyways, to address the point I am trying to make: a good restaurant (chain or not) should have good food and I can say that Olive Garden does have good food. Their soups are delicious (try the chicken gnocchi or the zuppa Tuscana), the bread-sticks are light, airy and buttery with the right amount of garlic flavor, and although the salad is nothing special vegi wise, the dressing is one of the better Italian dressings out there and is very refreshing. For entrees, they make the one of the best eggplant Parmesans and fettuccine Alfredos I have ever had, the stuffed chicken Marsala is unique but delicious, and their seafood portifino is rich and creamy with a generous amount of perfectly cooked seafood. The desserts are equally as delicious, my favs being the apple crostada and the black tie mousse cake. 
The service has always been decent although you may get an occasional slow waiter. However, I can say that most times I walk away satisfied with the overall experience. The price and value is terrific too. Come on, how many other \"Italian\" places you know of where you can get bread, salad/ soup, and big bowl of pasta for less then 15.00? Not very many, that's for sure!
My only complaints: Too family friendly and sometimes there are screaming kids, however, with a few bowls of  delicious soup and pasta, I can sometimes manage to drown it out. Also, years ago, I ordered nothing but their cannelloni al forno (pasta tubes filled with meat and topped with cheese, Alfredo and marinara sauce). My precious dish was taken away from me and replaced with \"three meat ravioli\" which was close so I kept getting that. Then that was removed from the menu. I started getting \"classics\" after that that I was sure would not be removed from the menu like eggplant parm. But for dessert, I fell in love with their chocolate molten cake with vanilla cream and strawberries. Guess what happened? Yep, it was taken away from me  :(  I have also heard numerous complaints about how a special one month will be terrific but a month later, its no longer available and is never to be seen again. I wish the OG would stop replacing good meal items and also bring back some of the popular past specials so people can enjoy them again. I also wish that one of those specials will be the cannalloni al forno. If that was the case, I would go there for a month straight and order it. OG, stop changing out good menu items. After all, if it aint broke, don't fix it!"}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrible.  There was only one person at the bar waiting for a to go order and two people behind the bar.  One was chatting it up with his girlfriend while the other was running back and forth from the kitchen. She actually looked like she was trying though.  We waited  at least 20 minutes before we decided to leave because we were never acknowledged. Not cool."}
{"text":"It's the typical chain Italian food restaurant, but received service and meals that were expected.  It's pricey for pasta but the salad and bread sticks make up for it. Entrees came out while still working on salad, but no big deal."}
{"text":"The food is typical of Olive Garden. The gluten free menu is available on its Ziosk via an allergen menu. There aren't a ton of choices; however, what's available is decent. 

I ordered gluten free rotini with traditional marinara. That came with Olive Garden's unlimited salad, which I ordered without croutons. I'm also happy to report that it's delicious salad dressing is also GF. No complaints here about my meal in terms of food. 

What didn't impress me was my server. I was seated quickly and then greeted and my drink order taken by one server who said the server who was supposed to be taking care of my table was \"a little busy.\" That was fine until \"a little busy\" turned into a 35-minute wait for food, no drink refills for my party, and a general impression of aloofness. My server did apologize when I called him out on forgetting refills he said he would get, but still...not impressed."}
{"text":"Went yesterday an wasnt impressed, salad was barely green, bread was beyond salty, and noodles felt a little undercooked. The food tasted like it had been microwaved, and if I wanted that I could just paid for a frozen meal at Walmart which would have been cheaper. Needless to say i wont be returning anytime soon, to this or any olive garden chain."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous hostess services. Every time I call to see if they do call ahead seating I get a different answer. Called veterans day they said they did call ahead, just not that day. That's understandable. I called again new years eve, they didn't do it on holidays but that they did do it. So tonight I call & I was told that they are not doing it since it is busy, I voiced my concern about how I get a different answer every time I ask. Then I was referred to the manager whom stated that \"they are just too busy tonight to do call ahead seating, but normally it is done throughout the week\". I asked what the guidelines were as to when call ahead was/wasn't offered. He said that they normally do it on slower days to get people in. I'm sorry, but why would I call ahead on a day where there isn't a wait. Call ahead seating is meant for people who are getting their name on the list prior to showing up. He referred me to do online check in, so I did & it said 41-50 minutes. I show up 30 minutes after doing this & I was told that the wait is 45-1hr. Somehow it magically jumped as if try are unsure how to operate the seating system. I was a hostess before as a 10th grader, it's not rocket science. Very displeased with their service."}
{"text":"We visit this olive garden about once a week because my kids love it.  I like it because they have allergy friendly dishes for my kids.  (But you have to ask what is in certain dishes). I also love the soups here. Overall good."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving Olive Garden a star is because of their salad and breadsticks! I honestly don't know how they can charge so much for crappy pasta and subpar meats?! It used to be ok but over the past few years portions have gotten smaller and prices went up! I will not be returning unless there's an improvement!!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price. Only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because we got the buy one bring one home and unlimited soup or salad and the waitress didn't offer another serving, I mean it's not like I was gonna get another serving but offering would be nice. But the staff is still friendly."}
{"text":"Mediorce food and poor customer service! I ordered takeout and waited a long time in the parking area after the woman on the phone said, \" I'll be there in a little bit.\" I finally went inside and rather than expressing an apologetic demeanor, she gave me an attitude as if I was the inconvenience. Unfortunately, this wasn't even the worst part. When I served the food to my guests, the utensils had chocolate smeared all over it and I didn't order dessert. A tell-tale sign of a disorganized and unsanitary kitchen. Disgusting and an overall atrocious experience!"}
{"text":"One fucking star! I spit on your ground! Enjoy this one fucking star bitches! Got it pussies!?"}
{"text":"Ordered stake and soup and, loved the soup for sure, stake wasn't really my favourite but it was just okay! Service was weird thou, the waitress was told us to order while she was serving the other table; so we basically yelled out our order."}
{"text":"Everything was off. The greeting, the ordering, the drink. I was trying to leave as fast I could because I was over it. The whole experience suck!  I left unhappy. I wish I didn't eat here today. Maybe it was just meant for MY experience to be bad. I watch other customers have a good encounter."}
{"text":"Use the online reservation, it helps cut the wait time! 

I am sad to say, this was my final try with Olive Garden. They have gone down hill, slowly but surely. I have tried Centennial twice and on March 9, 2018 Summerlin for the final goodbye.

The customer service up front, was a 50/50. There was this young asian girl who just looked and acted she did not want to be there. The nice young black man asked her to seat us first. She rolled her eyes at him, didnt say a word and kept walking... we were like \"should we follow her, what are we doing?\" Lol. 

The server came and he was alright for the rest of the night. He was nice but tricked us to order all kinds of sides. The trick is saying \"I will get you a side of alfredo sauce for your breadsticks, it's delicious\" come to find out later he charged us $3.79 every time he brought that out. Smh. Never again.

The food was not that great. We were excited to do the neverending pasta special. Yup, only did 1 bowl and it was enough. We didnt even finish the pasta. The pasta was old, it was mostly clumped up and turned color (like it old). There was barely any sauce on each of our bowls. I think they were short on sauce or they are just stingy. We had to fill ourselves with the breadstick and salad, it was the only thing that was well worth to eat. Smh. Never again.

So, I am very disappointed, Olive Garden was one of my childhood favorites. But after giving them a chance 3 times. It's time to try something else."}
{"text":"Been a fan of tiramisu here. Never disappoints.
Great service too. The new service of tabs on every table is really good and helpful with quick orders and payment."}
{"text":"Came here around 3 in the afternoon, had a party of 2 and a small child which was sleeping. Our waiter was Semir, and i must say i was highly satisfied wwith his service, and work ethic. I have been to this olive garden a couple of times but never had service like this.

In the middle of our late lunch we needed a little more cheese for our salad and we stopped Austin since Semir was a little busy with other guests. Austin had a great attitude. He never told me he would tell my waiter. He just did it because he saw our waiter was busy and he wasn't as busy. Overall the only reasons it wasnt 5 stars is because we saw atleast 6 empty booths when we got there but still had a 10 min wait. Best servers at this location to date."}
{"text":"Went in last night around 10:15 pm for a late dinner with my husband, wanted to take advantage of his free Veterans Day meal as we do every year. First of all we felt so rushed into ordering and when we told our waiter we need a few more minutes he just walked away without saying a word looking very annoyed. Once we ordered Everytime we would ask for something I got the feeling he was annoyed it was such an uncomfortable experience. We did not enjoy ourselves one bit. Positive note, the food was great!"}
{"text":"It's a chain and lives up to that biking. It's nit going to knock your socks off but is good simple food.  Service at lunch wss really great, Bri is under paid.. actually she let us take food home like salad and extra soup.  Some olive garden's tell you they can't do that.   

But I'm here for food.  Light menu had real winner with ravioli di Portobello had real rich cheese flavor in sauce.   Didn't seen low calorie.   Nice size portion too.   I got asiago tortellini great mix of cheese inside and meat sauce outside.   Not fancy but very good and filling.  Can't go wrong with unlimited soup if it's good."}
{"text":"Coupons work with take out orders here.  The take out orders seems to be slower than the restaurant!  I tried keeping it simple with classic lasagna.  The to go comes with more sauce, than eating there and the soup is extra too.  So it seemed like a better deal."}
{"text":"olive garden is consentant that is why they stay busy.  We havent been to one in a while so last night we thought it would be a good idea to try something different.  Dinner was good app took 15 mins but things happen I understand. Overall it was a good dinner just the girl and I."}
{"text":"Oliver Garden has changed so much since the last time I been there which was about 8 year ago lol. 

The food that I had was soooo good. I had the shrimp scampi. I will most definitely have it again next time I go. The soup was also good. I went for my daughter birthday and they let me drop off the cake and balloons earlier that day and they had it waiting on the table as I asked. Super pleased
 

Inside was the Italian look and vibe. Staff was nice and friendly. The Server was GREAT!

The only down side was: 
1. The smell when you walked smell like a dirty mop.
2. The glasses on table was dirty."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever encountered.  Passive waiters and terrible manager.  With 2 kids in tote, you would think we could have had faster service!    Would NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious dinner today 
We were sat fairly quickly and got our drink order taken immediately. JUNIOR was AMAZING. He took care of us quite a bit. Our glasses never became empty. He suggested a red wine w my meal and it was GREAT. Junior helped us pick out appetizers and even offered us sauces with our breadsticks-- I didn't even know they had sauce for them! He was nice, attentive, but at the same time worked with a purpose. Keep up the hard work, JUNIOR! See you next time"}
{"text":"Have you ever had a nice servicer who wasn't the great at serving? That explains my experience whenever I come to this location. I give three stars because the food is good quality but the service just isn't the best. One thing that's usually continuous is I never get wine samples nor the drink menu, because I look young, and of course I wouldn't ask for the sample seeing they are supposed to offer it; I also am swayed from buying drinks seeing that they don't offer it and I don't get a drink menu. Something I also notice is the servers attentiveness, they just aren't. I find myself with a empty glass often and I also never get another serving of soup or breadsticks by them noticing I always have to say something, which is annoying. Overall though the food was good as always."}
{"text":"I saw one of the waitress / hostess pull toilet paper off her shoe in bathroom and didn't even wash her hands. Gross!!!! Won't be back at this location!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off with the negatives and finish with the extreme positives.

So on Saturday me and my wife decided to order Olive Garden TOGO for lunch. We ordered our favorite appetizer which is the \" Lasagna Fritta \". Hands down the best item on the menu. For our entrees, I ordered the \" Tour of Italy \" and my wife ordered the \" Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo \" which is the only thing we ever order because we have never had a problem with those dishes. We stand strong by that good old saying \" If it's not broken, Don't fix it \". So 45 minutes later when our food was ready for pick up, my wife went and grabbed it. She got home 5 mins later with our lunch. We live right across the street from the Olive Garden let me point out. So it's not like it was a 20 minute commute. I opened the bag and everything was there which is always a plus. Then I open my food which was the Tour Of Italy, and I looked down in disgust. The lasagna was brown and mashed up, it also looked like they tried to cover up everything with cheese because the whole plate was covered with cheese to the point where I couldn't see my food until I picked up the chunk of cheese. My wife's Fettuccine was \"Swimming\" in Alfredo sauce. And the appetizer was covered in sauce and very rubbery. So I was completely unhappy and I called the Olive Garden and asked to speak to a manager.

NOW LETS GET INTO WHERE THIS BECOMES A EXTREME POSITIVE!!!!

I was put on the phone with the Manager on duty, His name was Marcus. Now I explained the situation to Marcus and he was very apologetic. He also off the bat asked if I would like my order redone. I explained to him that I wouldn't be able to as me and my wife had to go to work. So he said if one of us could stop by, that he would have a gift card waiting for us. 

I couldn't pick up the gift card on Saturday due to me rushing into work. So Sunday me and my wife called Marcus and he said it was no problem we could come and grab it today. So instead of going to get a gift card we decided to go have dinner at Olive Garden. 

We walked in and asked for Marcus. He came up about 1 minute later and I introduced me and my wife and he knew exactly who we were. So then he asked us to follow him. He asked if we were having dinner with them tonight and we said yes. Then he said okay perfect \" I want to take care of you guys \" he sat us at the booth near the bar, which is our favorite spot. Marcus brought us some menu's and said \" ORDER ANYTHING YOU GUYS WANT, DRINKS, APPZ, ENTRÉES, AND DESSERTS \". He was buying us DINNER. Let's just say we had a lot of food lol and everything we had was AMAZING!! So his amazing hospitality didn't stop there. We were so full that we passed on dessert, and Marcus came over and said No Desserts??? We were like no thank you we were full. And he picked up the dessert menu and said pick two desserts to go. He was very adamant lol. So we got our desserts Togo with our leftovers and my wife loves the iced tea there so we always buy a gallon Togo. And he went back and made a gallon Togo for us. Marcus was going above and beyond for our dinner. And we were definitely impressed and pleased. That is why I gave them 5 stars because yeah they messed up but Marcus definitely handled the situation accordingly and we appreciate that in service. 

THANK YOU MARCUS !!!!"}

{"text":"Terrible. My husband and I went there one night. I ordered the gnocchi soup. It came out and the gnocchi was just way too soft. My husband ordered the stuffed manicotti with the meatball. The meatball looked like a blob of meat just tossed on top of the manicotti. Last time I checked a meatball is supposed to be round! The server was great. That's the only reason I rate this place a 2. Restaurant needs to work on quality and recipe compliance!"}
{"text":"I had a waitress named Kristy and she was on the ball. She rocked. I'm not a big Olive Garden fan, but she made my experience so great, this Olive Garden gets 5 stars. Although we waited about 45 minutes to be seated (we went during a very busy time), the service was absolutely impeccable. I was having the endless pasta bowl and not once did I have to ask for a refill on my pasta or water. Before I could even get around to asking, Kirsty was at my table already serving me a new dish. Just an all around great experience."}

{"text":"This Olive Garden is consistently high quality food wise. I can't say I have ever had a bad meal here. And the staff is top notch. Have been to this location frequently and will continue to come."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying we could tell it was the servers first day or maybe first week at most. We came in on a Thursday night with a 30 minute wait and we could tell he was flustered. Started off at the bar with 1/2 price wine and beer (score!) while we waited and we were seated around 20 minutes in- off to a great start! Well I'm sad to say, it went downhill from there. We ordered the mozzarella appetizer and when it came we requested ranch on the side and a second beer for my friend. We waited and waited and neither ever came, oh well we can get over that. Time to order the entrees and he brings around breadsticks, salad and soup for everyone. We asked for alfredo dipping sauce, he nods and never brings it... we are already at strike three :( When the meal comes my husband asks for crushed red pepper and he says he doesn't think they have it- well we've been here before and we know they do, so just go ask the kitchen? Super awkward moment. When he walks away we realize that the five cheese gnocchi entrée doesn't have any chicken on top so we tell him and he brings another plate, but without chicken AGAIN, haha. He remedies this and is super apologetic each time. We also asked for the beer again and he brought it right over. He was a great kid and fixed everything that he could, but it was not a fun experience. Maybe he needed more time in training, less tables, or to not work on such a busy night. Whatever it is, we hope it's fixed before our next visit."}
{"text":"Not a long wait, bathrooms and table clean. Alex the waiter was awesome. He was quick with everything we needed and was genuinely nice and attentive. My baked ziti was cooked perfectly however I only gave 4 stars because there was a hair on my son's chicken strip. However Alex came to the rescue and told his manager immediately. The manager was also very nice made sure more chicken was made within minutes and took it off our bill. Overall this is the best Olive Garden to go to."}
{"text":"We recently came here and we are staying out of town. We were amazed with the service and our waiter Jon W. was completely outstanding! He was above all the best waiter I have had! He was on top of everything and our order was perfect! His attitude was outstanding and I had thought he had worked there for a while but he informed us it had only been two weeks. Normally I don't want write too many reviews but he deserved one! We are coming back tonight to request him with some of our friends. Just a note to Jon you were outstanding and keep it up!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Olive Garden for years in many cities and states.  My wife loves thier food.  Usually thier food is consistently good.   We went there last night for a dinner and was very disappointed.  Thier lasagna and sausage filled rigatoni left much to be desired.  Smaller portions...  My lasagna noodles were hard on all the edges.  The pictures of the sausage rigatoni on the menu made them look like the size of a taco or a egg roll.  However they were the size of a little dumpling.  Sausage was dry with no flavor.  The whole meal was blah.  My wife had the stuffed Chicken Marsala.  The chicken was dry overcooked.  I would have been dissapointed as the chef to put that food out.  As if they microwaved a frozen chix breast.  For an appetizer we have the the risotto nuggets with marinara.  Definitely frozen nuggets not fresh or good.  Risotto had no flavor.  They might as well just add cheese curds to thier menu.

I love writing great reviews when they are deserved.  I feel bad being so negative.  Read the first line of my review one more time.  My salad and Shocktop Belgian white beer on tap was the best thing we had all night.  The service was 4/5 stars by a young man named Tyler.  Good job kid.  

We will not visit this Olive Garden again.  With Bonefish Grille next door,  Old Chicago, Granite City.....  Too many great places around to eat at than to waste my money or time on crappy food."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for date night with my husband. Upon arrival (at 4:15pm) we were told there was a 30 minute wait so we waited for a table. When we were seated, our server got our drink orders & appetizer order. While we waited for our drinks, a large party was seated next to us and they were extremely loud & were using very foul language. The server brought our drinks & our calamari appetizer pretty quickly. The calamari tasted really good but for some reason it was all stuck together in a large clump. We were also served our salad & he took our food orders. Hubby ordered the chicken & shrimp carbonara and I ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo (my favorite!). Our food was great! The more time that went by, the loud and more foul the table next to us got. Our server (Austin) came to us & appologized for them and asked if we were ok & we said we were good & understood that people aren't always the best patrons. I could tell that Austin was trying to be as accommodating to us as possible. He brought us boxes for our leftovers & also brought us a to go order of breadsticks as a token of appology. He was very sincere. He also offered us some sodas to go but we declined. On the check, he wrote a small apology note. He absolutely deserved a generous tip and that's what we gave him. I hope that rowdy table didn't cause him grief with his other customers. I shoulda just gone over to them myself and socked em each in their loud mouths."}
{"text":"Went here for a nice lunch to catch up with a few old friends. I ran into a worker named Morgan. I didn't know Olive Garden served wings"}
{"text":"Our server Boushra was awesome! Our food came out tasty and hot but the kids' food was a perfect temperature, not too hot to eat. The food is always consistent and delicious.
Bouchra was attentive and very attuned to our needs.
We will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"We have 2 all you can eat Olive Garden pasta passes. We have gone to this locaction almost every night for two weeks and prefer it over the Fiesta Mall location.
   On Oct. 12, 2017, we arrived with a special request.  Salvador was our server and immediately went to Zach, one of the managers, who promptly took care of our request. 
   We can't eat an entire full serving of the pasta and this location has given us no trouble ordering the half portions.  I love the gnocchi soup,  my spouse likes the fazolli soup.  A few times the pasta was brought out while still eating our soup but that's not the norm. All our food has been delicious, hot and other than an overcooked piece of chicken, really great.  The chicken was promptly replaced with a perfectly  cooked piece.
  I suggest the following wonderful servers:  Tall Devan, Patrick,  Salvador, Ervin, and Lasso. We had a few others I may come back and add when I recall their names. 
    Remember,  when servers are busy, they are still doing their best for you! Also, Pasta Pass holders, leave a tip! 
  Handicapped parking, first come basis. One handicapped bathroom stall.  Half price drinks only while waiting for your table. Very busy Fri & Sat.  Evenings!"}
{"text":"You know what you're getting when you go to an Olive Garden... Full. 

Endless soup and salad is the only way to go. Service was fine. Food was fine. Nothing was phenomenal or horrible. 


:)"}
{"text":"Waited a long time to get a server which was fine because I saw y'all were busy and the waitress ended up being really sweet and made up for it. Ordered the calamari as an appetizer and I usually like it from Olive Garden but this order was shriveled and just tasted like fried batter. The salad is always good so no complaints there. As a meal my fiancé and I split the tour of Italy and out of all three I liked the lasagna. The Alfredo was dry and wasn't a fan of the chicken Parmesan. We did however order the Christmas drink and that was really good, the glitter made it very holidayish. I will come back one day but not any time soon."}
{"text":"I never dine here but do get take out. It is just slow thats all, and u have to double check the order. I will say, the 2x they have missed something they have made it up to me above and beyond. I always get the tour of italy which is generally tasty. I have done some catered lunches before during work, and they really do a nice job for pretty inexpensive."}
{"text":"The curbside pick up is a joke. Either the order is not correct or they tell you a certain time and they end up 15-20 minutes late."}
{"text":"Dinner is OK, food is a little bland. Don't expect gourmet Italian. It's a high volume, kid-friendly restaurant with high seating capacity. Waitress was nice. Cocktail was great. Spaghetti with meatballs was good with tasty meatballs. Baked ziti was too salty but otherwise bland. Breadsticks salty and stale. Salad fork tines bent and table a little dirty."}
{"text":"Our party of seven was seated at a comfortable, large round table and immediately greeted by Tasha in a warm and welcoming manner.  She answered all questions, made several excellent suggestions and served each dish exactly as requested.  Jessica also served our party and, like Tasha, she was courteous, professional and extremely pleasant.  The salad and bread sticks were replenished without having to request this and all dishes were appetizingly plated and food was fresh and delicious.  We met the Manager, Billy, on our way out and complimented his staff.  Billy thanked us for visiting Olive Garden and invited us to return soon.  This experience for all seven of us was an extremely positive one; once again, we want to thank Tasha, Jessica and Billy."}
{"text":"Not sure how much I can say about Olive Garden's food that anyone's who's eaten there doesn't already know. Food is always good, plentiful, and fairly consistent from location to location. I don't frequent national chains as I have a preference for local and independent eateries, but I would say that OG is in the top 3 of my national chain favorites. If I must include a annoyance with OG, it's that they don't take reservations, even for a larger party (8).

We started off at the Harvard Park location and was told that it would be about a 90 minute wait. We opted to drive to the next closest OG, which was a 30 min drive away. The Parma location accommodated us much faster, about 20 minutes and we were seated. I want to avoid ending this review with anything perceived as negative, so I will put this suggestion here: 

Before we were seated, their waiting area was full. However, there were 4 very elderly guests, 2 with canes - 2 of which were with our party - who were standing in the waiting area because there was nowhere to sit. I had to ask for extra chairs. The request was met, but host staff should've had more awareness.

Again, food was good - but what compelled me to write this review is the service. We were tag-teamed by Trish and Sherry. I will say that this has been the best service we've ever experienced at any OG. These 2 ladies were absolutely wonderful - friendly, service with a smile, patient, attentive without being annoying. They were great!!! I wish all restaurants could have a Trish and Sherry on their wait staff. Thank you for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"Seriously?  Who wouldn't love great service?   This is one of the only Olive Garden's I've been where it seemed like the staff is trained to be super customer friendly.  Perhaps a Vegas thing?

Either way, the couple times I've been here it seemed that everyone went out of their way to make it a great dining experience.  Food, ehhh...  same stuff, but more and more expensive over the years.  But location?  Makes a huge difference.

Also noted:  The Beard of Knowledge from Pawn Stars has been sighted here as an extra bonus!"}
{"text":"I always have an excellent meal at this particular restaurant. Food is always great and the bartender (I usually sit at the bar) is always wonderful. I think Olive Garden actually gets a pretty bad wrap, I think the food is excellent. The only thing I would say is to upgrade the tvs in the bar area.....I understand this is not a sports bar but PLEASE upgrade the horrible tvs from 1975. Other than that I give this place 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Right next to Metro Center Mall I stop by the other day and always get my zuppa toscana soup. Plus the bread sticks..yum! oh and then I got the fettuccine alfredo but i was already full lol."}
{"text":"Endless soup and salad lunch is quite tasty with a nice selection of soups.  Very reasonably priced.  Service is quick and efficient.  Even let you take leftovers home, not the usual norm for all you can eat.   Love the swipe and pay at your table,  a technology I have not seen elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm such a sucker for certain chain restaurants, because I know I'll consistently like their food.  Olive Garden is one of them.  Especially, when they advertise new pasta dishes, sauces, and the never ending pasta bowl.  One can never go wrong going to lunch there for their all you can eat soup, salad, and breadsticks for $7.95.

OG favorites are the salad, breadsticks, alfredo dipping sauce (for the breadsticks), zuppa toscana, and the chianti braised short ribs!

The only reason I give it four stars is because this location is always clean, consistent, professional, and not in a sketchy area.  I also believe this location has outdoor seating.  Other bonus points for this location are that it is nestled in with other restaurants such as BJ's Brewhouse, Agave, Islands Fine Burgers, and L&L Hawaiian BBQ.  

The only downside of this location is, while their servers/staff are always friendly and helpful, they sometimes seem overworked in a sense they are servicing too many tables and can't keep up.  It's really nothing to complain about because I see the staff are definitely busy attending to other tables and, after all, it's Olive Garden, not Ferraro's.  

Low and behold, Olive Garden is a great chain restaurant with good food and cheap prices!"}
{"text":"Food was great. I have never had a bad experience with the food here. The issue was the service. Our servers name was Shannon, she made my friend and I feel completely unwelcome. Food came out quickly but after we were finished we waited and waited for our boxes and bills and then she walked by us and ignored our table. Not only that but when we finally got our boxes she boxed my soup and went to another table before finishing with us. Then we put our checks up and she said absolutely nothing and snatched them away. As servers we always tip 20% or more, but in this situation our tip was based on the service we received. Normally our service here is great and this experience makes us hesitant to even return."}
{"text":"Worst customer service in the world. I ordered catering on Christmas Eve. My wife called to confirm the order that we will be picking it up at 5pm. We arrive to pick up the food and the food was not ready.We sat around for 30-45 minutes waiting for our food. We proceeded to take the food home and realized our Chicken Alfredo had zero Alfredo sauce. I called and spoke with the manager on duty and he informed me that he would refund me all my money or I could drive back in and get new order of Chicken Alfredo. It was already 7:00 PM. I called back on Tuesday to confirm they would be refunding me my money and speak with the GM. They told me it would be refunded within 3-4 days. I since called today and was told they are only refunding me $80 dollars out of the $140 dollars I spent. After talking with the GM he agreed to refund me all the money and said it would have to go through corporate headquarters. I would never visit this place again in my life. Thank you Olive Garden for ruining my Christmas Eve dinner and night. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was tasty! The server was friendly, helpful, and attentive. What more can I say... we had a great evening there!"}
{"text":"I am gonna be real with y'all and say I am not the biggest Olive Garden fan....but my family is. So, while I wouldn't necessarily CHOOSE to come here, I come because I love my peeps and the food isn't half bad. In full disclosure, I do not eat bread, pasta or anything gluten related. Previously, this was a problem at OG because they didn't have anything that I could eat. But, I am happy to say....that has slowly become a thing of the past. They now give the ability to get chicken and shrimp that is not breaded. I mean, that is pretty cool. Props to OG for appealing to those of us watching our carby's! My review is based on the overall experience of everyone at the table (and yes, I did a short research survey!)

The service at this location is always VERY good. I have yet to come with the familial humans and get poor service. French, one of the managers, is truly a breath of fresh air. He is kind, happy and goes out of his way to make sure you are happy. A great attitude, a fantastic smile and a genuine desire to serve. Lots of private lot parking here and the location is pretty good too. The restaurant is of average cleanliness (you know me, one star just for that) and I will take it. Some OG's are DIRTY!

The overall consensus of the food was positive. Average star rating round the table was 4 outta 5. Just to get it outta the way, everyone loves the breadsticks....save me of course. Here is what we got and the feedback it received:

1) Shrimp appetizer with spicy sauce: I am the one who ate this and lemme tell ya, it is really good. NICE AND SPICY. It isn't a good meal until my nose is running, my mouth is burning and my eyes are watering. A decent portion too (I made it my meal and ate salad!)

2) Tour of Italy (grilled chicken parm, ravioli in alfredo sauce, pasta with meat sauce): My girls split this. The TOI used to be so much larger....really felt skimped on everything here. The chicken breast was TINY and the pasta portions were too. The girls told me everything tasted really good though.

3) Linguine with alfredo sauce and shrimp: My brothers split this one. Simple, easy and they both gobble it up. A HUGE portion as well!

4) Steak gorgonzola pasta: My mom always gets this and loves it. Meat is tender and flavorful and it comes with an amazing sauce for the pasta. Portion on this one was huge too!

5) Chicken marsala with potatoes: My dad got this....but lemme tell you, the portion is HUGE! He was able to give everyone some food and still end up stuffed. I tasted the chicken and it was definitely good.

6) Salad: We love OG's salad....not gonna lie. I love now that if you ask, they will put spinach in it. This time around, our salad was literally WHITE save the spinach inside. I am so glad we ordered it added. No one wants a salad to come out with no green. 

7) Coffee: OG's coffee has to be some of the best restaurant coffee's around. Freshly brewed and super good. Came out cold a few times, but they replaced it no questions. 

Overall, this place is pretty decent. All of us ate for $97 (7 people total) so that isn't too shabby either!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Thursday night past 8 o'clock so we were seated quickly. The food was great, and so was the service was pretty good too. I would have given the place five stars, but halfway through dinner, an alarm went off and didn't get shut off for around five minutes. Also, one of the waiters (not ours) was trying to show off with some wine glasses and ended up dropping several due to a miscalculation. Practice makes perfect though. I didn't mind that so much but the alarm was a bit unnerving. I'm sure that wouldn't happen again though. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy eating at Olive Garden but not last night. This is my 1st trip to this location it was nice inside but we were seated in back booth area that had an overwhelming smell of feet (found out later that is a common dirty dishrag smell). Salad was lacking it's usual great Italian dressing and some of the lettuce was the big chunks of yellowed inner parts. My Chicken Marsala was overcooked and what happened to the stuffing? Was tasty though. Had chocolate lava cake for dessert, skimpy of the white sauce and strawberries were sour. Our server was pleasant though. Overall, disappointing!"}
{"text":"I dont know why this place gets such a bad rap. Mind you I have been one of those people to snicker at this place. However the food was good. We had the new breadstick sandwiches and they great. It incuded soup or salad. that was good. I was very happy it was a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be - except for the salad and breadsticks. Sausage in the sausage stuffed rigatoni is like refried beans - literally and defiantly not like the picture on the menu!

My wife's steak Gorgonzola was raw, they did bring a fresh plate out (10-15 mins later), the rest of the family was done eating by the time it came back cooked. 

Won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Eh. This Olive Garden isn't the best. It's set up funky, it has some wide open spaces instead of the warm homey feeling you usually get when you walk into a OG. Food was fine, hard to mess up when it comes out of a bag! I had a free desert coupon for my birthday and we had to wait for the manager to come over before our waitress was allowed to ring it in. I really hope they don't have to do that everyday considering how many tables they go through everyday. Staff wasn't horrible but they weren't too friendly. Hey, try it out if it isn't for you just head over to the other 4 restaurants that are within walking distance, without moving your car!"}
{"text":"Good location for this Olive Garden.  The parking lot is pretty large. They remodeled and the bar is awesome! It now has tables and booths so you can eat in there instead of those old wire tables and garden chairs they use to have. This is a little secret because when they go on a wait, if there's a table in the bar you can actually sit and eat dinner there while skipping the wait! This Olive Garden is pretty large, but they do go on waits all the time so be early! The food at this Olive Garden has always been typical og food, it's all the same so it's kind of difficult to screw it up !"}
{"text":"Kids are all grown so they don't want to do the whole traditional easter egg hunt. Instead they rather do brunch. Here we are...it was actually a surprise since they've been asking to go Olive garden.

We made reservation just in case it was busy. Got in 5 minutes early and the waitress sat is down in 10 minutes. We started off with our beverage and a appetizer trio of calamari,  3 pieces of mozzarella cheesesticks, and 6 pieces of stuff mushroom. 

Our entree came with unlimited soup or salad and garlic breadsticks.

We ordered shrimp scampi, alfredo linguine steak gorgonzola, shrimp and scallop Alfredo, shrimp alfredo,  and a tour of Italy which came with a choice of 3 samples of lasagna, alfredo linguine, and chicken parmesan with marinara sauce.  

Food is good but not the best pasta I ever tasted. Staff was awesome. Because Olive garden has been around a long time, I'll still be back. Happy eats!!"}
{"text":"I came here with Donald G. one afternoon for a couple appetizers. There was no wait, so we were seated in a booth right away. We ordered Calamari ($9.95), salad ($6.35), and Spinach Artichoke dip ($8.95). We kept waiting for our bread sticks to come, but they never did. The waitress brought out our appetizers and said, \"Is there anything else I can bring for you guys?\" We both responded, \"Yes, we've been waiting for the bread sticks.\" She said she'd have someone bring them to us in a minute (times10). If I didn't love Olive Garden's bread sticks so much, it wouldn't have been a big deal, but I was seriously craving them. Alas, they finally came and I had to double fist them so I could catch up on wasted time. The Calamari kind of looked like pork rinds and they were pretty crunchy (not crisp), so I didn't favor them much. They also came with a parmesan-peppercorn sauce, which was a little too cheesy for our liking, so we just stuck to the marinara. The spinach artichoke dip was probably my favorite of the appetizers, especially when eaten with the soft bread sticks as opposed to the crunchy Tuscan bread it came with. The salad, as you may know, comes with unlimited refills, so it's always a great value.

*Tips
-Don't let them shaft you on their little bread stick dipping sauce scheme. They make it sound as if it's free, but it's really $3.75 per sauce!"}
{"text":"I've come here quite a few times and each time has been pretty good experience. 

I guess my only complaint is that they don't give you anything complimentary for your birthday. I was a little surprised about that since it's a chain restaurant. We came here for my brother's birthday, told them it was his birthday and the waitress said, \"oh, happy birthday!'

I'm glad I learned about the dipping sauce trick elsewhere, so I was never had at this location. 

The service is always fast, the wait has never been long for me, the food is usually good, and the atmosphere is peaceful."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday for a late lunch. Was sat quickly and drink orders were taken quickly, as well as our order. The salad received had several bad pieces in it and looked like it just came from a bag. Wasn't very fresh. The entrees came which took a ling time. Not really sure why since it wasn't very busy. Just average tasting, which I guess is to be expected from the other reviews on here. Breadsticks were the tastiest part."}
{"text":"Slow service at lunch and when we had an issue with a coupon the manager on duty James said that within the rules we do customer service snarked and walked away. Poor service in my opinion. Last time I will go to the Goodyear Olive Garden"}
{"text":"This isn't even a nice restaurant, it's a casual restaurant and they charge $3.49 for a dish marinara sauce without warning you ahead of time. The waiter just brought them out like it was nothing. At least have your waiters inform customers of the charges. Don't bother coming here - you'd be better off spending your money at an upscale place for those kind of charges. $40 for salad and an appetizer (for two). Not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good? Review is mostly based upon the customer service we received. After waiting forever me and my wife we're starving and couldn't wait to eat a nice meal for our little night out. However the waiter was as slow as a snail and didn't really listen to us, she brought out the wrong soup once (we both had the unlimited soup/salad for $9.99 still a good deal). And then when I told her I wanted the another bowl of what I originally had she brought out 2 assuming that my wife wanted the same soup as well when she did not and was stuffed. I really do think that the right waiter would have made this review much better but no matter how good the food may be great customer service must accompany it in my book or else it was all for nothing, will end up going back but hope to not get the same waiter."}
{"text":"Borderline horrific service. Salad wasn't good, breadsticks were a super disappointment. Our meals, all the same, not good. Scallops weren't good, shrimp was sad. I wish it was more consistent."}
{"text":"Went here just before 6pm on December 9th.  I only know that because it was where my daughter wanted to go for her birthday dinner.  We were sat within like 10 minutes and the host were friendly.  Our \"server\" was Melissa, and I only found out because I looked at her nametag.  She didn't do a proper greet, she took a while to deliver drinks, the only part of the welcome that she did right was offering a wine sample.  She didn't offer refills on soups, or drinks, had to wait to get the plates clears until we stacked them.  I saw her take a dirty plate from another table and put it on the tray while boxing a different table's food, and she lied about how something was made because the bowl was messy and she didn't want to take it back and get another that looked presentable.  They were also told that we were there for my kid's birthday and no acknowledgement or anything.  The assistant manager?  might have even been a service pro was the reason for 2 stars instead of 1.  She was nice and engaging when I told her what happened and seemed a bit mortified by some of the stuff I told her.  The manager seemed like a donkey (some words can't be said on yelp)  He was very dismissive and acted like I didn't know what I was talking about, and then I informed him that I was a server trainer at a different location.  Meal was comped, which I told them I would pay for it so I could get the survey.  Guess I will have to stick with either going to the locations I know or making the food at home myself."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.  Why go to the Olive Garden when Pittsburgh has so many great local Italian places?  Hey, it's convenient and the food is decent.  For lunch, Olive Garden ain't bad in a pinch!   I had business to go to near the airport and I stopped here out of necessity.

I had the basic spaghetti & meatballs in marinara sauce.  Not bad.  I wish they had cups of soup 'cos the Zuppa Toscana was mighty tempting.  

Okay, so I admit I like the Olive Garden.  But my husband better not take me here on date night!"}
{"text":"Much has been written about Olive Garden and how it's not \"authentic\" Italian food.  Hey, it's a chain restaurant, no better and no worse than any other chain restaurant.  

I stopped in here for lunch after doing a site visit for work.  I tried the Venetian Apricot Chicken, which was a chicken breast glazed in an apricot citrus sauce with a side of veggies.  The chicken was good and juicy and my veggies weren't overcooked.  Oh ,but my blackberry blood orange ice tea was really good.

Yes, Pittsburgh has many good locally owned Italian restaurants, and please patronize them when you can.  But places like Olive Garden ,Applebee's, & Chili's fill a need to, particularly hwen you need a decent, wuick lunch."}
{"text":"Soup and salad deal is awesome, but overall I am not a big fan.
Its cheap and acceptable on every level.  Mediocre at best for me.
I don't know what I don't like about it, but its not the food, its the fake job here, it feels sterile and fake for Italian food.     I always enjoy the food, but not the feeling it leaves me with...sorry, maybe its just me.   Give it a try, I know people that swear by it.  
I swear to always go somewhere else.
Its like Mcdonald's, its my last stop, under duress, that I choose it, and its just ok, its food! 
I prefer an italian sub shop that's authenic to this mass produced italian.
It is what it is.....enjoy!"}
{"text":"Poor quality, poor service... Cold, bland food."}
{"text":"A chain is a chain, but i thought this Olive Garden deserved a little more recognition. My family has always loved the Olive Garden for some reason, maybe unlimited soup and bread sticks, not to mention good pasta. 
i don't know if this is a newer Olive Garden or what, but this is one of the nicest Olive Gardens i've ever been to. It had a nice airy, light filled Italian feel throughout, unlike the rest of them. 

This is our new Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I can tell you why The Darden Group that consists of Olive Garden, Red Lobster, The Capital Grille and a few others is missing earnings estimates. The portion sizes have come way down and the price is the same. Plus they got rid of the Garlic Herb Chicken con Broccoli. What is this world coming to? First Famous Dave's and now the Olive Garden have lost their MOJO.

I guess it's been awhile since I've ordered the Chicken Parm, because who orders that when there's Chicken con Broccoli? You get one small piece of chicken with some spaghetti when you used to get a giant slab of chicken. Good thing the Minestrone Soup and Breadsticks are still outstanding.

This is a weak 3 star rating but the Minestrone Soup saved this place from tumbling further."}
{"text":"I love the Olive Garden. Although it cost $49.25 (before tip) for a party of three on my recent visit on 12/22/10. If you really believe those awesome breadsticks are free, think again. 

I recommend the Garlic-Herb Chicken con Broccoli and the minestrone soup. The chicken comes on a bed of noodle shells in a creamy white sauce and perfectly seasoned with a touch of garlic along with the broccoli. Another favorite during lent is the Shrimp Primavera which is cooked in a spicy arrabbiata sauce along with penne pasta, bell peppers, onions and mushrooms (I say hold the mushrooms).

Make sure you ask your server for a couple of extra chocolate mints to wash away that garlic taste in your mouth.

Did I mention the breadsticks and the minestrone soup are awesome. I can say I have had an excellent meal every time at Olive Garden whether it's in the South or the Midwest and the Scottsdale location delivers the goods as well."}
{"text":"I do note  PHOENOMINAL excellent service by the waitstaff and manager and waitstaff that wasn't even ours. They did truly work as a team. Our group was made to feel Welcome Here.

I guess I have to start with the breadsticks. They give you bunches of them like it's raining breadsticks. Not all but most of the people at my table liked them but I thought they tasted a frozen dough product. One bite was enough for me as I didn't taste real garlic or a tasty oil on them.

The salad was sort of average with a what seemed like bottled dressing on it. They give you all you want and grate cheese on it for you.

I had the Apricot Chicken that's on the new Healthy Menu. The chicken wasn't as bad as that spongy Subway kind of chicken. I'm not sure if it was precooked and reheated or just over marinated because of the odd texture. It didn't taste fresh cooked but might have been. It seemed like it was cooked in a press of some sort. The asparagus and broccoli were nice and fresh but 100% unseasoned and just steamed. This dish tasted salt free and was slightly sweet.

My husband had a Shrimp and pasta dish. The shrimp were the small ones and the pasta was overdone.

I'd say if you are a fan of frozen TV dinners you will love the food here because it's a notch better with excellent service."}
{"text":"I love this place and Latisha, our sever, was so sweet! She made the dining experience really great. Delicious food and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Love coming the this Olive Garden. Very friendly and courteous server and door greeter."}
{"text":"This is a good Olive Garden - you know what kind of food is offered. What make this location good is it is consistent and you can count on a decent meal. This last trip we had a server named Jay. He was excellent and his timing was impeccable."}
{"text":"Needs an upgrade to the outside of the building but our food was really great. Pretty good as far as Olive Garden's go."}
{"text":"The food is good but it doesn't make up for the bad service....the wait staff is poorly trained..very slow....while we wait for service we noticed six people at the reception desk doing nothing....it takes six people to seat guests on a Monday ....sorry that's not acceptable...won't be back"}
{"text":"They had delicious salad and breadsticks. The Alfredo was perfect. I had to eat here by myself cause my wife hates Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I love the food and the service is great. Our waiter was amazing and very polite. Kept our drinks filled and was attentive to our needs. Plus they're about 5 minutes where I live, so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Slow service, disappearing waitress, rude food server, floaties in the drinks......my worst experience ever at Olive Garden. I'm never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I suppose no one ever expects to find a five star rating on a chain restaurant, but it's possible if they are on top of their game. As for chicken Marsala, at least cook the chicken perfectly and definitely don't get to the almost cardboard state. Problem #1 was compounded by over reduced wine sauce that has gotten to the point of just burnt. Chain restaurant big fail. Service was excellent, so there's that..."}
{"text":"Customer service failure.  Have been to this restaurant several times and have enjoyed it, but recently (6/18/2014) I called to order out and was on the receiving end of some of the worst customer service.

First problem is the phone menu.  When I called it asks you to press 1 for to go ordering.  When somebody then answered I had to be transferred to somebody to take the order.  Why have a phone menu that turns out to be absolutely worthless?
Then once I had somebody, after giving the first part of the order, I waited for confirmation from the order taker that she had gotten it and after a long silence, she blurted out \"I'm waiting\".  Turns out she had not gotten the first part of the order at all and displayed a very impatient attitude towards me.

I realize that sometimes they are busy, but this was during a down time so that is not an excuse.  I will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Yep another chain and though I have eaten at many OG's over the years, have never been a huge fan. 

Had lunch here on a Thursday with Gma, mom, and daughter towards the late side of the lunching hour. For some reason, there was a wait, and the dining room was crowded. 

Long story short, 2 of us returned our meals as they were nasty. Breadsticks and salad are still good but unfilled iced tea, weird service, etc. makes this one chain we will never visit again while in the area."}
{"text":"I love going here on a Friday or Saturday night. It's busy and wait is usually 30 minutes. So I just go sit at the bar and have a great meal and chat with the bartender. They give you VIP service and really treat you right.  Not big into chain restaurants but this one worth your time."}
{"text":"I downloaded this app just to give this review. I got here at 7:20 and we still do not have our food at 8:10. I ordered a glass of wine to just get the wrong wine. The waitress did not even apologize. Our food got here at 8:12 before my wine.  We love coming to Olive Garden but this one sucks. The service and all. It seems you have to go to Pineville for good service. By the way my spaghetti and meatballs came with ONE meatball."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service is usually good. 

Every once in a blue moon I get a craving for OG and come here to fuck up some salad and breadsticks. Last nights salad was soggy, old, and the tomatoes had some mold on them.

The chicken (3 strips) in the dinner portion of the Chicken Alfredo I ordered tasted funky and rubbery. Definitely not fresh, and if it was they need to source better suppliers. 

Waitress was super nice & made sure our drinks stayed full. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"We were in the care of Shauna tonight, who is on her last night of training, and she did wonderfully on her own! She was attentive, professional, and prompt. Her trainer (I'm sorry I'm terrible with names; he's a nice young man with an awesome mustache) was the one to show us to our table and he was a delight as well. When we go to Olive Garden we only come for soup and salads, so it's hard to screw up on the food and tonight was no exception. It was all very good. We were so impressed with the service we sprang for dessert (the Lemon Cream Cake) and got a complementary raspberry dipping sauce with it! So good! It all made for a pleasant dinner!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch was a good experience even though the lights went out. We had a wonderful server Anthonio. He said it was his second day as a server but he did an excellent job. We didn't have to ask for a refill on our drinks he had them refilled before it was empty. I would go back here for another meal."}
{"text":"So I placed a carry-out order and the guy working the station when I arrived asked for the name on the order so i gave it to him. He told me to wait there and that he was gonna go and get my order for me, so I waited. 10 minutes passed and other customers arrived, a lady (which I'm assuming was the manager on duty) asked us if we've been helped and i said yes that the gentleman working the station told me he was gonna go get my order and she looked confused. She bypassed me and helped the other customers, so those customers orders got brought up to the front and mine was not, then the girl who was actually working the station asked me if I had been help and I told her that the guy had said that he was gonna go get my order but she said that that was weird that there was no guy working that station at the moment and so she called my order over their headset and my order was finally brought up to me 20 mins after waiting. Whomever this guy employee was, was very rude and disrespectful and unprofessional to just have kept me there waiting and actually not bring my order or have had called it. Never will I dine or order food at this location ever again!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here tonight. I had the shrimp Alfredo. Plus I chose a soup that had chicken and dumplings. Also had a glass of the Michelle Chardonnay. Was a wonderful dinner with excellent service. The waiter was on point with refills with my water, checked on us after the food was served, didn't complain on how much cheese I had him put on my food Haha. We asked for a booth after they tried to put us at a table and they had no problem with that and found us a nice booth. Very polite staff and the food was amazing in all courses. 5 stars definitely. It is a pricey restaurant but if you have the cash to spend or the taste for the finer foods then definitely stop in. Will absolutely come back."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's a typical chain. Food is overpriced for what it is. They say unlimited bread sticks, soup or salad but they don't even fill the soup or salad bowl half way up.  I have never had a server at this location that was on top of things.  I am always thirsty or waiting to get something I need."}
{"text":"WORST dining experience. 

The dinner was for my best friends birthday and her two sisters birthdays which fall the day before. 

We called two hours prior to make a reservation for 9 adults and 2 children. We were told we couldn't make a reservation. So we ended up getting there a 7 to wait. We told Kat it was for 9 and 2 babies. She put us down, but when she did it was for 5 people. We again told her 9 adults 2 kids. She seemed very confused by her job. After reassuring that 9+2=11 multiple times she put us down for 11 people even after continuing to get it wrong when talking to the other lady tiffany. Honestly these woman were incompetent. I'm not sure if they could even handle rolling silverware but they definitely shouldn't be running the front. 

She never asked for our name or gave an estimated wait time. After 15 minutes of waiting she told us our table was being set up. Almost 30 minutes later they came and called for our table, another group was confused for us and they gave the table we had been waiting for away to another group. After we told her she called the manager. Finally they went and looked for a place to seat us. We waited and hour all together even after being told only a few minutes for the table to be set up. 

Once we were finally seated we were thankful. We had two waiters and both introduced themselves and took our drink and appetizer orders. When one came back he only brought the appetizers and one side of the tables drinks. We asked again for our water and bread and waited about another 10-15 minutes. Still no one brought those who had nothing to drink, something to drink or bread. We finally asked two guys clearing tables to bring us  water and bread. I also canceled my drink and only wanted water because I had already been waiting too long. We finally got some water but AGAIN had to ask for bread. Even though I canceled my drink they ended up bringing it and asked if I just wanted it since it was already made. I said I guess, even though it was canceled. (They ended up charging me for it, even though i told them it was canceled twice). 

The manager came over a few times to try and set things right even though we were all extremely unsatisfied by that point. 

By the time we did get our food everyone was ready to leave and they were already about to close at 10 anyways. So we asked for boxes to take the food to go. 15 minutes and no one comes with boxes. Finally someone comes back and asks if we need boxes.... Even after we already asked. Waited again, finally after more waiting we got boxes. By this point I had enough. Honestly if you need two waiters for one table one of them shouldn't just bail out and never come back. It was one waiter for all is us but after asking other people about 5 different people had to take our requests. 

Needles to say it was a complete disaster and a fantastic way to ruin 3 people's birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday (Canada day long weekend) for my Aunty birthday. We came at 5:30 and got a table right away. 

Our waitress Tiana was amazing she was very friendly and service was great. She made our special occasion even better. The menu has a large selection, something for everyone. All meals comes with salad or soup and bread. I got the stuff chicken Marsala and asked for spaghetti instead of the mash potatoes and it was good very saucy. Food portion large at a decent price."}
{"text":"Olive garden never disappoints.  It's affordable food not too far from home.  I had the Chianti braised short rib with risotto.  I love this dish and for $16 you really can't go wrong.  My husband had the stuffed chicken marsala.  He cleaned his plate so he obviously liked it.  We ate in the bar area since there is no wait there.  Service was great.  FYI-most of their dishes can be found on their website."}
{"text":"We've been going to OG for years at various locations across FL and the greater Phoenix, AZ area, and we're huge fans.  The food is consistently good, and the service is usually prompt.  The atmosphere is casual, so come as you are, but you could also dress up and make a date night out of it as well.  I've also been with large parties for birthdays and whatnot, and they are always accommodating.  

The food is always prepared fresh and served hot.  We love sitting at the bar with its quick open seating, and when it's not that busy we've always found the bartenders friendly and super attentive.  We typically get the spaghetti with meat sauce (hey, you can't beat a classic!).  I pair mine with the pasta fagioli, while my wife usually goes for a salad.  If there's any room left, we will split a black tie mousse cake. Delicious!

While this sounds like a general review, this absolutely applies to this OG location.  There are multiple OG's in our area, and this is our go to spot for its consistent service and relative proximity to our apartment.  Be sure to check this place out, and save us a seat at the bar!"}
{"text":"i lived in Italy for 2 years so i know what real italian food is and this is not it, but I go there expecting that. One thing i don't get is that they have a special culinary school in italy and they teach chefs how to cook genuine italian food? wtf! anyways the only time i come here is to get my belly full from the never ending pasta bowl dinner. if it wasn't for the special i doubt i would ever go there."}
{"text":"Very poor and inattentive service... Went there Saturday night with friends no one came to check on us for 10 mins no water nothing then upon asking a server showed up .. took forever for the food to come ..messed the order and brought out Alfredo instead of lasagna.. no lemon on water .. no apologies.. below average food will not be coming back .."}
{"text":"We had a lunch in this wonderful place. I was very happy with services, very tasty food, comfortable interior...sooo I'm going to back soon:) thank you ! Love Italian food!"}
{"text":"I only come to Olive Garden once in a blue moon. It gets very expensive with a family of 6 so when i dish out $100.00 bucks i expect a good meal. Wait time was 40-50 mins and i dont see how since half the place was empty. After about 15 mins of being seated our server arrived, she was very nice but non the less what took her 15 mins. We had time to look over the menu and ordered our food. My wife and i had soups with our meals. About 6 soups and 55 mins later our food arrived. At this point i didnt even want to eat. i simply asked for a to go box. Our server apologized for the long wait said they were short staffed etc etc. She told my wife she would get her a desert on the house of her choice. so my wife ordered the lemon cake. After receiving our bill i noticed she charged us for the cake. LIKE SERIOUSLY!!!! I didnt even say anything about it. I simply paid my bill left a tip i felt was enough and we left. Wont be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I don't mind eating at the Olive Garden because I LOVE their soup, salad, and bread sticks. That alone is 4 stars! I'm taking away one star because they serve shitty overpriced pasta."}
{"text":"If you come here you want Taylor as your server, she's fun, sweet, talkative and knowledgeable!

I had the shrimp scampi and gnocchi and dumpling soup, amazing!!!!!

My husband had spaghetti and sausage, and loved it.

It's a great place :-)"}
{"text":"I always say I am going to swear off chair restuarants, but I can't give up the good old OG.  Soup, salad, and breadsticks....oh my!  Best minestrone soup I have ever had.....large portions at a great price.  The only problem is I usually eat so much soup and breadsticks I end up boxing up the entree and making it my next day's lunch.....and dinner!  If loving the Olive Garden is wrong, I don't want to be right!"}
{"text":"Always really busy here, but the food is amazing and we've had so many great servers here that make us laugh and talk to us to make us feel comfortable. I always get the chicken parm and they always refill our breadsticks quickly. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"wrote back to Chris and never heard from him, so much for that."}
{"text":"Food is very good, service is also good. Problem is that my favorite food is not very healthy! And OG's food is very fattening! But that's my problem! For a restaurant chain this place is one of the best."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of OG! Just your typical franchise restaurant. But the wife, daughter, and myself had a great experience at this location. Food was very good, I had the stuffed chicken Marsala. Seen it on TV, and wanted to try it. Glad I did! Chicken was very moist, stuffed with dried tomato's,  Wife enjoyed their ravioli's with meat sauce, daughter had no problem with the Alfredo! Our server was Wolfgang, really nice guy! Always came by and checked on us, always made sure everything was fine. Place has a very good server there! This OG location, is probably the best experience we have had with Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This is my second time being at an olive garden. We (me and parents) had a meal with Some neighbors. The Gniogi (typo) Soup was good, but there Was flaws to it. One of the biggest flaws was the Gniogi In the soup was never found except in my second serving but even that was crappy Because when I didn't get any gnocchi I only got one or two pieces Of Pasta. Then the tea that I got that I asked for more hot water an it took a while before I got that and a few more things etc. I mean I understand that it was somewhat of a busy restaurant during that time but going over a certain limit of time was not fun. Yet The risotto balls are great that's all I can say."}
{"text":"Came as part of a large wedding party and the service was outstanding!  We were given a private room with just enough space for the entire party.  Service, though slow because of the size of our party, was prompt and polite.   The food was excellent and the two servers made sure we had enough drinks, salad, and breadsticks.   After the great experience, I would certainly consider this Olive Garden for a function of my own."}
{"text":"A review of the new Cheese Filled Soffatelli....

Olive Garden is my grandpa's favorite place because we can take the whole family, even my vegetarian niece, and everyone can find SOMETHING to eat.(to eat, not to love, but to eat).  Yesterday, I tried their new Cheese Filled Soffatelli with Chicken.  I had two bites and was done.  It may have been the breadsticks, or the fried cheese & ravioli (cheese=good, ravioli=dry) but I couldn't stomach that much lead. 

I thought there would be on a bed of spinach and diced tomatoes...nope.  Its a fried piece of greasy chicken smothered in white cheeze-wiz sauce with tiny bits of spinach.  It was so greasy and heavy it made me sick to my stomach before it even made it there.  The stuffed pastries were even worse with an overly flavored cheese stuffing that hung in your stomach like lead.  I strongly suggest something (anything) else.  May I recommend the Apricot chicken or mixed grill?"}
{"text":"My mother swears by this place, and I love to take her there.  Unforunately, Olive Garden is another chain restaurant that tries its best to be theme-ingly delicious.  I hate themed restaurants for that very reason. Frozen pastas, jarred sauces and mediocre food on a pretty plate is just that.  call me picky, but I prefer to avoid this place as often as possible.  Given that this place has its moments, but unless they start doing things fresh, I won't change my star rating."}
{"text":"Took my parents out for their wedding anniversary, our service was INCREDIBLE. Waitress was so pleasant and on the ball. What a sweetheart. Food was super good as well!"}
{"text":"The service here was so bad. My drink was never refilled, our server threw our dishes down in front of us and just left. My boyfriend had ants crawling around him. Then the server brought us our check and it wasn't even ours, it was another table. After I pointed this out to her, our server seemed very annoyed and acted like we were stupid for not using the little tablet to pay. The food was fine - nothing special but not bad."}
{"text":"Thankfully I made reservations a day in advance. The wait would have been over an hour, we got a table in about 5 minutes. The service was great, and very fast. We happened to go on prom night and the place was insanely crowded. The parents at the table behind us complained that her kids and their friends didn't get sat together (which was a ridiculous complaint because the hostess said there was no guarantee, the kids  just wanted to get in and out faster). (Parents shouldn't chaperone their kids to prom dinner!! IMO...). The manager comped all of their meals... Very generous of him for such a dumb complaint."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden is absolutely horrible!! Bad customer service all around and they were no where near capacity. This place deserves -5 stars!!

What went right: we got excellent parking.

What went wrong:   We were seated in a closed off nook, in which asking to be reseated resulted in the hostess rolling her eyes at me. 
They were out of children's menus!!!
We waited a long while for our server, Christian to find us. 
After taking out drink order he vanished again for quite some time.
When he reappeared we asked him to get salad and breadsticks out asap (kids were starving) he said he wouldn't do that until we gave him our entree order. He disappeared again.
When he returned we asked him again to bring that out asap as we were about to order. Again he said no and disappeared without taking our order. We sent another server to find him and he comes back and asks what do we need?! We told him we had been waiting to order but he keeps disappearing. He took our order and still no salad or breadsticks.
20 - 25 minutes later he brings salad and breadsticks followed by our entrees. We tell him there is no way we can eat all of this at the same time so he offers to take the entrees back to the kitchen. We rejected that idea given the likely hood we'd never see him again.
Finally, all of our entrees were cold. The salad was all  chunky white parts with little teeny bits of green lettuce. It was soggy and distasteful.  We never got refills on our peach teas or sodas.
We asked another server to hunt down Christian but instead some super sassy girl walks over and asks what we wanted. We told her we'd like our server. With even more sassiness she said why don't you tell me what you guys want so I can get it! I asked her to send the manager over and she said she would. 10 minutes  later after no Christian and no manager I approached the hostess area and spoke to the snotty hostess with a bad hair dye job (she sat us)again. This time she was nicer when I asked for the manager.
The manager was ok. She took all the events lightly. She did comp a couple of the 5 adult meals but left the rest on our check. Each and every meal was only partially eaten because of it being cold or tasting horrible. 
When I returned to our table I was really surprised that Christian was STILL NO WHERE TO BE FOUND not even the manager knew his whereabouts. 

Ultimately,  he reappeared when the sassy waitress tells him we left him a $20 tip. He had a shockface! He lost out! My husband is the most generous tipper. 

We will NEVER visit this location agai!!!!  It's too bad their Facebook page doesn't allow us to rate them."}
{"text":"The Goodyear location is always on point! The service is out of this world and the food quality is excellent. 

What went wrong: I got full too fast from enjoying my peach tea! :)

What went right: Everything! The experience exceeded all of our expectations.  Our server Kari was very attentive,  polite and personable. 
She kept our drinks filled without us having to ask. The manager Kris made her rounds to ensure all guests were taken care of. She was very nice. She was very willing to jump in and assist with a very large party next to us.

I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Frank the server there is awesome! He takes his job seriously and made our experience fantastic.  He doesn't write down his orders but got it 100% right.  He was super friendly and made our evening great! Thank you Frank!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is getting worse and worse every time i visit. If it was not for the amazing food I would not continue coming here."}
{"text":"To-go orders are slow as molasses! I called a simple order in of two salads and two Zuppa Toscana soups. I was told they would be ready by 7pm. Got to the restaurant at 7, told them I had called in my order, and walked out of the restaurant with my food...29 minutes later. There were three people in front of me, with the third person ordering a large amount of food on site. They all received their food before me. Not to mention, by the time I finally received my food...they brought me the wrong order. That will be the last time I'm doing that...and it was only a Thursday night. Disappointing. So much for \"to-go\" service..."}
{"text":"I use to come to this location often for cheap Italian food, but after my last visit I won't be stepping into this building again. We were finishing up lunch one day with some out of state relatives when I looked over at my daughter to see a cock roach crawling on the booth seat she was in! We brought it up to the manager and all he said was \"are you guys leaving?\" Didn't offer to cover the bill or offer compensation. During that comment another larger roach appeared on the freaking table!!!!! I lost it and we all stormed out."}
{"text":"Wanted to take the kids(college aged) out and wanted to go someplace they have not been for a while.  We had an overly polite waiter, sort of like Eddie Haskle.  The food was good. I have not been to this chain in years and was very disappointed that the Seafood Portofinio was no longer carried. The peach-strawberry tea only tasted like sweat tea (not a preference of mine).  Other than my negatives it was not a bad experience. We had a party of 6 on a Friday night and only waited 15 minutes."}
{"text":"hello iw ent there on Monday and the  waitress we got was such a wonderful person did a great job and full of smiles her name was Nicole if I go back il ask for her  she was wonderful"}
{"text":"I have been here endless amount of times. It is always fabulous.

I would go here just for the salad and breadsticks, they are that good.  The salad dressing the use is amazing. I love getting the parmesan cheese on the salad as well.  You can order just salad when you go. Otherwise you get it with any meal you order.

I usually get the orange glazed chicken with asparagus. Sometimes I get a pasta dish though. But regardless, the food is always great.

The servers always dress professional and make it seem like a fine dining experience even though it is not. So I love this place!! Great Italian food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"The waitress is very nice and professional. The food tastes great and fresh. I went here before but today is better than my first time. My daughter likes the spaghetti with tomato sauce."}
{"text":"The service was prompt and the food was hot and fresh enough at this location.  There is nothing very exciting about an Olive Garden.  If you are looking for authentic Italian food, obviously, that's not here."}
{"text":"This the Olive Garden is at Fiesta Mall in Mesa. It was renovated a few years ago and NOT for the better. Instead of several discreet dining areas, it is now one HUGE room, with tables and chairs too close together. The noise level alone at peak dining times makes dinner conversation impossible.
The food is 2-3 star level pseudo-Italian and the prices much higher than Rigatonys and other local Italian restaurants. The service varies from OK to dreadful. I rarely eat here anymore even though it is close to my home. 
I think the 2 star \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" sums it up."}
{"text":"Cheap and you pay for what you get. But I'm not a fan of any olive gardens. I always hate life when i eat there. Buts it's a cheap easy meal."}
{"text":"Our party of 3 all ordered the unlimited soup, salad & breadsticks for lunch.  Everything was freshly made and tasty.  Karina was our server and she made sure we were well taken care of.  We also placed an order to go before we left and she made sure we had everything we ordered in the bag when she brought it to the table.  When the manager stopped by before we left he said Karina was a fairly new employee.  This surprised us because she was such a great server."}
{"text":"We frequent this OG often because it's close to my parents home. We are always greeted with kindness and smiles. The dinning rooms are always set up nicely and it's obvious they are prepared to handle a lot of guests. Our waitress this visit was overly attentive to the point of annoyance. Offering complimentary wine as we were looking over the menu, she seemed more interested in getting in her \"wine talk\" then reading the table. It was obvious we were a family and taking time to reconnect and she kept talking.  She came back to the table 3 times to take our order but again she was not \"reading\" our table. It was around 530/6pm and clearly the place was not busy but she rushed us. 
Food is good, basic OG menu. Food arrived quickly and correctly. Don't believe that the Sicilian cheese cake was made with ricotta, because it was terrible."}
{"text":"Was here over the weekend. Very busy but they really took the time we were mad comfortable and made sure if our waiter wasn't present to ask if we needed anything."}
{"text":"... this particular location (and I assume all off them) is crazy busy around peak dinner time so we try to eat early dinner when we want to eat here on a weekend night (try 4:30pm). Food has always been prepared amazingly and at a large quantity. I typically overdo it with the soup/salad before my meal that I have to box 3/4 of the entree up (don't get me wrong either, I can throw food back like nobody's business but I'll be damned if I can finish garlic bread, soup/salad, plus the entree)! We typically eat in a hurry these days with the ticking time bomb of a 15 month old in tow with us. Our last visit, our server seemed to understand our fluster and boxed our meal in record time, handing us about 10 chocolate mints on the way out! Haha!"}
{"text":"So I love me some Olive Garden and I've only been to this location once before but wow, the service really sucked. We came and asked about happy hour and said it was only at the bar, so we sat at the bar no big deal. It seemed like they didn't any us to sit there... But even worst we weren't even really greeted. The guys at the bar didn't really seem to want to help us. I knew we were going to get slow service so we chose our food before they even took our drinks and ordered right away.

I am literally sitting at the bar writing this review because that's how bad the service is. So even though I won't ban going to OG I won't come to this location again."}
{"text":"It used to be really good.

Sometimes it's good. It's a hit and miss. The hits are wonderful, good food, good service, good everything. The settings is wonderful and it's fantastic.

But when it's a miss, bad servers and bad food can sour the taste.

One time our server was rude and mean, he didn't explain much about the menu. He only wanted to take our orders, and he never smiled.

The pasta can often be over cooked and chicken really really dry.

Overall the experience in this branch is a 50/50 hit or miss."}
{"text":"I hadn't had food from the Desert Sky Olive Garden for years.  I had lunch take-out: chicken gnocci soup, fettucini alfredo, breadsticks.  Absolutely delicious!  Could not have been better.  The portions were fine, enough for two meals."}
{"text":"I took my daughter out for her 21st Birthday. We had a party of 7. We waited an hour to be seated which was fine because it was extremely busy and it is my daughters favorite restaurant. We were first seated at a table for 6 people which was very tight. They moved us to a bigger table and that's when the nightmare began. We sat at the new table at 7:15. My drink came out wrong and the waitress told me not to pay attention to the description on the menu because it was wrong. She took the drink back. And it was still wrong the second time around. After sitting for 30 min we asked about salad and bread and the waitress told us it was not endless and would come out with our orders. So my husband found a manager who quickly rectified the situation. We were hoping things would turn around. But no, my appetizer came out wrong and while putting cheese on the salad it went into my daughters friend lap. Again the waitress had an excuse. Finally our meals came out and the table was crowed due to empty plates not being picked up. After the meals, which were very good despite my shrimp being a little burned, the waitress never asked if we wanted dessert. My mother asked if we could order some. I guess we were just asking for more trouble!! So after 2 1/2 hours of terrible service the bills come out. They were all messed up. After her third attempt to get everything together we were finally able to pay and leave. Upon walking out another waitress who was working near us apologized for the terrible service we received. Even though my drink and appetizer were free it didn't make up for the horrible customer service we experienced."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden. What's not to love? From the fantastic salad and breadsticks to the \"Tour of Italy,\" this is a casual dining favorite for all. 

This location is everything you'd expect from any Darden property. Good food and always excellent service. Is there better Italian to be had in the city? Sure! However you can never go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We ate here Thursday night (2/21) and had a great experience. Our server (wish I could remember her name) was helpful & polite. She gave us wine samples and everything came out quickly.

The chocolate mousse cake dessert was FABULOUS! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The service at the door was poor. Whoever the door girl is ?...get a new one. Shes like the teacher on ferris buller. Server was on point Angel was his name. Above and beyond. Food was not worth the price for sure."}
{"text":"Tina is a wonderful person! She's very professional and sweetheart. Thank you so much again! Tina. Coz of you we had a great lunch time. You made us feel the foods much delicious ."}
{"text":"I would warn you not to order to go...I'm not sure what has transpired to implement their new to go window but there is no semblance of order or customer service you just stand their wondering if they have you order if it's ready until they call your name...they ignore you at the window if you arrive at the time they tell you to even check if it's ready...Olive Garden to go needs some work from someone with hospitality experience...food was good but getting it what a pain...maybe ask for curbside might be better...good luck getting your breadsticks and not feeling like a pleb standing around the kitchen like a confused a hole as the workers walk around you during the entire process!"}
{"text":"We never have GREAT service here but today we couldn't even get service. We walked into a thick smell of paint and when we were seated we noticed patches all over the walls and the smell of paint was even stronger at our table. We looked at the menu and decided what we were ordering and processed to watch other tables finish their meals and pay their checks while we were still waiting to order our drinks. We ended up getting up and leaving and going to Red Lobster down the street. I can't believe this location would remain open during a remodel and provide this level of service. I sat for at least 10 minutes inhaling paint fumes to leave still hungry. I know you get what you pay for but it's sad when I can't even order my cheap crappy meal."}
{"text":"Never, never and I mean never let them sit you next to the bar. Second time and service was horrible, bartender tended to us and our food was cold, wrong and we hardly saw him after sitting there
For almost an hour. Will drive the extra 20 minutes to go to pineville."}
{"text":"This is a nice Olive Garden and I am impressed with my takeaway. I ordered Shrimp Alfredo and Shrimp Scampi. Shrimp were great on Scampi, Fettuccini Alfredo was good. Pasta on Scampi wasn't tasty as alfredo  . Service was friendly and quick . Prices are affordable at $11-$25. They hooked me up with Andes chocolates here (Thanks). I recommend this spot"}
{"text":"Of course it is crowded on a Friday night. We sit at the bar instead of waiting 30+ minutes. The bar tender Jason was a rock star behind the bar. He was able to take orders, prepare drinks, answer staff and patrons questions without missing a beat. Awesome time and if you go to the bar ask for Jason."}
{"text":"Olive Garden... What can I say except to quote Tony the Tiger, \"They're GREAAAT!\" I've never had a bad experience at an Olive Garden. We went to this restaurant last week and the servers were great, the food was great and the ambiance was great. Lovin' it!!!

Only one thing has ever bothered me about this chain... I am a lover of olives, especially black olives and I can eat them by the basketful. Why does a chain that professes to be a gardener of these black jewels always seem to be so stingy with them? I think they're Olive Hoarders rather than gardeners. 

I have never (in all my visits) seen more than TWO olives in their huge salad bowl. Come on! You're Olive GARDEN. Show us some love....

Release the olives!!!"}
{"text":"Not salting your pasta is a crime! I ordered Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo and expected to enjoy it. I didn't. First, the pasta was bland and I had to add salt. The Alfredo sauce tasted like watered-down pancake batter with specs of garlic. The sauce also needed flavor and salt Corporate shouldn't care if salting your pasta is harder on the pots, and they must be replaced more often. I think the \"true payoff\" would be better tasting food, and happier customers."}
{"text":"Gail was amazing.  Service was superb.  Food was delicious. My date was HOT.  Nice evening of laughter, fun and food."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered here was salty.  The bread seasoning was salty, the salad had too much Italian dressing and the food- I had lasagna-was also salty.  I've eaten at a different location and the food didn't taste this bad.
Our server wasn't that great either.  He didn't bother to check us often"}
{"text":"I haven't been to olive Garden in years. it was clean, friendly, and the food was quick."}
{"text":"You almost ruined my day with your extremely poor service. My buddy and I stopped in for soup and salad - thinking that would be a good quick lunch. My waiter couldn't have been anymore dead inside if he tried. It was extremely hard to get any service out of this guy. The waiter was bad but, the process is worse - so slow. Not the place to go for a working lunch. Slow - awful service but, the food was decent. Won't be back to this location...ever."}
{"text":"The food was delicious as expected and on time (pick up order). They loaded us up with extra bread sticks - too many actually  :) Everyone at our gathering was pleased."}
{"text":"Food is always alright once you get it and they usually get your order right.  The WAIT is awful.  I hate waiting while you can see empty tables.  I would much rather be seated and sipping on a coke waiting. 

This has to be the worst managed restaurant ever.  When you do have problems manager always have an excuse and never an apology or what can I do to make it right attitude.  I have been here with our family and extended family where they food was so slow to come out that people were done eating before the last person got their food.  I only go here as a last resort."}
{"text":"My family and I come here once a month. I have to say last night's service, Saturday, October 7th, was exceptionally good. I had the chicken Margarita, which I usually get. It was and still one of my favorite dishes at this establishment. With business busy with homecoming going on. My family were able to get in and out within the hour."}
{"text":"Anything with a lot of tomato sause is bland. However, all their dishes with alfredo sause are very good and creamy. 

You must try the Bellini tea - that's tea with peach syrup. Mmmm."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today very good! Staff was very friendly from the hostess to the server to the bartender who got me more napkins. Had the chicken piccata and it was excellent :-)"}
{"text":"I've eaten with my friends at this location multiple times. However I have never had a server as rude as Dwight he was unattentive, frustrated, & just took our orders and never came back and even threw the straws at my brother and I, extremely disrespectful. I decided to go tell the hostess, Brooke and her manager took care of it right away and Liz became our server. Liz was kind, attentive, & provided wonderful service. The hostesses Brook and Brittany were absolute dolls and helped arrange my fathers bday and it made everything go so much smoother. Thank you ladies!!"}
{"text":"Few years ago, I always thought this place was high end. But through out the years, they've really lacked. Their apricot chicken was my favorite dish, as it had nice huge chicken breasts. Now, they're small and the vegetables are minimal! I would be still hungry after eating it too! I'm very sad about that. Their peach tea is always good, but I wouldn't count their food to be on par as they used to be."}
{"text":"Food is OK and portions are decent. however there is a tablet at the table to order or to make payment and there is a game inside it. we just check the game and played once. when i saw the check, i couldn't believe, they charged for 1.99$+tax for tablet game? 

1- did you inform me before playing about charges?

2- how is the stupid idea put a tablet and charge for customer when they are waiting for your slow service

3- this isn't even board, it was a stupid trivia tablet game, if i would know, i can download (or purchase) from apple store then no need to use stupid android tablet"}
{"text":"Went to Olive Garden to enjoy some quality time with my family. Restaurant area was clean and the environment was peaceful. Went to use the restroom and lost my appetite. I could not decide which was worse, the overflowing trash receptacles or the toilets that had more urine on the seat than in the toilet which was not flushed. Toilet was not even able to be used due to its lack of maintenance. Had to leave restaurant to go use toilets at Wendy's."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner to go.  We live about a mile away from the restaurant but was still a little apprehensive about the food staying hot.  The food was amazing.  Each entree was packed to stay hot, it did not take long for the order to be ready, and the staff was very friendly.  Thanks Olive Garden for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this Olive Garden since it opened. I guess what bothers me most about Olive Garden is that every time I find a dish I really like, they remove it from the menu. That is true of all OG's not just this location. 

On this night, the wait was approximately 10 minutes at 7:44 pm. We had wonderful service (wish I would have noted her name) and she made some recommendations for me when she over heard my disappointment  in losing my favorite dish. I settled on the bruschetta and pesto salmon with crab risotto. It was tasty and cooked well. The salad is always good bit our breadsticks were hard and almost tasted old which is not usual. Overall, Olive Garden provides a solid meal. Is it the best no but it's ok for chain food and we will always go back just for shear ease and proximity."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the server Joe in the evening but everything was great the food the service and the whole atmosphere and I normally do not like fake Italian restaurants like the olive garden. It was the second choice but a good Choice and I will go back. Because of the service. Had a great time thank you one star taken away for calling yourself an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was good but not as good as it used to be. The salad needed more dressing as it was quite dry. Waiter was very good and refilled our drinks wihout us asking..I will return though to this location when i am back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Sad. I was looking forward to dinner with a friend here since I have always enjoyed Olive Garden. My favorite Zuppe Toscana wa very disappointing. It was thin, weak and had rather larger (larger than the soup spoon) slices of potato. What happened to my rich, chunky favorite that actually fit into a soup spoon and was thick and succulent? Meh.

Ordered eggplant parmesan, having never tried that before. Expected to feel the standard spongy vegetable inside the batter but the only texture I could feel was breading. So I inspected my slice of eggplant. It was in there, but was thinner than the breading. Therefore, no texture, no flavor, no darned eggplant to speak of. I won't return."}
{"text":"love the food. The staff is always friendly. The wait can be long depending on when you go but it's a great place for Italian food and drinks such as sangria and bellinis."}
{"text":"I was given a gift card and decided to take the family to lunch. This was a disappointing experience. The waiter never told us about the daily specials. He wasn't  very knowledgable about the menu and he didn't clear the salad plates before bringing out the entrees. My husband had to make room for the entrees while the waiter stood there with hot plates in his hand. Now on to the food. I know exactly why I don't dine at OG. The salad tasted as if it had been in the fridge for days and the pasta had been microwaved too long. The bread sticks were loaded with salt.Never again!"}
{"text":"Will never return to this OG. Reasons:
1. Slowwww service. All the waitresses were friendly enough, but there is some serious inefficiency. No matter how crowded a restaurant is or how backed up in the kitchen, it should never take 10 minutes to get drinks. 
2. I know Olive Garden isn't known for its high food quality, but I do expect some consistency with national chain menus. Tonight I tried the new creamy mushroom sauce. Pictured below is what I found at the bottom of the bowl. Yuck. Also, I found a solitary potato chunk in the noodles?
3. Nasty bathrooms
4. You may not believe it, but the inside of my water glass smelled musty. I thought it may have been a fluke, but then read other reviews on here complaining about various odors at this particular establishment"}
{"text":"I have been doing the soup and salad here for years. Always good and good service until this trip. The salad had lots of bread cubes and hot peppers and onions but very little lettuce. Not only that but the salad bowl was about one third full for two large guys who were hungry. The server who was new and not very good told us the salads are made in the kitchen at a set amount but could bring us more when we were done. We were done for about fifteen minutes before we saw him again. The soups were not as good either. We tried our usual two and found they were mostly beans and not much else. Our waiter kept asking us if we wanted cheese on our soup and salad even though we had told him at them beginning that neither of us wanted it. He acted like we were new customers on each salad and soup which became annoying. The Olive Garden has always been consistent and pretty good up until now but we will not be going back for a while because of this experience."}
{"text":"Best Olive Garden experience. Food and service was super fast and perfect. The waiter Dylan really made the meal 100 times better too! Best waiter I've had in a long time anywhere. Worth the money! All the olive gardens in Michigan I've been to cant even be compared to this place!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden is always a 3 star consistent restaurant. There is always something lacking every time that we get food from the restaurant. But we know that going in, so we don't really mind anymore, we just work around it. When we dine in the restaurant the service is for the most part pretty good, sometimes some lapses and long wait time for items, but overall they do their best.

This review of the food was from the last time that we dined at this location.

Calamari - 4 Stars - Cooked and Seasoned Properly
Zuppa Toscana - 4 Stars - Full of Flavor and Potatoes & Sausage

Ravioli w/ Meatballs 4 Stars - Only problem is the consistency of how many meatballs you get. This time was 2 last time was 4. Need to figure out what the normal portion size for the meatballs are. 

Large Rigatoni w/ bacon Sun Dried Tomato Sauce w/ Chicken Meatballs - 1 Star - Not enough sauce, pasta was way over done and stuck together. The only thing that saved the dish was the chicken meatballs.

Lemon Cream Cake - 5 Stars - Always on point

Apple Bread Pudding 3 Stars - Some was nice and soft and other parts were very over done."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden is located I visited this

Atmosphere: Lively!
It's your typical sit-down restaurant setting: people waiting, servers and baristas moving about getting their orders out as quickly as possible. Nothing out the ordinary that makes this Olive Garden stick out from your usual dine-in chain. With subtle music in the background, it's actually quite nice.

Service: I appreciate them! (Except for waiting so long)
Initially, we were told that our waiting time was 25+ minutes, but upon further inquiry, our waiting time was decreased to just 15 minutes.

Our waitress was absolutely amazing, polite, and very appreciate of our presence. What I liked about my server the most was they she said, \"I appreciate you,\" That sounded really great to my ears, honestly. Having just this waitress interact with us made my visit!

Food: Quite nice, but nothing spectacular
This visit, I had the chicken Parmesan sandwich with a side of fries and marinara sauce. The chicken Parmesan is served in a larger-sized breadstick bun, which was not horrible at all. Tasted like your typical chicken parm, minus the pasta, of course.

In addition to the sandwich, I had the side salad and their berry sangria. The salad was served with Italian vinaigrette, which gave it good acidity and flavor. It tasted even better with our request of having no olives. The sangria was sweet, flavorful, and went well with the meal overall; didn't taste too alcoholic, either!

Overall: Good visit!
I really liked coming here and enjoying a meal with my friends. What killed it the most was being told to wait for 25 minutes. Good thing our waiting time was reduced! This is probably my favorite dining experiences at Olive Garden. Stop by at this location if you can!"}
{"text":"WENT TO EAT at olive garden Saturday night it was great.    always have good service at this location food is always hot and fresh.  hostess always tries to accommodate you and get you seated FAST.  always gives veterans a free meal on veterans day.  ask for amber(frog) likes to hop around.  she is really great and really friendly.   will be back thank you again."}
{"text":"Sat in bar area waiting for a \"10\" minute wait to be seated. After more than 20 minutes decided to just eat at bar. Ordered a drink & bruschetta. Server brought bruschetta with large slices of barely toasted bread. In Cali it comes with the small toasted ciabatta bread. Asked server to change bread. A server supervisor in all blue came to assure they would bring the new bread, nice lady!  When the bread came it was pure white, barely toasted. I sent it back. Our server came to table & said had to send it back AGAIN, it was STILL not done right!  Finally, it came. So I decide to have another drink (grey goose & peach schnapps).  Well, they ran out of peach schnapps & the bar tender tried to trick me with peach brandy.......come on now!!!  I sent it back!  So here comes the restaurant manager to tell me they ran out, what would I like on the house & remove charge from other drink.  She sent bar tender to me to ask what i would like. Nice guy!  Now that's the way to make amends with the customer!  Thank you manager @ supervisor in blue. Sorry, didn't get ur names. Server we had, no thank you."}
{"text":"We went to an event with a group of people and they suggested we go to Olive Garden for dinner before the show. I really wasn't expecting a fine dining experience, but this place is definitely not the place to go if you're looking for a good Italian food in Pittsburgh. Yes the salad and breadsticks or never-ending, but even with that perk the entrées or just subpar. I feel like everything they serve your comes out of a plastic bag or a TV dinner style microwave tray.


The waitstaff and hosting staff are super friendly very nice and clear we take pride in working at a busy establish restaurant."}
{"text":"Our server, Jesse, was very informative about the items on the menu.  He recommended favorites from the wine menu  He also offered us samples of the wine.  Our order of salad and bread was quickly whisk to our table with a suggestion of fresh black pepper service, which was accepted.   We ordered the entrees which was very satisfying and Jesse made sure that our food service was good.  Jesse, our waitor,  has a great personality for food service."}
{"text":"I agree with others that have stated that for a chain restaurant, Olive Garden is good. I do like the Mom/Pop restaurants, but sometimes a chain isn't bad. Being a prior restaurant owner and someone in the industry for 20+ years, I can appreciate, good food and good service. I am not a fan of fast food, but something quick, we make it due. Olive Garden in Monroeville has been a great spot for us as take out and dining in. I like the new pay at the table service with the tablet you find on all the tables. The kids enjoy the games if you're willing to pay for the service. The kids menus are great and keeps them busy with the actives on the page.  I usually order the Endless Soup and Salad. I love the Pasta Fagioli. I have tried the copycat version but I like the in restaurant better. We have also purchased the salad dressing. Good Stuff! The Stuffed Mushrooms are great always and I like the Fried Ravioli.  We have not had a bad experience and have had dinner and lunch there with a small group and with a larger group of family. Service either dining in or take out has always been, quick and friendly. I am starting to really like the take out service!"}
{"text":"Got together with a couple of friends for dinner. I ordered the veggie soup very salty I had to return it and ask for a salad. 
For the entrée I had the eggplant parmigiana I was pleased on how well it tasted! I not a huge fan of franchised food chains but Olive Garden is not on top of my list. I did try their bloody orange tea and it was great! I'm giving it 4 stars because of the soup. Customer service was great just need to pay attention on who ordered what. And try to bring out all the meals at the same time at our table or at anyone's table not 3-5 mins waiting in between 5 people."}
{"text":"Ah breaded eggplant never goes wrong! With having a semi vegan diet this is one dish I'll recommend if you come to Olive Garden. It's well portioned and it will surely fill you up. Not a fan of chain food restaurants but must admit this is my exception. Glad to know there's all you can eat soup or salad not to mention that really good bread of theirs. Makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that our waiter was very friendly! Although he was really pushing the add an item into the bill. Asking us what we would like to chose between an apple dish or lemon cake.. It almost made us feel guilty for not ordering.. On the other side, the food was disgusting. I was extremely disappointed with my salad, I ordered an extra side of shrimp that cost so much and only came with four pieces. (Waiter said it was 8 or 12) My boyfriend ordered spaghetti that had such little sauce that i asked them to recook or toss it. I am usually extremely satisfied with Champaign restaurants but this visit was pitiful."}
{"text":"Hint: reservation a must
Crowded; great value for all-you-eat-pasta; small $ supplement for sausage, meatballs, chicken
Friendly & cool food service by Linzy
Nice small dessert sampler
Delish pumpkin cheese cake
Wine & beer"}
{"text":"I can never get over how much food you get for your buck here! All you can eat soup and salads with your meal & all the yummy breadsticks!  Once I get my food, I'm nearly full and have to take my entree home to-go.

I come here often and I have yet to get bad service here. I love their coffee too. And my cup is never empty. Thank you Olive Garden waiters and waitresses!"}
{"text":"What an excellent meal and birthday here at Olive Garden.. Promptly sat down and out server named Dane was totally awesome. He helped all of us with ordering the meal and brought the great meal as well. Meal was awesome as always and because it was my birthday Dane gave me more then enough of their breadsticks and a whole box of their mints. Score one for Olive Garden and I will be returning there in the near future"}
{"text":"It seemed like every one in the restaurant was incredibly nice, except the man who sat us at our table and the waitress we had. 

We asked the host (Zane) who sat us a question. Which he responded \"I think so I don't know\" and \"that's something you should ask your server\" 

When our server (Shannon) finally came, it took her way too long to bring us our waters (let alone our soup and bread). 

I at one point asked for another water (because I knew she wouldn't bring me a refill without me asking) and it took so long we had to ask someone else, who brought it right away. 

The table next to us had the same waitress, and I think those poor folks waited even longer. They got their waters it seemed 15 minutes after sitting down. Shannon also seemed very miserable throughout the night. 

I recognize that it was a Friday evening, but the place did not even look that busy.

The food was great as always and we were seated very fast, but the service from Shannon and Zane specifically put a damper on the rest of the dinner.

Update: I should say that it was Red headed Shannon who was our server. There was a blonde Shannon who served a table nearby that seemed very nice. We wish we had her instead. 

The Shannon we had was nice when she talked to us, but she gave off a different vibe at other times."}
{"text":"Terrible. I ordered chicken alfredo to go and eat at the bar until it was done. When I got home, I was less than pleased. My pasta was fairly dry and there was 1/3 of the alfredo sauce that should have been on the pasta. 

Word to the wise... Check your food before you leave!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for awhile. I've seen a rapid decline in quality. I'm sure they have cut back on quality, but they haven't cut back on prices. Things are extremely expensive here. I used to get the mixed grill, skewers of steak and chicken with grilled zucchini. Awesome food. I went back awhile ago, and ordered it, and it seemed to be pan seared with steamed asparagus on the side instead of zucchini. This change was not indicated on the menu. I was disappointed about the grill part of the mixed grill going away, but also the quality of the steak diminished significantly. It used to be big pieces of soft steak, then it was thin and rubbery pieces. I went back recently with my family and noticed it wasn't on the menu anymore. But that isn't what bothered me about this last visit...

We had a fairly large group of women, 8 in total. The service was good, no complaints there. But we had 8 women and they bring out a basket of 7 breadsticks. Really? I think their new policy is to bring out one breadstick per person, then you have to nag at the wait staff to bring you more every time. Even when they saw empty baskets, they never offered us more. I have to wonder if they are trained not to since the breadsticks are an all-you-can-eat item they'd rather not lose money on. Same thing with the salad. Just an observation. As part of customer service though, I assume they'd ask if you want more if they come by and the basket is empty."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and prompt. Food was as expected nothing exceptional. Staff sung Happy Birthday to me."}
{"text":"Olive Garden........hmmmpphhh

As I'm not a huge fan of Olive Garden, I went. My buddy said his dad was in town and invited me to eat with them. I could use some unlimited breadsticks in my life right about now.  

The service was good not great. Our server got in an argument over the bill in the table behind us and was kind of rude and loud and disturbed our conversation. That was a little annoying, but not that big of a deal. The food came out 20 mins after we ordered and she almost served one of our pints to a different table, probably cause she was flustered over the argument.

I had the Chicken Marsala, it was not bad.  I was pretty hungry so I probably ate more than I normally would have. The peppers and onions were a little overcooked, the onions weren't bad but the peppers were almost black.  The marsala wasn't bad and the mushrooms were delicious.  Chicken....Ehhh, not bad.

Location is a little iffy, kinda out of the way from where we're staying this week but wasn't that bad. It's kind of behind the main streets in the area, (peoria)"}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden, you should expect it to be the same as always. However, I always get the Eggplant Parmesan, and this time it was really bad. I told the waiter and to my surprise the manager came over and was genuinely interested in why I didn't like it this time since I always order it. She comped my meal since I didn't eat it. However, I left full since I did enjoy an appetizer, salad and breadsticks!"}
{"text":"I came to place an order for Postmates. The staff decided to play games and made me wait more than 5 minutes. I ended having to cancel the order as a result. Zero respect for delivery drivers."}
{"text":"This is my Olive garden I go to hands down , great service , great food , j would recommend this OG if you are in the south Tempe area ! Keep it up everybody !!!"}
{"text":"Billy Sheets, the Manager needs to be aware of my family's experience. After being seated by the host (a young man, tall with brownish-blonde hair) we sat for 15 minutes with no server. a family that entered after us, was seated, served drinks and placed their orders. Finally after 20 minutes, Jose or Jorge (not sure) walked out, carrying a large dessert order for the guest besides us. He turned to us, introduced himself, threw 3 coasters in front of us and said he would be with us soon. He preceded to turn back to the guest, chit chat about the young mans birthday along with the male host and another fellow before singing happy birthday. He walked off. Another 5 minutes, we walked out. Horrible service"}
{"text":"I've been here many time each time were treated exceptionally and the food is always fantastic! Today we had our server Cody who was just above and beyond.. he was responsive.. remembered everything we had asked him.. very polite and courteous!! 

Love this olive garden! The customer service is exceptional and the food is always held to the same standard! 

If I could give him 100 stars I would! 5 stars isn't enough for his efforts!"}
{"text":"Gross. Go support a real Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend and I got out of an event about 9:30 last night and we were starving. I looked online for restaurants that were still open and Olive Garden showed they were open \"today from 11:00am-11:00pm.\" So we pulled up to the door and it looked pretty deserted so I went inside to ask what time they closed. It was currently about 9:50pm. I walked in and asked one of the servers at the bar, \"What time do you close?\" She said, \"10:00 but you're more than welcome to come on in.\" I said, \"Oh, it says 11:00 online (I said this while showing her on my phone.)\" She said, \"Nope, we close at 10:00.\" I said ok as I was turning to walk out and she told me to wait while she grabbed the host so he could seat us. I said, \"No, it's ok, I feel bad for sitting this close to closing.\" She chuckled and said, \"Don't feel bad, if I were you, I wouldn't feel bad and I would go ahead and sit.\" I looked at her hesitantly and said, \"Ok.\" 

So I waived to my friend to come inside and I told her what happened. She and I were both a little nervous about getting poor service. (We all know no server wants to have someone seated at their table right at closing.) When the host appeared, I asked him with a nervous laugh, \"Are we going to get bad service since it's so late?\" He said, \"No, absolutely not. You will get great service here no matter what.\" 

He walked us to our table and told us our server would be right with us. She was at the table over dealing with customers who were not happy with their order. we sat down as the salad was delivered to the next table and as the waitress started putting cheese on the salad, the customer said, \"Oh, no we didn't want cheese.\" Exasperated, the waitress rolled her eyes, turned around and threw the cheese grater onto the serving tray and complained to the other server, \"I need another salad.\" So while our waitress went to retrieve a new salad, the other waitress came over to our table. Looking very disheveled and ready to go home, she said, \"What do y'all want to drink?\" We both just ordered water and knowing they were in a hurry to close, we were ready with our order when our waitress finally appeared. 

I placed my dinner order and I told her I knew I was going to want desert so I asked if I should go ahead and order that now. She said yes because she would have to check to see if they even had any of the food left, thankfully they did. 

Throughout the entire order, we got nothing but attitude. My lasagna fritta was cold and had maybe a spoon full of the pasta sauce. My friend's fettuccine alfredo had may two spoon fulls of alfredo sauce so she had to take some out of the cold alfredo boat I ordered for the bread sticks. While eating, our waitress was walking by and said, \"Oh, I need to go check on your cheesecake and see if we have any.\" She walked back into the kitchen and from where we were sitting we heard her yell, \"Do we got any cheesecake left?\" I guess they did because she came out and said she took it out to thaw. By the time it got to me, it was halfway thawed out and the more I ate and the further back I got into the slice, the more frozen it was. 

Needless to say, we were not very pleased with the service nor the food. And I do understand it was late but if your own staff tells me it's not a big deal, not to feel bad and to go ahead and eat, I expect better service than that."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some of the best wait staff ever just love them all from the bartenders to the outstanding manager , the food is good and if it isn't they are ready to fix it in s heartbeat I have to say everyone prints their complaints but big kudos to their whole team what an awesome bunch"}
{"text":"I used to really love Olive Garden but it's just turned into an Italian Applebee's. Seriously 8 times out of 10 you get a jerk for a server and the pasta is always luke warm at best. If it wasn't for the salad and breadsticks I would never ever go again. Seriously I've had better pasta from the freezer section at Walmart. It is honestly a terrible shame when a nice resturaunt goes straight to crap for what reason? Bad management? Or maybe food service standards don't matter to this chain anymore? Whatever it is you've ruined \"Italian\" food for America."}
{"text":"Last time I went there I was very disappointed in the portion sizes of the lasagna.  I used to go all-time. The bread sticks and soup are great and if u ask they have a amazing raspberry syrup that's great with sprite.  I am taking a break in hopes that next time I will have a better experience.  I felt like I paid to much for my little entree. The service is mediocre but I do enjoy the email updates they send."}
{"text":"If there was ever an Italian in this kitchen, he or she must have left immediately, hopefully leaving their paycheck behind.  Salad was vinegar, cheese grinder came without cheese, soup was maybe, three ounces.  Shrimp was over-cooked.  I asked for extra garlic, so they used NONE.  Waiter was so-so and kept apologizing for the problems.  And service was SLOW - almost 30 minutes to receive the main course after the soup/salad.

Sorry, I'm thru with this chain store!"}
{"text":"We've been to this location quite a bit, but the server we had tonight made me want to give it a 5 Star. Sierra was our server and she was so exceptional, whenever we go back we'll be asking to be seated in her section. We reserved our table ahead online and arrived early, we were told we had to wait another 20 minutes but our table was ready in 5, which was very nice because Saturdays are very busy. Our food came out quickly and we never had to ask for more breadsticks or drink refills and we were brought boxes without asking, she was seriously on top of it. Especially impressive since it was a Saturday night. Definitely reserve your table ahead of time online since they no longer accept phone reservations on weekends and average wait time for a table can be anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour on the weekends."}
{"text":"This was a ok place to sit down and have dinner but I mean don't expect anything fancy! Kids are yelling it wasn't very clean but the dinner deal was really good. The bread sticks where great as usual and the salad so good! But the food is good but the surrounding is loud and annoying. But the service was ok."}
{"text":"Usually hit or miss here. Food is consistent but service is either really good or really bad. For example, I'm here now and have been for 10 minutes and I haven't seen our server."}
{"text":"I had Olive Garden cater my latest dinner party.  We had the pasta station for 10 guests.  Edith delivered our food promptly at the time designated.  She was in her uniform and was very sweet and most importantly, very professional.  She had the whole thing set up (everything included, napkins, paper plates, cutlery and serving utensils) quickly and efficiently. I was tempted to ask her to stay, eat and clean up too...just kidding!  The food was very good and boy, there was lots of it, including after dinner mints. Plenty of leftovers all at a reasonable price. Kudos to Olive Garden and server, Edith.  We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent food in a great atmosphere. Had lunch with a big group. People at Olive Garden were very accommodating and ready to help us out. I had the soupa tuscano which is my favorite soup. It was perfect with right amount of cream and flavor.  For my entree I had the garlic rosemary chicken which was amazing. One of the best dish I have ever had. Thoroughly impressed with this place. Thanks to our servers so made this luncheon fun and memorable."}
{"text":"It's been five years.  I see things haven't really improved much.  I can't say the food is bad, but it's just not great.  We ordered a simple entree (spaghetti...they have a promo right now) plus an appetizer and a soup.  The entree also comes with soup.  The pasta fagioli isn't as good as I remember.  It was OK, but I remember it being better.  The toscana was good.  And the gnocchi was OK.  The lasagna fritte were really not much more than deep-fried cheese (ricotta, I think).  Even with the marinara dip they were underwhelming.  The calamari was tender enough, but not much flavor there either.  The deep-fried ravioli was OK.  And the spaghetti was fine.  Not great, but fine.

Service was very good, but not enough to pull this to three stars.  I have experienced better many times."}
{"text":"The service from the hostess to the waitress was in my opinion, stupendous, it wasn't too, long of a wait and the waitress was Johnny on the spot, her name is Nichelle, sorry if the spelling is wrong. My wife and I have gotten the soup and salad, first time for me ordering soup and salad, but the weather called for soup it was cold as all get out, single digits. I first had gotten the chicken n gnocchi soup which was wonderful and hearty, I had gotten a second bowl and you can't go wrong with the pasta fin a gali soup, beans, meat, pasta a dinner in itself. I have never gotten that filled up on soup,salad and breadsticks before In my life. Have to get the soup and salad again."}
{"text":"This one gets my 4  review, for the service, the dishes, especially my wife's, which is the one too please. Wifey, got the smoked Parmesan , the chicken was so melt in your mouth but so flavorful. Myself and daughter got the Alfredo, it was Alfredo, really good guilt food (not always). Usually good service but, this time was phenomenal."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Kids ask to go on a weekly basis. Lol. Food is good. Service is good. Last night it was great! Just depends on the night. We enjoy going to this location."}
{"text":"Typical Olive Garden, standard menu, nothing special. The 2 stars is due to the area. Typically restaurants right off the interstate are in a good neighborhood, this certainly didn't feel like a good part of town"}
{"text":"Service is ridiculously slow. Had to wait for our drinks, then our bread, then our salad, and then our dinner. 50 minutes and still no food. Bread sticks hard. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Need to work on customer service. You cannot forget your customers because you were so busy assisting other customers, unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Tuesday 2/7/17  7:30 PM.

We were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.  No wait, we were seated immediately.  I loved being seated right near the bar.  It was wasn't a busy night, maybe 3 tables and two seats at the bar.  Even the bartender was in a good mood and singing.

Jenn made us feel so welcomed. I went with the Never Ending Classic fettuccine Alfredo. My boyfriend went with Tour of Italy.  Our food came out hot and it was delicious. Jenn kept our glasses full and I was very happy with how well dinner went.  I read the recent reviews and was unsure of we should go.

Hostess even thanked us on the way out."}
{"text":"I love this place it never let's me down. I'm literally going on 4 hours of sleep and had to be at work at 9am. So I decided to treat myself since today isn't my day. I am very specific about my order and most places usually always get it wrong. However they did an excellent job of giving my exactly what I ordered. Carry out is great they give you everything your heart desires without even asking....."}
{"text":"This olive garden is a little rough but it seems like they've been trying to clean it up."}
{"text":"We used Olive Garden to cater our wedding reception.  The food was amazing and they did such a great job setting everything up.  My guests loved the food and it disappeared fast!  The only down side is they really do need more meat in the pasta station.  We ran out very early."}
{"text":"Stopped by at this location to meet a friend for lunch and to use my gift card there.  We tried the 2 for $25 special.  Not a bad deal, but what a drabby decor. It just looks ancient compared to the one that I've been to in Scottsdale.  The special comes with a large plate, soup or a salad bowl, one dessert or appetizer.  We each chose a meal, shared the salad and a good-size tiramisu.  Our bill came to $27 after tax.  

The server was okay.  She sneezed while taking our order, and I think she used her hand to cover her mouth!  I quickly looked away and hoped she washed her hands.  I mean, she's human but I just wished it didn't happen right then.  Later, she got confused about the tip.  She came back after I paid and asked if I wanted change and I was like, \"Yeah.\" And she responded, \"Oh okay, let me go and get it.\" And I'm thinking, why did she come back without it?  She already pocket it. I always tip, I just didn't want to give her that specific amount.  

Needless to say, I won't go back to that location because it needs a facelift."}
{"text":"Olive Garden oh how I love you Olive Garden! I came to this particular location last week during my lunch break and they were extremely packed! My company was holding training on the side of town hence them being out of control busy but I have to applaud them for getting my table of 4 sat within 5 minutes! The server we had was extremely professional and courteous to the time frame we were working with! The lunch specials of $11.99 are the best bet because that unlimited soup salad and breadsticks is unbeatable! I really hate going back to work full off heavy food and this place sure enough did the trick! I think it was awesome to see the restaurant manager going from table to table asking how everyone's dining experience was going! That goes such a long way in my book! I will actually be dining here a few more times while I'm in training on this side of town!"}
{"text":"olive garden on rainbow and cheyenne has bugs DONT EAT THERE the manger was  totally rude when I brought up the issue didn't even want to comp my table just my  entree and I had to send my waiter to get it fixed .... I work too hard to be dinging with bugs"}
{"text":"Brought 3 small children. Had the $11.99 Alfredo specials AND used an email coupon for a free dessert. The staff treated us like we we're spending a million dollars. The manager checked on us a few times. They spoiled us completely. It was like being at the Four Seasons. They were so sweet with the children. Will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"For some reason, this particular location is better than others.  I think it may be due to the fact that it's a very busy location and they've got their system for serving a ton of people down like a well oiled machine.  Our food is consistent here...always tastes the same and cooked perfectly.  Service is great.  We don't go to Olive Garden anymore unless it's this particular one."}
{"text":"First timer !! Food was so delicious' our waiter was excellent! The drinks were so good! We loved everything about this place! I wish we had one here in hawaii! Highly recommend trying here! When I say everything was good I mean everything! Even their bread! Prices were very budget friendly. Five stars for me"}
{"text":"Me and my family knew that we wanted to come here on Friday so at the beginning of the week on Monday I called to make a reservation for 5 people at 6:00pm on Friday (because I knew how long the wait would be). When I called they told me that no we are not allowed to make reservations between 4:00pm and 9:00pm Friday , Saturday or Sunday. 
When I called they have a voice automated system and it says if you would like to hold your place in line to push 2 so I just thought okay when I am on my way on Friday I will push 2 on Friday so that by the time I get there we will be close to the front. 
On Friday at 5:30pm we are on our way so I call the number and push two and it takes me to a human at the restaurant. She asks how ca she help me and I say that I just want to save my spot in line and she says she can't do that. Well I said that the phone recording says that you can. She said well sorry it must not be updated so I was frustrated but just said okay we will see how the wait is when you get there! So we got there and went to the front to ask for a table for 5 she asked me do you have a reservation? I said NO I was told I could not make one between 4:00pm and 9:00pm on Friday , Saturday or Sunday and she said oh.... no you could have!! 
Very frustrating!!! Also when you walk in the restaurant stinks like old from being an old building and my bread sticks were not good this time!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST location in the West Valley. Arrowhead is always too packed and the Metro Center location never makes the food the same. They always get me in quickly and the food is consistantly good. I order knowing I can expect quality. I am a big $6.95 unlimited soup and salad fan."}
{"text":"Moderate food, was not too impressed at all; i served better at other locations of olive garden, in other states!waited 50 minutes"}
{"text":"Had supper there and it was delicious. Derrick, our server was excellent. Great personality and very attentive. Would go back there again!"}
{"text":"This is my best far my favorite Olive Garden location! I've been coming here over 15 years and the service as well as the food has remained consistent. With that said I won't hold you! 

Our server for the night, Preston, was awesome! Very attentive and had great conversations while getting the food to us quickly! A real gift that many servers don't possess.

We ordered the stuffed chicken marsala! Comprised of a chicken breast stuffed with some sort of cheesy breading mix, topped with sautéed mushrooms, smothered in a brown gravy, and served alongside a pile of mashed potatoes! Yum! Drool! Yessss! It was delicious and was a nice alternative to my usual pasta dishes.

The oldest son.. I mean husband ordered the balsamic steak gorgonzola. It was like an alfredo pasta topped with steak medallions (cooked to order by the way) and Gorgonzola cheese! Let me tell you! It was really goooood! How do I know? I devoured his leftovers while he was sleeping hahahahhaa!"}
{"text":"Make reservations!!
Can get super busy, but their service is awesome.

Saw other table get faulty service, but was great with us.

We had screaming kids with us, and they made them feel at home...

Thats why we go back over and over"}
{"text":"I had a gift card to use, and I'm not one to turn down free food.  I don't care where it is...I'll find something to order.  I had not been to an Olive Garden in years, but I expected it would be much the same as I remember.  And it was.  Salad, bread sticks, out-of-control children.  Just like I remember.

But for some inexplicable reason, my husband and I had a crazy idea that we should order from the \"lighter\" menu.  I had the lasagna primavera with grilled chicken, and he had the seafood brodetto (a variety of seafood in a wine and marinara broth).  His was okay, although a little on the bland side.  The lasagna was surprisingly good for a lighter dish.  It reminded me of something I could make myself, but the point was, I didn't have to make it.

We had great service, and once the table of little tornadoes blew through, a nice and quiet dinner.  Somewhere out there is another Yelper with a gift card collecting dust in a drawer.  Don't be afraid.  Go ahead and use it."}
{"text":"So what if it's a chain I love their food. Soup breadsticks and salad?  I usually am full enough to not order anything else myself. But when I do the food seems always to be good. tried the chicken and noche soup today and loved it almost as much as the pasta fagole I usually get. Tried another soup with sausage and potatoes? Didn't like that.  So one I wasn't a fan of but the others are two of the best soups I've ever had."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars for the soup (Zuppa Toscana), breadsticks and our SERVER (Ronald). My wife and I eat out a lot and experience good service in most places. However, Ronald was EXCEPTIONAL! He literally made the night. Great service can literally take the night from good to great. Food I would rate at 3.5 (we ordered GF Rotini - so not really fair to OG). 
Thanks for a great night Ronald!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special with unlimited salad, bread sticks, and Spaghetti with Marinara Sauce for the main course. The salad was nice and fresh but the dressing was a little strong with the vinegar. The bread sticks were the best part of the meal as they were nice warm and freshly made. If you eat too many of them you won't have room for your main course. 

The Spaghetti was disappointing. Both the pasta and marinara sauce tasted somewhat flavorless. I doubt they put any salt or other seasoning in the water when they boil the pasta, but they need too. The marinara sauce was down right watery. Take a look of the pic I took of the spaghetti and it is so watery it makes you wonder if it was suppose to be minestrone soup!

The restaurant staff were friendly and attentive so I bumped up the rating to 3 stars. Olive Garden is known as an inexpensive restaurant so you really can't complain too much as you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Here to pickup a Togo order. Employees are very nice. Only turn off while waiting by the Togo window is watching one of the staff moisten her fingers with her tongue to open up a plastic bag to bag up the Togo order."}
{"text":"SLOW SLOW SLOW. Went  here for our daughters birthday. Normally service is ok. But tonight took over 20 mins before they took our order and then we had to constantly ask for service. The manager admitted to not doing proper quality control as the staff did not try to triage their service when they got busy   The service was so slow our guest of honor had to leave before her entire meal was delivered   On a positive note, the manager, to make amends, gave us a gift card.   That gesture got them one more star"}
{"text":"Breakdown -- food and service:

Service.  The host promptly sat us asap.  Staff, waiter and more were excellent in their communication with everyone in our group. Even with the bill (gift cards, cash, debit) -- they had no problems in making it all work.  I wish I had wait staff like this more often elsewhere!

Food.  The soup had little taste.  The dinner was blasé and non-interesting.  Whomever is cooking in the back room must have zero taste buds or no interest in using basics like salt/pepper or spices.  The texture of the tomato's, chicken, pasta and asparagus were all the same.  Only the pea pods had crunch left.  The salad was the only saving grace of the entire meal.

Unfortunately great service can't save the basics of unexciting food coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"First off, first impression... Dreadful! 3 girls on the podium, not friendly or welcoming. My husband and my son went to the restroom before we got our table and he advise the manager that the restroom was filthy! She nonchalantly said \"ok\". Ok?? Are you kidding me? I know this is not a glamorous restaurant but it's still a restaurant that needs to be clean at all times!! Our waiter was nice but our food did take a while to come out. First impressions are everything, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"At the Olive Garden, on Gilbert and Germann, the wait for a table, on Saturday February 13, was a little over an hour; we had some people put our name in ahead of time and then they came home to pass the time and collect the rest of us. I would recommend this method with a large party because no one likes waiting around outside the restaurant.  When we arrived they were not yet ready for our large party of 7, so we waited alfresco. When we were called, I noticed that the inside of Olive Garden had a nice Italian theme from the menu with Italian headings to the wine cellar like decor. The server was neither officious nor vapid, he generated genuine conversation, checked in regularly, and always brought refills; he was an exemplar waiter. At one point he even complimented my French! The food tasted great, even a querulous person such as me can find something appealing. Even though everyone seemed to be loquacious, the restaurant was not noticeably noisy.  

The entrée that I chose was the Tour of Italy, because it combined three great Olive Garden entrées: Lasagna, Alfredo Pasta, and Chicken Parmesan. I greatly enjoyed the Alfredo Pasta and the Lasagna, and the chicken was not bad but it was a little dry. I fixed this by dipping it in the Alfredo and Marinara sauces. The salad was, however, amazing. I generally do not enjoy eating salad, but the dressing and ingredients Olive Garden used created a salad that was . . . magnifico! The breadsticks are always a great success, and every person in my party enjoyed them, but to me they were an unneeded, but still valued part of the meal. I think that the breadsticks have too much seasoning and spices on them. The Tour of Italy entree, including the salad, with Olive Garden's \"secret dressing,\" was a great dinner, the breadsticks were superfluous, but appreciated. Our argus-eyed waiter never let us go thirsty, and even brought my grandmother free wine samples (aka scoring brownie points and a higher tip). The atmosphere, the staff, and the food were the perfect melange. 

Overall, the Olive Garden on Gilbert and Germann is laudable, earning 4 out of 5 stars. Actually, I would have given it a 4.5, but Yelp wouldn't let me. I would definitely recommend Olive Garden to anyone, with a party of any size. It is a great atmosphere, perfect for family dinners or for a date night."}
{"text":"Been to this particular Olive Garden three times over the past year, and it has honestly been very good every time.  Two out of the three times the manager came around to ask how we were enjoying our meal.  Service was always prompt and friendly.  It's always packed, so the wait can be anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour, but they serve free appetizers while you're waiting.  

When you go to Olive Garden, you know what you're going to get in terms of food.  Yes, it's a bit heavy and salty, but we have always enjoyed the dishes there.  Last time we had minestrone soup, house salad, chicken parmigiana, and lasagna primavera with grilled chicken.  The time before we had the braised beef tips with tortelloni and lasagna classico.  All the dishes tasted great and were exactly what we expected.  The lasagna primavera was particularly tasty.  

The tables/chairs/dishes etc looked clean.  Carpet is a little worn but it's a high volume restaurant.  It's rather noisy, which would be my only complaint.  Luckily the restaurant is divided into a lot of smaller rooms, which helps the noise.  Prices are standard.   

Have yet to have a negative experience at this particular franchise and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Wow what can I say about dinner tonight. Salad and breadsticks took about half an hour to arrive. Another half hour later, our food arrives. No one bussed our plates so the busser just stares at us waiting for us to move our own plates around. 

We still have only received a grand total of TWO breadsticks the entire hour we've been here. Yes. Two individual breadsticks. 

Food was meh as expected. 

Our server was MIA for almost the entire time we were there. I think she stopped by 3 total times. We sat at the bar and there were only 2 tables... 

Two employees were at the entrance arguing very intensely right in our line of sight. So that was weird. We asked the busser about it and he said it was none of his business. 

Oh and we asked for more breadsticks on our way out and she told us no. 

Where was our server this whole time? Why were you so cheap with the breadsticks? Why are your employees arguing in the restaurant? Why did salad and breadsticks take so long?

Get it together Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Like a lot of people start their OG reviews off with, it *is* a chain, but it really isn't the worst! We stopped in tonight for dinner and we were told the wait would be 35 minutes. Luckily, it was only about 15 minutes and we were seated at a perfect little table in the corner. We had surprisingly good drinks, delish food (that salad though!) and great service. 
The only complaint I have is more about clientele and their smoking right at the door, I felt like I was walking through the cigarette gauntlet to get inside! While benches outside are nice for people who are waiting, they attract smokers and it's gross for those who don't smoke to walk through it. The benches should be moved further from the door if possible!"}
{"text":"Food, great like it always is at Olive Garden. I have to complain about the customer service though. It was terrible, and I hate to complain about customer service because I have been in the same position. With that being said...I also know it is not impossible to give a customer/guest outstanding service. 
Problem 1. Speed of service and accuracy of order. Wrong soups were brought, items were not brought, and it took FOREVER to bring the right items. We could hear the two tables behind us complaining about the same thing! I can only hope it was an off night... 
Problem 2. At the end it, of course, took forever to get the bill and when the receipt was brought back I got someone else check! I had someone else's credit card in my hand. THANK GOODNESS I am not a horrible person who was desperate for gas or something. I ended up giving the server 6 dollar tip, which I can't say he deserved. The manager staff couldn't find my change?! I was too fed up to care about 6 bucks. Complete fail for this location."}
{"text":"Great service (teresa). Food always hot and fresh with craveable breadsticks."}
{"text":"Very rarely go to Olive Garden, but we were out all day running errands and decided to stop by close to home. The wait was intense. 1 hour and 20 minutes, but we were both too beat to move, so we sat in the waiting area and people watched for the duration of our wait and when we were called in, we were seated in an area with a lot of busboys and their dump station nearby. It was actually very strange. 

The server seemed like he was either on something or wired for sound and didn't seem like he understood a word we said. It was just a bizarre experience. The food came out cold (it was getting close to time for them to close) and I was really disappointed in my mushroom pasta. The raviolis seemed very flat and not a lot of content inside. But the flavor was not bad and I ended up taking the dish home. 

What I do love is the pasta fagioli soup and I ended up having that and a few breadsticks. Honestly, what do they do to those breadsticks to make them so awesome? 

It may have just been an OFF night for them or maybe it was the timing, but this night did not impress me and reminded me why we don't often visit chains like this."}
{"text":"Used to be our favorite restaurant. The portions are getting smaller and smaller.. part I don't understand is that they are making the pasta portions smaller? How much does pasta cost? And for some reason the salad dressing is way too salty.."}
{"text":"Our server was a little lost she never brought us salad and breadsticks until I asked another server. She was not really paying attention to our table which we kinda felt left out. Plus my lasagna was a little burnt. I'm not sure if I would take my family back to this location."}
{"text":"Last night the service we received at this Olive Garden was outstanding!!! Fast and friendly, but the fast part is what we loved best. Since moving to Vegas it seems no matter where we go; from fast food to fast gourmet: ITS SLOW! So we were pleasantly surprised at this chain restaurant. 

We had cheese ravioli, stuffed Marsala chicken with mashed potatoes, and the Northern Tour of Italy. We also ordered the Tiramisu and strawberry cheesecake. It all looked good and tasted great! We got plenty of salad and breadsticks too! The waiter filled our waters without us ever having to ask, we loved that! Just a great overall experience."}
{"text":"I normally love olive garden but Sunday night we arrived and got seated at a dirty booth, not only did i have to clean it myself but ask for extra napkins just to keep wiping my seat clean. Once we ordered the food we tried having simple conversation but we were seated next to a large loud group of people and we weren't able to talk over them, im not sure why they sat us next to them if it wasn't even busy and there was plenty more space, we did not need to be so grouped together. once our food arrived it was pretty gross, and i noticed that steak my came really rare, it was hand down the worse meal ever, i didn't eat any of it and my waitress noticed and still did not even asked how it was, or why i hadn't eaten it.  my partner also didnt eat any of his meal. The Customer Service  was extremely poor she didn't ask why neither of us had  touched our food once she brought the bill  , she slid the card and left. WORST MEAL AND CUSOTMER SERVICE EVER."}
{"text":"I come to this location all the time cause it's the closest to me although very busy. Their service has defiantly improved I was greates upon walking in and our waitress Jessica was great !! She checked on us frequently despite how busy it was and refilled our drinks before we even finished them she kept the refills coming which I love lol I go through so much peach iced tea here. The food was great and it didn't arrive to long after we ordered which was great cause we were hungry ! Will be coming back again I always leave ready to explode lol"}
{"text":"Came here with my gf for dinner the other night. WE ordered the Shrimp Scampi appetizer the Chick and Shrimp Carbonara the Seafood Alfredo with the Caesar Salad. Everything was delicious. The service was excellent and our waiter Brian G was on point. We never had to wait for a drink refill, and he was very informative and helpful.  We had a fabulous experience. Everything was perfect, we could not have had a better dining experience. The ambiance was good, this place is always busy, but we did not have to wait and were seated right away. I will definitely be coming back here in the near future."}
{"text":"Meh.. Olive Garden claims to be an Italian Restaurant, that's like Taco Bell being a Mexican Restaurant. The problem I have is you can get true Italian dishes in town for the same price!!! This chain has gone down hill since it's first inception .What I do like about the Olive Garden is their unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks.. now that is a good deal. The staff has always been awesome when I've gone. I guess I'm just picky when it comes to Italian food"}
{"text":"Had a family gathering booked months in advance. squeeze us in a little cove are clearly not room for the party. food served cooled. Taste of Italy very small 3 lobster ravioli 3 mushroom ravioli and a small fist size of paste with sauce. The best part of Olive Garden salad. Severs were overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Yep, lately we have been here way more times than we should. This because I did rekindle my love for zuppa toscana. 
We have had great servers and service. This latest time we asked for Kelli but she was not available. Jacqui was our server and she took excellent care of us (not sure if it is spelled like that, I remember her name tag having an unusual spelling).

We were going to have just the soup, but we ended up getting a meal to go and having a few bowls of soup each. As I said, zuppa toscana is my favorite, hubby's is the chicken gnocchi.

I had the peach tea to drink and asked for low ice since I have been a bit sick, Jacqui got me the perfect ratio of tea and ice every single time : )"}
{"text":"Well, I could have zuppa toscana every day. 
Came here for dinner and ended up having some of the lighter fare (tilapia, shrimp and broccoli), everything was good and the portions for the pasta dishes were very generous. Hubby had the NY steak I think and it was kind of fatty for his taste.
Our server Martin took great care of us."}
{"text":"Will not be back. Went to eat here with 16 friends for a birthday celebration. There were 17 of us so with that many people there will definitely be more noise than normal. We were not obnoxious or cursing, though- just good friends having a good time. After we had eaten our meal, the manager came over and asked us to keep it down. This was extremely embarrassing and unnecessary, especially since we were all already done with dinner and almost ready to leave. You're a chain restaurant, Olive Garden, calm down. People are not expecting a once in a lifetime experience in your restaurant so who complained about our noise level? You should have been catering to the 17 ladies willing to waste money on your sub-par fake Italian food."}
{"text":"For some reason the last time I ate here the quality of food was much better... About 2 years ago.  Ordered a platter of appetizers (stuffed mushrooms-acceptable, fried calamari-below average quality, fried zucchini-terrible) and Cape di Mare for the main entree.. Acceptable.

What made it worst was the service, we sat in the bar thinking that we will be served faster but it's the other way around.  The waitress took 10 minutes to give us the menu, 5 minutes to give us a drink, 15 minutes to give us a bread, 10 minutes for soup and salad to arrive, another 15 minutes for the appetizers to come. Though the waitress offered to refill our drinks and check on us from time to time, the overall waiting time for the food to come out was disappointing."}
{"text":"Olive Garden just sucks period. Not this location in particular but the entire chain. I ordered 2   tour of Italy to go and the portion size was so small! Ummmm at $17+ per entree I expected a comparable amount of food. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY OG has truly minimized their product. They should just close them all."}
{"text":"I would like to thank the staff , particularly Drew our waiter for making our veteran's day dinner a wonderful experience. Both of our orders were so delicious! 
Thanks to Olive Garden Italian Restaurant for providing the free dinner for Veterans Day! It was awesome and greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere to eat late at night around 10:20 and we saw this place was open. We came into the restaurant and got dat right away and told the specials. It did not take too long for the server to approach us. He brought us some drinks and I got a strawberry-mango margarita but it was not topped with rock sugar or anything. From what I remember, those come with the sugar rocks but wasn't to upset about it, would have been nice. It was closing hours so I believe they just left them out. Our server was amazing and was very sweet and would check up on us immediately. Overall the experience was good and the place is really nice. I would recommend this Olive Garden to anyone"}
{"text":"This place needs new seats, the  bar booth  seats have no cushion left. You sit down on wood. 

The food when prepared properly is quite good but the soups and apps are very inconsistent.
I hear cooks don't last long and I know servers don't last
Service can be horrible here .

We  had to ask for a menu, utensils , to order and to get our check tonight.  Bad service. We told the manager too. Menus weren't picked up and a grater was left on our table. The manager took over our table but not for long.

We left no tip. The service was that bad. 

When we came in, dishes were piled up and booths and tables were unclean. We asked for one to be clean and the girl left us with a wet table . Yuk

I'm sure the wiping towel was filthy too

This place needs a makeover and a scrub . Bar lighting is harsh.

They are busy so  they  won't make any changes . Corporate must just have thrown their hands up in this one.

They have let it go
UPDATED 

March 17 9:45 

I sat on a booth that capsized. They need to replace seats. The staff tries to group everybody together and I want a more private seat . For 2 years we have had to summon the manager to ask for less congested seating and then are we accommodated"}
{"text":"**BAR AREA ONLY**

We were greeted right away by the lovely hostesses & we were greeted right away by one of the bartenders or maybe bar back... TRAVIS was the one that made all our drinks & took our orders so he was the bartender but there was sweet girl that also tended to our needs & was the one to greet us. Wish we got her name... but for manager's reference 9.28.15 around 5:30pm whoever this girl is give props ahahahha

We just wanted to kill some time before our next movie so the hubby grabbed a glass of wine & I got some soup. I convinced my man to come here by saying that PROBABLY have a TV at the bar... I was WRONG... he was DISAPPOINTED as being FOOTBALL season... he could only check the scores on his phone. I understand it's a family resteraunt... but DEFINITELY would say at least one TV at the bar top area would PROBABLY bring in slightly  more guests especially during football season... ahahhaha (at least the girls would be able to convince their man to go eat at olive garden or something)

ZUPPA TOSCANA SOUP $6.49 - I ALWAYS get the toscana soup here... & the fact that you can get UNLIMITED amounts of it is AWESOME!! plus it comes w/ complimentary yummy warm bread sticks

STRAWBERRY PASSION FRUIT LIMONATA $3.50 - a large drink I would say... very refereshing & not toooo sweet since there is that tartness & sparkle 

TRAVIS & the girl (really wish I knew her name ahaha) conversated w/ us & they were pleasant & got us everything we needed & answered all my stupid questions

We also noticed little tablets EVERYWHERE! You can order apps. Desserts. & drinks from this thing which is pretty nifty. It also has little app games for $1.99 maybe to keep the little ones distracted."}
{"text":"After a long day, my boyfriend and I decided to have dinner here. I was surprised that it wasn't busy at all since every other store that we've been to beforehand was packed. We were seated right away by the host. Mustafa? (Sorry if I got your name wrong) was our waiter for the night and he is simply the sweetest and the best. He took our orders right away and refilled our drinks without us even asking. Food was brought out right away and it was delicious. When I asked for a togo box, he put my leftovers in the box for me! Not a lot of waiters do that but he did. How awesome. :) I saw him offering some tables wine samples. I kind of wished that he offered me a sample too but he probably thought I was too young or something. It's all good, no big deal. I asked him if I could get an empty cup for our unfinished iced tea and he gave us a cup filled with tea instead. How sweet!

This Olive Garden always has great service. Food comes out quickly and taste delicious. If you haven't already tried their peach iced tea, you're missing out! It's refreshing and comes with big peach chunks inside. The chocolate mints that they give you with your bill are yummy too. 

I seriously had the best waiter today. You don't come across many people like him too often. Thank you. :)"}
{"text":"This Olive Garden gets kudos for their to-go counter. 

They are always on point with the speed, kindness, and patience at this particular spot. The girls are always friendly and go out of their way to get everything we need for our order before we walk out the door. 

Extra meat sauce? Okay. A drink while you wait? Sure. Plates, napkins, extra whatever you like? Take all you like. 

I've eaten at, and gotten to-go, Olive Garden in a variety of places. This place does an above average job of making sure you leave satisfied. To be commended."}
{"text":"Ate here. As expected this place caters to weekend mall traffic and families with a bunch of kids. That is all they excel at."}
{"text":"I love Italian food , and this hit the spot . However it definitely lacked in service . Our waitress was very inattentive and food came out real slow . Took about 2 hours for us to complete our meal and there were four of us, which was the effect of the slow service. Although they were quite slow, the servers were nice and friendly.

It wasn't too busy and I would highly recommend them to buy some new chairs cause they just look so nasty. The only thing that is saving the interior is the walls.

Overall , the price for the quality and quantity was well worth it. 
We ordered two of the $25 deals for two entrees , unlimited salad or soup and a dessert . Every thing we had was delicious! And we got full even before the entrees came out ."}
{"text":"Food was ok, it seems Olive Garden and many other large chains are going downhill. We sat in the bar and the bartender/server was very pushy and trying to hurry us to order. Asked for fresh bread sticks and was given semi-hot bread sticks, definitely not fresh. When I am paying 60 for two people I expect better. I will continue to stick with local restaurants, better quality, service and prices. It was not ok to hear my server complaining about the kitchen. I am a server and you never let your guests hear you complain!!"}
{"text":"Very poor experience. I have never had a bad experience at any of the other Olive Gardens across the valey but this location definitely rubbed me the wrong way. I order to go from the website and asked that it be ready at 11:40am. I showed up at 11:47am and the food was not ready. The waitress at the bar acted like she didnt want to be at work and took about 10mins just to come help me. She took a very long time to go into the back and box up the food that should have already been ready. Then the waitress argued with me that if I wanted marinara sauce with the extra breadsticks I ordered then I would have to pay an additional $3.49 for just the marinara. The website says that the breadsticks come with marinara when you order extra for $3.49. When I explained this to her she gave me nothing but attitude. She eventually gave it to me without charging but then she didnt even offer an apology for making me sit there 20mins when I was already supposed to be at work. If I would have had more time to wait I would have spoke to the manager about her attitude but for now I will send this to Yelp and will call the management team later today."}
{"text":"Wow. So I ordered to go and whoever answered the phone sounded like she was in the middle of a parade! I asked what soup they had and she says no we don't have any promotions. I told her no soup and she said hold on while I find another phone. She switched phones but I could still barely get my order through. I wouldn't have really minded much I've worked in the restaurant business but she had no customer service at all. This place is ghetto. Ghetto ghetto. You would think in a chain such as this there would be some kind of quality control and thorough training but I've been to this location on a couple occasions and the service has never improved. Ghetto. Oh. And to top it off, she told me 40 minutes wait for soup bread sticks and tiramisu... Wow."}
{"text":"It was my brother-in-law's birthday on 6/15/12 and he was given a gift card at work to Olive Garden. We bought him a Bellini and we advised the waitress of his birthday and asked if they will bring him a cake and she said cakes are $6. His wife agreed to order the cake and the waitress brought out a chocolate chip frozen cake and dropped it in front of him and didn't have the wait staff sing happy birthday or even refill our drinks without being asked to do so. 

The prices for entrees have gone up in price so high for the amount of food that for two people ordering one appetizer and 2 entrees and one Bellini and iced tea cost over $60!! The price coupled with the poor service on a special occasion make Olive Garden an undesirable choice in the future. My brother in law said he will never eat there again."}
{"text":"'Twas a normal Saturday evening at Olive Garden with my pals, although the service was subpar, we very well did enjoyed our meals!  I ordered the braised beef and tortellini, it was what you'd expect from an Olive Garden.  Overall my pals and I enjoyed the visit!"}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Service is absolutely horrible. Taking forever to order, get food, & get a bill. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Five stars . Always dependable quality with good customer service. Denny, our server, went above and beyond! Right now Olive Garden has endless pasta bowl for 9.99."}
{"text":"I am out for a birthday dinner with my family and I must say our experience dining here was pleasant. The soup and salad I ordered was delicious especially the Zuppa Toscana. And my family's food was well prepared and the enjoyed it. 

Our server Lisa was amazing making sure that our every dining need was met with speed and a smile. She did a truly wonderful job making our experience something I look forward to repeating soon."}
{"text":"I guess we came at the wrong time. The hostess didn't have a \" Seater\" so that confused her. Our server acted like he really didn't want a new table and when I asked about silverware, the reply was... The hostess has one job, and they can't do that! We ordered and waited forever just for salad and bread... I guess it was a ruff night the night before. When the salad finally came.. We were told how he had to go into the back cooler to get it ?!?! TMI I am only giving 3 stars because it is comfort food go to for us... In other words, it's my daughters favorite."}
{"text":"This was probably the most worst experience I have ever had at an olive garden! The food was cold   inside and the pasta on both mine and my sisters food was like hard on the edges?. Not to mention the waitress with the wrist tattoo (I think it was like a feather or something) was super weird and rude. During the entire check out process she was soliciting for tips... I think it was because we looked young and she thought we werent going to tip her or something.  as a waitress myself I would never leave without tipping but it was really rude and unacceptable that she pretty much asked for one even after she knew our order was messed up and she had been all wierd towards us on top of that."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Olive Garden is so delicious. I don't care if their food is frozen it's still delicious. Stuffed mushroom is my all time favorite appetizer. I wish I could have it all the time. I would be in heaven. :)

This place doesn't have the fastest service but the taste of the food makes up for it all. If you are in a rush then don't come here. If you have some one to kill an don't mind the slow service then go on down. 

Right now they have a special where you buy a dinner and take one home for the same price. I mean come on, 2 Alfredo plates for the price of one. Who can resist that bargain?!?  

I love their fettuccine Alfredo and when I'm ready for a cheat meal that's what I get. I've tried their eggplant Parmesan and other than the sauce it's delicious. Don't get me wrong, the sauce isn't bad it's just that I'm used to eating a different type of sauce"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this location but the service that I received was horrible.  Let's start off with the fact the waitress had spaghetti sauce all over her shirt.  Ewwww gross.  We had to ask for our salad and breadsticks several times and the people behind us who came after us was served first. They had their food before she ever came back to take our order.  We ordered 2 appetizers as a main course. Even told her it was the main course and what happens, one of them was brought out early because she forgot to click a button on her screen. Couldn't find our server half the time.  Because we were a party of 8 the tip was already on the bill.  Way to much tip taken for crappy service.  Perhaps that's why we were treated the way we were because she knew it was a guarantee tip."}
{"text":"This review is for this location only and not for the chain....

let me start of by saying that I love olive garden.  We did not have one back from Hawaii (although there are rumors that one is being built in Kapolei) so every time i came to the mainland I made sure I stopped at one.  Now that I moved here, I can come here anytime.

We were seated right away and as soon as we sat down, my daughter said we should order calamari.  The person who seated us was surprised that she liked calamari.  What was even more shocking is what came out of the hostess's mouth.  She said calamari was octopus.  I told her no it is squid. \"Well isn't a squid and octopus the same thing\"  Ummmm no it's not.  I was shocked that someone who worked there didn't no this piece of information.

Anyway fast forward to our server who was slower than molasses. Our drinks were messed up and the food came out before we were even done eating our salads.  This guy was sweating so bad it was gross.

Maybe this is a sign from calorie gods that i should not be wasting my calories on olive garden and pick a different place for a cheat meal.  Nonetheless how can you go wrong on never-ending pasta bowls.  Yummo.  the garlic sticks are to die for and that salad dressing has me drooling right now.  I was so excited to see the dressing at Sam's Club..

I will come back and give this place another shot.  Hopefully my waiter will look like he did not just run a marathon.

pros:
ample parking
never-ending soup/salad
delicious food
short wait time

cons:
sweaty waiters"}
{"text":"Our server , Kassi was amazing! Went above and beyond. We had kids eating with us and she was quick to offer them breadsticks while we waited for our other party members to arrive for dinner. Even after we paid for our bill she continued to check on us making sure we were doing okay. I will be back just for her amazing service!! Best service I have had."}
{"text":"There are many other pasta places in town that I'd choose over Olive Garden. But they boyfriend had a gift card and free money is free money, right? The night before we ran a 5K, we decided to pay OG a visit and carb up. 

There was about a 15 minute wait when we arrived on a Friday night. Looking around, there were plenty of tables opened, but I guess they were short on staff. A couple of booths were open at the bar area along with plenty of bar seating but we were never offered a spot there. We decided to wait it out. No biggie. 

Our server provided speedy service. No complaints here. They had a great deal going on: three course Italian dinner for $12.95.

Appetizer: You can choose from unlimited salad or soup. I chose the salad. Your typical appetizer salad. My boyfriend got chicken gnocchi soup. This was alright. Gnocchi had a grainy consistency to it. But the soup was tasty. He finished the bowl. Hot and fresh breadsticks were also brought out. No sauce. Sauce is an extra charge. 

Entree: I got the three cheese ravioli. Your typical ravioli. I really wish I had hot sauce to give it some flavor. I should seriously carry a bottle of hot sauce in my bag at all times for this! Anyways, my boyfriend got the Penne di Mare. This is pretty good. Small pieces of shrimp with cream sauce over penne pasta. Apparently, scallops were supposed to be in this dish. I didn't see any, but the dish definitely had the scallop-seafoody taste. 

Dessert: I got the chocolate mousse cake. Pretty darn decadent. I think this was the best part of the meal. But then again, I love anything chocolate. Give me chocolate and I'm easily satisfied. Boyfriend got the strawberry and white chocolate dolcini. This is way too sweet. Stay away. 

Overall experience was alright. We got what we came for (carbs, carbs, carbs) and left with a full belly. But the next time I come here will be only when I have a gift card to spend freely."}
{"text":"Went to Olive Garden for there awesome soup and salad deal. I've never been to this Olive Garden, but been to 1 been to them all. The only difference between Olive Gardens for me is the service. 

So let's break that down, we went on a Tuesday afternoon got sat fairly quickly and our server Fred came right to us. Fred really made this experience for us stand out. He was very personable, making us laugh, making sure our waters were full. Even tho he forgot my Coke for a while he was great that I didn't even care. He was extremely attentive. He made this experience awesome. He was really interested in our day! 

Food was good soup was fresh salad was dressed properly. I'll be coming back just for Fred! Thanks buddy!"}
{"text":"Belive it or not it's my first time eating out in olive garden special thanks to Kimberly or kimmi for her attention to detail very very happy with the food, service  and that extra mile she takes to have customers happy there was a lot of people due to mothers day but that is acceptable fare price to be treated with kindness and all the comes with it great food thanks again

{"text":"Called in an order so I wouldn't have to wait. Got here and guess what? Had o wait because they couldn't find my order! Nice! Thanks for screwing up Valentines dinner. Wont be coming here again. This was their last chance. Still here waiting because they brought my order out with the WRONG PASTA!!! WTH people?"}
{"text":"Our baby girl was promoted to 6th grade and she choose Olive Garden for dinner. The service and food was good."}
{"text":"We got here before 12 pm. It was pretty empty at that time. The service was great. The food was delicious. I loved the soup and breadsticks. We ordered the lunch special. I got the fettuccini alfredo mini bowl, my husband and dad both got the chicken sandwich. I ate two bowls of the pasta e fagioli soup and took another as my leftovers with some breadsticks. With the sampler platter and three drinks it was less than $50. 

When I was leaving, I asked for utensils. She was nice enough to give me two sets. lol. 

The restrooms are nice and clean, but there are only two stalls in the women's restroom. One is a handicap stall. 

It was a great dining experience. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I visited this Olive Garden in February 2015. Yes, that was over a year ago. I never took the time to write a review and wanted to do so now.

Our waitress was a black woman named Sandra. (I do not at all mean this in a racist way. I just want to make sure the right Sandra gets credit if theres another employee named Sandra) Sandra was AMAZING. She has a very bubbly fun personality, while keeping it professional at the same time. She was pretty busy that day when we went for lunch, but managed all her tables fine! 

The food was good. Definitely worth what you're paying. I had the chicken parmesan and the chicken was very moist, unlike some other places. 

Anyways, Sandra is pretty much the highlight of this review since Olive Garden has consistent food. LOL. It's been over a year and when I dine out, other restaurant workers cant compete with Sandra!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there on Saturday with the family . Sunday afternoon, 1 by 1 we all got sick. Food poisoning if I didn't know any better. The only thing we all ate was the salad. I've never been a huge fan. The waiting is ridiculous. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden, but NOT THIS ONE.  Normally the managers go out of their way to make sure customets have a positive experience.  Terrible customer service.  Terrible!"}
{"text":"Take out food tonight. Packed well in secure containers with utensils, napkins and all the sauces and toppings requested. Salad fresh and tastes. The bread sticks warm and fresh, lightly garlic flavored. The meal was ready when asked. This is a great option. Thanks for the service and tastes pasta and salad."}
{"text":"I didn't have any choice since it was my sister's birthday.. I would have rather have cooked at home than to have experienced the \"OG\". However it wasn't as bad as I remember.. though the pasta was over cooked and the sauces lack depth overall the experience wasn't that dreadful. However I was also so happy to see my 2 nephews getting so big and enjoying themselves gorging on hot greasy bread sticks.. it was a family affair."}
{"text":"Ok so I know not to expect a whole lot when I walk into a olive garden. The salad and breadsticks and dip is delicious. The service is mediocre but like i said I really dont expect a whole lot. Either way the 1 star is for the service the minus 4 stars is for the appetizers and food. Yuck? I could eat better frozen food. The fried raviolis and cheese sticks were hard and cold in the middle.  Maybe it was just this one night but the food was cold and all tasted bad. Thank God for carrabas."}
{"text":"fast service and always busy . the quality of the food is great . i tried a few olive gardens in town this one is by far the best . the soups taste great and warm breadsticks always . love the staff"}
{"text":"not a fan of the service at this location . the quality of the food is not like the other location . . for example to soups taste like yesterdays leftovers. avoid this location"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spot to go with fam! And we are so lucky to have a Waiter like \"Sky\" he is such a nice waiter and of course you can't beat the never ending pasta deal right?"}
{"text":"Of course we came on a Friday night,  the wait was supposed to be 40 minutes which was expected,  we were sat in less than 20 minutes which was good.  We were sat at our table and then NOTHING! We had servers walk by us,  look at us and still NOTHING! Finally someone that was not a waiter stopped by and asked if we had been helped,  after 15 of NOTHING! People that were say after us had their drinks,  soups and salads before we were even greeted.  The manager came and apologized and we were assigned Patricia, who was awesome.  Him apologizing and Patricia are the reason the are getting 3 stars instead of one.  She was awesome!"}
{"text":"First off, haven't been here in awhile and walked in to see the place was renovated. My first response to my wife was: \"prices went up\"!!  ( yup, I was right ) I guess, stick it to the people to pay for it! Waitress didn't ask if we wanted a wine sample nor did she take the glasses away. Seemed like she was always in a hurry and everything was \"funny\". Ordered the spinach dip appetizer and it came out ( after we received our meal ).Bread wasn't really toasted and looked NOTHING like the picture. ( which I undstand but, come on ) looked like just melted butter just drizzled on it. So, we asked for different bread for it. One that was toasted like it was suppose to be. Came out toasted but, just drizzled again. Whatever....just let me make it! The wife's meal was real dry like always even tho she always ask for extra alfredo sauce and the garlic was just about raw! Don't want to keep going on because, it's  no use. Just falls on blind eyes and deaf ears. They will keep making their $$ regardless of what I say. Especially charging outrageous prices for soda, tea, etc....example: $3.49 for just a freaking glass of raspberry tea. So, two people two drinks just to start: $7.00.  Um, don't think so!!  At the end of this lunch disaster the waitress asked: \" how was everything\"? I said, what do you think? You can see what was left. We have had better I told her.  ( I don't like being a jerk but, when you pay over $30. for JUST lunch and it sucks, you get the point ) Oh well, enough rambling we will just stay home and make our own for a hell of a lot cheaper!!"}
{"text":"Been here 1:20 minutes still no food. Out of 4 items so far. No one seem to care. Spider on table last time."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was great, our server Cameron was super attentive. Great place, great food, great service"}
{"text":"I had the Stuffed Chicken Marsala, its was very good. My companion had the Salmon Piccata, she was very happy with her meal.  The salad was also very good, fresh crispy lettuce, good tomatoes, and purple onion.  Our waiter, Mitch, was excellent.  He was efficient, pleasant and very accommodating.  He made our dining experience a joy.   We didn't have to wait for anything, maybe because we arrived just after five.  Get there between three and five to pick from a discounted menu.  We would go back. Ask for server  Mitch.  Very good job, thanks Mitch."}
{"text":"Service: our server seemed friendly I will give her that, however she was not personable at all! She rushed us and I hated it! We were there and ate and out in 27minutes! My daughter and I went out to try and have a nice dinner but that didn't really happen. I left annoyed and disappointed. My daughter eats slow and I eat pretty fast so I finished my food and was waiting for her to eat, no big deal we were just chatting and eating. The waitress asked if I wanted a box for my to go food and I told her yes. So I get a text from my sister and I replied I look up and she is bagging mine and my daughters food! I was done but she wasn't! I just said forget it and paid and left. We didn't get mints or offered desserts or a sample of wine. :0( 

Food: the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Goodyear AZ

Service was great but the food was disappointing. 
We are ordered the appetizer that includes a trio. The raviolis, calamari and mushrooms did'nt have any flavor. We both ordered the spaghetti one with sausage which my husband enjoyed and mine with chicken. I thought it was flavorless. With a soda our bill was over $45.00 very disappointing."}
{"text":"This location gets 2 Stars. The restaurant was NOISY, & had a low-class of people. We had to change tables because the one we got was obnoxiously noisy with loud children nearby. I wish parents would make their kids behave in public, plus it was 8:30 pm & little kids s/b in bed by then, at least  I was at that age. Anyway, we did get moved to a quieter table. The service & food was great, but I recommend the Scottsdale location over this location by far...."}
{"text":"Just a follow up to my earlier review. Be careful everyone, Lucy M still is employed at this location... Olive Garden knowingly employs a server who has daily contact with multiple customers credit card information - she stole from me - I doubt i'm the first one she's done this to and I can guarantee I won't be the last.  Manager Nicole has been great throughout this but the fact that she still works there guarantees that not only I will never be in there again but I will warn as many of you as I can not to go there."}
{"text":"Second time visiting before I wrote this.

When we walked in, we saw a woman with black glasses an white ear plugs talking with a woman with long dreadlocks. We walked up to the counter, no greeting or anything, just carried in talking.

Was told to wait 10 minutes but given no menus, the restaurant wasn't that busy as it was lunch hour. We actually got seated in 5 though, that's good!

Sever asked us if we're ready, we ordered drinks, lunch specials and an appetiser sampler. He came back with drinks but asked for our food order again.

The food arrived, the soup was a small portion, but that was good, so you can try more! The salad looked good too. However, both times we visited, the service on the lunch special is very very slow. If you ask for the waiter for a soup, they seem really annoyed and bothered by it. Small portions are good, but of they don't want to bring more, then it defeats the point. We are not a large group, we wanted to try 2-3 each. The last time, and what prompted this review, was that the server asked if this is all we want in a rude tone and we asked for his assistance 3 times in 20 minutes when wanting re-fills and soup.

The first time we visited, they forgot the breadsticks twice and it took 25 minutes to get them. I don't believe the breadsticks are fresh, they are baked from pre-frozen dough and have a strange plain taste about them. 

Anyway, to conclude... Service 1/10, salad 7/10, soup 7/10, breadsticks 2/10, sampler 7/10. A restaurant is nothing without good service and has no legs to stand on. Therefore, I have to give one as I genuinely was very disappointed. We won't be back here but glad we gave it a second chance to confirm."}
{"text":"Place cooks great food, awesome service and your not waiting all night for a meal like some of the thee restaurants in the pv mall shopping area."}
{"text":"love this place. however last time I got take-out the customer service was horrible. I complained to the hostess how rude the waiter was but to my dismay ignored my request to speak with someone! never will I get take-out from there."}
{"text":"I have gone to Olive garden for more years than most people have been alive. There salad has been A1 from day one. TONIGHT'S experience would be enough for me to NEVER EVER EVER NEVER go back there again. We had a gift card that we could have used at any of 4 different locations. We chose Olive Garden due to their PREVIOUS consistency of good food and great service. Tonight if I had not seen the sign I would have thought I was in a cafeteria at a roadside stop in the middle of nowhere. I had to BUS my own table after waiting 20 minutes and the server passed by us at least 4 times. When I put all the dirty dishes on the empty table next to where I had been standing waiting for 20 minutes she proceeded to bus that table. She had no name tag so I don't know her name. Finally someone came to wipe the table down. The server that waited on us offered us no drink refills, no salad but he was very generous with his I don't give a crap attitude. We used a $50 gift card that was truly wasted. If you have a Darden Company gift card, select any restaurant but Olive Garden and whatever you do, if you do go there, DO NOT SIT IN THE BAR area for food. . .unless you like bussing your own table and getting the worse service EVER. Bon apetit! Why is there no option for 0 ***"}
{"text":"02-04-18 8:20PM

Literally just had to walk out of here without even eating  because the host & the server were rude from start to finish. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Well from the photo the meal did not resemble the photo it has three small pieces of chicken. From the menu photo the cheese was browned with more chicken and get this it was there second try."}
{"text":"The service here can really bit hit or miss. I came here in a big party on Halloween and the service was beyond dismal. 

However, craving the bread sticks and Sopa De Tuscano, we came back and got excellent service!

The food came out a little slow, as did the drinks and appetizers, however politeness and a smile go a very long way. Especially when these days it appears people are not happy to be employeed.

The food is good and worth the gamble if you have time to spare."}
{"text":"I always go here for a quick bite and to fill up for a few days.  Its not the best, but you get what you pay for.  imho mcdonalds is worse"}
{"text":"As we entered the host was waiting and ready to greet us  she was very nice and had us seated almost immediately. Once we were seated our server Cassia approached us offering us some wine samples she then showed us how to  order using ziosk at the table. Throughout our visit she was very attentive and polite offering assistance when needed. She was amazing as well as our meal. Thank you"}
{"text":"Ok. So this place was just downright horrible today. I understand if it's busy will cause delays, but when it's just normal business, you should be on top of bringing drinks and food out. Every single item my group ordered took way too long to bring out. Just don't come here."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and always great service. Lunch date w fam or friends. Great Food And Services."}
{"text":"It's a great restaurant, They have a lot of options to choose from the menu.
They are really good with kids,
I really love their specials.
It's really great they they are offering wine sample,  I like to try it before I buy it :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I always have great service and food here. A good escape. Thanks Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Why must you keep disappointing me Olive Garden, why?!

 Was in there yestersay July 22, for lunch and it was pretty empty in there for a while so no excuses. It took a little while after being seated for someone to come over to take our drink order it felt like forever especially after coming out of 100 degree weather.

 Then, after drinks it took another lifetime to get our food order taken which we should of just done after we ordered, since we ALWAYS order the samething. 

 It took 11 minutes after ordering our food to get our soup and salad I feel like that is a little ridiculous. The people sitting behind us arrived 20 minutes after us and got their soups and salads at the sametime we did. 
 
 Luckily the chicken wasn't undercooked this time it was perfect! 

I would probably have to say we experienced all of this due to our server as another table was also complaining about her."}
{"text":"My favorite location!!! We usually go for Sunday brunch  (After church/in-between services). Today we came for dinner. I got the New Limited Meatball Stuffed Pizza Fritta & Classic Lasagna. Sonya had Lemon Salmon with Parm Crusted Zucchini. We shared 2 salads. Jennifer MADE IT SNOW Parm Romero Cheese and she was genuinely funny!!! 2 Peach-Raz Teas ended out tab at round $51. Great service. Fast. Server was excellent. Chocolate Candy to end and dinner was DA BOMB!!! 

***Dieting?
LoseIt and other apps have Olive Garden meals added making it easier to track what you ate OR check it before you order it. They also have gluten free and vegetarian options available. Cheers to eating and life style changes."}
{"text":"My most recent trip to Olive Garden has made me want to avoid this place for awhile. When we initially walked in we were greeted and seated very quickly. No problem there! The issue was when we were seated it took awhile for our server to arrive and he seemed a little scatterbrained. He may have been new, I'm not sure. Some time passed before we received the salad and breadsticks and the salad was drenched with dressing which made it soggy. We ordered our food, which was ok. My fiance wasn't impressed with his meal and ended up getting something else. When his food arrived, he had to wait 5 minutes before receiving replacement silverware and our drinks were not refilled the entire time(it wasn't that busy in there either). The server also said he was going to remove the other dish from the bill, but it still showed up when we got the check. Another 5 minutes passed before we saw the server again with the correct bill. He was a nice guy, but it just didn't seem like he was paying attention."}
{"text":"Every couple of years, I get a craving for some lasagna.  This week I had been craving some badly, but I'm on somewhat of a budget this month, too.  So, I saw they had a smaller lunch portion for about $12 here.  So I decided to eat here.  I don't mind Olive Garden.  It's not my favorite Italian joint, but there are MUCH worse.  The salad is always worth the trip.  I normally like the breadsticks, but given I got there around 2pm today, I guess they weren't that fresh.  They were a little stale.  The salad and lasagna both did not disappoint.  They were great.  And I had a $3 Birra Morretti (A great Italian beer).  So, with tip I had a great meal for under $20.  And my server was beyond spectacular.  She was fast, attentive, and very friendly.  It was a great dining experience.  Now, if the powers that be there are listening, please bring back the Manicotti.  It was my favorite dish on the menu."}
{"text":"I get about a once a year craving for Olive Garden, and yesterday was that day.  And it was pretty good.  My server was excellent.  I wish I remembered names better.  But she was very attentive and very nice.  I ordered the ravioli and it was good.  The breadsticks and salad are still the best thing about the place.  The place was clean.  The manager came around and asked if I needed anything to please bring it to his attention.  I thought that was nice.  Overall, it was a good experience.  The two reasons I didn't give it five stars, is the wine list is not good.  I had a Coppola Cab, which was not great.  And the parking is terrible.  They seem to share a lot with a BJ Brewhouse and another restaurant.  Olive Garden is sandwiched between the two.  I went at 4:30pm, and it was full.  I can just imagine what it is like at normal lunch and dinner times."}
{"text":"I have always had fantastic service here good good some things more over priced then others but that's the expertise I guess. Love ordering to go!"}
{"text":"I love the Olive Garden!  For a chain Italian restaurant, they have great food.  I have never had bad service there either, and go at least 3 times a month.  One thing is for sure, Olive Garden goes to the limit to make their customers happy.  You can't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"They keep removing good food from the menu. The food we ordered was good, but the service left a lot to be desired. The waiters disappear for long periods of time. The upgrades to the building are nice, but good service is much more important."}
{"text":"I know that the Olive Garden is not real Italian food, but every once in a while the breadsticks and salad of the Olive Garden strike a craving in me. Dad and I decided to head down for lunch, and it wound up being a mistake.

The restaurant was surprisingly uncrowded so we had a seat right away. The waiter came up after a few minutes and asked us for our drink order. He offered us an option to purchase wine, and when we both asked for water, his completely friendly demeanor vanished...as did he! He came back with our water and breadsticks, took our food order, and we only saw him one time again before he brought the check.

Another waitress brough the soup and salad. The soup, Minestrone, was not too great...Campbell's would have been better. The salad was excellent as usual, though. We ran out of breadsticks pretty quick as we waited for our entrees, which was a LONG wait. We managed to catch our waiter one time and asked for more breadsticks...and he brought us a basket containing TWO breadsticks and dissapeared again.

The waitress brought out Chicken Parmesan for me, and Spaghetti with Meat Sauce for dad. My Chicken Parmesan was pretty terrible...and came with a side of approximately 20 rigatoni noodles. There were so few it was possible to easily count them! Dad said the Spaghetti was nothing to write home about either.

The waiter re-appeared with our check sometime after the meal, and he was suddenly friendly with us again. It really didn't help his cause, he still got a crappy tip for crappy service. 

All in all, I believe that taking a trip to any number of Las Vegas' local-bred Italian restaurants is a better investment if you're looking for some good Italian food. If you're hankering THAT much to go to a chain restaurant, Carrabba's and even Fazoli's can provide you with better fare than this place."}
{"text":"We went yesterday for lunch with a a few cousins. Hardly busy but it took forever for everything. Someone ordered a house salad and come to find out you actually just share salad that was brought to the table for someone else's order. The beef that was ordered was cold and when they came back with the new one it barely warm. Someone else ordered an meal with roasted potatoes. They were barely cooked and come to find out they are actually fried potatoes. 

But the best one was the disgusting hair I found under my flat bread. I wanted to throw up. Of course it was after I paid for my food and was boxing it up. They offered me another one.  Um no thanks. I did get a $20 giftcard and they returned my money but the last few times we've been there it's been pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent service from having the door opened for us by the host when we arrived and when we were finished eating. Our server Nashae was very attentive and kept up on our drinks throughout the whole meal. The food was hot and freshly cooked. 
We paid with cash and she broke up our change like a real pro. I asked for a To-Go cup for the rest of my soda and was given one with no hesitation. 
Over all great dinner here at this Olive Garden location. 
Oh- and used the restroom before leaving and it was clean."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner food was amazing as always but tonight I had the best hostess who so friendly from the moment we walked in the door! Gail truly was top notch bubbly, sat us right away,showed us and went over the specials tonight and make our date from the start just right! Her customer service went above and beyond tonight which is lacking in most restaurants most days and it was great to see someone who enjoys what they do!! Thanks Again Gail"}
{"text":"I never wrote a mean review before but unfortunately, I had to for this particular Olive Garden. My family owns a restaurant and I am exceptionally sympathetic to servers and kitchen staff, but I couldn't even offer that with this restaurant.

I took one of my best friends out to lunch yesterday and had an awful experience while we were there. It took a few minutes for our waitress to come to our table, but that is never a big deal to me. When she came to take our drink orders, we asked for lemon water and a cherry coke. That is a total of two drinks - why did it take longer than 15 minutes to receive?

Then, our food. We ordered an appetizer (stuffed mushrooms) and as common sense goes, appetizers should be the first order to the kitchen so you can munch while waiting for your main entrees. That didn't happen. Our appetizer took over 30 minutes to arrive and for most people, I get irritated when I'm hungry. Still, I was incredibly polite to her because I know what it feels like to be a waitress (even if it's my family's place). I think our server is one of those people who might not care to satisfy friendly customers - they take advantage of kindness and give priority to customers who are screaming and yelling instead. 

To not continue this long rant, our entrees didn't show up for another thirty minutes. I asked about the wait two times and she said, verbatim, \"yeah I don't really know what's taking so long. I forgot to put the order in but it still shouldn't take this long for lasagna.\" 

That was unprofessional and I asked to speak to a manager at that point, but, surprise surprise! The manager never showed up and we had to wait an additional 15 minutes before we decided to forget about it and leave. 

I didn't forget, though. It was supposed to be a nice lunch with a friend and because I didn't get to speak to a manager, I had to put a review on Yelp."}
{"text":"Probably the worst food I've ever ate!!!!  Dry cold bread styx, salad dressing is absolutely gross, I believe they add corn starch to it!!  Had them take my chicken piccata off my bill it was sooooo dry & gross!!  They lay zucchini on the plate and sprinkle bread crumbs on it , yuk!!!!  Sat for 45 minutes before we received our salad, when my husband asked if they went to Yuma to pick the lettuce the girl said no we get it from California,
LMBO,  right over her head that went....  I don't understand how these chains stay open?!?!  No creativity or presentation & definitely no flavor!!  Will definitely not be returning to any Olive Garden EVER.  I seriously wanted to go back In the kitchen & teach them how to use spices & make homemade salad dressing, pretty hard to mess a salad up, but, they succeeded!!  Amazes me people flock to eat that food!!"}
{"text":"One thing I absolutely love at Olive Garden are the bread sticks and soup here! So yummy. I end up eating so much before my actual meal comes out (unlimited bread sticks and soup!) that I am too full to finish my entree.

However, I find it a bit irritating that they don't take reservations. It doesn't make sense to go to a place with 6+ people and have to wait all together at the front. The wait is usually very long, especially for dinner time (at least 30min). The place is big, but always packed and usually very loud.. I guess it is more of a family dinner place. I'm not sure if anything on the menu is amazing either. Especially for the price, I think you could go elsewhere with a better atmosphere and better food, with less wait time.

I will still visit Olive Garden for lunch (you can get just the bread sticks and soup for less than 10 bucks!), but probably never for dinner and definitely not for a date or for big get togethers."}
{"text":"Meal was good...Waitress was really nice but slow and forgetful...Tiramisu was frozen."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is the place to go for moderately priced, tasty Italian fare.  Famous for their bread sticks and endless salad, they now have a buy one, take one for $12.95.  What a deal! 

This particular location in Summerlin, is the best Olive Garden in Vegas. worth driving off strip for."}
{"text":"The food is still great but today was kind of disappointing.  I was there with my daughter and her best friend.  It was a little before noon and they weren't really busy. Placed our order starting with appetizers.  I had the stuffed mushrooms, my daughter had the  mozzarella sticks and her friend had flatbread.  The problem was that we all ordered soup, salad and breadsticks as well.  They arrived before the appetizers.  Don't know what their problem was today but it included very slow service."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Olive Garden.  It's truly one of my all-time favorites and usually my go-to Italian place when I want something yummy and not want to worry about quality.

That's why I was SOOOOOO disheartened by this particular location.  The waitress was awesome!!  Best part of the night.  BUT, the food was crap.  Seriously, I almost sent my meal back because it was so freaking bad.  I got the fetuccini alfredo.  The pasta was severely over cooked.  They noodles fell apart as I was trying to wind them around the fork to eat them.  And the sauce was poorly seasoned (like no flavor whatsoever) as well as chunky.  Have you ever had chunky alfredo sauce?  I was thinking, what the heck did they use in this, cottage cheese??  Ewwww!  That's all I have to say about that.  My dining partner said his noodles were also mushy (I thought, maybe, it was just the fetuccini, but nope).

Save your money and eat somewhere else or go to a different Madison location because THIS one was so totally not worth it."}
{"text":"I second James S. experience. After waiting an hour for a table which was fine the service was SLOW, the salad was terrible (it looked like it sat out for days) by the time we got our food almost 45 minutes later we just wanted to leave. I don't take my kids out often and this was VERY disappointing. It also smelled like rotten food or throw up back by our table. We will not be returning. I knew we should have went to Carabbas. I WISH I could take it back and go somewhere else. I hate spending my hard earned money on a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Never even got in the door, poor service before even walking in. Called to make a reservation for 4 adults and 3 kids, was immediately told I couldn't. Was very confused and asked if they didn't take reservations anymore? Girl informed me that they do but they can't accept any parties of 7 for the night.... I asked if they were too booked for me to try coming to dinner and was told no I could walk in.... confused on why they couldn't take a reservation but saying they \"could still seat me\" I asked if they foresaw the wait being longer than 20/30mins, she said she couldn't tell me. I asked if I came later in the night if the walk in wait could be better or worse, she couldn't tell me. I was very polite the entire time and felt like she was basically saying don't come and eat here at all. I asked politely if I could speak to a manger and was put on hold for longer than 15 minutes before I ended up hanging up. Why would I wanna come and spend money there if I'm basically told \" we don't want you\" ? I worked in a restuarant for 5 years - it was poorly handled and worse that she left me on hold most likely with intention of not helping me speak to a manager either. When I worked as a hostess I would have politely said that they only allow so many reservations of large parties but we never turn anyone away. I would have said that it's not normally busy on Mondays - which usually have a 10 min or less wait time. I would have said due to holiday I can't guarantee you a certain time but our staff is doing amazing at handling the increased business and we would love for you to come down, the wait could be 10 minutes but could also be up to 45 or even a hour. At least that would have been some effort to give a customer ANY type of answer! I have eaten at Olive Gardens in quite a few states but not at this one yet- and I guess I won't be?

Update: on our way to giordanos 
We called ahead- they were happy to make us a reservation and estimate only 10-15 min wait"}
{"text":"I eat out at this Olive Garden a few times a month and almost every time I go my group has a flawless experience. Parking is never a hassle, even if we have to park all the way in the farthest lane, it's only 3 lanes away from the door which isn't far at all. From the moment we walk in we are greeted by the host and on occasion, some employees will hold the doors open for us to come in. We are always seated in a timely manner: If they can, they seat us right away and if they seem to be busy, they give us a time estimate and it is always a reasonable number.

I've never had a server that left me with a bad impression or experience. I have definitely had some that I liked more than others but they all still get the job done, and well. They're always smiling, kind, and eager to listen. My family and I are fast drinkers so we always warn them we will need multiple refills throughout our visit and they always happily comply.

I often do the \"Build Your Own Pasta\" and I've tried many of the combinations and it is always delicious and plentiful... I always take home leftovers! I've also tried the Tour of Italy, Fettuccine Alfredo, Chicken Parmigiana, their Zeppolis, Tiramisu and much more, and I'm always satisfied!

Last but not least the place always looks clean. I've never received dirty utensils or plates. Never any lip stains on my drinkware. Always been sat at a clean table. So on and so forth.

To wrap it all up, I'm always happy when I leave this place. I've been coming here for years and will be coming for many more!"}
{"text":"Their to go ordering is absolutely the worst. I ordered on the phone and she told me it would be 15 min. I ended up waiting 45 minutes and by the time I got my food it was ice cold and the salad was warm.  I'm pretty sure they just forgot to bring me my order. Either way I'll never be visiting this Olive Garden again."}
{"text":"My wife and I share an equal admiration for this place! I generally order the trio sampler which goes well with salad and bread sticks and my wife gets an order of mussels. This is our little get away from the kids on a Friday night secret! Great service even when they are busy!"}
{"text":"love the salad and bread sticks. This place really is fantastic because there is never really a long wait. I am a big fan of the chicken alfredo"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat out. Great food selections, and bread sticks are amazing! if your looking for a great place for a date our just go out with the family this place is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful and service is exceptional. We love coming to this olive garden location. We definitely  recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I found a winged insect in my soup. The potatoes were undercooked and our server forgot 2 of our orders. I can't say I enjoyed this Olive Garden."}
{"text":"The few times I have been to this location with friends and my husband have been top notch! Went for early dinner yesterday and the food was great with big portions to be able to take some home.  Our server, Jennifer B. could not be more attentive!  She ran over about 3 times to refill our beverages, asking us if we wanted more salad or breadsticks, and despite how busy she was, made us feel very happy to be there.   They keep people coming back because of great food, amazing service and reasonable prices--this is the recipe for success!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We went to the Olive Garden for the consistently good food however the waitress was incredibly amazing! Breanna gave us the best service we've ever had!  Despite juggling several tables at one time she provided us with fantastic service!  I hope you're lucky enough to get her again! Definitely be asking for her table."}
{"text":"We were seated right away because they weren't very busy. Unfortunately our server took almost 10 minutes to ask if we wanted water or not.  The service continued to disappoint as our apathetic waitress informed us that there were delays on house salads and breadsticks. It's safe to say that this Olive Garden is the only one in the entire franchise with breadstick troubles. 

Our lunch concluded with my pregnant wife hand delivering our payment to our waitress who was chatting in the corner with her co-workers.

So you know I'm not one of those people who complains about everything, I will say that the hostesses were very nice and the soups were pretty good."}
{"text":"Few basic rules of being a waitress. One, don't tap your foot and look around when we're not sure what to order. Second, when you leave to give us time to look over the menu, we don't need 20 minutes. Also good to not assume your patrons are under aged and not offer any alcoholic drinks. No wine tasting was offered so we didn't order any. Know your lunch specials... when I asked what the current specials were and you answer \"none\"... that's just lazy. Ordered a beer and a mixed drink... another ten minutes. Food came and went fast enough and the waitress was attentive to our drink needs. Salad was kinda old looking; clear onions and lettuce wasn't super crunchy. Otherwise everything was ok! Place was clean, got right in, food was good, price was ok. Always feel like Olive Garden as a whole is a bit of a rip off for the quality of their food. Most tastes microwaved or frozen, especially compared to many other area restaurants."}
{"text":"I am typically a fan of the calamari , cheese fonduta, and mussels and their tirimisu, but, I think this is the last time I am ever going to this Olive Garden.  The server did not bring out our appetizer (though we were not charged for it).  She definitely heard us, because she repeated it.  We didn't want to say anything because she was training someone and we didn't want her to lose face.  Our server WAS nice though. 

Definitely not a place to go for authentic Italian. I can't stand their lasagna.  It's a block of salt and marina. Whole Foods hot foods section has better lasagna.  Tuscan steak always comes overcooked (as in overly well done).

SECONDLY and MOST IMPORTANTLY, when I was in a bathroom stall, another staff comes in and uses the stall next to me.  She takes off her apron, and throws it on the bathroom floor, as opposed to hanging it on the bathroom door.  And after I saw that, I couldn't even finish my meal.  I wrapped it up and just broiled the life out of it.  I am not saying it was my server, but it was somebody who worked there.

I would have given it three stars, but that apron/hygiene fiasco really freaked me out."}
{"text":"Normally service is good , but today was very disappointing!
I tried the new lunch chicken sandwich and the bread was hard as a rock , chicken was all dried up and very small. 
The server never asked refills with our waters or more soup or salad. 
Just all bad all the way around. I would rather just go to the Decatur location Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I had the best service tonight that I had to yelp it. Our servers names were Megan and Christine. I'm sorry ladies if I've spelled your names wrong. But they were so polite and provided excellent service. Our drinks were never low and they constantly came to see if we were okay or needed anything. I thought it was really great service for us having a big party and the restaurant being so busy. They split our bills correctly and Megan even walked us out which has never happened to me at a restaurant. Absolutely best service I've ever experienced at any restaurant. Thank you ladies. I hope your boss reads this and they give you some kind of bonus check or something because you ladies were so great. Thank you again."}
{"text":"Had such an amazing time our waitress Loraine was so amazing helped up pick our appetizer and recommended the new fizzy drinks will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Service is very bad. Waitress was throwing plates on the table. And not even listening to want we want to order. And she even charged for salad which comes for free. Have been to many restaurants but this was my worst experience."}
{"text":"We ate here and got food poison with my entire family. We were hospitalized. I tried calling the manager several times today to let him to check the food, but he NEVER came on the phone. A black girl took the call around 4:30pm and refused to give the managers last name. After the 5th call a girl took the call and said she was a manager and her name was Shawna. She refused to give her last name. She told me that Tom is the other manager and she spelled his last name, Wozniak, Tom Wozniak. Finally Shawna said her last name was Shawna Caper. She then laughed in my face and said she does not care that we got food poison from Olive Garden food. I asked the name of the General Manager, then Shawna slammed the phone in my face. RUDE! I will NEVER eat at Olive Garden again."}
{"text":"Usually I love the Olive Garden, just not this one. The food was bland, service was very slow, my alfredo sauce had separated by the time they brought it to the table, and it was room temperature. Our waiter was inattentive and spent the whole time making eyes at a table of girls near by. We had to ask several times just for things like a refill of water. The place doesn't look that clean and is generally uninviting.

The olive garden near my hometown was always delicious, but this one was subpar. I think the best olive garden in this region is probably the one near parma, but even that one is only OK."}
{"text":"This would be 1 star had Andrew our waiter had not tried to correct the service failure. After hour being seated we actually watched table across from us be seated after us eat pay bill and leave before we even received our main course. Ordering never ending pasta bowl one would think that is pretty pre made basic stuff they have available to serve. Andrew advised kitchen was having issues and basically reason for problem. Manager Tanya was nice however offers a coupon for free appetizer next time we come and dessert free to take home. Would have preferred discount off meal after spending 2 hrs there. We did have 5.00 off coupon that was not applied to bill, after being up since 3am to go to work and 2 hrs in OG was willing pay bill get out and go home @6:30pm. Thanks Andrew for trying to make up we appreciated it, however OG will be long time before our feet will step foot in your establishment."}
{"text":"So Olive Garden has had the same menu for as long as I can remember, and the food is consistently good across multiple Vegas locations. Food-wise, you pretty much always know what you're going to get. Mom and I wanted pasta after massages on Monday, 1/15 and decided to visit the Centennial Hills location. 
The food was, as always, good. We both had salad and chicken fettuccine. Get a side of alfredo sauce to dip the bread sticks in-it makes them that much better. 
Where they lose stars for me, is the service. So we didn't get a receipt because the Ziosk was out of paper, which is annoying and a problem I run into consistently at the chains that use those. I don't recall our servers name, because despite being incredibly loud and attempting to joke with us, I don't recall him ever introducing himself. He was so loud that we could hear him across the room, and rather than just taking our order he kept trying to make jokes and comment on everything, which got kind of old. I'm all about friendly service, but your jokes (that I could hear you using at other tables as well) weren't funny and frankly half the things he said just confused me. We're here for a relaxing lunch and to chat, and I don't need you interjecting and commenting on our discussion. I'm sure we'll be back, and as you can see I'm still giving them an A-OK."}
{"text":"I was here on Saturday the 30th of March & although I have always been a big fan of OG that quickly changed. When a waiter, dropped a tray filled with plates on my 3 year-old son's head! OG, was quick into action by providing free meal, $100 gift card and even throwing in free dessert. Another, waiter even cracked a joke saying \"Surprise\"- not funny considering there was broken glass all over our table, on our un-eaten food. And, the fact my 3 year old just got hit a set of plates and a tray. . Nonetheless, I forgive OG and the waiter who did it, and thankfully my son is alive and just has a few bumps on the head. Still, I'd really like for OG to be more careful - I know how it is to wait tables, and try and hurry up. But, safety is a big concern."}
{"text":"Beware of Ziosk!  These are new interactive devices they place on your table to view menus, pay your bill, call your waitress, and play games while you wait. I liked the concept and proceeded to answer one of the trivia questions promoted on the screen. It then asked me to answer more by joining a tournament with fellow patrons, which I did.  What a great time killer. Low and behold the bill comes after the meal and they added a$1.99 charge for games. Are you kidding me? No indication a fee was involved nor a confirmation to accept charges. What a scam. I am an intelligent person and was duped here. I can only imagine it's more common place if you have unsuspecting kids at your table. To me a deliberate attempt to defraud patrons.  

As for food, it was only ok. The chicken and veggies were obviously added later instead of being cooked in the sauce. Portions were small and prices were incredibly high for Italian fast food (16.99 chicken entree).  Too many nice authentic Italian restaurants in the area at or only slightly above this price point to put this on my frequent stop list."}
{"text":"Our server Sara H was outstanding! 

Now onto the rest of the review. Chain food should be all that's required to describe this place. Place was clean, and as said above, great service. Food on the other hand...

Breadsticks were meh. Salad was mostly just lettuce. Please stop with the grating of cheese at the table. It's not 1970 anymore. Chicken Florentine stuffed shells (totally not authentic) were a ridiculously huge portion. Yes, pasta dishes are cheap and the urge to over-plate is huge, but just don't. Make your ingredients higher quality instead. Tuscan sirloin. Oh boy. Asked for rare (125 degrees), expected medium (145 degrees), and was not shocked when it came that way. Should have asked for blue (115 degrees). Garlic butter on top was not good - literally garlic with unsalted butter. Adds no meaningful flavor. Zucchini side was horrible. Garlic mashed potatoes were surprisingly not garlicky."}
{"text":"I went here anxious to try the lobster ravioli ! Me and my date were quickly seated and ordered the spicy calamari which was good and then our lobster ravioli arrived and it was disappointing it was too heavy on the Salt so my date and I had to send it back I then ordered the classic lasagna which was good . The server was very friendly and very accommodating that's why Olive Garden gets 4 stars.."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a bit it's sad when you walk in and never get greeted I have always said hi first cuz that's the first thing people notice !! Every time I go the ladies at the front that seat you to your table and are suppose to greet you it's not that hard but they are always talking to one another it's truly rude. Gets even better I say bye as their talking on our way out and they continue to have their conversation. Idk to me that makes someone feel welcome in your establishment. Hope they see this and change it !!"}
{"text":"It used to be of higher quality with large portions, now it's small portions with huge prices. $10 is a lot for a bowl of spaghetti. I can make 8 gallons of sauce for that... If it was fantastic, I wouldn't mind the cost. Now it's only convenient because it's close and is better than Denny's."}
{"text":"I went to this Olive Garden after receiving a gift card last time I had gone there because the service was so awful. Thinking I would give it another shot, I was thuroughly disappointed. We order the chicken Alfredo and it was way undercooked and then when I received the bill, I was overcharged and had to send the bill back. Will not be giving it a third shot."}
{"text":"Food was good and quick, service was nice, I don't like the rooms that are off to the side so when the server bends over while helping another table, you get ass close to your face."}
{"text":"I am deeply disappointed. I've loved Olive Garden for years, partially because at least there, I knew what I was getting. 

Well, not anymore. 

I'd heard they were changing the menu, including the sources for food, but I didn't expect the changes to be this drastic. It's either that, or just this location is terrible. 

We went yesterday. And here's what we got:

1. Wilted, brown lettuce with unspeakably gross consistency. 
2. Stale, CHEWY bread sticks. 
3. Tortelloni instead of tortellini. 
4. Old minestrone soup - so old, so overcooked, that it's GRAINY and all one color. 

Just... This was nasty and disappointing. I really, really hope this isn't the new Olive Garden standard, or I won't be returning. :("}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for table dining but I must shout out their to-go service. It's been consistently excellent. My office is mere minutes away from this location so if a pasta craving hits, I can be in and out thanks to placing my order online. The people who are behind the desk handling the to-go orders have been above and beyond friendly and always make sure everything is correct.

As for the food? Eh, it's an Olive Garden but I go here for their pasta e fagioli soup and breadsticks so not much can be messed with up my order. 

My personal tip: place your to-go order online via their website and check online for coupon codes...I saved 15% on my last to-go order!"}
{"text":"Went in at 11:15 on a Saturday morning  with the family after being turned away at Shuck's and Timbers because they are 21 and over. There were very few cars in the lot so we anticipated at least a quick seating. OG opens at 11:00, but we were told we would have to wait for a table to be set up. After an extended wait and watching several employees milling around with no sense of urgency and acknowledgement we were still waiting. We opted to dine elsewhere and walked out. In my book, it starts with the service. We got none."}
{"text":"I love the Olive Garden.  I have been here several times, and only once been disappointed.  Great place to take the family for dinner without having to completely drain your wallet.  The service is usually good, and the selection is varied enough to please everyone you bring with you.  But it can get crowded, so be prepared to wait.  I do not remember if they take reservations, but if they do, make one."}
{"text":"So it seems this location is very popular with the locals.....elderly.....and hosting family functions. This location like most Olive Gardens I have visited in the past can get very crowded....but I do have a very good tip for you if you decide to dine here. If you don't want to wait you MUST go between the hours of 4-6pm.....because after that you will be waiting for at least 20 minutes for a table. Now while that is not a long wait if your hungry that could seem like an eternity....LOL. I have waited as long as 40 minutes but I wouldn't do that again. The Service is pretty good but if you sit at one of the tables in the rear of the establishment they may forget about you back there. The food is just average.....I had the Chicken Alfredo....the chicken was to fatty....and the noodles were a little cold. All in all it wasn't a terrible experience....but I don't have to come back to this location anytime soon. That is a real shame too because it is only about 5 minutes or less from my apartment. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Even in the context of this is an Olive Garden, this should get a Zero.  We were a little late getting off the road and this was close to motel.  Would been happier starving.

The waittress started off being rude because we wouldn't try the wine they were pushing.  Then the salad came late and skimpy.  And she actually started to hand us the bill before even putting in our dinner order!  When dinner finally arrived, my asparagus was so tough it could NOT be cut with a steak knife!  Housing timbers maybe, food not.

Then  a lady, acting like the manager, came by and asked if everything was OK.  Said \"not\" -- unusual.  I really detest bothering to complain.  She offered to get me more asparagus -- as if....   Then she said she'd remove the meal cost from the bill.  We said that wasn't necessary and she said she'd do it anyway.   Guess what?  nada.

AND the waittress overcharged us -- charging for a dessert we didn't get.

Next time I'll forget these guys exist and go to the Subway -- at least it's consistent."}
{"text":"Why people love the Olive Garden is a complete mystery to me.  You always have to wait for a table, the restaurant has a bad smell, and the food is just average.  I'm always sad when a family member really wants to go there.  Such a waste of good money."}
{"text":"Soup service and cheep house wine... priceless"}
{"text":"Kinda hard to go wrong here. The service is sometimes spotty but the meals are typically good to great. Tonight the fettucine alfredo was a bit bland and lacked flavor. However, the lasagna and the chicken parmigiana were excellent.  We typically like to sit in the bar area if possible.  It seems like we get better service in there."}
{"text":"A friend and I had a very tasty Mother's Day dinner after a movie. I had a chicken dish with salad. The waitress was kind when she served us but because it was Mother's Day they were very busy. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table it was standing room only. But we had a nice time."}
{"text":"The service from Nick was amazing. It was my birthday and we're a big party (8) and we never went without anything (soup, salad, bread sticks, drinks, napkins, ect). The food was amazing as well. My kids all cleaned their plates (uncommon) and my wife and I can't stop talking about our dishes hour later. The price was really amazing too we had 3 kids and 5 adult dishes and 3 sampler appetizers and a $30.00 tip for less than $200.00.  I will definitely be back with my family."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ.

I'm having a hard time putting this experience into words because I am still so dumbfounded. They serve food that has gone bad and don't care, PLEASE don't eat here.

We ordered Togo food last night, 6/2/2017 and both my husband and myself ate their mussels. He unfortunately ate his entire mussel entree which masked the flavor before starting on the mussel appetizer and asking me to try one because he was not feeling well. I immediately spit it out and he is still sick. I won't go into the details... you can imagine classic food poisoning symptoms.

Having worked in the restaurant industry for many, many years we called the restaurant to let them know they had a food safety issue and asked for a manager.

We spoke with the manager, Carlos Meraz. After explaining our concern you would expect an apology and assurance that he would personally go check the mussels they were serving right.....? 

Honestly I could not make this up, he replied with, \"I'm sure your enjoying your dinner, I'll let you get back to that, why don't you call back after? 
I asked, \"are you serious?\" And he just repeated what he had said previously but added that he wanted to give us a gift card. I told him that we were not interested in money but that we were concerned about public safety. He, of course just repeated that I should get back to my dinner...?

........ I can't put enough dumbfounded periods here to fully explain our concern and shock. 

We just told you, that you have a food safety/health department concern and your reply was to keep eating and call you back??? Oh you mean from the hospital because that's were my husband would be if we'd taken your advice and continued eating our dinner. 

If they had reacted differently I wouldn't feel it was my duty to report this illness to the health department and Darden corporate."}
{"text":"We had a really nice dinner here tonight. Our waiter John M was super service from him.  I hope on our next trip to Vegas if we want Olive Garden hopefully we will get John again."}
{"text":"We dined as a large party of 14!   I had the new parmesan crusted steak with cheese stuffed noodles, it was devine!  The waitress did great and helped make our birthday celebration even better!"}
{"text":"My server james was very kind!!!! Our food AWESOME!!!we have a great dinner, prices dont matter!! We comeback soon, our dessert  was so good!! The only thing thah make me unconfortable is the machine to pay !!!we are back for lunch today it was awesome my server kally was great!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like soup, salad and bread sticks! Most of the time that is what we have. Not really into their pasta dishes. Service seems to be fine. Never had any issues."}
{"text":"Great outing with our grandmother. My lady and I are in town visiting and we wanted to have a meatless entree. No matter if its Chicago or Vegas Olive Garden is good place for good food that's not expensive. Our meals didn't come with sauce on top oddly, it was on the side. Our waitress Damara was really nice and friendly. Great choice for our first meal in town."}
{"text":"Their service was horrifying. We had to wait 10 minutes to get our drink. Then when we ordered and got our food the chicken was burnt and there was a rock in my Gorgonzola steak pasta, and the rock chipped my tooth. Then when they brought out the new chicken stuffed Marsala the side dish mash potato also had inedible substance in it. Out of the whole service my coke was never refilled. The service and food are horrible!!!"}
{"text":"what has happened to the Alf redo  sauce. It is so bland
We were there Saturday evening with friends Our friend had shrimp with Alf redo sauce and was also unhappy  
We will probably never return"}
{"text":"Whenever I go here there is a wait.  Granted, one time was for the Veteran's Day offer.  The service can be rather slow at times but I like the food so I am not too bothered by it.  My waiters/waitresses are always friendly and I like the wine tasting they offer when you are first greeted.  I have never had to wait too long for the food and I have yet to have a bad experience.  My only complaint is they don't really offer a second basket of bread sticks once you finish the first....not that i need them! but isnt it unlimited?  My favorite soup is the chicken gnocchi (sp) and the salad is always delcious."}
{"text":"They revamped the restaurant, it had a very strong smell of feet, not ideal for eating. But I'm pregnant and wanted soup and bread sticks so we waited the \"5 min\" for a table for two and then sat another 15 min for no one to come to our table or even be acknowledged. That has never happened at at this location before and now I'm never going back so it'll never happen again. Good luck to those who go."}
{"text":"Wow the have to get it together, I came in for a to go soup and it took 20 minutes now I'm back to pick up something I forgot and have been standing here for 10 minutes while managers and servers walk around.
And yes there is a ration and charge for breadsticks, I thought these were bottomless.   Meh.....
Make eye contact, acknowledge the customer and provide service."}
{"text":"I love the food at Olive Garden, although the service can be a bit slow at times. I am really glad that an Olive Garden restaurant is located near my house which makes it quite convenient."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of anything they serve here but the salad, breadsticks, roscato wine, and their seasonal pumpkin cheesecake. Most of their actual dishes just don't have any unique taste to me especially for the price. Honestly sometimes I just go for the salad and breadsticks!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a long time. It's my moms birthday and she wanted to try the new dishes she saw on a commercial .
It was all great! The wait staff and the food. The only down to my experience was time . We got dessert and it took a good 15 minutes before it made it to the table. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love this place. No complaints over here. If you have something bad to say about this Olive Garden"}
{"text":"My BF & I stopped in for dinner one nite with our cousins.
We were seated immediatly, & greeted by our server. He offered us each, a glass of moscatto to sample & took our orders. Though the service was great, the food most definatly needed some work.  My dish as well as my cousins dishes were okay, but my Bfs dish didnt come out so well...
He took a couple bites of his seafood pasta and ended up cutting his gums with a sharp piece of shell that broke off a mussel. His mouth bled for a while. Meanwhile, the server came to check on us & noticed something was wrong, once he found out he called over his manager, she appologized, gave us her business card/info & said to call if we ever needed anything...."}
{"text":"Finally went back to olive garden & it was so good! It took awhile for the waitress to initially come to greet our table, but after that service was very good, much improved & the food was great! My mom's choice for her b day & she enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Olive Garden. This location seems to be very popular and can have up to a two hour wait, so plan ahead. Once in, the staff is very friendly and attentive. I am a picky eater but my requests didn't seem to phase them. I was pleased with the speed of service we received and will likely come back to this location (making sure that there is no wait ahead of time)."}
{"text":"We love to go here on our lunch to get away.
All you can eat soup,salad and breadsticks for $7.98 what\"\"
Delicious"}
{"text":"So we ordered online one of their catering platters that's was 10-14 people with less than a 2 hours notice. They had our order ready to go as soon as we arrived and the girl that helped us was super helpful. I'm not sure if they do this with every order but to me she went above and beyond by taking the time of labeling all the food and sauces. This location is about a 10 minute drive from our office so I was concerned it would not be hot anymore. Wrong it was still hot when we arrived and it was delicious! Everyone in the office gave me and the doctors a thumbs up for choosing this as lunch for us. We will be ordering from here more often than not and I will also be coming back to have a sit down with my family."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying that my family has been going to this Olive Garden for years. I really truly wish I could give it a better rating based on the fact that there are a few servers and other staff that are really great and it used to be a well run restaurant. However, things have gone downhill the last year and I couldn't recommend it to anyone.
The last two visits we have made have both been for birthday dinners. Last visit left us a little less than satisfied with inattentive servers, being seated next to a group of 30 who decided they could take up half the room for their office party complete with applause, and waiting 20 minutes past everyone else's food arriving for my entree which was then so hot I had to take it home to eat. I went ahead and filled out the online survey, marked that I wasn't opposed to having a manager call me, and NOTHING. I was hoping it was a bad night and this time it would be better. Unfortunately it wasn't.

We have a large family group and are used to waiting, no big deal. An hour wait when quoted 40 minutes on a Sunday night when the lobby is empty (and some whispers amongst the hosts about not wanting to seat certain servers because they want to go home) gets a little annoying, but I digress. 
We are sat at a table pushed together almost right in a traffic area(we were paranoid of getting elbows and trays to the head the whole time) and one flustered server gave the greeting and walked away without taking any drink orders. At this point we had 3 small children who already were getting tired as it was nearing bedtime after the wait. Waiting for drinks and putting orders in took forever, when we finally brought salads and soups it was already past 9 PM. Then we sat with empty app dishes in front of us for a good 20 minutes with no sign of servers. When my entree came out(shrimp ravioli type dish which was good but nothing amazing) the whole side and bottom of the plate had mashed potatoes on it. I'm hoping someone in our party had mashed potatoes. After eating a bit, most of us were just ready to go home at this point, the kids were sleeping in their chairs, we had to flag down our server who was cleaning tables across the room and ask for our check. We had asked for two cakes earlier for the birthday guy and as we were asking them to just cancel that, the server insisted he had them all set and waiting to go he was just waiting for checks(huh?). So they brought out the cakes and the two servers tried to get our party to sing happy birthday. Poor birthday guy got the most pathetic and tired birthday song ever. When the bill came, that automatic 15% tip added to each bill was just a slap in the face. I know it's customary but being large tippers generally, not having a choice in the matter was offensive at that point. Not to mention the fact that the servers had to have known that our meal took a ridiculous amount of time and we were far from happy, but there was no sign of the manager all night and it was far below what we have come to expect from any Darden restaurant. 

We won't be going back to this location if we can help it."}
{"text":"food was very good, especially the service by Maria G. She went up and Beyond good service, one the best waitresses I have seen living in Arizona for the past 30 years. usually don't give out reviews but this one is a necessity. Service match the food. If you're coming to this establishment I would ask for a table being serviced by Maria G.!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my experience at this Olive Garden location was extremely dissatisfying. It started with the hostess Elohneana (sp?) believe her name was. My boyfriend and I walked in around 3 pm, no one else in the waiting room. It took forever for the hostess to even come up to the stand at which point she didn't even greet us, didn't even make eye contact...she then proceeded to answer the phone which seemed to be a personal call because we could hear her giggling and the call lasted about 5 minutes. At this point a family of 6 walked in behind us. She then hung up the phone and greeted them and took their name down..while we were standing right in front of her. Overall she was just rude and incompetent in managing her time when it wasn't even that busy. She rushed an elderly couple who were getting drinks at the bar to be seated when she could have sat my boyfriend and I while the couple closed their check. She also sat the party of 6 before us. She was extremely unwelcoming and her customer service was atrocious. The server we had was nice..but she didn't even get to our table to get our drink order until about 20 minutes after we sat down. I don't really blame her because she was stuck at a table where a man was showing her some video on his phone..but I still think that she should have given him the hint that she needed to greet her new table. The food was good and that's about it. Worst hostess I've ever seen pretty much sums up my experience here."}
{"text":"constantly good, I have a favorite and they have never disappointed. Some times I have good servers sometimes bad it doesn't matter the food is alway great And I never leave hungry :)"}
{"text":"Best Olive Garden I've ever been too! I was never a big fan of Olive Garden in Fresno (where I'm from) but I thought I'd take my girlfriend there for a nice night out.  WOW!  We had to wait a bit (they always have people waiting, a sign its a good place to eat) but after we sat down the waitress was SO nice and the breadsticks actually had flavor unlike Fresno.  The food was served quickly and tasted GREAT!  Even as busy as they were they were very prompt, always happy and even gave us extra Andes mints in the end. Nice!"}
{"text":"Not happy with the service .. Not going back anytime soon ... Our server dicided what is good for us turn out food was not expected..  It's not even busy feel like we being push away .. Done with this place"}
{"text":"What horrible service, I will not be going back to Olive Garden Anytime soon.  I went for an early dinner with my family on Sunday, Jay was our server. The place was not full, there were more empty tables than there were full.  After 20 min. we had to ask for refills, after another 20 minutes had to ask for bread-sticks and our soups/salad. A manager finally walked by and it was if she could not care less that our waiter needed help.  I paid $100 for 4 people to eat, I would rather spend that kind of money someplace with better service."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful time at this Olive Garden our server Jamie was so polite and fast!! She took care of all of our needs!! The food was amazing!! We will alway go here!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I come back... the wait, the service, the food. It is all boring. Up to the point where you get the bill...then you are just mad. 

We had Soup, salad, bread for 3 of us at the table and 1 entree. The bill was still over $50. I cannot justify the cost at all. 

Go to frys and buy the Dressing, make it at home for 1/4 the cost."}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with some old friends for dinner and it was a major disappointment. The food was delicious as always, but the service here was so bad!!! Our waitress took a long time before she came to take our order. The food came out fast but the waitress only gave us not even 15 mins to enjoy our food before she comes back asking me if I want to box up my Alfredo. I told her no and that I'm still working on it. She then came back 3 more times after that asking if we needed boxes and if we are ready for the check. We thought that they close at 9pm, that's why she was in such a hurry to check us out. I checked and they dont close till 10pm. It was not even 9 yet, so why was she rushing us? We were so annoyed by her because she kept on coming back asking if we are ready. We decided to pay and find another place to catch up with our friends since our waitress was too eager trying to get us out of there or so it seems. We had to tell her twice that we wanted to pay in cash but at the end I still had to use my card because she was not paying attention to what I was saying. After we paid, she was no where to be found when I needed to get a to go cup for my lemonade. Finally my friend got fed up, she went to the bar to ask for a to go cup instead. I wish we had more time to enjoy dinner with my friends. Such a disappointment, because I really enjoy the food here."}
{"text":"We went to the OG for lunch on Saturday.  We could see empty tables, but had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  A pair of seats became available at the bar, so we chose to sit there.  We ordered soup and salad with the breadsticks.  The chicken and gnocchi soup was flavourless, the gnocchi's were huge, and the carrots were raw in the soup.  The minestrone was much better.  The restaurant is looking very dirty and tired, carpets are dirty.  We don't plan on going back there again."}
{"text":"I primarily go to the Olive Garden for the bread sticks, soups, salads, wine and on occasion the never ending pasta bowl when they have it. Everything else they offer is okay and can be gotten in the frozen food aisle in the store with a better taste. The lines are extremely long when we go with a 30 to 45 minute wait and this is even worse when the temperature outside is over 90 degrees. The value for your money is okay, but could be a little better."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff in general, however our server Rose didn't give us the proper customer service. Very fake energy and stingy service. Did not feel welcomed. Hopefully the other location by home has decent service."}
{"text":"After our visit to this location this afternoon I can definitely say this particular Olive Garden is home to some really great servers. 
Our server Cheryl G. exceeded the standard service in every way! Simply arriving to our table she gave a warm greeting and her overall attitude was amazing despite the busy environment. She consistently checked up on us and served us so very well. I had even mentioned how my girlfriend absolutely LOVES cheese with her chicken gnocchi soup and she even brought us out an extra portion aside from the standard portioning all without asking. She refilled our drinks and offered assistance very often. She even gave us some cheese to take home! Haha. I honestly cannot say enough about how great it is to have such awesome service during those busy hours where an average server would neglect the small details to meet the minimum. Great food, great service, awesome energy. 10/10 would eat here again. :)"}
{"text":"I can't find a fault. Great food (for the price), great service, good atmosphere, good for kids. good meal size. I had the chicken parmigiana, but I tried everything else that was on the table, and it was all good. Great family style Caesars salad. I think it would be good for large groups, parties, etc.
I will go back."}
{"text":"I spent my university years eating here-
Fill up on bread and salad/soup, then take your main pasta dish home for \"leftovers\"- kind of a students dream, where less cooking and saving money are top priorities.  
Coming here recently, it was as predicted- enjoyable salad but I do wish the dressing came on the side.  Tried my hubs' pasta fagioli soup and it was good.  My kids were pleased with their choices- not the best calamari ever, but still enjoyable.  The option to buy a meal to take home worked well for my hubs for lunch the next day.
Dinner here was as expected- if not a bit underwhelming. Their formula works, I just prefer to go to more interesting places these days.
Reservations would be a huge improvement to service."}
{"text":"Food just ok average but loved the service and especially our waiter Adam. That's a plus. We will come back and ask for our waiter Adam."}
{"text":"Called with a last minute catering order for 7... told her I'd be there in 10 minutes and that I understand If the food is not ready... I'll pay and wait.

When I arrived they were almost done packing the order and apologized that it wasn't ready- I told them that I wasn't expecting it to be , but thank you. 

A colleague was with me and when I returned from
The restroom he told me literally five separate staff members had asked if he had been helped, and if they could do anything.

Awesome location and great staff. Food came out really quickly for us, everything was packed nicely .. in and out! 

Thank you"}
{"text":"Food was good as usual.  The waiter was really slow and was attending to other tables that wasn't in his station.  He should have just focused on his tables."}
{"text":"Food was good but our waitress Keisha S. Was not friendly at all. We had to practically beg for refills. Not to mention 2 of the waiting staff members making out in front of me and other families around. Good food but lacks a family friendly environment."}
{"text":"Things have certainly changed, not for the better, at Olive Garden.  I have only eaten at this particular establishment twice in 3 years, only because of family birthday celebrations. I have eaten at several through Chicago area as well as Phoenix through out my life.  I use to think the food here was decent.  My latest visit on Monday 8/16/2016 (manager take note) proved to be a let down.  While being seated I noted these little kiosks on the end of the tables just like what you would find at Chilis or Applebee's.  This proves that the company is going through changes not characteristic of an Italian restaurant. Once we sat down my 10 yr old went right for the gaming on that kiosk. I told him this is a family dinner and no game playing is allowed.  Weakening wine menu, enough said.. We ordered the appetizer salad, that part was fine. like I'd expect from an Italian restaurant the salad was huge to be served on smaller plates. Not one min goes by we were served the entrees.  Waiting staff FUPA.  I ordered the cheese ravioli with Alfredo sauce.  Should have been on a kids menu for starters.  On the menu this dish described it for adult portions and taste. On to the desert an obviously a quickly thawed slice of Tiramisu.  Zero taste and the bottom was wet , water from the ice it had been thawed from.  No good.  My family enjoyed what they ordered.  Im my opinion ( just mine) I am placing Olive Garden in the Fast Food category of places to eat in quality. Kiosk games available at the dinner table Is a huge step backwards.  Also had trivia like at some sports bar."}
{"text":"Mediocre Italian food, not great service, and in my opinion overpriced for the quality. Here's the catch - I only go for breadsticks and salad, and you walk out cheap and satisfied, because that salad is always killer. Unlimited salad and breadsticks is my go-to meal, but other than that, I don't eat there. Not a huge fan of their food for the price, I'd rather go to a place and even pay more but with better quality taste."}
{"text":"Took my family to dinner tonight to celebrate birthdays and had an exceptional evening. I called earlier in the day to see what time we needed to go online to be able to get a table at 6. I explained that my mom is 96 and it's hard for her to wait so they were kind enough to reserve a table for us.  When we were arrived we were immediately escorted to our table. Our server Brian was absolutely fantastic! He was friendly, professional, made suggestions and made us feel very welcome. Outstanding service. The food was fresh and delicious. Thank you Olive Garden and Brian for a wonderful evening. We will be back"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that Olive Garden does not honor veterans. Not to mention they messed up my wife's order. Will never go again"}
{"text":"Typical Olive Garden. Not real Italian food, but definately tasty still. Love the soup, salad and breadsticks to go for lunch. I do wish that all Olive Gardens didn't use bagged lettuce and used fresh. Their chicken gnoochi soup is delish as well as their minestrone and pasta fagoil. Breaksticks are always fresh at this location. Staff is always nice and I love that even tho they don't open until 11, they are there to take your to-go order early so it is ready for pick up at 11 :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner.   Quick service.   Order came out just right.    Just what we expect.  Thank you OG"}
{"text":"Went there earlier this week to celebrate our grand daughters birthday.  Everything started out OK.  Our server was pleasant and had a trainee with her.  They took our drink orders and we ordered two of the calamari appetizers at $9.99 each.  The calamari was horrible!  Over breaded and over cooked to the point of almost being burnt!  I immediately notified our server who apologized, but made no attempt to resolve this situation, which was disappointing.  That was our biggest mistake of the night.  We won't make the same mistake again!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my mother in Laws Birthday. We waited to get a table for about 45 minutes. The service was quick but.. the food tasted like it had sit out too long. I ordered the salad and bread sticks,and a chicken fettachini alfredo and I was not happy with the quality of the food especially the noodles, I think the fettachinii alfredo in the box turns out better then what I recieve and to top it off my husband threw up in he parking lot. It was way over priced for the quality, and the only reason I gave it a two is because the waiter was soo friendly. meh I am a sucker for customer service even if the quality of the food is gross."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden in particular this one . I was here not too long ago. Out waitress was Jessica . She was amazing and very friendly ad helpful . I order steak Alfredo and it was delicious . I can't wait to go back !!!!"}
{"text":"You know when you are having a bad day and you decide to go to a restaurant with a friend and you have the most amazing waitress, well thank you Kerry, you were amazing and made my day.  The food was great and she seriously made my day.  Cudos to Kerry for making my day."}
{"text":"A great spot to enjoy a nice dinner and hang with your friends!  tip: ask for \"Roman\".   This guy is awesome!  Probably one of the best servers you'll have."}
{"text":"i know, I know--Olive Garden, how pedestrian of me! I don't have too many chain restaurant reviews, so I figured I'd write one. We went for a surprise birthday party. My friend had made a reservation which they somehow didn't have (maybe she called the wrong one? Anyway, I'm not going to dock for this). The staff was very accommodating, they were able to put a table together for us on short notice. 

When we sat down, I was immediately hit by a gross smell. I asked my friend \"Do you smell that? It smells like...\" to which he replied \"wet dog!\" which is exactly what I was thinking. It smelled badly like wet dog. How disgusting. Maybe it was the table--can you say dirty rags? While we waited for the rest to arrive, we got breadsticks and were also told that dessert for the birthday would be a charge. Really? Come on now. The bread sticks were pretty underwhelming--there was no garlic or flavor really. Booo. 

Once everyone arrived, we placed orders. I got the Bruschetta Salmon. When I asked the waiter how it was, he said he hadn't tried it in forever but that people say it's decent--I appreciated that honesty! They served salad shortly     My goodness this place was slow though. The food took forever. When it came out, it was pretty lousy. I found two bones in the salmon before I quit eating it. The risotto pasta thing under it was so heavy and the salmon was sort of hard and the toppings made no sense. It felt like two or three dishes in one. Others' food didn't come out, so the manager came out and apologized and comped several meals. He even went up to the birthday boy and told him he'd comp his dessert as well. Thumbs up. 

Dessert was actually pretty good--I got the chocolate tuxedo mousse cake which was quite good and it seems everyone else enjoyed theirs as well. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is for service. Our waiter was personable and friendly, and the manager was excellent. I'd stay away from this garden like the plague, though."}
{"text":"Es sin duda una gran experiencia. Las porciones son muy grandes.  La relación precio/comida vale mucho la pena. No te pierdas de la sopa toscana, es cremosa y en su punto. 
Jamie la mesera ofrece un excelente servicio"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today with my husband and my sister  the food is excellent and the waiter too his nama is Steve he is a good waiter he did everything fast we are really happy for everything thanks olive garden and the  manager too , but next time Steve please give every body smile :)"}
{"text":"Went out with my aunt and uncle tonight and were served by Garrett. He is an excellent waiter, super friendly, and attentive. We really enjoyed talking to him and would definitely come back because of him...and the breadsticks."}
{"text":"Best place for a date night!!! Love it, great waiter service and nice but COLD seems always really really cold"}
{"text":"My family and I decided upon this location as it was central between our house and my parents. I won't comment to much on the food as, to be honest, it is an Olive Garden. Generally, everyone has been to one and the food is consistently ok. 

The decor and aesthetics were on point as it was in the style of a little Italian villa. Everything was clean and aroma of food pleasantly filled the room. We were placed in a nice booth that was kind of tucked away and it wasn't overly crowded. 

Our server was great and very attentive. Our drinks weren't empty for long and breadsticks were always refilled. The reason for the four stars however was my initial bowl soup (I did the unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks) was old and deeply yellowed. It also tasted bland. I know this for certain as when my server brought a new bowl she said \"Here, this should be much better. The last bowl was an older batch. This one is very fresh.\"

So, all and all, it was ok. Olive Garden is the McDonalds of the chain Italian restaurant. Doesn't matter which one you go to, you'll find everything to be very similar."}
{"text":"Every month our church group meets for lunch at different restaurants. This time we picked this location. BIG MISTAKE! The food wasn't bad, our waiter was doing his best to make up for the piss poor planning of their manager. I was hosting this months event and had contacted them for reservations. I had originally made the reservation (3 weeks ago) for 15-20 people to arrive at 11:30 am. I got there around 11:20 so that I would be there when everyone arrived. The greeters acted as if they knew nothing of our reservations. I mentioned that I had called 3 weeks earlier and placed the reservation, then called yesterday with the latest count we had. Both times I was told they would notify the manager. Evidently knowing of a reservation in advance doesn't mean anything to him. All other restaurants we've gone to in the past 15-20 years has had our seating ready in plenty of time for our arrival. This manager made it seem as if he constantly got groups arriving in smaller numbers than planned and wouldn't set up until most had arrived. I couldn't understand his worry for the area we eventually were seated in there were always 3-4 tables empty. As I said the food was good, and our waiter did a wonderful job. As for the management...   I think Olive Garden would be better off getting rid of him and hiring someone who cared about the business and was interested in making sure things went smoothly for his customers. Will we or I return, not on your life!!"}
{"text":"Bad service, dirty table.

We went for lunch 5/1/17. Told it would a 5 minute wait and got a buzzer. I went to the restroom (in less than 5 minutes). When I exited, I was puzzled to get a text from hubby telling me he was already seated. When I got to table he told me that when the buzzer rang, he told the hostess I was in the restroom and wanted to wait for me, but she just stood there and seemed impatient so he told her he'd just text me. She proceeded to bring him into the dining area, then pointed to a table further along, several tables away, and just said something like, \"the last one over there.\"  Didn't even bring him near the table. He sat at the indicated table and noticed the previous party's check was still there, and there were crumbs as it hadn't been cleaned. He said the server came over, saw it hadn't been cleared, looked slightly panicked, but instead of dealing with the situation (by say, moving him to a new table or wiping the table) instead reached across the table and tried to discreetly take the previous party's receipt holder. I showed up as she started taking his drink order. After I ordered a soda and she left, I noticed the crumbs and a hair on the table too. Then my husband told me the whole story of how he was treated and seated at the dirty table. When the server got back with his water and my soda, we told her we wanted to just pay for the soda and leave. She looked slightly alarmed, but did not ask us why or offer to call a manager. She did offer to give me the soda to go, which i declined. She got the bill for my soda. We paid and left to eat elsewhere.

People wonder why some of these casual chains are falling out favor. Well, this kind of service doesn't help. It would have just taken the barest amount of effort to make this an entirely different review."}
{"text":"I was blown away last night with the amazing service I got from my waitress Tiffany, it was her second day and you couldn't tell, she was beyond phenomenal. Always made sure my glass was full, said please and thank you ,very welcoming and just such a positive person and impact on my night there last night.. Keep up the good work girl!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Italian food for a good price. This is a good place to have a good meal, without breaking the bank. Quick service, fresh food and always busy. Busy is a good sign, A place thats always busy can't be bad, and the unwritten rule of restaurants, if they're busy, everything is always fresh since they keep going through everything. Nothing sits. Nearby is a small casino, and movie theater. Nice area to be."}
{"text":"We were told 15 minute wait.  We waited 1 hr.  We sat down I had to ask 3 times for them to bring salad and breadsticks.  Horrible service,  manager was supposed to come by and he never did."}
{"text":"This location offers everything you would expect from an Olive Garden in terms of menu and ambiance. The wait staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean.

However, service here is sometimes unbearably slow. I've had to send food back twice for cold pasta, which was disappointing. During promotional periods like the Neverending Pasta Bowl, the wait staff seems completely bogged down and unable to give all of their customers adequate attention.

It can be a wait here because of the proximity to shopping and Red Rock, so make a reservation to be safe, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Took my granddaughter there.   She had the spaghetti and meatballs and the minestrone and I had what I called the shrimp over pasta but is called \"shrimp scampi\" on the menu and by the server.   When she brought the minestrone, she asked if we wanted cheese.   We both said \"yes.\"  The minestrone was good, nothing spectacular, and could actually be a meal in itself since it is such a large serving.   It comes with warm garlicky, buttery breadsticks, which were quite tasty.   

By the time the entree came, I was FULL!  So I ate the shrimp and took the rest of it home.   It was \"okay,\" but actually tasted much better the next day cause the seasoning had time to \"set.\"  My granddaughter ate some of the spaghetti -- after fishing out the meatball and setting it aside -- and took that home as well.

It's not a bad place and was close to where we were -- We were at Scottsdale Center for the Arts earlier -- and my granddaughter likes their food, but would I go there myself?   I might. ..."}
{"text":"Please don't answer your phones with \"how can I provide you with excellent service\" if you're not going to do that. Jennifer C. Answered the phone and was very rude from the start, my friend is a vegetarian and I asked if they had a four cheese pasta she said they had a 5 cheese CD. I asked what it was like and she answered \"just like any other 5 cheese pasta\". There was several other things she said that were just plain rude. I love Olive Garden but it definitely ruins the experience when you get treated this way."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this olive garden... Service is always spotty at best...and now they have these machines on the table to order your food, pay for your food, and play games....not a fan....I go out to eat for the experience and talking with my friends and family.  The prices aren't bad but not worth it to me...love the bread sticks though!!"}
{"text":"Is it ever bad at an Olive Garden? Being from Hawaii, I make it a must eat place at least once while on the mainland.

This location was very clean and neat. Seating was no wait. It was just me (business trip) and I arrived at 5:30.

The service was excellent, the food was good and the portions were large. I had the calamari, stuffed mushrooms, the beef tortellini, and a pomegranate citrus acqua fresca.

Everything was delicious. That beef tortellini was OUTSTANDING. I had a ton of leftovers that I took in for lunch today and it was still just as good as the night before.

The pomegranate citrus acqua fresca came in a really tall glass. They need to consider serving that with a bendy straw. It was refreshing, but too bubbly for my taste. The sparkling water made me feel like I was all gassed up. Or was that the fried calamari? :)"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our experience tonight. We had a coupon for free meatballs for \"National Meatball Day\". The restaurant was not very busy but it took a while for our waiter to take our orders and for us to get our salads and breadsticks.   In fact, our hot meals came before we had finished our salads.  We had to ask for our meatballs since they weren't delivered with the meal.  Our waiter was not very attentive. In fact another waitress asked us if we needed more breadsticks or anything else.  We had to ask the same waitress to get our waiter in order to get our check and the \"take home\" portion of our meal.  Then when we got home we discovered that the meatballs were not deducted from our bill.  When my husband went back to have the bill corrected, the manager was not very apologetic.  She just refunded him his money and felt that was the end of that.  She did not inquire if everything else was OK with our time there."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Olive Garden but I have to give credit where credit is due. I had a gift card to OG for a year and was tired of seeing it in my wallet. I figured I would get a couple of desserts to go. I waked in and like all chains they were slammed. Young man behind counter immediately assisted me and took my order. Within 5 minutes he had taken the order, walked it to the back and brought up my desserts. Wow! Now for the food, I bought a chocolate mouse that was great, a strawberry cheesecake that was very good, and a tiramisu that was very, very average. Overall though I was impressed and surprised. Well done OG!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was well above average!  Her section was completely full and she handled it like a pro!  My Kim and I both had the soup and salad. I always ask for a bowl of Alfredo sauce because it is just amazing with the breadsticks!  I enjoyed two bowls of soup and then she packed up a bowl which was extra awesome!"}
{"text":"My server was extremely nice he even gave me extra Alfredo sauce to go. Although my raspberry passion fruit was super sweet but my classic lasagna was so good! I would recommend anybody to come here."}
{"text":"Came with the family on a Saturday night. The wait was not too long (20 mins) and the food was as expected at any Olive Garden across the U.S.  The Service however was mediocre to poor. Water glasses stayed empty for 5 minutes at a time and the food was slow to arrive.  The waiter needs to learn proper etiquette. He served my wife last in all instances.  Our food took forever to come out and the only positive about the wait time on the food was the fact that our kids got served first. Our food arrived a good half hour after that and we had to \"keep them entertained\" when our meals finally arrived. It's been a full ten minutes now since we have completely finished and if I can't get the waiter's attention so I can pay and leave, the rating and the tip will surely drop. Update:  I practically had to do jumping jacks to get the waiter's attention. My family left and it's been close to 20 minutes. I'm not coming to this OG again!"}
{"text":"This is Olive Garden and I knew what I was getting into when I suggested lunch here.  I knew Rand would be all over the all you can eat pasta and I was right.  The only thing I've ever liked at Olive Garden was the soup and salad and for 6.95 you get all that and breadsticks.  The zuppa tuscana soup had little flavor and the pasta fagioli which has always been my favorite was bland and tasteless.  Even the salad was rather sad, only 1 little piece of tomato and no cucumber.

The ledge of the booth had crumbs on it, and so did the windowsill.  There was scraps of paper on the floor under the table next to us.  Disappointing especially since were were the first table today.

Service was good but I don't think I'll be going back to an Olive Garden anytime soon."}
{"text":"Always enjoy it here! Food was great. I had the rosemary chicken, the lighter side of the menu. Love all the food here though. Our server was awesome too. We had a party of 14 & it was a good time. Food was on time and all the orders were correct. You can't go wrong with coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this Olive Garden for a celebration. We were seated immediately this is a late review. It was for my birthday which I celebrated that whole weekend. The waitress arrived at the table took our drink order asked for our id's which were fine. Now it was the ACTUAL DAY of my birthday okay. We placed a order for appetizers which arrived fairly quickly, after our drinks. Now here is where the problems start:
1) Dinner was not good at all, my carbonara was warm not hot,cheese and oil was coagulated ugh.
2) We had to ask for the check three times and they were not that busy.
3) Our check was $130.00 with everything we ordered. Was going to give $ 30.00 tip but because of crappy food and service very low tip given, and I ALWAYS tip good when I go out.
4) I was WEARING A \"Its MY BIRTHDAY BANNER\" and our waitress did not bring any birthday dish and no one sang, after we told her it was MY BIRTHDAY before our meals were delivered to our table.

Was so disappointed because had went to lunch about 2 weeks prior and had excellent food and service, but this time it SUCKED !!!"}
{"text":"This place gives u a good bang for your buck. They always have specials and I always have a to go bag highly recommend for friends and family"}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite restaurant and i like it as well it really never disappointed me the food is good the service is great."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit my brother, this is the one place he asks to go to over and over again.  The food is always delicious, the service always excellent.  We've tried everything from the herb grilled salmon to the stuffed rigatoni and have never been disappointed.  The only time my brother regretted his choice was when he ordered the meatball sandwich after eating way too many free breadsticks before our meal arrived!

I have never met anyone who didn't like Olive Garden's salad and those breadsticks. On this last visit we had the salad and soup combo -- as many bowls of different kinds of soup as you can handle.  The limit is usually two.  Chicken Gnocchi is our favorite, with Pasta e Fagioli a close second. (I must admit, I do not care for their minestrone soup.) 

The place has been busy for lunch when we've gone, but we were never ignored -- or lacking in breadsticks.  I highly recommend getting the Alfredo dipping sauce to go with them."}
{"text":"Another satisfying visit to the Olive Garden. The braised beef tortellini was delicious as usual though is it me or are the portions getting a little smaller? The shrimp linguini was also very good. Then of course there's the salad and breadsticks... but you didn't need me to point that out did you! :)"}
{"text":"First of all James M. Was probably one of the best and most sincerely interested servers we've ever had at any restaurant ever! We even complicated our order by requesting the beef from the braised beef tortellini entree (our usual) atop a bed of gnocchi instead of tortellini. Not only was this met with enthusiastic cooperation, the resulting entree was ok be of the best things we've ever enjoyed from Olive Garden. 

It doesn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Another satisfying Olive Garden experience. The server was extremely attentive, friendly, and FAST. We broke away from our usual braised beef tortellini for the new wine braised beef gnocchi. It was very good but the edge goes to the tortellini, as the wine reduction made the beef a little too sweet for our liking, verging almost on a BBQ sauce taste but not quite. The perfect variety for us would be the beef from the tortellini dish atop the gnocchi. We may try to order that next time."}
{"text":"The breadsticks were soft & warm with the right amount of garlic & salt, the salad was ok- they only gave me one pepperocini : ( and the tomatoes were a bit soggy, the zuppa toscana had a nice flavor, & my fried eggplant was decent. My cousin took a culinary class in Italy and she learned how to saute eggplant & wrap it around mozzarella cheese & cover it with sauce to make eggplant parmigiana. The flavor of the eggplant is much more pronounced this way- Olive Garden's taste is good, but all I could taste was the batter, I felt the thinly sliced eggplant inside, but there was no eggplant taste. The service was excellent, even though I wanted some more of the chocolate mints in the end *waaawaaa. I hadn't been to Olive Garden in a few years and I thought the prices had risen drastically for all of the entrees ($13 & up) and the rest of the menu- I didn't factor this into my rating, but for me its reason enough to wait another couple of years to go back or find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came in 20 min. before the store was closing after a 8 hour drive from SD, I wasn't sure if they'd serve us, I asked if we could just order something to go.  The host was very welcoming & insisted that they were still open & able to serve us dining in.  I was relieved as it had been a long day in the car & it was raining out.  We sat down, our order was taken, the food came fast & piping hot.  Our server was so sweet, in fact even the staff that wasn't serving us, greeted us & everyone was just so friendly.... maybe it was because it was almost time to go home... lol but regardless, everyone made it a very nice experience for 2 weary travelers."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch, our server was Renee. Renee was wonderful, very nice, helpful, fun to talk to...the list goes on!! I was feeling a little ill with a stomach ache and asked Renee if I could get some sprite and told her the reason, she said I have a better idea and brought me out soda water with a lemon slice in it...not as sweet as sprite, but am very much appreciative of her thoughtfulness!!! Will definitely be back!! 

Thank you Renee for taking care of us!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, but anything this delicious has got to be loaded with calories and not always on my Weight Watchers plan, but when I want some good Italian comfort food, there's no better place than The Olive Gardens and their salads are endless. YUM."}
{"text":"I have been going to this olive garden for more then 10 years and i love it! The service is always helpful and they always seat us asap. My family always goes to olive garden to unwind and the food is always amazing"}
{"text":"I had such a horrible experience here. They kept switching waiters and when the first waiter was \"suppose to go home\" he kept showing up. I feel like they lied to us. We had 4 different managers ask us if everything is ok but not in the \"what can i do for you\" but the \" hurry up and leave \" everyone at the table felt uncomfortable. It was my birthday dinner and they ruined it for me. It was only 4 of us at the restaurant and we did nothing wrong. I remember a particular manager came up to us asked if we needed anything in a horrible tone then half way when he was turning rolled his eyes FOR NO REASON. We are very nice people and wanted to enjoy a nice meal. We were not loud, we were not being rude, we gave a good tip but we still got treated like we were not welcomed. Never going there again. I will tell everyone i can about this horrible experience. I do not expect anyone to care about this review at this olive garden since they treated us like crap when we were giving them our money for terrible service."}
{"text":"Dillon was our server and he was excellent. I would request him if I went there again. I don't live here so will not be going back any time soon. It's Olive Garden, you know what you're going to get. If you've been to one..."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed the 12.95 entrees. Serving is huge. So youll get your money's worth. The only downside is this branch is bussssy. But yeah overall, good service, great timing of food, good food, reasonable prices. Try the roscato wine. I loooove that."}
{"text":"The food was okay but not for the price.  I'm certain if they made a few changes they would do better.  The service wasn't too great either.  Again, it could have just been select servers."}
{"text":"Love Olive Garden!  Salad, soup & breadsticks.  Most locations do very well, we just got a new waitress this time.  Had longer wait times on food, drinks & to-go box.  Doesn't happen very much."}
{"text":"I don't really like writing reviews on chain restaurants because really, who actually looks at chain restaurant reviews? Everything should be consistent across the board...? Service was good but my 2 main issues- why don't they ever put more dressing on the salad? I'm not one to have my salads swimming in salad dressing but I had to ask for extra salad dressing, twice. I got the shrimp scampi dinner meal. While I realize it is on the healthy eating list so the portion will be smaller, I got my food and wondered where the rest was. There were about 6 shrimp and a small portion of pasta. For $15.99!!!! What! How are they justifying the cost of this dish? I liked the ambiance of the restaurant, felt like you were in Italy.  All in all it was okay. I mean yeah I'll go back, it's Olive Garden. Like the McDonald's of the Italian world. ;)"}
{"text":"The prices keep going up, and the flavor keeps going down.  We used to go here as a family, but there are better places to go for the price.  Certainly don't think the food quality is a good value - and the service is pretty hit and miss."}
{"text":"Good times. The quality is always on par...staff was friendly and it's never too expensive. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience today. Found a super long hair mixed into my pasta today. Thank God I didn't take a bite yet. Totally burned me out on ever eating here again. We won't be back. 

The service was good , people were friendly.  Just the food was a no go."}
{"text":"Prefer other locations than going to this one due to there HORRIBLE customer service. Don't recommend !"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and the place is dead. More people working than eating still had to wait to sit down.  Salad and bread sticks 15 minute wait. Food even longer and it was off the quick lunch menu. No wonder no one is here. Hashtag never again."}
{"text":"Hi Sam (general manager) my name is Diane. I was a guest at your restaurant in the afternoon. I have to say I was quite disappointed at the service, and quality of the food. We are weekly guests at the Nellis Location and felt that we would receive the same or better service at your location. I would like to start by saying we were a party of 5. We weren't offered a wine sample, we were then greeted by Rumel. She went off to say what would you like to drink and stated she hoped we all had salad because it was easier for her. Once we gave her the drink order I explained that I was on short time that I needed my order to be put in along with our salad and drink order so it could all come out at the same time. She said ok and left. When she came back with our drink order our salad was not as ordered I asked her for the missing items and extra dressing. She then had to confirm our order, she stated she couldn't even read her own writing. We were never offered cheese the first or second time around. Then about 10 minutes went by and she noticed we were just sitting there with our plates full of salad she asked if everything was ok at this point I said well we need cheese, and refills on drinks please. That took another 5 minutes. After we were done with that our order was still not out. She then came out with a tray that had only 5 plates and out of that only 1 of them on that tray was ours. She stated that the \"manager\" was placing the food on the trays and they didn't know what they were doing. She then left again and about 10minutes later someone else comes out with 3 more of our plates. So we still have 1 person with no food. And guess who that one person was? Yes me the person that told her that had short time on her hands. So once it comes out again it is not how we had ordered it but since I had 15mins to eat I just ate 2 spoonfuls and boxed it up. Should I say again no one was offered cheese once again. When she noticed that I was irritated by the whole ordeal she offered me a drink to go and said I could pay on the machine on the table. She walked away and didn't see her again. So we paid and of course didn't receive any mints or was checked on again. I am so surprised this even happened to us and I had no chance to talk to a manager or even yourself! That is the reason why I called you as soon as I left the restaurant. I am very very disappointed and if this happened to us at a \"green valley\" location.  And for the record have not heard from you since I left the message."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's Olive Garden! An Italian franchise restaurant. Quick friendly service. We enjoyed our lunch."}
{"text":"I really like that I can order catering without it saving to be 24 hours in advance. The food was good. The only reason why I am not leaving 5 stars is because the food was not completely ready when I got there. Other than that the service is good, the staff is really friendly & the food is great."}
{"text":"The server was outstanding for the six of us. Three of us had tour if Italy which you can't go wrong with. The dining fare was excellent. No complaints."}
{"text":"Not the best Olive Garden. I prefer the one in Henderson. The lady ordered a virgin daiquiri and it had liquor in it. It was the first time she ever tasted liquor in her life. One of the waiters had an attitude. After tonight I think women are more suited to be restaurant servers. Food was just OK not very hot."}
{"text":"Olive Garden, you have always been average, but the last two visits have even subpar.

The always have soup, salad, and breadsticks. I just really like their soup, and it's generally a decent deal.

They have taken it off the menu! But, alas, it is still available. I wish, though, that they would use a higher quality lettuce and go easy on the salad dressing, or put it on the side. 

In regards to service, the server was not at all on top d his game. He was nice enough, probably in high school or his freshman year in college, but he was bad.

The manager, a dark haired gentleman, probably late 20s and spiky hair, asked the other 3 tables surrounding us how their dining experience was, but not us. I guess he didn't care how our experience was.

Well, Olive Garden, thank you for confirming, again, why I shouldn't deposit my money at your average food/subpar service center."}
{"text":"Horrible service from the min we walked in we had like three different servers, the ran out of ravioli and my sister ordered a shrimp with the pasta and the pasta was over cooked and soggy experience wasn't pleasant you think Olive Garden would give their customers a good experience"}
{"text":"This place is in the middle of nowhere. I only say this because I live in N. Phx and my niece wanted to come here for her 18th birthday. Since she lives close by so its nothing for her, but I swear I am going to make her mom give me gas money lol.  I will say that the everything went  pretty well. We had a super large party of about 35 people and we did have a reservation so score one for them!  I can't even be upset with them for taking forever to bring our checks since they decided to split it up instead of giving one big check and making us work it out amongst ourselves. It did take longer than the average due to this but I will give them credit for doing a stand up job with taking orders and getting them out in a timely fashion. Although some checks were wrong, everyone was very patient (some more than others but I digress) I highly doubt that I will ever be back to this location again due to the distance but I do give them two thumbs up for service."}
{"text":"Much better than in past years. We had previously sworn off this place after a profoundly mediocre experience a few years back. Blah food, no real garnish, breadsticks that were salty and flavorless. 

I'm happy to say that Olive Garden seems to have redeemed itself. The breadsticks and salad taste like breadsticks and salad. They're now doing a 2 for 1 dinner special where you get one order of food at the restaurant and another full order packed in a to-go box. I opted for alfredo on site, and cheese ravioli to go. Happily, both were excellent. The alfredo sauce was garlicky and the pasta was cooked correctly. It even managed to stand up to microwaving the next day. The ravioli fared great and was delicious the next day as well.

The place was busy on a Saturday night, but the service was efficient and they looked to be holding up just fine. This place was LOUD though."}
{"text":"Ate dinner tonight service was great food was great perfect 
Until the booth behind us we noticed they had a small dog a dog in the restaurant sitting on the floor not a seeing eye dog and once in a while dog would bark why is there a dog in a restaurant hummm ????"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch with my bf. It was a pretty average experience. They recently renovated and it looks nice inside-- love the waiting area. 

We each ordered fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. I order the salad and he went with wedding soup. Our meals were OK. The salad and bread sticks were good as always but i found the wedding soup to be pretty basic. 

Our server was very kind and friendly but disappeared after our food was delivered. It wasn't a huge deal but we did want to get more bread sticks and then towards the end we needed a box. 

Average experience. I know people love to hate on OG but we don't mind it :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in to use up a gift card the other day. We each went with their dinner special which is an entrée of pasta and you can add chicken, meatballs ect for an additional charge. The meal is about $12 before add ons. It comes with salad and breadsticks (obvi), entrée plus a mini dessert.

I went to angel hair, garlic wine sauce and chicken. The pasta was extremely dry and hardly had any sauce on it at all. For dessert I went with the chocolate mousse... amazing. 

My bf went with angel hair, alfredo sauce and meatballs. His dessert was the caramel one. 

Meal and service were good.

I took a star off because our server and a hostess were talking crap about a busser. It was upsetting to see and hear, especially bc they were both young and he was older (probably his second shift at a second job)"}
{"text":"I LOVE OLIVE GARDEN! I would give you guys five stars but you guys discontinued my chicken alfredo pizza. Please bring it back..."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is always a good place to come if your in the mood for pasta. Especially if you want soup, salad, and breadsticks. The service here is really great and they're usually pretty fast with getting you a table. I defiantly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant it is one of my favorites.  I have to be very careful especially with pasta due to diabetes.  I was there twice in the last 3 weeks.  The first time the all you eat salad was like it was laying around for hours, very soggy.  I ate it anyway (my bad, should have said something I know they would make it right).  I do like their new Ziosk on the table, you can order right there, call your server and pay your bill all at once.  That is definitely a big plus for me!  The second time was last week.  Had the chicken flatbread and the minestrone soup.  Cant go wrong with any of their soup.  Hot and tasty in any season.  All in all I will be back to any of their restaurants."}
{"text":"When I need a quick bite or a regular meal, I choose Olive Garden.  This day I had wanted to try their breadstick sandwiches.  This new offering is absolutely the bomb!  They are paired with fresh made garlic Parmesan fries and of course the ever present all you can eat salad.  My salad was crisp and fresh.  I sat in the bar area.  I had meatball, perfect size, flavorful and saucy.  I cant say that I have had a bad meal at Olive Garden at all.  I even had them cater an event for me that was equally awesome! So always love Olive Garden.  For a chain one of the absolute best!"}
{"text":"The place was packed when we stopped by for a good Italian meal, and we were not at all disappointed! The waiters were friendly and we were treated well.

Who doesn't love unlimited soup/salad and bread-sticks? It pretty much fills you up even before the entrees are brought to the table! So beware!

The chicken dumpling soup was hot and delicious. As far as the entrees go, the chicken was tender and juicy (goes really well with the angel-hair pasta). The spicy shrimp was kind of bland (although a featured item on the menu!).

Overall, it was great. Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I normally love OG, but after last night, this place will not see me again.
It was busy and we didn't mind waiting the 30 min for a party of 5. After sitting there 20 min, 6 young girls showed up. All of a sudden after a couple minutes, they get seated after they went in a 2nd time. We thought that was kind of odd. Well we been watching this whole thing to find out, the host is telling all those young people to check in thru their phone for faster seating. That pissed me off. We were sitting there with a 7 and 8 year old that were hungry and the young kids that come in get extra fast treatment. Then our buzzer goes off and they want to sit 5 of us on a 4 seat table. You have to be kidding me, we don't fit on a 4 top! If I spend my $ I want to compftable sit at my table and not being squished! Then they tell us we have to wait another 10 min because they messed up the seating and gave the table away to someone else. Maybe you should train your hostesses better. 
I wish this would be the only issue, but to our bad, the calamari was not like usual, they must have changes supplier. And they also were not cooked long enough. 
They also must have changed the chicken scampi receipe, it sure didn't taste like usual or the kitchen just can't cook when it's busy.
Well you lost a family of 5 that used to love OG."}
{"text":"We just came in for an early dinner around 4:20pm, both hostesses greeted us and sat us immediately then told us our server \"M\" will be right with us. As we checked out the menu and their new little computer gadget on the table, I looked up and realized another table after us was already getting served their soup and salad... About 5-10 minutes had passed and even with our \"call server\" button blinking, nobody came, so I decided to walk up to the front and asked the hostess ( manager was standing about 8 ft away) if we had a server because another table has already been greeted and started to get their food. She apologized and went to go look for her, a few seconds later the blonde hostess decided to just get our whole order since our server was busy or couldn't be found, we thanked her. A few moments later our server popped her head around the corner and asked if our drink orders had been taken, didn't introduce herself or apologize for the wait or even really come to our table... She then dropped off our soup and salad, my boyfriend asked her to grab red pepper if she had time, and apparently she didn't because he never got it, even with his second soup. Our food came out super quick, which was nice since I was starving, then not even 5 minutes later our buy one get one meal came out too.. Felt a bit rushed, but proceeded to check the bag to make sure our to go meals were correct, one wasn't. I let our server know one was incorrect and she swapped it out..
While working on my meal I was still munching on my salad, breadsticks and a bit of my boyfriends soup, our server came up and started taking away all of our plates... Awesome on pre bussing! But she never asked if I was finished and just took them away, she seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out so I didn't even say anything..
Our drink was low and wanted another one eventhough the drink had no free refills, and we wanted dessert as well but our server never asked and just dropped off the check.. Atleast she asked if I needed a box for my meal I didn't finish...

Downfalls were.. 
Lack of real service from our server.
Management never even came over when he had plenty of opportunities to see how things were going or to appologize.
After a mess up like that don't dodge your table, you should be trying to make it up.
Rushing us out even though we were super polite was kind of rude.

Only reason why I even gave 2 stars to this location was due to the the blonde hostess that stepped in to take our whole order, eventhough we can tell she was irritated, whether with us or the server I don't know, but I know she stepped in as soon as she knew we weren't satisfied customers. We also thanked her again on the way out and she apologized to us once again.

And another reason why I gave them two stars was because of another server who was attending to the other tables around us, when our \"call server\" button was blinking for a second time, she was the only one who helped us after 2 other servers had walked passed.. And she helped me take a charge off of our tab that I screwed up on ( on the table gadget under games don't hit continue to play unlimited games unless you read the bottom first, where it says cancel $1.99 charge lol stupid me)"}
{"text":"We had the smoked mozzarella chicken with ziti, it was delicious, chicken parmigiana was great and seafood Alfredo was great as well.  The service was good and we were seated fairly quick, even though it was a little full. Our server Ray was great, quick and very attentive, as well as fast. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came for dinner today with my husband and 1 year old. Our wait time was 5 minutes and our server JUAN C. was very attentive.
We ordered ...
Peach tea (super delicious) and with Juan our glass was never empty
Two item sampler - Mozarella sticks and fried Calamari, both were great.
My husband Had the Tour of Italy, everything was cooked well and was delicious.
I had the Chicken Alfredo, first time chicken was rubbery, Juan took care of that and within 5 minutes I had a NEW plate. Chicken was juicy and delicious. MANAGER SHELLY checked on us to make sure everything was good. 
I would have given them 4 stars with the rubbery chicken but honestly they handled the situation fast and with no problems they get the star back. EXCELLENT SERVICE."}
{"text":"Apparently there is a shortage of lettuce and bread sticks at this Olive Garden...the salad was less than half the regular size and only 3 bread sticks for 2 people...I'm all for portions but this was kinda funny :)"}
{"text":"The salad plates were not chilled... As they usually are it however is a busy night but something's are expected at the olive garden... The food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood... Not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected... The expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do...."}
{"text":"We made online reservations which I highly recommend as the wait time would have been 40-60 minutes!!!

Our server was fast & friendly!  The food was tasty!  

Downfall:  the Manager in Training did not help her staff when she saw multiple tables requesting help.  She just walked by and ignores the patrons.

Downfall #2:  the acoustics were horrific!  You cant hear people at your own table.  

Best secret tip:  if someone is getting endless salad --- order a side dish of anything but salad so you can table share! 

I would go back -- I would just be more selective about the time frames so I could converse with my peeps."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could, awful customer service. We get there around 3:10pm order our food. Salad came 20 minutes later.  When the salad came there were no breadsticks. They eventually came 5 minutes later.  Everyone around us came and were seated almost 20 minutes later and had gotten there good before us. At 4:00pm we were finally given our food.  I had ordered a 6 oz. Sirloin medium,  I received a well done. The alfredo sauce was bland without flavor.  Overall upset with the service."}
{"text":"We had the BEST service from Christopher!  He was very personable, patient and joyful.  More servers should take a lesson from him.  But honestly, all of the employees that we came in contact with this evening, were very pleasant.  Oh! And the bartender with the long hair and beard was super nice too!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This location USED to be Awesome but has really went down hill the past 2 Years. I always get the tour of Italy and my kids love the Alfredo. The last couple of times we have had Olive Garden at this location it has not been great, not even good. I ordered our food to go the last 2 times because eating in was not worth it the past few times before so why sit and wait for an hour to be seated, get horrible service, cold food and smaller portions than usual when I can just go home and enjoy it. Well that was my thinking anyway. This last  time the food was ice cold when we got home. We only live 7 min away. We had to wait for it even after I called it in and was told 20 min. We got there 25 min later but had to wait another 10min. So it should have been piping hot. The alfredo was super dry with only about a tablespoon of sauce. This has got to be my biggest complaint the past few times. It's like they are so scared to put sauce on the noodles. If I wanted plain noodles I would just cook some at home. I really love Olive Gardens food but lately I have been very disappointed. I wouldn't waste my money here. The quality of food and service has went from a 10 to a 2 in my book."}
{"text":"Always a satisfaction to your tummy! Fresh bread with alfredo dip. Creamy soups. Shrimp pastas. Yum! Dessert is just okay, but everything else is always delicious. I've always appreciated this corporate/big chain restaurant. Olive Garden changes up some deals for their menu like \"all you can eat pasta\" & whatnot. It's a simple date or family night location. The food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"This place is a well oiled machine. I haven't been to one of these in several years, but it's not hard to see why they are so popular: service is quick and friendly, ambiance is nice, and food is a great value.

My wife and i walked in and had what turned out to be a 15 minute wait. No problem: sat at the bar and asked for wine and some fried risotto and were promptly obliged. Did i mind that the sauce tasted like Ragu? Not at all considering we paid $7 for the deal.

We did not order it, but a special part of the menu offers 'buy one take one home' as an option... something an italian place could only pull off, probably (i think Maggianos does this too) and a great value. Also, unlimited breadsticks and soup/salad with an entree... In any other restautant, it would seem like they are just asking to lose money. I suppose the economies being realized with the vast and powerful Olive Garden chain allows them to get away with this. 

Basically you will love every part about the OG if you weigh everything you are getting with what you paid for it: nothing's great... but it's all great for the money."}
{"text":"Come here a lot. Love the tilapia which my mom order. My sister have the steak gorgonzola and she love it. I like my berry freshca. The food is great. But the service is bad. Usually the service is the best here. But this time it is horrible. The guy doesn't even care. He let us wait and never come by and ask how we are. I know they are busy but we never ask for anything. Even when he bring put the dishes, he just shove it to our face while talk to the others. Wow what a nice service attitude?"}
{"text":"This place was always great in the past but my recent visit there sucked! The waiter was ABSOLUTELY horrible! I asked him 4 times for refills, asked him several times for more breadsticks, for silverware, and i never got any! I had to go and take the silverware from another table. Had to go find someone for a refill and for the breadsticks and STILL never got those breadsticks! and everrrrrryone who knows and goes there, knows its all about them breadsticks!
Then to make matters worse, we asked for the bill....HE NEVER brought it! so we just got up  and went to the front and asked them for it and then he had the nerve to get upset at us because we didn't leave a tip and we complained! so sad, but the scottsdale location down on Osborn and Scottsdale rd is not a great experience, at least not anymore"}
{"text":"It's been over a month & I can not remember the servers name unfortunately. We arrived late on a Sunday evening on our way home from Minneapolis.  After checking into our hotel we were pleasantly surprised the restaurant was still seating.

We walked in and while there was no hostess a really great brunette server welcomed us and sat us in her section that was immediately left of the bar area & first booth on the left. 

We ordered the salad which is pretty much a given drenched with dressing.  We asked if we could just get a piece of grilled chicken and al dente veggies our waitress said she would check. We never ask for special orders unless its clear that similar options are on the menu. She brought out a chef to hear what we wanted. We were blown away. She cared so much about getting the order right she got a chef out there. To his credit he rocked it. YUM! Grilled chicken & lightly cooked veggies were perfect. We asked our waitress to please let him know how much we appreciated his efforts & how good they were."}
{"text":"MY WAITRESS WAS AMAZING!!! Her name was ALLYSON. I would ask for her if you have the opportunity and she was the waitress on shift. 

This definitely started off as a bad experience. We called at 5:50pm and told them we wanted to come in around 6:30pm and wanted to make a reservation for 6. The hostess on the phone informed me that there was no need to call ahead. We again mentioned that it is a party of 6. She said they are so slow that we don't need it. OKAY!

We get to the parking lot at 6:30pm and it is packed!!!!! We were a little confused because what we were told earlier. Once we got inside we were told we would have a 40 minute wait. I was pissed because the lady on the phone insisted that we do not need a reservation and here we are stuck waiting. We wanted to talk to the manager, who never came. However after 5 minutes a party of 7 failed to show up and we were given their table. This made sense, we appreciated it.

Thereafter, we did the endless pasta for 9 bucks and the soup/salads. Its an olive garden. The food was really good it was nice and warm so thats always a plus. The breadsticks were extremely fresh and flavorful among the best I had. The waitress was attentive but not to much! Our drinks and food were prompt, she came around enough, extremely nice. She made the experience that began negatively a whole lot better. Had we had a horrible waitress the place would have gotten maybe 2 stars.

ALLYSON IS AMAZING =] truly a pleasure!"}
{"text":"Awesome caramel iced coffee. The caramel doesn't overpower the original coffee flavour. The ravioli di portobello is full of flavour! This was on all you can eat pasta night, so service was slower than normal, but still quite nice."}
{"text":"Well, never did I imagine I would be writing a negative review for Olive Garden, but I am today. I visited this particular location, which I have done many times in the past, on Monday. Our waitress said she had not been to work in two weeks and that the kitchen staff was all new. This was her first excuse of the time it took us to get our food. 

Secondly, we ordered three large orders of the Alfredo Dipping Sauce, that alone was $18, the biggest issue I had with that was that it was served in a bowl and there was only about 1/4\" high of the sauce in all theee bowls. I Lentine's something to my husband as I thought that was ridiculous, and he said not to say anything. However our waitress must have heard me and she said that they are preparing more and would bring out more sauce as soon as it was ready. I thought, great. However 5-10 minutes later, yes, we got three more bowls with the same amount of sauce. 

Moving on to dinner. I had the five cheese baked pasta. When my dish was served, it only had the Parmesan cheese on the top, no baked cheeses, which I specifically asked about when I ordered.  

I think I may be going on too long here, so quick finish is that the lasagna could only be eaten on the top layers, as the bottom was burnt and rubbery. The shrimp and pasta - bad !"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I just came from the Goodyear location.  Was asked if we wanted more bread, which we didn't get. Also, no refills were offered on tea. I noticed our server was stretched thin so I thought \"no biggie\".  However, my main complaint is based on what I witnessed. We were in a booth within a couple of feet of the wine station. I know a little bit about wine...tend to try and enjoy a wide variety so I am well informed.  A server for another table poured 2 half glasses of the standard merlot Robert Mondovi. then took 2 more glasses and poured just a quarter in each of Cavit merlot.  Im studying her trying to figure out what she was doing.  Then, taking me by surprise, the Cavit wine was poured into the Robert Mondovi glasses, making them full servable portions and then they went to the awaiting patrons.  Im beside myself.  I now question every and any establishment I have ever dined. I am for sure not choosing this particular location again."}
{"text":"What is there to say?  Hard to feel compelled to write for a large chain restaurant, as they can really be hit or miss.  This location is always busy when I've dropped by, which is puzzling, as the food is only ok.  Maybe there's just not that many choices in the area.  The staff is plenty friendly, but the place is so busy, it is easy for them to overlook or forget you for little things like refilling drinks or even getting our utensils before the food is served.  Again, I don't feel like it's the staff's fault.  But if you have other choices, I would exercise them."}
{"text":"Josh is an AMAZING server!!!!!  We will request him when we go back.  Food, as always, was on point- fresh, flavorful and large in portion.  Josh was sure to keep the drinks, salad and bread full at all times."}
{"text":"We always do take-out from here when we're too busy to cook. They've always been very helpful when we arrive for the pick-up, almost always at the time they say, and the food has always been great! They never forget anything and they are just all around helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location a couple times and am never disappointed. Greeted and seated right away even with a busy lobby. Friendly and attentive service all times I have been. Portions are decently sized. Minestrone is always on point and my favorite! Whenever I'm craving it this is why we end up here, or my boyfriend craving the chicken alfredo. I never stray away from the popular/main pasta dishes so those are this dishes I would recommend as I don't feel you would get a phenomenal chicken parm or salmon dish here. Conveniently located right across from Red Rock. We always have a difficult time finding parking, the lot is always full."}
{"text":"I really want to give our Olive Garden 5 stars. We've been going there for over 20 years. We have always been served food of a consistent quality which is key. We understand it's a chain and not gourmet so it meets our expectations but we have noticed over the years that the quality of their service is slipping and the interior has become worn and tired. It's getting a funny smell from the old carpet and decor fabrics. Dining room is desperately in need of a renovation and deep cleaning."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Marsala...pretty bland. I've had better at Olive Garden. Everything was fair!"}
{"text":"Maureen went above and beyond as our server! She was so attentive and very friendly. We don't usually go to Olive Garden but after our experience tonight we will definitely be returning!! She should train other servers, she is exceptional. Food was great too!!"}
{"text":"I placed an online order because I have a special needs child. It's easier to get take out then risk a melt down in the restaurant. My son and I arrived at 5:55, at 6:15 I asked for how much longer the wait was. If it was short then I would try to keep my son calm or if it will be long just refund me my money. They told me not much longer. 20 minutes later the manager came out and said the order was being bagged up. My son was distressed and I told her I could not wait much longer. We waited 20 minutes after that conversation! She brought my food out and comped one dish. I was trying not to melt down myself and just walked out. Note to anyone ordering take out DON'T!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here on a Tuesday night for my moms birthday. It was not busy at all, it was Halloween. The place has a nice atmosphere and is very clean with friendly staff.
Our waitress was awesome! She was on the ball with everything. We didn't have to ask, she already knew! Great service. I got the pick two app with the Parmesan crusted zucchini and calamari. Zucchini was good and tender and the calamari was nice and tender too. I wasn't a big fan of the breading but I'm just glad the calamari wasn't chewy. Salad and bread sticks are always good but just a good block to your meal. I always fill up on salad and breadsticks
I got a special the citrus salmon pasta. Salmon was very good with a citrusy glaze. It was cooked perfectly and not dry! Hallelujah! The pasta had a citrus Alfredo sauce. I'm not a big fan of Alfredo but it was good. I was too full and only had a few bites. 
My family all enjoyed their meals and really appreciated the service. I don't usually come here by choice since I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants. It is good food though. I'll be back when my family wants to come back and will be at ease to know I will receive good food and service."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Olive Garden for years. I never have a bad experience. The parking lot can be scary at first because it is usually packed and you might think that it will take forever to get a spot inside but they know how to keep things moving along. We went on a Sunday night around Dinner time and only waited 5 minutes. Sometimes it does take a bit longer but when people know good food they flock to it!
We started out with salad which I honestly can never get enough of! 
They were having the \"Never Ending Pasta Bowl\" on this visit. I chose \"Angel Hair with 5 Cheese Marinara\" and the sauce was just delicious!  I think I found my new favorite sauce :) It's not authentic Italian food, but there's just something about it. I usually rate 4 stars for OG, but this location just always goes above and beyond anything I'd ever expect from an Olive Garden!

Our server was excellent. He was always checking on us and never let the bread basket go empty for long. When it came time to pay for our bill we each had pasta left and he brought us more sauce to put on top and even put a couple sausage links on top and then packed it to go for us along with some bread sticks. I left full and fulfilled!"}
{"text":"I only ever go to this Olive Garden when I have a gift card. The couple of times I ate inside the service was terrible and too many things went wrong to mention. I did bring it up to the manger. I decided from then on out I would only use the curbside to go and only like I mentioned, if I have a gift card.

I decided to get the \"Soup, Salad & Bread Sticks\" deal and a side of the \"Alfredo Dipping Sauce\". I found the curbside parking and waited. And waited. And waited. I know it doesn't take that damn long to ladle some soup in a bowl, gather some bread sticks and container me some of that store bought salad mix. So, I got my food and headed home. I thought the salad looked yummy but it didn't taste yummy. The soup was good though. I loved the bread sticks and alfredo sauce. I just wish for $3.75 they weren't so stingy with it! They give you this cup that could clearly hold decent amount yet they put like a little layer in it.

The curbside is convenient if they can bring your food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I've been to a few olive gardens. We went as a group to have lunch. The whole staff was over the top trying to be nice and we really didn't have to wait for anything. They filled out drinks many times. Never had to ask. I was impressed with the service. The food was average as I have experienced in the past. I think a great place to go for lunch and get back to work. They gave us our food quickly and we had time to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Food is horrible there! My family of 28 went here for a special occasion and they were simply rude. It was an 3 hour wait. When we hit the 2 hour mark i ask how much more time and the hostess said in a rude manner\"you've waited 2 hours so you have 1 more\". I understand that since we are a huge party that the wait would be long, but come on 3 hours. We usually go anywhere else and it's 1 hour max. Idk maybe it was just a bad & really busy day."}
{"text":"Mediocre food for dirt cheap prices great if you're going out to get s*** house drunk. Close to all sorts of other places to get that done. This location can be very busy so try to avoid weekends and after work dinner times if you are super hungry."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on homecoming night. It was super busy and had to wait 45 minutes. But our server was wonderful!! He brought extra bread sticks to our table when we told him we loved bread sticks. Despite the busy restaurant he made sure we had everything we needed and our food was just right! Jamell is a great server and did a wonderful job under hectic circumstances! Thank You!"}
{"text":"Service was ok but could be better if the server was a bit more efficent as well as proactive in making sure we were ok on drinks as well as how the food was."}
{"text":"As usual, Olive Garden is always jam packed with people on the weekends! It's a good thing the servers and hosts were friendly and nice. The ambience was speedy and loud since we weren't placed in our usual spot in a separate room. We had to cram a party of 12 in the middle of the hallway. This month's 2 for $25 deal isn't so bad. However, the \"appetizer\" is just soup or salad and you can get that with any entree. You're pretty much getting a free dessert and one discounted entree. The choices are delicious though!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the service I received at this Olive Garden. We were sat with a young man named Dean who gave excellent table service, he was great! Despite the fact he was triple seated, he managed to get our food and drinks out quickly. His personality was awesome, and it just made the whole experience EVEN better! The general manager Lynn is very friendly as well, ask for Dean when coming here. By far the best server I have ever had! I'll be coming back to this Olive Garden for sure. The food was delicious; absolutely no complaints. Try the Raviolis they are soo good. And the strawberry lemonade!"}
{"text":"Hostess are not the mostess here.  We usually try to go to local restaurants, but we were starving and saw a sign for OG. We noticed people outside waiting so knew there would be a wait. When my fiancé asked the hostess (there were 3) how long the wait is they didn't even bother looking up at him and answer \"25 or 35 minutes\" ...which I'm sure is normal during a dinner rush. Anyway they must have thought that would make us leave because they just let us stand there.  It was a bit awkward....so we stand there,  they aren't looking at us, asking our name,  etc....so we just left.  It felt like we were bothering them by wanting a table vs a local restaurant where they would have been happy to have another customer and a steady influx of people choosing your place over others."}
{"text":"I'm blown away with how good my experience was here. It was my first time at Olive Garden, but it won't be my last. Pegah was our server, and she was incredibly attentive and made sure our table was happy. Everything was brought out promptly, and best of all, they keep the breadsticks coming-which, you don't even really need because the dishes are almost too much food. Seriously, I left stuffed. I tried the \"create-your-own\" pasta dish and it was a great value. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Always busy and usually end up sitting at the bar. I was disappointed the last time we sat there because the bartenders and staff were complaining about their jobs. One even went so far as to complain/engage in conversation with patrons.  I find this to be rude, unprofessional and to take away from the meal. No complaints with the food but I suggest that the management staff take a look at either increasing morale or getting a hold of their workers."}
{"text":"My fiance & I are very very pleased with the OUTSTANDING customer service our waitress \"Veronica\" & Manager Amy gave me.
I signed up for the Olive Garden Email club Online & I received 2 coupons one for a free appetizer or dessert & another one for a free dessert for my birthday
Well I didn't know there was an expiration date on both of them but I explained the situation to the manager Amy, being that this was my first time to this Olive Garden & I never been in this situation before I'm so happy to say I found my home Olive Garden I'm very very happy and my fiance & I will be coming back more often
This is my dessert that Veronica did for my birthday how sweet & creative is this?
Thank u Olive Garden
You'll are the best"}
{"text":"First time and last time I go to this location of Olive Garden, customer service is under the ground! I made an order online and it was supposed to be car side pick up, and I had to go inside after 15 minutes of waiting because whenever I called, someone would pick up and hang up on me! I complain for the delay and as usual they apologize. And management offered an apology as if that would solve the problem. After finally they have my order I notice that something was missing that i paid for. I told the server and he walked to sweep me out right away. Then we I get home I noticed that there was no Parmesan cheese, no forks or chocolate as other locations put in your order! I believe that first priority should be customer service. Horrible experience!"}
{"text":"I did the online to go ordering last night and let me tell you, it was a waste. I arrived about 10 minutes after the site said it would be ready. I still had to wait another 20 minutes. They weren't even crowded. Finally got my meal home and it was cold. I live 10 minutes if that away. I asked for no olives in my salad. Instead I got olives and no peppers. I like the peppers. My calamari was ok but cold. I asked for extra sauce with my meal( Chicken Scampi) and did not receive it. My meal also lacked sauce that was supposed to be on it. Very dry. I only had two bites and in he trash it went. Even if I heated it up, it was dry. I could almost understand if I hadn't waited an extra 20 minutes for my meal. So rally, it was 30 minutes past the time I was told. How do you wait that long for cold food? Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"After watching the commercial on tv, with the whole tour of Italy for $12.99, I decided to come here.  I got the lasagna, ravioli, and the spaghetti with meat sauce.  After I ate the salad and breadstick, I was able to finish a quarter of my lasagna and had the rest to go.  It was just so filling and so much food.  I ended up throwing the food away because it was just oo heavy.

Service was good.  There was no wait on a Saturday night.  I rate this place 3.5."}
{"text":"Very pleased with my experience here. It was very busy, so there was a bit of a wait for our table. We were a dining party of four.
I ordered an appetizer, as I hadn't had lunch and needed to eat. However, I guess our server misunderstood and waited to bring my appetizer out with the others' meals. He was so busy that he didn't stop by so I could tell him. Oh well, I ate some bread sticks. Not what I wanted to do, but I made do.
My appetizer came out and it was delicious. It was the fried lasagne. However, the server said it was \"overdone,\" so he brought another one out. It was very kind and I ended up taking the second one home. 
Everyone was pleased with their meals. Our server was very friendly, but a little overly busy (yes, it was busy...I understand!)"}
{"text":"Went in for their \"Buy One, Take One\" promotion and let me say its a flippin joke! They use the cheapest, most rubbery pasta they can find. Definitely not the same pasta/ingredients used for dishes on the regular menu. Couldn't believe how tasteless my food was, and afraid to eat my \"take home\" dish. 

Nonetheless, this restaurant is nearest to my home and is usually delish."}
{"text":"Went back..ordered five cheese al forno.  it came out swimming in sauce like soup!! They brought out two bowls of plain pasta for us to add to dish.  the comment made was..now you have more to tske home as if that compensated.  not a great dinner..dining out experience.  i guess if u r looking for a bad meal but free leftovers..youll be happy."}
{"text":"Had cheese ravioli...very tasty.  Just learned they have lowfat italian dressing ...wish I'd known sooner as 30 calories per tbsp is much better than over 100 calories for sane amt.  And it was good. 
All in all .very good meal and great service in the bar area."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but the head hostess April was rude to most customers and gave dirty looks to pretty much everyone. Good food, came out quick, but the server took almost 20 minutes to bring check on just an averagely busy day."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to OG Friday night for dinner. Our waitress was superb. My wife and I both had soup and salad. The salad and breadsticks were really good as usual. The soup seemed watered down and not up to the OG standard we have enjoyed in the past. I hope it was just an off night and not a cost cutting move to water down the soup."}
{"text":"A - List. Rating 3.5 to 4. Great food, lively atmosphere, good service. I have been to this location several times. The quality of food is consistent. The place is always busy (expect to wait; they do not take reservations). The service is hit or miss. The menu is interesting and there is something for most everyone. I have not experienced the issues others have reported here. There must be a reason people keep coming back and lining up for?"}
{"text":"I feel like Olive Garden is a go-to spot if you're craving \"Italian\" food. I've been to many different locations around the valley and this one is my favorite. While the service isn't great every time, once you find that great waiter or waitress...make sure to request them! Our favorite is Travis. He's attentive, but not over bearing. He's quick, friendly, and he's also incredibly good looking...so that helps. Even on a busy Friday night, he never spent too much time away from our table. Drinks were always filled, he checked on us every 10 minutes or so. The food took a little long to come out, but it was Friday night. Thanks for being awesome, Travis!

The food is always consistently the same. It's not SPECTACULAR, but it's good enough to go back when you're craving their addicting breadsticks. Overall, I really enjoy coming to this location when I'm craving pasta."}
{"text":"Came out for an last minute lunch with my guy before heading into work today and this was on the way. We had soup salad and breadsticks ya know the norm for an olive garden lunch as well as the Mediterranean flatbread. Everything was unexpectedly delicious for such a large chain.  The flatbread had a very generous amount of toppings peppers artichokes and olives and the bread sticks were super fresh and the minestrone soup was loaded with veggies beans and noodles. The salad was good as always they really do have tasty dressing. 

The service was great we sat at the bar as we mostly do wherever we go. She was super attentive we wanted for nothing and everything came out quickly and there was no wait even given the busyness of the lunch hour. 

Plenty of parking and easily accessible being in front of the Carolina place mall. They are great for groups and kids lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I drive by this Olive Garden countless times a day and I always think to myself \"one of these days I am going to try it.\" After all, I always hear about the bottomless salad and breadsticks.  

So, yesterday, along with the lovely Farrah A, I decided to do just that... we went to a late lunch at Olive Garden and guess what?  I'm here to tell you about it!

Yes, it is a chain, and yes - I had low expectations... but I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was fabulous thanks to the hostess that opened the door for us when we entered and exited, and of course thanks to Tony, our waiter.  The bathrooms were clean and although the atmosphere is a bit on the sterile side, I'd rather have that than a dirty restaurant!

I went with the soup and salad - minestrone soup, and Farrah went with soup and salad - a creamy chicken and gnocci soup.  We also shared a mussels appetizer... I didn't love the breadsticks, and the mussels were a tad on the buttery side, but the soup and salad were both fresh and flavorful!  I had just one bowl of soup but several helpings of salad... and Tony didn't even flinch.  

Farrah informed me that the Olive Garden chefs go to Italy for training and upon checking out their website, I see she is correct!  Here's what it says on their site: \"Olive Garden's Culinary Institute of Tuscany is located in the 11th century village of Riserva di Fizzano. Every year Olive Garden chefs travel to our Culinary Institute to learn authentic cooking secrets from Italian Chef Romana Neri and Chef Paolo Lafata.\"

Impressive, huh?

I still prefer to support local, but I have to say... I would have no qualms about returning to Olive Garden again!"}
{"text":"We love to come here just for the soup and breadsticks!! 
Amy the server was amazing!! Thanks for the great costumer service girl!  me and my daughter are full of happiness"}
{"text":"Just had an AMAZING experience in the bar area with kellee as our server. She's was humorous, timely, and very kind. She provided excellent service and the food was perfect as well. We go out a lot and I would say she's the best server we've had at any restaurant in the past 5 months. She was genuine in congratulating me on my recent graduation and wished me the best of luck in the job search (so nice!). Thanks kellee we loved having you as our server."}
{"text":"I love eating at Olive Garden! This location is clean and the servers seem to care about their guests :)"}
{"text":"This place was horrible, wait was over 25 minutes , service was bad, we had a table of 8 and the waiter rather help out a table of two instead. They had the dirtiest bathroom I've ever seen . Get your crap together or continue to get bad reviews and lose service !"}
{"text":"I didn't have the best service , but the manger stepped in and helped out as well as gave us a discount ! Very good and will be a return customer"}
{"text":"Wasn't the best. Got Tour of Italy and didn't care for the meat sauce. Noodles were undercooked and chewy. We also got chicken and shrimp carbonara, looked good, and tasted good. Service was nice and quick. Not bad but not good."}
{"text":"Came to this location for lunch not expecting much. Recieved great service from a server named Kelly amazing customer service and knowledge of the menu. Best experience I've had at any Olive Garden. Kelly is definitely a keeper and should be well taken care of. I plan on coming back just because of her customer service."}
{"text":"Visited just for a good night out. Our server was Martin and he was outstanding. The best service I've ever had in an Olive Garden. Will definetly be back."}
{"text":"Always a big fan of Olive garden, dencent food, dencent price, great service. Since we haven't find a nice local italy restaurant, here seems to be our top choice whenever we wanna have some pasta!"}
{"text":"Love their new deal, 2 for 25. The special menu had pretty good variety of  the appetizer and entree that you can choose. I don't recommend the bruschetta, because there is no Mozzarella, otherwise the whole meal was very pleasant. We got tons of food for very good price, in fact, we were so stuffed that we had to take almost both entire entree home."}
{"text":"I had today one of the most unusual dining experiences of my older adult life, at your Olive Garden in Paradise Valley, and I  thought I would share this  with you today. After a long work day in a busy medical center, where I treated many patients throughout the day, I finally could go home stopping first at one of my go to restaurants, by myself.  I was seated at a booth, and the maybe collage age waitress took my order for dinner, which included a Margarita. I went to the bathroom, and then returned to my table, to read the news on my cell.

Then someone other than the waitress came by, more my age,   and told me, Sir, we cannot fill your Margarita order today. Thinking perhaps they ran out of one of the ingredients, I inquired regarding the reason for this. She said, in a stern voice, we cannot serve you alcohol. I was quite confused about this, and her not telling me who she was, and why she was talking to me. In any case, I asked her why this would be, that she would not serve me alcohol. She said again, sir, we cannot serve you alcohol, in a sterner voice then before. Then, as in an afterthought, she stated, I had almost sat in the wrong booth. However, this would most certainly not be the case, as I sat directly in the booth where I had placed my phone before going to the bathroom.

Puzzled, I excused myself from the restaurant, and they cancelled my food order. As I was driving to a restaurant across the street, somewhat offended and disappointed I would not eat my favorite Olive Garden meal, I wondered what had happened there. For example, I wondered if I went into the woman's restroom by mistake. Nope, I remember using a urinal, don't have those in a woman's restroom, as far as I know (never been in one, assumed they don't have urinals, am I right?).

Seated at the restaurant across the street, at a dining booth, I made my food order, again, ordered a margarita, wondering if she too was going to refuse to serve my order. Only after they brought to me the beverage, I told her what happened a moment ago at the Olive Garden, and I asked her, \"do I look under the influence to you\". She said no, not at all. She said that sometimes, more than on occasion, she refuses to serve alcohol to customers at the bar when they are blatantly intoxicated, which I was not.

In fact, I drink an alcoholic beverage about once in every two months or more, have none at home, and only have one drink, because more than that makes me a bit tired, at my age. Also, I am a certified alcohol and drug counselor along with being a doctoral level medical provider, and I know how to tell when someone is blatantly drunk, which could be a valid reason to refuse to serve alcohol to a customer. Since I do not frequent bars, I saw this once or twice on a TV show. Also, I do not do drugs.

I am mystified by what had happened. Perhaps the older woman who came to my table was a manager,  though I do not know if this is the case. Perhaps the young waitress told her that she thought I might be under the influence. Maybe it was the way I said hello to her, or the way I ordered my food, I do not know. If the older woman was indeed the manager, she should have introduced herself as such, and she should not have lied about my almost sitting down at the wrong booth. That's like, messing with someone's head, insisting they did something they did not. See what I mean? Well, if someone is drunk, not sure how restaurant staff are trained to turn a cap on it and tell the customer no more. But it seems to me there should be blatant signs and stuff (slurring, falling down, etc.). I suppose another explanation is that the staff thought i was foreign born or something (I guess I don't like like I'm from around these parts), and wanted to discourage me from eating here?

I will not likely ever visit this establishment again, and will take my family and friends here no more. Who needs that? Also, believe there is often a relationship between the safety and quality of the food and the way the food is served. Therefore, giving this Olive Garden a one star rating, and would recommend that you stay away. I would consider, however, cautiously visiting another Olive Garden somewhere, but not this one."}
{"text":"been here many times and have always been satisfied. the bar area is normally where we sit. it was rather busy and was difficult to get the servers attention. 

Soup and salad is always a winner! 

Overall quality was great and food was awesome."}
{"text":"I came on a Sunday, and didn't realize how incredibly crowded it would be, but the wait was only 10 minutes for my party of three.

Our server was quick to attend to the table, even with a full room, and our food came out just as efficiently. He made sure to ask if we wanted refills of bread salad and soup without us flagging him down first.

I found a piece of foil in my chicken, which was unfortunate, but the server offered to bring a new plate, even though I was almost finished.

I'll probably go again sometime, but definitely not on a Sunday, and maybe I'll skip the chicken."}
{"text":"I've been to this location numerous times in the past and never had a bad experience. Recently, I went back for lunch with my daughter and a friend. This was the first time coming back to this location with a child. 

 All in all it was a great experience and I was rather impressed that my daughter got her food before the adults so that she would get more time to eat. The menu items were a bit pricey but all in all it was a good meal."}
{"text":"A very odd dining experience, for sure.  I haven't been to Olive Garden in about 2 years, and never to this location.  They were pretty busy but we were seated within 5 minutes.  They have that little kiosk on each table that lets you order appetizers/drinks/desserts and pay your bills.  

We sat down, were given water quickly, and put in an order for the pizza breadstick appetizer.  Our server came over and we ordered the Tour of Italy, but split it.  She also noted the kiosks weren't working correctly, and some of the stuff on it was only available during lunch hours (we were there at dinner).  When we told her we ordered the pizza breadstick appetizer through the kiosk she gave us a look and said \"Ooooook well let me know if you don't like it.\"  Very odd.

Anyway, we get breadsticks, soup, and appetizer fairly quickly.  The breadsticks are good but in terms of chain Italian food, Fazoli's is so much better.  The soup (pasta fagioli) was good.  The pizza breadstick appetizer was underwhelming, but for the wrong reasons.  In terms of taste it was actually very good.  While we were eating it the server came by and again again said \"If you don't like it, let me know\" as if she had a personal vendetta against the dish.  The main thing I didn't like about it was that it was almost $9 for what amounted to 1.5 breadsticks cut in half, smashed, with a little pizza sauce, cheese, and pepperoni on top.  Also the plate it came on was half empty.  This appetizer needs to be double the portion.  There's absolutely no reason to pay $9 for 1.5 breadsticks with some toppings.  That's nearly the price of some of the entrees!

Anyway, we get the Tour of Italy which has chicken parm, fettuccine alfredo, and lasagna.  They were nice enough to split it in the kitchen and we felt it was the perfect serving size for us.  Props to them for us.

In terms of service, everything was super fast.  From arriving, waiting for a seat, being seated, getting drinks, getting appetizers, getting our food, eating our food, paying our bill, to leaving only took 30 minutes.  Our server was attentive, but actually a little too attentive.  She must have checked on us every 2 minutes or so.

I guess overall it was an OK experience."}
{"text":"Giving you 5 stars because of our awesome waiter Dylan!!  He's so attentive, friendly and prompt.  We ordered a 2nd salad and realized when he came that we didn't want it.  No prob for Dylan!  He is a gem...a real KEEPER for sure."}
{"text":"Our server, Liz, was one of the best that I have had. Service ninja is an understatement. Hey bubbly personality is bright and wonderful. The food is obviously delicious but the top notch service puts it over the top."}
{"text":"What more is there to say other than the fact that it is Olive Garden?  It isn't gourmet by any means, but every now and then I want their soup, breadsticks and some \"Italian\" dish they happen to be advertising.

My favorite time to visit is in the fall when they have the all you can eat special.  That is really their best value at under $10 per person, it is a nice meal.

Service was decent, but certainly not the best I've ever had and everything tasted just as I expected."}
{"text":"We've been to this Olive Garden several times with our son, a student at UW Madison. We went again last evening after taking him back to school for the fall. Food was typical OG but, good and consistent for what you pay for. Service was below average. All five dinners did not arrive on time, the 5th plate came out about 5min's after the 1st 4. Server was pleasant but, brought the check while two of us were still finishing our entrees. Then what has to be worst idea I've ever seen in any restaurant, the \"Ziosk\" checkout. A wireless tablet at all the tables including ours. So Darden congratulations you've found a way to make your customers do the work of paying their own bill! Unbelievable. You slide your card at your table and then their system comes up and recommends a 20% tip, which you can change but it is a strong suggestion. The only thing they got right here is you can fill out a survey & make comments. This is just an awful system and ruined a typical average but, decent OG experience. Get rid of the Ziosk."}
{"text":"Went to Olive Garden today to have lunch with my husband. When we walked in to the restaurant the waiting area was empty. We were greeted at the desk and told it's about a 20 minute wait. Surprised since we didn't see anyone we ask why. We were told they had just seated everyone but there was a booth in the bar area if we wanted it. We said whatever is first. After a few minutes we were seated at a table in the bar area. We were given menus and that's it for the next 20 minutes. We saw a waitress going to other tables but not once looking at or acknowledging us.  Perturbed at this point I went to the front desk and asked who are waitress was. I was informed that there is only one waitress for that area and that three other people were ahead of us. 
I said that was not satisfactory - and informed them we were leaving. We always go to Olive Garden for dinner but never for lunch. Obviously they don't hire enough staff to keep up with the lunch crowds. Sadly because the food is great. Heads up people!!!  Your not going to get a quick lunch here. Be prepared to sit for an hour or more."}
{"text":"This location always seems to be busy for lunch and dinner.  Expect a wait getting in.  The best part of ANY Olive Garden is the salad and breadsticks.  If you came only for them you will not be disappointed.  The menu items change with time, and they now have a \"light\" menu.  Overall, their food tastes overseasoned and slightly processed.  Our server was attentive, but overworked.  Menu items are reasonably priced for the portions and quality delivered.  So if you just want a light lunch of breadsticks and salad or breadsticks and soup, go for it.  Otherwise, you can find better, fresher Italian food multiple places."}
{"text":"I felt like family.... our waitress took really good care of us sold us a bottle of wine and wrapped it so we could take the rest home.   Great over all experience and this was after work on a Friday with the family.   Its was clean. affordable and had plenety of outstanding flavors.  A+++"}
{"text":"I went for lunch today and me and my party were greeted by a very friendly staff. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the fried beef and pork ravioli. I thought I would like the mushrooms more but was quite surprised of the fried ravioli. The place was clean and we had a great server. I made sure I left her a tip larger than 20 percent. My sister and mom had some kind of chicken and dumpling soup and they loved it."}
{"text":"Never again. First, the servers do not know how to serve and need to be trained or maybe just care. Second, my knife was filthy and so i asked the server (Nadia G.) for another set. She brought it after i asked a second time. My party and I started off with the stuffed mushrooms and calamari. The mushrooms nearly burnt our mouths from being intensely hot inside. I had the carbonara dish with shrimp and chicken and again my dish with speghetti was piping hot. Speghetti is never piping hot unless it's nuked. The shrimp was very tight because it was nuked also. This took some of the taste away. It was not good. Besides that it was very overpriced. I asked our server how much because the description was not on the menu and she stated $16 and change. When I got the check it was $2 higher.

My friend had eggplant parmigiana and he also said he could tell it was nuked. I ordered iced tea with my meal. The server told us we could pay by using the pay yourself option that's on the table but never came back to ask us if we wanted to do that option. After she brought our entrees she disappeared. Never asked me if I wanted a refill of tea or to give us our checks and left our dirty dishes on the table for 45 minutes until I asked someone else if the table could be cleared. 

We asked for the mgr and informed her of the blazing hot food and we knew it had been nuked and also why our dirty dishes were left in front of us. She apologized and comped us the entrees and kindly asked if we wanted dessert but we passed. When paying the check our server gave my friend about 75 cents too much and shorted me my 58 cent change.  I think she was too lazy to want to count it out. 

I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"We got a gift card that we put off using for years now. Only reason we would put ourselves through this. 
It's all I've remembered...steak poorly cooked, out of main items, boiled shrimp, poor quality on all items.
Wife's cheesecake came out looking like Costco bought with a sauce that is a runny as filibertos salsa.
My tiramisu came out HALF FROZEN. All we could do is laugh. 2 stars because they carry the only thing that cannot be messed up, bottled wine."}
{"text":"Always a great experience at this location! This place is always busy, great service, and good food. It's great for date night, girls night, and even family dinner. 

Love their salad and breadsticks. I always get a boat of their Alfredo sauce to dip breadsticks and it's delicious!!!! 

Just went here recently with my girls to celebrate a promotion and got some food and drinks and it was great. Their peach Bellini was super tasty and I got the buy one take one meal for 12.99 which is a great deal. I enjoyed the cheese tortellini and took home the five cheese Alfredo and everything was great! 

Would recommend anyone to come here and I will be back plenty of times!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Olive Garden I have been to.   After being seated it took the waitress 15mins to even greet us and take our drink order.   Next after unrolling my utensils I noticed that the forks and knives were not washed well. There was left over residue.. Disgusting I must say.   The food was cold and did not meet expectations."}
{"text":"The service was top notch. The food is where I become less than a fan. It's hard to find good Italian food when you're not willing to pay an arm and a leg for pasta. Bleh."}
{"text":"Never really impressed with this location. Always great service, but the restaurant is disgusting and filthy. Our table had crumbs all over it, the walls were soo gross and dirty, food all over the floor, the menu had crust smeared all through it, and also the electronic ordering machine that sits at the table has crust from food all over the screen."}
{"text":"Impressed! Surprised to see so many negative reviews. 
We did have to wait awhile to be seated, but it was Fri night, so we expected that. 
Our server, Kendra, was great! Very nice & had a good sense of humor, too. She even went into the kitchen to find out EXACTLY what marscapone cheese is when I asked.
My husband ordered the chicken marsala & really liked it. I ordered the, um...seafood bordella I think it was called. It had shrimp, scallops & tilapia. I wasn't crazy about it. Oscar, I believe he was one of the managers, came around to see how everything was & even asked if he could bring me a different dish. I declined since I didn't think there wasn't anything wrong with it; I guess I'm just not a fan of tilapia in tomato wine sauce. Will order something different next time. Breadsticks & salad were awesome, though, as usual. 
Thier toasted marshmallow martini is TO DIE FOR!!! HOWEVER, only have ONE! I had 2 & I think it was too much \"sweet\" for me. But they are SOOOOO delicious!
We also really liked what they did with the building. Looks really nice inside & out. 
The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars was the seafood dish & how noisy it was in there. But, we will still go back for sure."}
{"text":"It's probably been 10-15 years since I last visited an Olive Garden. However, we had a Darden Restaurants gift card from the holidays and didn't want to break the bank, so we headed to 'da Garden for a little lunch. 

The waitress was very pleasant (and a talented cross-seller) and we sampled some wines before deciding on the chianti. 

The menu looked awesome, and we finally decided (after much deliberation) to order the eggplant parmesan w/ cup of zuppa toscana and the giant rigatoni (w/ sausage and meatballs) w/ unlimited breadsticks and salad. 

The breadsticks were even better than we remembered. 

By the time the entrees came out, I was stuffed with soup and breadsticks. :) But I had a couple of bites of my eggplant parmesan and it was very tasty. My husband was extremely pleased with his entrée as well."}
{"text":"This is the location to come and have your chicken scampi. Overall service was fantastic"}
{"text":"Italian food it is not. Is it good? Yes. Just like Taco Bell is white Mexican food, Oliver garden is the white Italian food. Breadsticks and salad. Past that, get a to go box for what ever you get. You won't have room for it."}
{"text":"Here's why they get the 4 star instead of the average 3...the kids. My kids love coming here. I'm not sure if it's the cups, crayons, breadsticks, or what, but they love it here. I have to admit that I really like the stuffed chicken marsala and the salad and breadsticks always hit the spot. This location had burned down back in the day and they renovated it when they rebuilt it to the way it is now. I like it. Would come back as we almost always get an engaging server who gives us good service."}
{"text":"My fiancé had the salmon and zucchini piccata it was really good, full of flavor. I had the tour of Italy it was alright, but our server Tyler was great, mostly why I'm leaving a great review. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Free glass of wine? sure!
There's just some thing addicting about the endless breadsticks and salad bowl...

Wifey likes their Toscana Soup(Potato and Kale)

I keep it simple and usually order any pasta dish that I can twirl with a fork and spoon-this time, meat sauce gets my vote.

kitchen crew needs a Mussels 101 course...these were pretty bad(Firefly on Sahara still gets my vote for the worse mussels ever)

Not the best, just A-OK for me......ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"The Olive Garden closest to us. The one we frequent. Showed up at 4:45 pm, Monday, 22 Jun 2015, before the dinner rush. Parking lot 1/3 full. Greeted nicely. Expected to get seated right away with such an empty parking lot, and no one else waiting. Was told it would be a moment. We sat for 10 or more minutes. Meanwhile, 3 hostesses chit chatting at reception desk, a few guys who apparently work there sitting at table, behind reception area. We got up slowly to leave, without a word from hostesses (our leaving silently loud & obvious). Drove down the road to visit La Loca Pupusa (first visit there) where we are going to spend a lot of money on good Salvadoran Mexican Food. Thanks to OG, we discovered a hidden treasure. OG mgt recommendation: reinforce customer service at the front end.

Edit: wow... After reading others' reviews, this place has a serious habitual customer service deficiency. Consumer beware. Fortune cookie: \"He who treat customer with indifference soon hold cardboard sign at freeway off ramp.\""}
{"text":"Love, love, love my Italian food.  I admit it.  When I think of Italian food, O.G. is not my first choice.  And this is why I rate this shop so high.

Thirty of us sat down in this restraunt and the majority of my group are competition paintballers with big stomachs and light wallets.  This bunch treats nickels like manhole covers.  And the majority of'em want separate checks.

The servers nailed it.  They were prompt and very paitent.  I had the Mezzaluna pasta with sausage which came out to me within minutes of ordering.  Rene, our server, was on his \"A\" game.  A glass of house wine and the house salad made this meal very pleaseant.  The manager stopped by and chatted us up, introducing himself by name.  Very cordial, this despite a very full house (and he's a Detroit Red Wings fan too!)

I like this restraunt because the service was very prompt and attentive despite the line going around the building when we rolled up at 7:30 p.m."}
{"text":"The lunch special is a great price and I love that they have more vegetarian options now. Brian was a great server even though he was extremely busy he was right on point with our needs and very friendly making our experience way better"}
{"text":"I love this place and location. I've only had bad thing happen and that was whenever the waitress forgot my son's name while they were singing happy birthday to him. Other than that my family and I can't go wrong when we dine here. Great food great service and fair prices. Even on busy days the staff makes sure everyone is well taken care of."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We ordered to go expecting it to be quicker than sit down however we ended up waiting a full hour before we received our order."}
{"text":"I know... OG?!!? Jeremy the bartender is great ! Stopped in for lunch. Split a mixed grill. Light dressing on salad. Saved calories , got stuffed , saved money. Pretty decent meal :)"}
{"text":"For fast food \" Italian \" the food is not too bad. The house wine is over priced though. This location is clean and the servers are nice. We will be visiting again when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great. Henry was our server. He was great and gave  excellent menu advice, was prompt and polite. The new grilled chicken Parm is awesome. The rotini lost a star for being under cooked. It's ok GF pasta is hard to cook. Maybe they will get it next time. 

Got a free desert with coupon code 67. Signed up for promos to get it. My son ordered Zeppoli. Italian Doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce. Looks awesome and he is teasing me with them since I'm gluten free and can't eat them:-)"}
{"text":"It is exactly what you would expect if you've dined at an Olive Garden before.  This location was clean, and service was quick and friendly despite being very busy.

If you don't want to wait for a table there are cafe style tables available with the bar service."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is a pretty solid Italian chain restaurant. But I must say, unless they're on their endless pasta bowl event, I don't know if I think the price is right for the quality. Nonetheless, this place is a must go if they have their never ending pasta bowl!"}
{"text":"We go to this Olive Garden frequently and usually like the meals.Went to dinner yesterday my husband got the pasta meatballs with Diablo sauce There WasNo Sauce!!!!!! He had a plateful of pasta AND no sauce ! When the waitress served us the meatballs were bare could easily tell she was hectic busy ,we asked for Sauce! 25 minutes later!!!!! A small ramiken of sauce came! Terrible! I got fettuccini and it too had almost no sauce! Who is the chef back there? Need to check your customers meals and waitress needs to SLOW down give client attention,"}
{"text":"I have a review for two servers. One working day and one workin night.

Kevin Z., is the first server I'm going to review:
I decided to treat my mother for lunch and Kevin was our server. He saw that we were having trouble deciding what to order, and he kindly suggested some fabulous dishes! We ended up getting the unlimited rigatoni with soup and it was amazing! He was very kind and checked on us often. He was on top of refills and kept us laughing with his conversation! He was very polite and made us feel at home. 

Last night, I decided to treat my coworker to dinner at Olive Garden and our Server was Justin.

We came to Olive Garden at 7pm with no reservation and were told that it would be an hour of wait time. We waited and surprisingly it only took us 15 minutes to get seated! Our server Justin was very charming and polite to us. He served us a complimentary sample of the sour Apple wine and kept us smiling throughout our whole dining experience! It was a busy night and he was juggling tables and orders like crazy. But he was always on top of his guest service and was enthusiastic at all times. Would like to see him get a promotion!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is pretty good.  The service is usually pretty fast and the waiters are friendly. Today though this olive garden really disappointed.  My girlfriend and I walk in around 2:00 on Saturday and I was expecting a litrle bit of a wait but this was just stupid. The hostess took my name and handed me one of those little pagers telling me it would be 10-15 minutes. Pretty reasonable on a busy afternoon. After about 20 minutes I notice a man is talking to the hostess about he and his family of 5 are still waiting to be seated and have ben skipped over by multiple parties. The hostess says she doesnt have his name on the computer but he is obviously holding a pager and had been waiting for awhile. The hostess. Had a couple more complainta of people waiting from people being skipped and just as I was getting impatient my girlfried went up and asked if the same problem had happeded to us and it had. My biggest problem with this isnt the computer its that the hostess has eyes and if she bothered to take a look around she would see that the same people are still standing in front of her while she continues to call other names. I waited almost half an hour for what was supposed to be 10 minutes. Thats why I rated this place the way I did. The foods good. The place is busy. Ther servers are nice. But its pricey for what it is, the wait was long, and the hostesses because there were two had no common sense."}
{"text":"I must same the service we received today was excellent. Our server Christina was very attentive and on top of things. The food was good and full of flavor. The peach tea was amazing as always. Definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"As far as Olive Garden's go I am a fan of this one.  I have most frequently used this for their take out option and I have never been disappointed.  All of the staff is always extremely friendly, kind, and helpful.  My order is always warm and ready on time.  Even in times when it is extremely busy. 

Aside from the take out option I have always had excellent customer service while eating inside the restaurant. Our food is always quick and the prices are very reasonable. One of my favorite things to order is the Chicken Flatbread. It is small enough so you don't feel stuffed but big enough to be satisfied.  

If you are trying to eat here on a weekend there will likely be a long wait.  I would recommend doing the to go option.  You can order online or you can call, I have found calling you are able to get the food faster, and then you can take it home to enjoy."}
{"text":"Expensive, my friend and I ate here for the pick three. It was lame $17 for my plate and so disappointed in the quality-our bill was $75  and not good quality and I've had better. I had one glass of wine and she had one too and we shared a desert. It's been years since I ate here and it use to be better."}
{"text":"Joni! Joni! Joni! She was amazing tonight. Hell of a dinner rush and she was able to be prompt, witty and attentive. We adored her and will be back as long as she's around! There was an issue where our main dish came out before our soup and salad but she made quick work of that and kept us satisfied. Please, don't let her leave!"}
{"text":"Always a great place and I think they gotten better with the move. It's much more fancier now and the staff seems very happy to be serving you. They are understanding and very patient, too. Our waiter was very funny and was positive. I can't exactly recall his name since it's been a few days but he looks exactly like Kevin Smith. We asked if he's ever gotten that and he says yes, a few times. Also helped us settled our Star Wars over Star Trek dispute and also added Marvel over DC. Yes, we are a bunch of nerds but we will continue coming back!"}
{"text":"Based on my Online To Go Order pickup experiences, I am left with a lot to be desired.  Yes they were busy, but only one guy was doing To Go orders and no one offered to assist him; he was working his but off too.  No one asked me if I needed help or anything.  Waited for 45 minutes, 35 minutes past my pickup time.

Last time I picked up it wasn't this bad but still slow as can be.  Not sure why it's an issue here.  I do not recommend ToGo here.
My food is probably cold as well.

Also, people showed up after me and were served immediately.  Very frustrating.

Don't plan on takeout here ever again.  
2 strikes and your out."}
{"text":"I have not been to Olive Garden in quite some time, but ventured out for a family birthday and the current special was enticing which was a great selling point! The spaghetti and meat sauce was delicious paired with my merlot. Overall customer service by our server was hands down outstanding!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this place at all. I'm still not sure how it's surviving with all the mediocre food that they make. i'm a big pasta person so I have a pretty big standard on anything about it. So, upon arriving here, I was SUPER excited about their endless pasta deal. I immediate look advantage of it because... Why not? 

I ordered a combination of angel hair pasta topped Alfredo sauce. Me and my wife were definitely not happy about this as the pasta was served to us dry. I don't think you can go wrong with cooking angel hair with sauce. I just didn't think that was possible. Instead, it was under sauced. We would've wanted to bring it back to the kitchen, but we were waiting there for a while already so we weren't excited about doing that at all. 

The meatball that we ordered with it was fairly delicious, but there was nothing spectacular about it. It almost reminded me of the meatballs you can get at the supermarket, but they're larger in size. 

Th ambiance of this restaurant was lovely. I really like the look and feel of this place as it felt romantic and a bit homely at the same time. The waiter that helped us was very accommodating as well. These are the reasons why I'm keeping them at two stars instead of a one. Seriously, I'm disappointed at even thinking about stopping by this place. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Great take out service. The food is absolutely great. N the bread sticks are the best."}
{"text":"There was not a lot of green in this garden!! 

We waited almost 15 minutes before our server got to us to ask us for a drink. She seemed to be nice but barely came by to check on us and got more lazy as our time there went on! 

We ordered a duo appetizer...and we were very disappointed! The calamari seemed like it had never been in water, it was dry and cold! The fried mozzarella was good but we only got three. For $10.79 the plate was tiny and completely... NOT WORTH IT! We had ordered the unlimited pasta bowl and the pasta was great, but when I went to order a second plate our server said, \"really?\" It was uncomfortable and unappreciated. I'm not ashamed to say I love my food and want to get my money's worth 

Overall the atmosphere was okay. Seemed a little more dated than other Olive Gardens I have been to."}
{"text":"Meh. It was fine, but I wouldn't hurry back. Server was attentive enough, but I was very turned off on the wine tasting thing. It's presented as, Ooh, try some free wine, but leaves this weird obligatory sense that shades the interaction. I didn't even drink any and I felt weird.

Food was meh. Just meh."}
{"text":"My family and I eat at this Olive Garden frequently. The meals are always delicious and come out in a timely fashion. The bread sticks and salads always hit the spot. The staff was friendly and held the door as we walked in. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had not been to the new location a block away from the old one.  I met Rand H here for lunch the other day.  He out ate me about 2-1 so I am not sure the never ending pasta bowl was that great of a deal for me.   With my one bowl of pasta I had a breadstick and the whole serving bowl of salad.  One thing about chains is they  are predictable and this was no exception.  The food was good but not exciting.  The one thing that can change from one location to another is the service and ours was excellent on this trip.  Even with the larger building this place was almost at capacity as we were leaving just after 12."}
{"text":"Rand H sent me an email the other morning about meeting here for lunch.  It was close and I could make it so I joined him.  Over the years I have liked Olive Garden pretty much.  Right now they have a never ending salad and pasta special going on for $8.95.  I make red sauces at home so I tend to get white sauces when I go out.  This time my choice was Alfredo on spaghetti which came out just as expected.  Instead of getting a second bowl of pasta I chose to make the serving bowl of salad a single serving size and only had one bread stick.

We were greeted immediately upon entering and seated.  It didn't take long for our waitress to show and offer us a sample of wine which I had to turn down because I was going to spend the afternoon running machinery.  The service was good throughout the meal and the staff worked as a team when they needed to.  This was my first time at this location and I would certainly return."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch the other day.  I had intended to get there about 11 but it was almost noon and I had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  Being lunch, any more of a wait and I would have gone elsewhere.  Right now they are running their $8.95 all you can eat pasta special with choice of soup or salad.  I had two different pastas and a big bowl of salad.  I love the pasta and like the salad, the food is always consistent from one location to another.  This location always seems a little more crowded and hectic than the one on 75th. If I could use half stars it would be a 3-1/2."}
{"text":"a little slow on receiving food, but overall this is a good olive garden location. friendly staff, good food, huge portion sizes. the manager here went out of her way to make sure we were satisfied with everything. overall, I will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Basically the McDonald's of italian food.  The place is terrible the salt content alone is enough to give you heart disease.  They try to sell you a bottle of wine regardless if your interested or not.  If I were you I would go to a real italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Went with my kiddo today for a mother/son date. He's ten and really wanted shrimp, and loves Olive Garden. Amy was fantastic! She suggested the shrimp appetizer with no seasoning to accommodate him bc they don't have shrimp on the kids menu. I always get the gnocchi soup and breadsticks... I'm a sucker for them. The food was delish, as usual. Amy was very pleasant, and did not make me feel rushed. I love the consistency that I receive from Olive Garden, no matter which location I visit. This applies to the food and service. Eating dinner with my son is always stress free and I never leave feeling like I wasn't welcome (which I've experienced at other restaurants when eating alone with him). We finished with a delicious Sunday topped with his favorite... Andes mints... Then she gave us a couple extra with our ticket. We will be back!  Thank you Amy for the outstanding service!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for the soup salad and breadsticks. I ended up getting a meal too the. Chicken and cheese pita.  It wasn't very good, like pasta sauce on a pita. Should have just gotten the soup and salad.  Olive gardens not somewhere I typically go unless it's for soup and salad though. Service always varies, I've never had a note worthy serve but never a bad one either."}
{"text":"What can you say about commercialized so-called italian food?  We only went here because mom gave us gift certificates for Christmas.  There were 5 of us. 

I had soup and salad, the old standby.  Salad was as it always is, lettuce, olives, onion, crutons, dressing.   Minestrone soup was heavy.  Others said their food was ok to good.  Did NOT like their house red - yuck!

The server was nice and we got everything in a timely manner.  The server gets 4 stars.  Not my choice to eat here when I want REAL Italian food."}
{"text":"I got the unlimited soup and salad for lunch and of course it was amazing . The service is pretty quick so it's safe to come here for lunch !"}
{"text":"What can I say? Went with a friend and my daughters to have lunch at the Olive Garden, we went for the all you can eat pasta bowl with salad and bread sticks! Lunch was very good, service was fast and friendly, only hold up was bread sticks were cooking but it just meant they were fresh from the oven! Great lunchtime with the gals!"}
{"text":"Phenominal service! My dining companion has a really difficult food intolerance, and the waitress and sous chef were SO helpful and accomodating. GREAT meal! So satisfying."}
{"text":"We went to dinner with friends last night. 4 kids 4 adults so we expected a long wait to be seated. Once we were seated it took a minute to get our drinks still fine. Then we ordered 2 appetizers first to come out was wrong. The second one came out 45 minutes later when I went and found the manager because by this time we all needed refills. After sitting for nearly 2 hours and telling our waitress we would just go elsewhere our food came. Cold and just not good. No one was apologetic really. Worst service and food I've had at Olive Garden to date. My family and go to this location a lot it's close to us. After last night probably NEVER EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I have visited an Olive Garden, I keep hearing of long lines on a Friday & Saturday night. Went on a Sunday & tried to make reservations  early in the morning but the person said we don't take reservations, when we arrived at 5:15 they said the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour, while I was talking to the host a person got right in, with call ahead seating. I described what had happened to us & the host proceeded to ignore my comments. At about 45 long minutes I grabbed the manager & explained my situation the manager seemed genuinely concerned but did nothing to seat us faster, there were tables but not enough staff. At roughly 1:05 wait we were seated & the manager offered us appetizers as a peace offering for our wait.

In all honesty the appetizers were below average, the calimari was chewey, the stuffed mushroom caps were OK, the lasagna fritta were over cooked rubbery, the mozzarella sticks were more breading than cheese.

When the salad came to our table of six there was barely enough to serve 3 of the 6 at the table.

When dinner came I had ordered the chicken & shrimp carbonara at $18.29 it arrived my luke warm with barely enough shrimp & chicken, I boxed most of or up hoping I could bring it back to life with more chicken & a spin through the skillet to serve it bubbly.

The other dinners at my table were far from impressive, the braised beef Bolognese was overcooked but luke warm, the stuffed chicken marsala looked like leather, the recipient of this meal said it never was like this before. I think the people who ordered spaghetti were happy.

All in all I would look for a locally owned italian restaurant for better service & much better food."}
{"text":"I decided to \"try\" to be a little healthier, so I got their whole wheat pasta w/ meat sauce and it was actually pretty good! 
I also got the chicken gnocchi soup, and wow, that was delicious! Their Roscato was also very good!!

I'd definitely come back to order those again, and next time try a different sauce with the whole wheat pasta.
Their unlimited breadsticks, soup or salad are definitely still worth it!

Their servers were also very friendly, and patient with my huge family (including 3 toddlers)."}
{"text":"Fast service for my to-go order today! She came out and told me piece-by-piece how it was getting assembled in my bag. Nice touch. 
I was pleased with my herb salmon and steamed broccoli! But it was steep at $17.

The fried calamari was terrible.

The trio of alfredo, lasagna, and chicken parm looked 'meh.'"}
{"text":"Sooooooo good love this place great service 
Good food I come here rarely but wen I do come I love it ( my 11 year old son did this)"}
{"text":"Love this location better than the Arrowhead location. It feels much more like a nice restaurant rather than a cafeteria like the Arrowhead loc. Maybe Im being too harsh, but what a difference. If I'm going to spend $100 on a meal, I want to feel good about it. The food was good as it should be.  I like the newish grilled chicken parmigiana. Lower calories and very tasty. They now have a way to put your name on a wait list, similar to \"call ahead\" offered by other restaurants. I thought this was great and signed up. When we got to the restaurant, none of the employees knew what I was talking about. Not good. I haven't been to Olive Garden in a while, but I will be back."}
{"text":"The review is only in regard to the service from the waitress Shay. At least I think her name was Shay... She was mumbling the entire time. She started off the conversation by discussing how bad her day was and that it was worse than hell. I asked for my salad with no olives, it had olives. I asked for meat sauce with my ravioli, I got red sauce. I asked for a refill on my drink, never got one. She came to our table maybe 2 times total. Absolutely terrible service. I'm appalled."}
{"text":"Horrific manager. Allen whatshisface was very unprofessional and harsh to me and my family. He literally threw them out the door for trying to sit with us. Our server Oscar was great, though! Everything tasted pretty good. Other than a hair in the salad that was not ours and a \"manager\" who only knows how to panic, the restaurant was okay. We were very very much encouraged to sit in the cafe area as to not have to make the servers walk or clean a normal table. (This was 1 and a half hours before closing) Whatever. Basically, as long as you don't have friends or family who want to sit with you and everyone preparing your food is bald, you should be okay. Again, manager did not explain reasoning for kicking our friends out, but just ran off like a sissy not to be seen or confronted. Salad rocks tho. Oscar was this Olive Gardens saving grace. We will unfortunately not return to this location."}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite restaurants to come to as a kid with my parents and family. Now, that I'm much older and independent, and have more money, I can order my favorite dishes! Before, I had to ask if I could order pasta with shrimp."}
{"text":"We have a party of 5 and they sat us in a table for 4.  We were so tight for space we were in almost spilling our drinks when we pick up to drink them.  The table next to us left and we had to ask the manager if we can push the tables together.  There was hesitation but she did not anyways.  The service was slow, very slow.

Chicken Alfredo:  It was ok.  I remembered it being better."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is Olive Garden. We got on the waiting list as we drove in.  Of course this is all online. The wait was 2 minutes when we got there and sit at our table. The service was pretty good. But the food is always okay. Actually desert was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"I got the chicken alfredo for lunch. The flavor is ok, I remember it being better. The chicken is sliced thin (I think they use only half a chicken breast for this order). The chicken and gnochi soup was good. The bread-sticks are always a staple. 

I should have gotten more soup since the chicken alfredo was not a good portion."}
{"text":"My parents called this week and our adventure was Olive Garden. What the hey again, since the hubby is working late and beats cooking. Drove to my parents out met up with my parents and my brother. We plied into the van. Dad drove us, it felt like we were little kids again. But I did not remember dad's driving was that bad. Seriously, he drove like an old man speed and stops at green light. OMG! 

Got there finally in 1 piece! They were pretty packed on a Thursday night. We waited no more then 10 mins and the lights on the beeper box was flashing. We were quickly silted in booths. The booths are getting old, I sit down and hit the wood part of the booth. OUCH. I thought I was my big butt, but my mom mentioned the same thing. Our waiter was fabulous. She was patient and nice. My parents took forever to pick something. 

Dad ordered: Seafood Alfredo - He ate 3/4 of it and loved it. 
Mom ordered: Chicken Marsala - She ate 1/2 of it and loved it. 
Brother ordered: Meatballs and Spaghetti - He ate all of it and licked the plate. LOL! 
I ordered: Chicken Parmesan - I ate most of it and thought it was a little salty but good 

Our appetizer of Chicken flat bread came late (middle of the dinner). It was so good. It was nice of the waiter to take it off the bill. She did not have it. 

Our soups and salads were the same as every visit. Plenty and good. Again I thought my chicken and gnocchi was a tad salty. Maybe it is was me tonight?? 

It was good family times and good laughs..."}
{"text":"I have not been back to this Olive Garden since last review (1 year).  We had a family dinner there with 9 of us.  We called ahead for reservations and they got us in for 6:15pm.  OK, I will try this Olive Garden again...

The service was good.  The food actually was ok this time.  I was surprised.  I got the chicken and gnocchi soup, there was only 1 dumpling.  Really?  The flavors were good, but 1 dumpling?  I asked for a 2nd bowl and wow, tons of dumplings.  It guess it is a hit or miss kind of thing.  I got the Alfredo chicken, it was actually not bad."}
{"text":"Overall the experience wasn't bad. I get pretty much the same thing every time i come so I know what to expect. The zuppa was amazing as always. Along with the breadsticks. The salad had to much dressing on it. We got the spicy calamari, the jalapeños were good but there was no flavor to the calamari. Also one of the kids got the wrong sauce on their pasta. We asked for meat sauce and she got alfredo. The server was nice however his English wasn't the greatest so it was difficult to understand him."}
{"text":"Food always tastes good, and the prices are reasonable. 
Service is always hit or miss when I come in. 
The Zuppa Soup and the breadsticks are AMAZING - I get it every time!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden has a nice take-out system here, and that's what my rating is about. Before, you would walk up to the bar and the bartender would take care of you. On this visit, I was greeted by the host at the front, and he asked for my name to radio ahead. When I got the bar (full of people), the bartender greeted me even though she was busy and assured me one of the food runners would assist me soon.
Sure enough, a pleasant girl had my food in hand and addressed me by name. She showed all the items without rushing, to ensure accuracy of the order. I much appreciate the nice timing, she was personable without dragging out the transaction. I'm impressed with the small touches of exceptional customer service. Thanks for not treating me like cattle at such a busy time :)"}
{"text":"We had a great experience!! Kenny was our server and was very attentive and friendly.  We will definitely be back and we will be sure to ask for him."}
{"text":"The pasta dishes were delicious.  I got the ravioli portabella and it had a very creamy sauce.  I had to soak some up with the breadstick that came with the dish.  My boyfriend got the classic lasagna and the layers were good.  Not too much meat or sauce or pasta but proportional to all the other ingredients.  I'd want to come back to try their chicken and dumpling soup and maybe even their endless pasta one day!"}
{"text":"olive garden is now open! ignore the temp closed message on yelp!"}
{"text":"I was in this location today for lunch. I got awesome service and great food. I love the friendly staff here, they really make you feel welcome. I also like the fact that you can pay at the table with the tablet they have available at every table. It makes it easy to get in and out and you are not left waiting around for the server to bring you back your cash or card. This restaurant is always very clean and presentable. I enjoy eating at this location very much, it is consistent in every aspect. I will be returning! Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"hahah!! one more night of pasta before summer shredding begins next week!!!! yes, we stopped in for the never ending pasta bowl promo theyve got goin on rn.  wed never been to this location n not really knowing how busy theyd be on a friday night, i called in a res for 715. perfect. walked in. immediately seated. items we ordered were:
*chicken fettucicni alfredo
*fettucini alfredo
*angel hair pasta w/marinara
*chicken parm
*spaghetti w/meat sauce
and a side of baked zucchini 
i almost forgot how delicious those breadsticks are!!! omgggg... and the salad was yumm as well.  server was awesome! drinks were never empty and she explained about a huge party they had in the back being the reason it took so long btwn my husbands and sons pasta refills.  other than that no complaints!! well worth the price!"}
{"text":"This is a very busy location. So be prepared to wait if you go on the weekends. I have been here before so I was a little confused as to why I had to wait for a table because when I was walking back to be seated I saw a ton of open tables and booths. 

Anyways back to the food. I am that weird girl who orders Salmon at a Italian Restaurant. This salmon is delicious though. It's a big piece and it's super juicy. Perfect portion for me. It's comes with broccoli but I did a substitution for something else. My plus 1 had the chicken Alfredo, which is always good. The salad was a little sloppy but for once it had enough salad dressing on it. Our server Joshua was very nice and works hard for us even though he was swamped with other tables and guests. 

If you fill out their survey on the table kiosk the servers get brownie points from their manager if they were awesome."}
{"text":"This location was awesome! My server was A+. She knew the menu and also recommended different dishes. I would not get the bread dipping sauce. For what you get it's not worth the money. I actually went with the salmon. Yes I know it's an Italian Restaurant but it looked so good and it was. I was able to substitute the broccoli for Alfredo and noodles. 

The GM was checking on all of the tables and was very involved with what was going on. He was even helping deliver food to the tables. For how busy the restaurant was, the staff still delivered awesome service and they looked like they wanted to be at work."}
{"text":"The Olive Garden's food is wonderfully consistent and I always enjoy it. The food tastes great, the atmosphere is light, and the staff do a wonderful job. The food is awesome. Soup, salad, and breadsticks is one of my favourite things. I also love the eggplant parmigiana. The food is amazing."}
{"text":"Great customer service Jason was such a cool guy . Made us laugh and was very helpful."}
{"text":"Worst service I have experienced since moving to Arizona. I love Olive Garden as a chain and I have been to restaurants in several different states. This one started out badly. When we walked in, two servers and two hostesses were standing at the front counter complaining about their personal lives. No one looked at the door, no one greeted us, and when they finally acknowledged us, it was as though we were imposing on their lives. Once we finally got to the table, there were crumbs all over the bench. I can always understand this as I used to work as a server and bartender. When we asked for the host to bring something to clean it up, he brought a wet rag and not a dry one. Once we tried to get into our seats, he left without giving us a chance to ask for a dry towel to dry the seats. I decided to use my cloth napkin to clean it off-- as I was wearing a white dress. After sitting down and drying my seat (my significant other decided he would just tough it out in his black shorts), I looked up and realized 2 of the wine glasses which they set the table with were dirty and had actual food on the rims! After that, we still looked at the menu and thought about staying. As I said, I am pretty tolerant of dirty situations as a former server and bartender and I know how hard they work. Once 5 minutes passed and more than 5 staff members walked by without greeting us, we decided to walk out. 

I really love pasta and the way Olive Garden provides a consistent product throughout the US-- but, I will never be a patron of this specific location ever again."}
{"text":"Tried to post this review, but Yelp posted it to the Red Lobster. 
To be brief: the service was bad, got the wrong meal and over charged. Would not go back to this location, might try OG again elsewhere maybe.
Now disappointed in this OG and Yelp."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is one of the few chain restaurants that has a special place in my heart... mostly because my mom and dad like it so much but also because I really like their salad bowl and bread sticks.   When I'm home, on the rare occasion we eat out, we  sometimes go there for family dinners.  

I recently met a new friend at the Chandler location for lunch because they still have that great all-you-can-eat soup and salad for lunch... Yum!  Really, the soup and salad is my favorite thing.They have a chicken and dumpling soup now, which was delicious and easy on my tummy (was sensitive that day)! 

Might see ya there!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to eat dinner on Saturday evening, we just moved into our new home and needed a nice break from un-packing. We also had coupons for kids meals so couldn't pass that up! We enjoy the food at OG and the portions are more than enough. The real reason I am writing this review is because of our waitress. Her name is Tasha and she is WONDERFUL! I can't recall another time that I ever had such great service...ever!!"}
{"text":"I went here last week with the bf for lunch Ive been wanting to come here and try there food because I hadn't eaten here since I was a kid.

Thank god Ive stayed away from this place for so long! what a disappointment.

So we did the 2 for $25 deal...

It comes with all you can eat soup or salad, bread sticks, and pasta of your choice.

We had salad, bread sticks , and the fettuccine Alfredo as the main dish. 

The salad was ok but i guess it would be kinda hard to mess up a simple salad, the bread sticks were hard and tasteless. As for the fettuccine it was ok nothing I would brag home to mama about Ive had way better it reminded me of something I could microwave from the grocery store no flavor at all I had to put a pound of salt and pepper on it just to make it ok to eat. 

I will not be returning to Olive Garden this is Las Vegas there are way to many good restaurants to eat at rather then waste my time at this fake \"Italian restaurant\" not to mention the service was lousy.

Please avoid this microwave Italian food!"}
{"text":"Thank you to the Manager, Mr. Jim Lloyd, for making things right today.  I was hosting a large gathering for Mother's Day and Olive Garden put the wrong date on our catering/carry out order, which I placed in person a couple of days ago. Not only did they make it right, they were extremely professional, apologetic, and courteous about it. I was so stressed when I found out we had no order to pick up... but you made it right, and I will most definitely come back with that level of customer service I was provided today.  Thank you Jim!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great!!! The service is very friendly and attentive. I got the chicken alfredo and it was delicious. I Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"The reason we went, is because we're cheap. They are running a special $8.99 for their dinner combos- Commercial says over 50 combinations before 5 PM. Got there at 4:35- place was pretty empty, but still had to wait almost 10 minutes to be seated. Got seated, waiter was very attentive. There are really only like 6 real choices on the special menu, but with all the mathematical combinations of different pastas (3-4) sauces and chicken (3 chicken choices) I guess you could get 50 out of it, but to me it was a little misleading. The food was mediocre. I haven't been to Olive garden for several years. We used to love it. We left the restaurant and my wife and I looked at each other and almost said in unison. \"I don't care if we ever go back\". I don't know what they did, but the only redeeming thing was the salad."}
{"text":"I had salmon salad and bread sticks ... salmon actually was cooked very well and broccoli also ! Lady who brought me my food Rose was so sweet ! Filled my peach tea and re filled my salad and bread !! Gave me plenty of cheese also ! She wasn't my waiter but she was great didn't catch my other waiters name ! Salad I could tell was a lil old . My favorite thing here is the peach tea! Great job rose"}
{"text":"Horrible 
Waited over 45 min for 3 dinner items 
The kids had already eaten and we're ready to leave.
Manager came out never apologized just said she had no excuses & would give us a discount.
Assuming she would comp the 3 meals we had boxed up because we had to leave.
Never assume gave me a 16$ discount for a horrible $60 experience.
Waiter was horrible as well not filling drinks & never informing us of anything.

Don't even deserve a star"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the never ending soup salad and breadsticks. Soup was hot and fresh. I had the sausage and potato and then the chicken and dumplings. Very good soups. Breadsticks and salads kept coming and the service was great. All this for $6.95!"}
{"text":"We got to-go food here a couple of weeks ago and we found a little black hair in our chicken and shrimp carbonara. It looked like a pubic hair we were super grossed out. We filled out the survey asking how our meal was and it said that a manager would get back to us in a few days and that never happened. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The only reason I go to the Olive Garden is salad, all you can eat salad. I always fill up on salad and then take my past home and usually take it for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"All that I have to say to everyone is have Steve wait on you he was the best server I have ever.  to you Steve you were on top of things! Other then the great server we had the food was good. I will totally be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Wow! What has happened to this location?  This long time work lunch location has been so disappointing the last 2 times that we walked out today.  

When we 1st got there (this happened the exact way the previous time we were there) we were immediately told that the wait was 10-15 minutes or we could sit at the bar!  What??  The dining room was virtually empty!  Both times!  The 1st time their was a large booth open so we sat in the bar area.  Today the bar was full and so I asked...  \"Do you know what the issue is?  Why the dining area is near empty but we can't be seated?  The hostess who is usually as sweet as can be glared at me and snapped NO!  I said you don't know why?  Again, NO!  I was shocked!  We all just looked at each other like, what the heck just happened!

The hostess then asked if I wanted to speak to the manager.  I said yes.  After being gone for several minutes she stomped back over grabbed some menus and said follow me!!!  We were then seated with the same grumpy short worded attitude.  When she walked away we just looked at each other like WOW!  Is this for real?  Decided quickly this was NOT okay and got up and left.  The manager never did show up to talk to me.  Perhaps the writing on the wall...

One time maybe... everybody and everyplace has a bad day.  That's okay.  Treating us like we were the issue is not okay.  Two times now the same experience...  I'm sure we will try again but be clear Olive Garden/Chandler Blvd is on notice and we go there a lot!  

SO disappointed.  Totally inexcusable to be treated like that..."}
{"text":"i had a gift card from Christmas that was burning a hole in my wallet, so i went here for a work lunch.  Food was excellent, I got the Four Cheese Pastachettis with chicken.  It took longer than expected to receive the entree but the flavor was wonderful.  Cheese, cheese and more cheese just the way this midwestern boy likes it please.  Service was attentive and friendly.  My only concern now is that with my digestive system is sounding like an earthquake.  I hope that it agrees with me later on this afternoon and doesn't send me into a multiple dating spree with the bathroom.  Yikes."}
{"text":"Brought my mom here for her birthday! She had a great time! Tochi really took care of my family.. she's awesome! :)"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Came here for lunch with four people for a work outing and we were told it was a 25 minute wait, with a PLETHORA of open tables. Now, I get it, it's lunch, you don't want all the tickets to hit at once, but maybe staff appropriately so patrons can enjoy a beverage while waiting, as opposed to standing in the lobby. Looks pretty awful to have a CROWD in your lobby, and a multitude of tables open. Step up your staffing and scheduling so your patrons can enjoy when they come in."}
{"text":"Olive Garden on Flamingo. I was not familiar with their soup selection our waiter, John was nice to give me a tester of each. He went out of his way and for that he's the best!"}
{"text":"Great service! Good food. But the highlight was definitely the service, she was on it! If you want a safe bet this is a good place to go"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday afternoon. Parking lot almost filled.

Enter the restaurant. People patiently waiting everywhere. 
What to do? Got to have a serious strategy.

I've got one!! Eat at the bar. Empty.

Promptly seated. 

Danielle took my order immediately. 
She, alone, is the personality behind the bar
late afternoons and evenings.

Beer, soup and salad. 


Mmmm, I feel better already. Great beer. Soup, salad and breadsticks 
were quickly brought to my spot at the bar. Enjoyable!

I notice that the bar area is filling rapidly. It pays to have a strategy.

First-rate, cool lunch for a hot afternoon. Thanks Olive Garden.

Best Part: good bit less than $20.00. I was satisfied, not stuffed.
(Oops, shouldn't have told you that... now I'll never get a seat.)

This could get to be a habit.

UPDATE:

Did it again on Tuesday.

Does that make it a habit?

Good habits are hard to break!

UPDATE  #2:

This really has become a habit. Delicious habit.
Great food; great service from genuinely friendly servers."}
{"text":"Food is awesome... like any other olive. My tip would be to avoid Saturday evenings. We had a party of 3 and had a wait time of 45 minutes. Service was okay- not great."}
{"text":"Food okay. Weird experience. Never refilled water. We were very cold & asked if they could turn down air conditioner (not many customers in restaurant). Air conditioning continued, one person in our party had to go sit in car was so cold. Waitress didn't say I'm sorry or anything. Just  'oh, ok'.  They have you pay the bill on a screen at the table
. Wouldn't work. Pushed button to call server, didn't come. Asked another server to get her, no action.  Manager was about the same. No 'I'm sorry' offered."}
{"text":"Another birthday down and it ended here - great waitress - great food - tons of left overs! 
Loved the free birthday dessert and since my folks picked up the tab ! The whole experience was great!"}
{"text":"Did a 300 dollar lunch order today 2 hours in advance online arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes early understandable the order wasn't ready pick up time was scheduled for 230 should have checked the bag I asked for 16 plates and 16 setups good thing the office had forks and spoons to go around or we would be eating with our hands to busy to post this on Dec 2nd but had to be posted next time actually go over the checklist on the receipt and I tipped like 20 bucks regret that choice"}
{"text":"They have a pad looking terminal that you can order items or request refills at your table. The server was still great. The gnocchi soup is nice. My mom likes the chicken parm. I got a seafood over flat noodles with tomato and asparagus. It was ok with some clams and shrimp and scallops. Dessert was fun it is s fried sweet bread with raspberry or chocolate dipping sauce.  You can look at your bill and pay it at your table. Super convenient!"}
{"text":"Shut out to Candy;  Thank you for your service! 
Came in for take out and had a nice experience! 
She greeted us with a smile and made sure we had everything before leaving! Thank you Candy! She went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Here is my question ... I have been to two Olive Gardens one in Salisbury one in Concord Mills. Why are these two unlike any others in any other state? TERRIBLE TERRIBLE !  The one in Savannah and ones in Florida are actually pretty good .
        First we where attacked by flies and had instant mashed gnocchi ( at The Salisbury Location)YUCK then 19 sticks of butter where put on my dish Look my name is not Paula Deen... ( at The Concord Mills location.)
          Not to mention that the place was nasty there was trash and food all over the floor and the table was not even wiped down and you want me to sit here?Then the utensils and the plates had old FOOD on them. NASTY Just take a look at the picture and you will see.
          Needless to say this is my last Olive Garden visit in this area WHERE IS THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHEN YOU NEED THEM?)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Olive Garden but this location is absolutely the WORST I've been too.  I worked for Olive Garden for 3 years and know what to expect service wise.  I've been in here 3 times.  The 1st time was great only becau5my server was awesome.  The other 2 times was to place an order to go. It was dead and it was as if the bar tender had never in his life placed a to go order.  The food runner had to tell him how to do it all that is after I sat there and was ignored for 5 minutes and finally decided to say hello I'd like to place an order. Mind you he was playing around with another employee at this time.  I get it if your busy but when I'm the only person in the bar and you can't say I'll be right with you then there is a customer service issue.  I decided to go back in tonight for a to go order.  Grant it it was busy but if I may suggest that there needs to be some sort of process.  I don't want to go and wait 30 minutes just to place a to go order because the people ahead of me want to sit and have drinks while waiting for their order, and ignored until their order comes up.  I literally walked out and I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"The server we had was simply amazing in every way now we know why we should come back thank you Brooke D for your at most best service kindness and for making the experience worth while. Your service is while we will come back. Thank you. The food was great it was delicious."}
{"text":"First let me say 2 stars are ONLY because the female bar tender who served us until we were seated was great!!! Now it was down hill from there in a huge way. We've been to this OG numerous times with good service. I can't say the same for this visit. Our male server had the \"shakes\" worse than patients experiencing DT's that I've cared for. Upon bringing the bottle of white wine to our table it had ice on the bottom as well as dripping water. Our friend grabbed the bottle just as it was about to hit the floor. The server never even noticed the bottle sliding off the table because of ice on the bottom nor did he notice the water he dropped all over our friends suit. He also either didn't noticed or care that he spilled red wine on the table while reaching across me to pour my husbands wine. We had to ask him three times for our pitcher of red sangria, our friend asked at least that many times for another glass of white wine which he never brought. This was a party of six adults in which he brought one bowl of salad that was maybe half full for the five who requested salad. He did bring more bread after we asked numerous times only to drop the empty basket in my lap. Never once did he ask if anyone wanted more salad or soup, very odd which by the way we did want more. Our food took over 35 minutes to come out which in the mean time he never bothered to ask if we'd like anything. The food was COLD as in ice cold!!!! All six plates clearly had sat waiting for him. One person ordered chicken meatballs, they were so over cooked it was difficult to even get the fork in it let alone slice. In passing we informed him of this he took the plate (again never asking if everything was OK or did we need anything) without saying a word. He came back 10-15 minutes later to inform us \"they were making more chicken meatballs did we mind waiting?? Yes we mind!!!! The cook should be ashamed to send anything out of that poor quality, you could tell by looking at the meatball it was as dry and hard as the desert. The server stated the meatballs would be removed from our check, guess what??? They weren't! We had planned to order desserts but our server must have been in a hurry to leave as he brought our check without even inquiring. The resturant was not busy at all, we were seated at approximately 6:45 not that there's any excuse for this type of service nor food quality. People that were seated after us were served and leaving by the time our food arrived. I now wish we'd spoke to management prior to leaving."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch with a friend. We split a side of stuffed mushrooms, and each ordered a different kind of soup. The server brought us both the SAME soup, so I had to wait for the kind that I had ordered. I ended up talking way too much as I always do, and had most of my meal leftover, so I asked for to go boxes. She boxed everything up and put it in a bag (I wasn't paying close attention). Now, I Just sat down to finish my meal, and there is no soup.... Really? How can one mess that up? I am bummed ....."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would!  We are still waiting in the lobby, after they wanted to sit our party of 5 at a small booth.  We informed the young lady that we would like a table.  She huffed turned around and said fine.  We went back to the lobby.  I waited across the bar and over heard her say \"they are to fat to sit at the fucking booth\" omfg I was in shock... I haven't requested the manager yet I want to see how long the wait is going to be!"}
{"text":"I go here often, mostly before I was Yelping.  Now that I Yelp, I find myself seeking out other Italian restaurants.  

So... this location is where I go mostly and it's good.  Beware of long waits though.  I know this isn't much of a review but as far as Italian goes... there are probably better."}
{"text":"Wow what great service we had there yesterday. We ordered our food and we split. They automatically split the plate from the kitchen. The waitress was the best, her attitude was the best. With that personality, she must be a millionaire. Besides the food being on point, the service was excellent. The waitress really made our day yesterday with her service. Restaurant gets 5 stars, waitress service gets 10 stars."}
{"text":"came in today to enjoy a nice lunch. our order was entered by our server and the kitchen messed up is what we were told an hour and a half later, with tables that arrived much after we did received their food. our good was brought out. I asked for those that came, to let the manager know. I was then told by our waiter that the manager was to busy to come to our table. the restaurant was not full or extremely busy. I am absoloutly blown away by the managers response. this is at 1:50pm Sunday. Never coming back and do not recommend this place. it is now 30 minutes after management has been notified and has not come to our table."}
{"text":"Been to this Olive Garden twice with my family. Obviously if it was up to me, I wouldn't have come back a 2nd time. The salad and breadsticks are always good, but the main courses are seriously bad here. Both times I've eaten here I've gotten sick. Tried different stuff each time, didn't matter. The service is lacking here also. While everyone is nice, the service is very slow."}
{"text":"This is my first time to dine here and it is so great experience because the quality of food and taste was so perfect of my choice."}
{"text":"Only two stars because the soup was good. Service is slow, waitress's are unprofessional and ghetto. Olive Garden is not what it used to be"}
{"text":"They absolutely outdid themselves!!! My party of 10 had gone to another restaurant for my birthday only to be ignored for 40min, so we left and came here. They were informed of our previous letdown and stepped up! Our waiters were great and attentive. The food was familiar and fabulous. Bread sticks and salad abundant, drinks refilled, we left plump and satisfied. Also a sweet song serenade was icing on the cake! Thank you for making my birthday memorable!"}
{"text":"Great food! Our server was a short Hispanic man who was very funny and great to have around! he's been our server before and the service provided is always great :) the food was delicious and drinks as well definelty not my favorite Olive Garden location because of the location itself but they always provide exceptional service and food :)"}
{"text":"For the longest time, I've always avoided going to Olive Garden due to a bad experience. I finally decided to give Olive Garden another shot a couple months ago & I'm so happy did! Pretty much every dish I've order here have been really good. I'm a fan of the lasagna & the smoked mozzarella chicken. I just tried the gluten free rotini with roasted garlic alfredo & chicken meatballs today...totally found my new favorite dish from there! The only thing I don't like is the fact the breadsticks always look so pale but they still taste good regardless."}
{"text":"Yesterday we went to Olive Garden to treat my mom to a Mother's Day lunch. I have been here one time before with my fiancé and we had a great experience so I was expecting this visit experience to be no less satisfying than the prior one. 

It was very busy upon arriving, but this was expected for the occasion. The hostesses were pretty unwelcoming and gave off a bit of a cold vibe, not the best impression on this visit. We were quoted a 45 minute wait for a party of 6 which seemed reasonable all things considered. They had a fair bit of waiting room which extended outside as well; the day was beautiful so we took advantage of this and waited outside until our table was ready. They had the vibrating coasters that light up and vibrate when your table is ready so waiting outside was easy and stress free, no worries of being overlooked/missed. They under promised and over delivered with the wait time and within 20 minutes we were seated :) which made up for the cold welcome.

Our server Salvador was very professional and polite, he was always diligent with serving our table from his intro right until we asked for the bill. He was always good at checking up on our table and ensuring everyone had what they needed. He was also good with clearing plates and bringing refills which is always important to me, even more so when you're with a bigger party at a smaller table :) as you can't afford the clutter with limited room. 

The most disappointing part of this visit was actually the food, I know coming to Olive Garden it's unfair of me to expect the best Italian food money can buy, but in comparing it to my previous visit it was definitely much worse. For the complimentary wine sample I tried the Zinfandel today, wasn't my favorite, a bit sour. The salad and breadsticks were very salty, definitely less enjoyable than the heavenly breadsticks we had last time. Those who ordered soups were happier than us salty salad eaters. As for the meals themselves the feedback was mixed at the table, about half were happy and half were not. I ordered a meal from their \"Lighter Italian Fare\" menu, for a \"light\" option the presentation was very heavy and unappealing. There was far too much sauce, the vegetables were over cooked and overall it felt really processed; basically it felt like the opposite of what I was trying to order. One of us ordered lasagna and that came out looking extremely unappetizing, sloppy and overcooked. It looked worse than one you would buy from the frozen foods section of a grocery store :S. The rest of the dishes were a bit better, other than the strips of steak in in my brother's pasta dish which were clearly a poorer cut.

The visit in the end was a bit of a disappointment, as it was Mother's Day I was really hoping for something a little more memorable that reflected my first visit here. The hostesses were unwelcoming, the wait time was good as was our server, but not exceptionally good to the point that would make up for an overall pretty disappointing meal. Unlimited breadsticks and salad/soup is definitely a plus so I'm sure I'll give Olive Garden another go, I just feel like I need a little break given this mediocre visit."}
{"text":"Lol please don't let Arica be a server anymore.  This is not her calling. 
1. Waited 25 minutes for drinks.  
2. Waited 40 minutes for our bread sticks
3. There were 6 tables that sat down, ate, and left before we got our food. 
4. Hair in our soup 
5. Finally just asked for our entrees to go
6. Cmon man, wouldn't even fill our drinks up unless we asked.
7. This was a 2 hour experience for spaghetti and Alfredo, that we didn't even get to eat at the restaurant. 
8. She got our checks wrong 
I've never felt so disrespected and my boyfriend has hit me. 
This review is just for her, usually you guys are fantastic."}
{"text":"I have been to this Olive Garden so many times over the years. And this is the first time I was disapointed. Our poor waiter was so over worked. The blond female manager had sent people home and they then got a rush. The funny as heck black bald waiter we had was the best. He handled 10 tables with grin and a joke for each. He was as fast as he could be. The food was okay. But our waier honestly made the visit as good as it was."}
{"text":"This is just what you'd expect at an Olive Garden. The service does seem to be a little quicker here. The parking lot is large, and exiting is easy due to traffic lights from the mall onto either Southern or Alma School."}
{"text":"So we came here to use up our last $10 bonus card we had and it was just okay. Honestly it was just your typical chain restaurant. Now I'm not saying that all chain restaurants are bad but you pretty much already know what you're getting into when you sit down and order. But sometimes there are little things that can really impress you. However this was not the case last night. Our salad was really good I have to admit and had more of the little extras (onions, olives, croutons, tomatoes) than normal so I will give them that. I ordered the Seafood Lasagna Sauté and it was just all right. To be honest I was really looking for some ricotta cheese (because when I think of lasagna that is the first thing that comes to mind) but this did not contain any. It was simply sautéed shrimp (with the tails on which is a pet peeve of mine) and scallops in a light Alfredo sauce and lasagna noodles. Needless to say I was a little disappointed. Hubby had the Steak and Gorgonzola cheese with fettuccine noodles. It was really good and his steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. The little bit of balsamic drizzle they finish it with is a definite plus. So all in all an okay dinner but nothing fantastic."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Nick tonight. He checked with us frequently, food was served warmed, frequent refills, etc. This place gets busy on the weekend so plan ahead. During peek times they do not offer call ahead seating."}
{"text":"Poor service, overpriced for the quality of the food, overall not an enjoyable dinner place."}
{"text":"I usually love the Olive Garden, but this visit was less to be desired. I sat at the bar and was waited on promptly, which was great, but after that I had to call for my server everytime I needed anything after. To give her some credit, the place was really busy, but this is the holiday season and the place is located in a busy shopping district. I ordered raspberry ice tea, they don't offer it so she asked if I'd like peach/raspberry instead. I ordered the tea and it was terrible. I took one sip, appoligized, and politely asked if I could replace it with a coke instead (this took a while, because I had to work to get her attention). She did switch it, but of course charged me for both beverages. Even that would've been fine, if the service wasn't so bad. It took forever to get someone one to allow me to cash out. Luckily one of the other bartenders saw me holding the cash and bill and asked if I wanted to cashout."}
{"text":"I was hungry so I stopped in. Not hard to be seated at 4:30PM. FIrst time at an OG. 
Salty, doughy breadsticks. Minestrone OK. 
Eggplant parmesan, greasy, boring cheese. The red sauce, peppery but no substantial flavor.
Chicken parmesan. Might as well walk down the street, head into McDonald's, pay one fifth the price and order some chicken nuggets.
\"Have we arrived at our taste destination?\" Huh? No, we aren't in Italy. Italian food is light years beyond what is served at OG. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. If you can't do the basics correctly, how are the other dishes fare?
This chain of restaurants is one of many contributing to American obesity. Quantity vs. quality. \"Unlimited soup, breadsticks\" makes you think you got a bargain. I think not. I left full, but I can get full at McDonald's too. Americans don't know the difference any more."}
{"text":"I frequent this location quite often but today I simply called for the hours of the Pronto Lunch special . The young lady who answered the phone didn't seem to know anything about where she works . I asked the question in maybe 5 different ways and she didn't know , said \"I think\" after every statement and \"I'm not sure\" was her final answer . Don't count on me returning as a customer again ."}
{"text":"We tried one of the new tour dishes, the northern one. It was delicious! Olive Garden is always good and their salad and breadsticks are a staple. We ordered online and got the to-go, which we have never tried before. It was good and convenient, as we were too exhausted to go in and eat after work. I would have given it 5 stars if we would've eaten inside. The food was delicious, it was the refills of salad and breadsticks that were missed (we could've used more of both)!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this Olive Garden and before today I really did not care much for Olive Garden. Only took my mother out to eat for her birthday and brought along more family because this is where my mother desired to eat. It was very good, the server Nicole C. was absolutely amazing, everything you'd want out of a server, even at such a busy time so I'd like to thank her again for exceptional service, and the rest of the crew! You guys rock. My Steak was great, cooked perfect and exactly the way I asked and not one thing wrong with our huge order, was amazing Nicole could memorize orders for 5 people, from appetizers, drinks and full meals all at once. Great job, again."}
{"text":"We arrived as a large group after making a reservation days in advance. Upon arrival we had to wait for twenty-five minutes (anyone can take a reservation, takes a legitimate restaurant to know how to handle one. This was all despite the fact that the manager had called prior to our arrival to ensure our party would be arriving when we said we would). We were told we could not be served alcohol as our IDs were not scannable, and furthermore our service was horridly slow. I forgot why I hadn't come to this fast food kitchen in over a year, but this place quickly reminded me why."}
{"text":"Came in and got sat down immediately our hostess was very sweet and explained everything to us. Then after she left is where it all went down hill. 5 minutes go by, no other contact was made. Then 10 minutes still nothing, we're just hanging out, didn't think much of it. And so on, you can already tell where this was going. 20 minutes go by and I'm like where is everyone? Maybe it was because we were seated in the corner behind a group of people or maybe no one cared.. but it's okay. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This spot was selected  for our belated Christmas get together with the kiddos and family this past Friday. It's a solid place for a family get together and they make sure the kids get their crayons and coloring books to stay entertained while the food is being prepared.  A busy Friday night for a table of four  plus two kids equated to a 35 min wait. They only take reservations 2 hours ahead of your planned arrival (read: call ahead of time and not last minute like I did).

Our table ordered a variety that includes their smoked mozzarella fonduta appetizer (melted smoky blend of a variety of cheese served with slices of Tuscan bread- yum), seafood fettuccine alfredo (w/ shrimp and scallops), the kids got spaghetti and meatballs with extra marinara to dip breadsticks, and I ordered their  unlimited Zuppa Toscana (bits of spicy sausage w/ kale and chunks of  potatoes in a creamy broth) and breadsticks (so worth it) along with peach iced tea (sweetened). The food was good and no one at the table was disappointed. Our meals were solid carb-loaded comfort food and it was exactly what I expected-- A-OK.

TIP: EAT IN THE BAR (21+).  When my husband and I come here by ourselves we easily scoot in and are seated in the bar and eating in less than ten/fifteen minutes (even in the middle of the Friday/Saturday night dinner rush). It's speedy and the right choice if you're starvin' Marvin."}
{"text":"We were here on a Thursday night and it was actually pretty packed. It is a chain restaurant so I understand. Our male server was actually very attentive. The food was pretty good. It's not GREAT, but it's a lot better than I have had before. The bread was nice and hot but was salty. My boyfriend loved his steak with pasta. I had the chicken scampi and it was good. The calamari was a bit bland for me."}
{"text":"We went to this location last night for my birthday. Well it wasn't a very happy birthday. Our server was Buddy and he wasn't very friendly. He kinda just threw our stuff at us. He seemed like he didn't want to be there. His bad mood started to make me get into a bad mood. My boyfriend had mentioned to him that it was my birthday and he didn't even ask if I wanted anyone to sing and bring out a dessert. He didn't say anything about it. No happy birthday. Nothing about out costumes. We actually had another sever come up to us and talk to us about our costumes and was super friendly. I wish I had gotten his name and I wish we had him as a server. 

My food was ok. My boyfriend said his pizza was terrible. 

Overall last night was a horrible experience. Now I know not to go to this location for a late dinner."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible food. Seriously- soup, salad, and bread sticks. Colored salt water, iceberg lettuce, and white bread.The TRINITY! This is the attraction??? 

Two cold bread sticks attached together with five-six inches of chain would make great nunchucks.

The dining room does however have an upscale nursing home cafeteria feel. 

The unsanitary computer device sitting on my table needed a biohazard sticker attached to it. 

Who thinks of this stuff???!!!"}
{"text":"We always go to this location, Bagley Rd, Middleburg Heights, Ohio. Food is hot and fresh. Our server, Melanie was very nice and personable.
--
Went back again last night! Our server was great, he was very attentive and polite. Food was great! I really enjoy the music and atmosphere.
I've been to other locations where the music is too low to here and others where they play music you'd here on your local station, I hated that.
So again, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Zuppa Tuscana, and the mixed grill make a fantastic meal here. If you don't want an average meal, get something more than pasta."}
{"text":"Came in for a to go order. They were pretty quick to take my order and the food came out quick. 

Food came out correct with precise condiments for each plate. 

Good service from my point of view. Check em out"}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Service, our waiter was Alex- super attentive, gave us great 'favorite' options.
Ziosk at the table, very convenient for ordering and paying."}
{"text":"The menu has improved , plus the service! I suggest the cucina mia option. You choose the pasta, sauce and  chicken, Italian sausage , or meatballs. This s comes with unlimited soup or salad. We chose three meat spicy marinara with bucatini, and the creamy bacon , sundries tomato sauce with cavatappi and sausage. We were also offered a sample of Italian wine . Yum!"}
{"text":"If you eat here you are so uncool.  Like how could you go to a chain restaurant like olive garden or applebee's??  Clearly you are not hip and all indie-like.  I can't even talk to you right now.  Like OMG."}
{"text":"Another chain establishment.  The sad thing is that we \"tried\" to go to Red Lobster first, but were repelled by the large crowd of waiting people.  No, I don't want to stand around like cattle waiting for my pager to buzz so I can be ushered to a cramped seat, fed, branded, and ushered out again stampede style.  The mighty gods of chain restaurants everywhere are wagging their fingers at me right now saying, \"what do you expect lady?\"  I know, I know.  

So we went to Olive Garden down the street.  No wait there.  Our waitress was very young, I'll refer to her as \"Sparky\".  My dining companion had a sudden need to try some wine, so he asked Sparky what would pair well with the lasagna.  She didn't come across confident as she pointed to the list of wines on the menu that mister dining companion was holding.  She finally chose one and said that it would go well with the \"meaty\" dish.  I'm not sure what either one of us was expecting because after all this is Olive Garden and we have almost zero knowledge of wines.  So de-classA!!  

After Sparky left our table, dining companion says that he expects the chosen wine to be the suck because Sparky doesn't look like she's even old enough to drink, let alone have knowledge of the fine wines.  But you know, none of this really matters when you consider the fact that compared to her we are old as dirt, and still don't know shit about wine.

I had the eggplant Parmesan with Alfredo sauce.  It usually comes with marinara, but if I'm going to have a heart attack it had better well be because of something I enjoyed eating, not something I felt like I had to eat in the name of my health!  Hell no!  

Dining companion had his red wine something or other, and he was right it sucked.  He described it as tasting like, \"the barrel it came out of\".  

After the main course I had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake.  I made sure to look in a direction where no one could see my face before I crossed my eyes from sheer delight.  I am a pumpkin lovin' nerd by nature, and this cheesecake was gooood.

So this chain experience wasn't too bad.  The only thing that sucked was no refill on the bread sticks.  If I'm going to go slummin' at the chain restaurants, I expect the constant refills man.  Especially on those items they advertise as \"bottomless\" and/or \"never-ending\".   Finally, Sparky took a long time to bring by the check, and this goes against the code of chain fine dining, wham, bam, thank you mam.  Touche!"}
{"text":"No stars terrible customer service from the hostess to the wait staff.  Sat  for almost 20 mins in the open seating in the bar area.  Not one person said I'll be right with you.  We did get to hear the bartender attend to her friends and hear about their love lives.  Needless to say we walked out without anyone saying a word to us."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs!  They diluted my wine with water, the food was mushy, they charged me $3.25 for marinara sauce from A CAN (without informing us beforehand this injustice would be taking place)!  Typical big corporation: cut costs down to last nickel and inflate the prices so the CEO can fly in his private jet (after landing, eat at a REAL Italian restaurant) and purchase a new Bentley each year.  

Visit DeBlasio's Restaurant for twice the portions; it is MUCH CHEAPER, as well.

Worst experience at a restaurant... EVER!"}
{"text":"I give this olive garden a 2/5 rating, mainly only because the food was great as always. the restaurant was very busy, which my boyfriend and I expected since it was dinner time and the day after christmas. once we got seated our waiter seemed very angry from the get-go and you could tell he hated his job. unfortunately, i didn't catch his name because he was so stand-offish. He was a decently tall, male hispanic. he asked my boyfriend and i how things were tasting maybe once the whole time we were there. He didn't even bring us our meals or top off our drinks once they got empty. my boyfriend was paying in a gift card and once he went to go tip there was only about a $1.40 left on the gift card so he gave him a one dollar tip and then added $4 with his own debit card and he payed at the little kiosk thing at the table. before my boyfriend and i were even up from the table the waiter got in our way cleaning the table and as we were leaving he said to our faces \"thanks for the $1 tip\" when if he looked at the whole bill would have noticed we added $4, which was really over tipping considering he shows that he hates his job, pretty much sucks at his job, and is rude to customers."}
{"text":"No one was at the door to greet me. I had to walk around the WHOLE restaurant to find my husband. Then when I got to the table, they said I couldn't order lunch chicken parmesan. The manager came over, and said it herself. Funny how ive come and gone to several olive garden and only order that. Im a go to dish type of person. What a Terrible manager!!!!! And waitress."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times since we moved here and the service is always great. Tonight, Margeaux waited on us. She was super sweet, efficient, and our glasses were never empty. We have also had Kyle at this location twice. Once again, never had to ask to have our glasses refilled and friendly, efficient service. Kudos to the management team for great training and stressing customer service. We will come to this location over Others due to the friendly staff and good food!"}
{"text":"Our family had a better visit, they didn't offer wine sample, forgot the bread sticks, forgot the refill for the soup and we only saw our server when she dropped off the check. I even have to ask someone else to get a box for our leftovers and no chocolate mints. Overall service could only get better from this visit...I hope!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable we came with family to have a dinner we ask for soup and salad.
We ask the server to get another salad for three times. Doesn't seems like they really care about their customer we had to get up from our table go straight to server and ask for salad.
And then we sit and talk trying to spend time as a family while eating the server came and bring the bill to make us get up so quickly.
Don't understand the name the location that company is terrific but some employees can make your name look bad.
Will try to go somewhere else........."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a group of my coworkers for dinner.
It's been a long time that we've been to Olive Garden   The food was pretty good and the wait staff was AMAZING.  

We had the following: 
Chianti Braised Short Ribs (it's was ok, the meat was a bit overcooked/dry not juicy, risotto a bit too much salt.  Veggie seemed overcooked).

Braised Beef & Tortelloni (really good, I was told my coworkers would get it again)
Tender sliced short ribs and portobello mushrooms tossed with asiago-filled tortelloni in a basil-marsala sauce. 

Capellini di Mare (really good, didn't smell fishy, pasta was NOT aldente though, a bit overcooked for my taste).

Grilled Shrimp Caprese (pretty good per my coworker, shrimps were not overcooked, pasta a bit overcooked).

But the overall high rating for this place was more of our waiter Craig D.  Can I tell you, we've NEVER had a wait staff being so attentive for our party of 5.  He knew who got what, the timing of our drinks/salad/soups/main meals were on spot, like clockwork.  He made sure our drinks/water was full, the bread was fresh and warm, salad and soup refills even without us asking for more.  He made us feel like we were in a 5 star restaurant, really.  What great service, next time when we're back in town we'd go back again!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go and when I went to pick up my order 3 people asked me if I had been helped and I said yes and I waited 30 minutes and I just would've liked to know if it wasn't ready or what was going on. Once I got my order I opened up my spaghetti with sausage I paid for and I noticed there was no sausages in there. I was very disappointed by that. I feel robbed."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, i love olive garden.  My problem is, they dont have cannolis and now NO rissotto.  What Italian restaurant doesnt have either.  Their food and service are great, but, cannolis and rissotto  are a must for Italian restaurants, in my opinion.
I love the chicken gnocchi soup, a lot.
Please get the two things i miss most."}
{"text":"After we were seated, our server didn't come to us for around 15 min. People around us that got seated after us were getting their drinks, so we used the tablet to call our server.  After we ordered, it was a long time before we got our salad and bread sticks, which usually come right out.  Again, people sat after us had their salad and bread sticks long before we got ours.  They came out pretty much right before our food. We were a party of 2.. nothing huge or difficult.  Our sangria was weak- tasted more like kool aid.  Food portions were huge but not that great.  We asked for more bread sticks but she never brought them out.  We asked for our check twice and when we finally got it we said \"thank you\" and our server said \"Ok.\".  No good night, thanks, anything.  This was my first time at Olive Garden in several years- I felt like \"carbing out\", but I don't think I'll be back (at least to this location)"}
{"text":"So I have been here about 4 times before, This last time was awful!  The food was the worst I've had in a long time. I ordered the Northern italy plate for a whopping $15.99 it was literally 3 pcs of dried tortellini, 1 pc of undercooked chicken patty thing,Extra dried fettuccine Alfredo and a slimey salad missing tomatoes! SHAME ON OLIVE GARDEN you lost 6 customers..."}
{"text":"Recently got dinner to go from this location. The order was perfect, and the food was still hot when we got it home. I will definitely come back to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Best Italian food ever had and best Italian food in Phoenix ,excellent food and excellent service,everything was amazing,i will go back to Olive Garden"}
{"text":"Seriously there best place! Every server was amazing at their jobs and are very hard working. The server I had ( Nicole) tonight was so sweet, she was very graceful. I have nothing bad to say about this Olive Garden! Well done!"}
{"text":"I do not really consider this Italian for starters so don't get me wrong with this review. And for the record I try and avoid master chain restaurants.

I do enjoy frequenting Olive Garden for their Soup and Salad and that is about it...oh and their salad dressing, I buy bottles and take them home.

As for the rest of the food I really don't eat it. I have tried alot of it and yes it was ok but it was \"generic\" if you know what I mean, good food should taste like someone really wanted to make it.

So for other than soup and salad not my spot for \"real\" Italian food."}
{"text":"Can I just say I normally don't go to a restaurant if it's a hour til closing but I had just gotten of my shift at work and was craving a meatball bread stick sandwich and decided to break my rule.  I was hesitate cause I know sometimes towards closing servers are anxious to get home.  Our server rose was so welcoming and accommodating not once did we fell like we came in too late or that we were a bother to her she was quick and efficient the best server we've ever had.  Can't wait to come back and see her again!"}
{"text":"Omge just finished a LOOOOOOOOOONNGG day of moving, and I kinda avoid going out because service these days is so horrible.  However I was tired and wanted a hot meal that didn't involve a drive through.  I am beyond ecstatic that I came here.  Our server (Ron, Rome, Roman not quite sure of his name at the time of writing this) was super on point, he was charismatic, made convo, and was efficient.  Thank you for your awesome service! You are truly one of a kind and I hope you are there often cause we will be back!"}
{"text":"I've waffled back and forth between liking and disliking Olive Garden. I've never been too impressed until I tried their tilapia piccata. It was amazing. I would definitely come back to have it again. Well done!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is great, the parking is HORRIBLE! This place is always packed! Brunch, Lunch, or Dinner plan on hunting for a parking spot, waiting for a table, and enjoying yourself AFTER you are seated. They have a bar, and also serve drinks at the tables. The food is great (I love their salad), and the service couldn't be better."}
{"text":"The Never Ending Pasta Bowl is fun. Try to get in for it once per year. In my last home state (MD) it was fab. This one in Scottsdale not so much. Meat sauce Plus sausage on whole wheat linguini. Linguini was soft and overlooked. Unforgivable given the focus of this restaurant. The sauce was thin and not much meat in taste or view. Sausage tasted ok, but was not first browned and had a smooth pate like texture, not coarse grind like it should be. Next tried Mushroom al Fredo w meatball. Sauce was tasty with lovely Parmesan flavor. Mushrooms were thinly sliced and nicely browned. Meatball was a total fail. Bland, tasteless, pasty & not browned. Salad was all iceberg with paucity of extras. Breadsticks stale. 3 stars is being generous..."}
{"text":"Extremely,  pleasantly surprised.   I had written off this chain years ago but a gift card from my mother in law brought us in.  The service was amazing!   2 people strategically checking on us and a manager that made his round as well.  Our 3 year old ate his food (wonderful flexibility), I went out on a limb ordering the Pappardelle Predators.  It has seafood and I am extremely picky having lived on the coast.  All of our meals were excellent and we even ordered deserts to go. (Sooo full)  and they looked great."}
{"text":"With the unlimited soups and salad I was already full & satisfied lol ...their Creamy Chicken and Gnocchi Soup is to die for! I treated my mom there for Valentine's day and she was very pleased to see the new renovations. Our server Matt was extremely patient, kind and generous, he knew exactly what to recommend and we enjoyed our meal because of him. Thanks Matt you were Amazing!"}
{"text":"I have to say this was the worst experience I ever had.  The waiter was okay, he tried, but they did not even have the ingrediants for an Arnold Palmer.  The salad was okay, but my eggplant was hard.. tough and not good at all.  The silverware was dirty I had to send that back, the simple dish of macaroni and meet balls my partner had were over cooked and the at $2.79 per meatball, they were hard.  The management was not helpful.  This was our first date location and now I don't know when we will be back."}
{"text":"Went to dinner during their homecoming rush, but we still were seated within 10 minutes of arrival thanks to their call ahead seating. Our server Carly greeted as right upon seating and did an excellent job at serving us. Very friendly and a great bubbly personality. We had a bit of a wait on our food but that is because she herself noticed they over cooked my food so instead of serving it incorrectly she made sure it was right."}
{"text":"Great service and the soup salad and breadstick deal is a great way to fill up the belly!

Can't beat the price and they did a great job keeping up with all the snow birds flooding in."}
{"text":"My steak was good but small. We ordered a cheese cake but it doesn't come as advertised. The picture in the menu shows glazed strawberries but the actual cheesecake you receive has no strawberries. False advertisement."}
{"text":"Awful experience here last night. I sat at the bar around 8:00. After waiting for 5 minutes with no service, I asked a hostess if someone could take my order. Another 5 minutes go by and a an annoyed waitress ends up taking it. When I hadn't even received my beer 10 minutes later, I simply just got up and left.

Terrible experience--will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful after they took care of a minor problem.  I ordered the never-ending pasta bowl with meatballs.  We were there during lunch on a weekday so they were rather busy.  The food arrived quickly.  Plenty of meat sauce on the noodles and of course the breadsticks are outstanding.  My problem came up with the meatballs.  They were nearly white on the inside which means there was hardly any meat.  They were made up of cheese and breadcrumbs.  I complained and the waiter brought me two new ones that were wonderful.  He said that the person that normally makes the meatballs had to come in late so the manager made the first batch.  The manager needs to get his/her hands out of the recipe, because they were awful."}
{"text":"We wanted to order some soup to pick up.  We tried to order via the website, but the time of pick was changing by 10 minutes later every 20 or 30 seconds.  Although it was only 7:30pm, our pickup would have 8:50.  We decided to call instead.  The order via the phone could be picked up in 5 minutes.  We arrived home with hot, good soup.  However; the bread was rock-hard and stale.  I guess they figure they could unload the bread they would throw away since we wouldn't know it was bad until we got home."}
{"text":"So we placed and order for carry out from this restaurant and the service was good except that when we got home the breadsticks were cold and old and the chicken Alfredo was very dry no sauce and to make matters worse it wasn't even half of plate $14 not worth it for this amount of food!!!!! Very disappointed NEVER going back to this ghetto restaurant is horrible!!!!!"}
{"text":"Added a star to my previous review.  Solid place to dine at a reasonable price.  I always sit in the bar area, never had to wait.  That unlimited soup+salad combo, hard to find a better value. Can understand why the Olive Garden chain has turned around and become a big asset to Darden Restaurants."}
{"text":"We quit going to Olive Garden after we tried the new one on Cenntenial. n we figured we hated that one always liked this one. but our server never talked, forgot drinks. she never asked us for more salad. as we waited. She brought the bill n i said sorry were getting desert. then i boxed all my own food. n we put 100.00 in the bill folder n she just figured she was taking the 14. n some change. i had to sit. there for 13mins until. the manager seen i was pist. n then she went to get it. There food has went to shit and way smaller portions that when i used to go with all our family n friends. but totally done with this place... I understand people have bad days. n me n my hubby work for tips. n we alays over tip. but i am still pist on the whole meal."}
{"text":"OK.  So we don't have an Olive Garden in Hawaii.  You know how much I hate their commercials?  They mock me!!!  Therefore, when I was offered a chance to hit Olive Garden in Vegas I was in!  

All you can eat soup and breadsticks?  No lie!  Also, the service was excellent!  Our waitress was very patient and gave great suggestions for dinner.  So nice :)

My company mentioned that other Olive Gardens that they've visited were not as good.  I was pleased with this one.  We all stuck with the pasta and didn't go wrong there.

I'm planning on heading back the next time I'm in Vegas.  Hopefully I'll be super hungry and can get seconds on soup and breadsticks!!!"}
{"text":"I am mad. I like olive garden as a restaurant however they should not put noodles in their minestrone soup. It ruined it. My friend's kids meal was gross. I cannot be sure of this though, because I am a vegetarian. Also, our server was not good at all. Erwin P. needs an attitude change immediately."}
{"text":"The food was hot and fresh. The server was super polite and very attentive to me. The service was fast as well, no sitting there waiting to eat. I ordered and opened my Yelp app to being my review process and boom, my order was ready and I went to eating. I had just enough time to write the first sentence, and then it was nom nom nom . Great job OG on Happy Valley. You guys rock. Thanks for the great service and great food."}
{"text":"Ok I know 2 stars usually is something 'bad', and I sure wouldn't think Olive Garden is 'bad'.  However I go with the 'Meh.  I've experienced better' part of the rating very much.  I love Italian food, and have eaten at several Italian places over the years.  And while there is nothing bad about the food at Olive Garden, it sure does not stand out in any meaningful way.  If you eat there you will likely have a good meal, but if you eat at just about any other Italian restaurant you will likely have a much better one.  Ciao!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Olive Garden but not this one.  Apparently it is \"rogue\" OG because things I normally get were completely different.  My lunch companion and I both got soup, salad, and breadsticks with Zuppa Toscana.  The bread sticks were brought out before we even ordered which made them cold by the time the remainder of our food was brought.  A refill was never offered.  The salad was swimming in dressing where normally the dressing is light.  And the Zuppa Toscana was unrecognizable.  It was totally different from all other OG restaurants I've visited.  We had several different servers during our short stay.  I doubt that I'll ever go back to this location again."}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant and saw a great atmosphere. I asked for a vegan menu, and they said they had a vegan selection menu on their tap screen. All I saw that was related to vegan selection was a dairy free menu. On their dairy free menu, there were breadsticks, which are buttered. Their \"vegan\" manager claims to eat the breadsticks all the time. I began to stop trusting the dairy free menu, and was hesitant to take a bite of the pasta.

Atmosphere 4/5
Food Taste 2/5
Reliability 1/5
Other 3/5"}
{"text":"Olive Garden gets a bad rap. I love their salads, breadsticks, and every entree and dessert I've ever had here. The service is always stellar too. Don't hate on OG!"}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff. 

Food is delicious and well portion. Prices are great and it's family friendly. 

Decor is outdated slightly and too busy on weekends. 

Highly recommend for any occasion and parking is ample."}
{"text":"We like the olive gardens soup and salad and thats why i go there. So it was myself my wife and our daughter for dinner. We orderes the mozzarella appetizer which was good, i.ordered the soup and salad my wife ordered build your own pasta rigatoni with LIGHT oil white wine sauce with shrimp. My wifes dish came out and as the waitress was putting it down on the table she stated i know its not light sauce but the kitchen told me to try it anyways. It was like soup so we sent it back. The 2nd time it came out but not with rigatonis but with angel hair that was so overcooked it was mush so it was sent back again and then the 3rd time as the waitress is standing there my wife pulls out a very long black hair so we gave up on her dinner. 

Not once did the manager come over to apologize and left the waitress to take the heat and didn't empower her to discount anything. Mr or Mrs Manager quit hiding and get out to the dining room to see your guests. We had an older white lady which was great."}
{"text":"My husband and I had stopped going to this Olive Garden quite some time ago. It's not that we didn't like the food but the service was far from acceptable.  Once we realized that we were spending more time grumbling about our disappointing visit than enjoying our evening out we decided we would just do take-out going forward. This was a great solution as it was convenient, I got enjoy my salad with their yummy dressing and my hubby got to indulge in his favorites along with the warm bread sticks. Well, this past weekend might have put an end to that.

Before ordering we always their check their website since they have seasonal specials and they often rotate selections. I was happy to see that our usually selections were still available so we phoned in our order. 10 minutes later we got a call back regarding my item no longer being available. Fortunately I had a back up but felt frustrated that their website hadn't been updated. 

When we arrived, we parked in the designated spots for the \"car-side pick-up\", but I guess they no longer monitor those spots as we had to call them to advise we were there. A very pleasant attendant brought out our food and I quickly checked the bag... at that time the only thing I noticed was that my dish had broccoli instead of asparagus which wasn't a big enough deal to send it back. So my Hubby paid for the order and we proceeded home. 

After completely unpacking our items I realized that there was no salad dressing or croutons to go with my salad--seriously?! How can they forget their signature salad dressing?? I know it was my fault for not thoroughly checking EVERYTHING in the bag... but seriously. There were also no utensils, napkins or the thin mints we were so accustom to getting with our order.  On a happier note, my filet mignon was cooked perfect--it was my back up option on the Lighter Fare menu but certainly didn't cure my Italian craving for Lasagna Primavera. 

So, needless to say I think we're going to be searching for a new place to get our Italian food fix."}
{"text":"We've been to their restaurants in so many cities, and this outlet is on our favorites list! 
We were served by Paul, a very attentive waiter with a charming personality and infectious smile! 

The great thing about Olive Garden is the large variety of choices on the menu which are further customizable to suit your taste. The appetizers, entrees, desserts, drinks, the ambience and the waiters create a beautiful dining experience. 

My husband and I usually share an appetizer and an entree. We're vegetarian, and very happy with the menu options. We love the Fried Mozzarella, Lasagna Fritta, Cheese Ravioli with Alfredo Sauce, and the unlimited salad and breadsticks are a super A+!!! Desserts are great too but we're usually too full to order! Our bill is usually around $25 ... but it depends on your individual order."}
{"text":"I love this chain. My favorites are the Minestrone soup, House salad, Fried Mozzarella, Fettucini Alfredo and Cheese Ravioli.

Service was impeccable as always and the experience is always beautiful. But today I was surprised to find that I was charged $1.79 to substitute a marinara with an Alfredo sauce on my ravioli ... not sure if it's a new company policy or has been always. Nevertheless, always a pleasure to dine here."}
{"text":"I picked this particular OG because it is the closest offender, geographically, to my compound.

As succinctly as possible: you suck the life out of Italian Food, you bastards. You are the epitome of all that is wrong with corporate food service. The only way that you could add more salt and remove more life from your food is if you were called \"The Red Olive Lobster Garden\".

You suck. You know you suck. And you are killing people with your crappy food. Die.

(apparently, I have to give you 1 star. suck it.)"}
{"text":"My family ate at this location the week before Thanksgiving and I was extremely impressed with their customer service. I told them my daughter has Celiac disease and could not eat anything with gluten. The manager came over and took her order personally and ensured that the kitchen staff did not cross contaminate her food. Small gesture that meant so much to me and my little girl  I would definitely go out of my way to eat at this location again!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like delicious authentic Italian food and throughout the US, there is an abundant of family owned Italian restaurant. In this day and age, restaurant chains are a powerhouse in the United States. Olive Garden is no exception as it's one of the most popular chains with locations everywhere. Most of us are accustomed to their salads and breadsticks which is probably one of their main draw. Another, main reason is the value since most Americans are used to having larger portions at a reasonable price. My family and I, occasionally will crave Olive Garden or for the sake of just having Americanized Italian food. My parents are from the Philippines and Italian food is usually consumed by the wealthier citizens in the country. However, it's pretty much a middle class staple here in the States, LoL.

They have decent food and most times I do enjoy my order but this particular visit we had the privilege to be served by Luis, who was simply amazing. From the beginning to the end of our most recent visit was fantastic. Considering that it was a busy night and the staff seemed overwhelmed. He made sure we were ok and everything came out in a timely manner plus the food was hot and fresh which in most cases chain restaurants tend to forget. We will be back and will request Luis to be our server!

2017 Yelp Review #77"}
{"text":"I've always love coming to Olive Garden the food is always good but last Saturday I came to This location and  it was around 9pm and I felt rushed and my soup and shrimp appetizer was cold and it was frustrating cause right after the appetizer came out a couple of min later they rushed the food. Just a feeling of being rushed out of a restaurant is upsetting I'm not putting blame on the waiter I put blame on the cooks, like damn really cold shrimp and soup? Not worth the 75 dollars I payed for cold food."}
{"text":"Not that great; the food was not served hot. And if you are new to the states and coming from Asian country then this is not the place."}
{"text":"Great lunch today. We are disappointed with the over done breadsticks. :( The past few times we have been to Olive Garden, the breadsticks are dry and hard! Bring back soft breadsticks, or I'm done."}
{"text":"I enjoy Olive Garden and this is the location we always go to. The food is quite good with the exception of the breadsticks. The last couple of times they have been overcooked and hard. Prices have recently gone up so would like to see the food reflect that. Service is average. They recently got coke zero which made me happy but they have used the old root beer lines so the coke zero is tainted. They need to put new lines in. Had to change to a different soft drink which they are happy to do.  Will go back but if the breadsticks and service don't improve probably not as often as I used to."}
{"text":"We go every Friday after work to have dinner and unwind, sit at the bar and eat so we get served right away no waiting.  Bartender Mike is  professional and personable. The Chef is fabulous as our food is always perfect and served hot. A little pricey sometimes but they do have a lot of choices for lesser $$ items.  It is worth it though food is flavorful and fresh."}
{"text":"Salad & Bread sticks & Soup! Oh my! 

There are many a good chain restaurants & in my opinion this is one of the better ones. 

Light, casual atmosphere, good service & the food is not bad at all!

My favorite order is Zuppa Toscana, salad, marinara for the bread sticks, peach Bellini iced tea & a slice of lemon cake :D
This meal does make me a happy, happy camper!"}
{"text":"eh... a victim of location...

The franchise is okay if you want very basic italian chain restaurant food.

This particular location is more like the bar scene from star wars at times.
Rough crowd and very rude customers who have zero couth.
(Not the fault of the business, but nonetheless, its a defining factor)

The food is average, nothing special.
Overall, that's my opinion of this location as a whole."}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving pasta so they decided to come here. It wasn't very busy. I ordered a toasted marshmallow martini, which I think was good. I ordered the salmon with steam broccoli. One of my friends said order tour of Italy, and the other friend ordered black tie mousse cake with a vanilla scoop ice cream. Our food took forever! to come out. We were getting full off of salads and breadsticks. The table next to us, got seated after us and got their meals before us. Our waiter however, was very nice, he came to check up on us and apologized for the delay and tried to make things better in any way he could."}
{"text":"talk about bait and switch!!!  Do not play the stupid games on the table some games costs.   Make sure you check your bill."}
{"text":"Oh how I have been craving soup and salad! I finally got the chance to go and if it weren't for people waiting on me, I could have been there for hours eating the unlimited soup and salad for only $8!!!!  The service was great, a busy lunch time hour so we were waiting a little longer then usual, but the manager came around and helped our waitress which sped things along. I know that they don't bring an overflowing bowl of salad just in case we wont eat it, but they bring only enough for a few scoops and they need to start adding more in that bowl, I hate asking 5 times for more salad! Service was pleasant and the facilities were nice and clean!  Only complaint, what happened to the chocolate mints they used to hand out!!!?  We didn't get one and I was so sad!"}
{"text":"Any time we visit this chain we sit at the bar, since it's usually open seating and service is almost always great from their bartenders. Our server was quick to get our drink orders and we didn't wait but a few more minutes to place our order. We always get the same thing and it's consistent at every location, which is really what you expect to find at chains.

There were a couple of interesting patrons that came in for to-go orders while we waited for our food, but the staff handled everything flawlessly. Props for the good service and the ability to diffuse difficult situations from staff and management alike. 

We had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake at the end - which we have had on one other occasion - and it was delicious!  I recommend giving it a try before it's gone until next year.

Overall: A
Consistent food, great service, yummy dessert.  Good visit."}
{"text":"A pretty standard Olive Garden in a great area to shop around if you want more to do then sit and eat.  The restaurant was pretty busy and we opted to sit at the bar instead of wait for a regular table - most of the time bartenders are awesome servers anyways.  Side note: If you sit at the bar to eat be aware of the a/c units - they are directly overhead.

It was a Saturday night so college football was on and the crowd was a bit louder than normal in the bar area, but not a big deal.  The food was good as always and our server was very nice and checked in on us regularly.  

Downsides on this visit would include some of the kitchen staff coming out to take a peek at the game and touching a chair (i.e. my fiancee's chair who happened to be in the bathroom when they came out), the counter, the doors, and other items with their prep gloves on - then proceeding to walk back into the kitchen with those same gloves on.  We decided to pray that those gloves were thrown away as soon as they went back into the kitchen, and new gloves were put on.  However, the fact that they were touching things that we were touching with gloves that had who knows what on them was a big downer.  

Overall: B
The gloves thing killed a lot for this location - but considering the vast amount of Olive Garden locations we have been to in the past, it's not a norm and we'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"So I'd like to start off on a positive note, overall our experience was great last night. I would like to just point out something for families of 6 or more, including 5 ppl and one baby which is considered 6 bc of the high chair or sling. When they quote you 45 minutes to an hour or an hour to an hour and a half... they mean it. I say this bc I know there is a lot of ppl out there like myself who get a quote like that and look around the restaurant and think, \" yeah okay we should get back way sooner it doesn't look that busy.\" but like I said they mean it. They turned their waiting room 3x before we were finally got a table. We waited an hour and 5 minutes, they quoted us 45-1hr wait. I know some ppl are reading this and thinking, shut up you only waited 5 min after your wait time you knew about, but my point is. They cleared that waiting room 3x... we set there in an empty waiting room watching a new wave of ppl come in and leave for dinner. The manager spoke with us and was very polite and professional but I feel like I wish one of his hosts could have been more considerate and spoke with him like, hey maybe we should push two free standing tables together to get this family in, because that's what great customer service is but after last night it's clear that revenue is more important. Funny thing is a women who was leaving the restaurant that had clear view to the bench we were sitting at before we were seated said \" I just want to say you guys are so patient, wow I couldn't believe it blah blah blah.... I swear I'm not making this up it was funny but frustrating at the same time bc we didn't want to go up to the host and bother them but like seriously they made us sit there and watch families of 5 come in and be seated right away multiple times, your telling me they couldn't just put a family of 6 where a family of 5 are seated? Anyways the server was amazing, I loved her. She had short blond hair full of energy and personality. She really turned it around for us, I give her 5 stars."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is always one of my favorite places to go. How can you beat all you can eat breadsticks and soup or salad? I went on a weeknight, so the service at this location was a little slower than I would've expected it to be. There is currently a buy one take one home deal which is great, and I was able to add shrimp to the plain fettuccine."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden.  You go there for consistency, not amazing Italian food.  That being said they now have these stupid tablets on the table that you can essentially use instead of using a server at all.  They have games you can play for $1.99 on them.  What happened to the times of talking during dinner? It's bad enough everyone has a cell phone but now you put a tablet on the table? I can see it as wanting to cut down on labor but the also jacked up the prices! Was was once $13 is now $17!

The smoked mozzarella fonduta was horrible.  The cheese was like a giant piece of string cheese, it wasn't warmed enough and it wasn't gooey, just a blob.  The salad is good just like it's always been but for some reason you constantly have to beg for more salad.  My chicken Marsala was ok, the sauce was more of a demi glaze than an actual Marsala sauce.  Oh well. It is what it is, you always know what you're going to get there...nothing amazing and nothing unedible."}
{"text":"The service has really gone down hill, they have 0 customer service nor can they handle groups of 10 or more. What a shame this restaurant used to be good."}
{"text":"Olive Garden food is as you would accept it to be a bit over sauced and prepackaged. What keeps us coming is the standards Salad and bread sticks. Never fails to do the job in making your choice to \"OG it\" worth wild. Service is spotty sometime but not this time, our girl was spot on and was very personable. She gave me extra Andes mints so... The highlight and crazy surprise was something I would NEVER think about at OG... Hot Chocolate. It was very \"unOlive Garden,\" neither over sauced or prepackaged. Next time you go to OG, and you will, if there is even a bit of a nip in the air sir-press it with some tasty Olive Garden Hot Chocolate. 

Crispy, Out."}
{"text":"I ate here more than two times the place it's perfect and the food it's amazing i always ordered a salad and breadsticks and mozzarella cheese it's delicious and fettuccine alfredo i love it this is my favorite place"}
{"text":"Desde que llegué aquí la atención ha sido fantástica. Susana mi mesera es excelente, me recomendó diferentes platillos, me brindó la mejor margarita, dándome la mejor actitud que hacía mucho no tenia en un restaurante. Sin duda una noche para recordar. Gracias Olive Garden por tener un buen equipo de trabajo, tuve un pesado día de trabajo y ahora es confortable llegar a comer a un lugar con estas atenciones. Mi mejor noche. De hoy en adelante quiero voy a pedir a Susana sea mi mesera, pues ella es excelente."}
{"text":"The server makes the night so often, and tonight Breanne did such a great job!  She was there whenever we needed her, positive, but didn't over do it. Food was decent. The chicken parmigiana was sort of soggy, I think that is because they ore make them (not fresh), but I love the zuppa Toscana soup."}
{"text":"Always a great place to hang out with friends and have great food. This is my mother's favorite place to come eat and enjoy the Italian Charming food.. waitresses always look neat and well groomed, salad is delicious and so is the pasta.."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden really emphasizes excellent service in everything they do. 
Olive Garden is number one on my list for affordable Italian without sparing the classy ambiance. The food here is wonderful - I always start by sharing the smoked mozzarella fonduta before moving on to the always flavorful minestrone soup. Whatever you order for your entree, make sure you save room for dessert - the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is to die for!

But more than the food and environment, the customer service here is what makes this Olive Garden unmatched. I have never been greeted by a more cheerful and enthusiastic wait staff; they genuinely enjoy working there and making pleasant conversation with the diners. I always tip my servers well, because they really do make us feel like part of the family!"}
{"text":"We were celebrating 3 birthdays with what was suppose to be 15 guest but changed quickly with only 9.  Our servers name was Tony and was such a gentleman and very patient with our group.  Was very attentive to my youngest and ensured we were taken care of.  We felt like he always had us in mind first. Great service for such a large group and specific needs.  It was a perfect night with great food!"}
{"text":"I asked for pasta alfredo with just the sauce, and they added EVERYTHING that I didn't ask for. And then To fix the pastas they upcharged us for PLAIN alfredo noodles! Figure that one out?"}
{"text":"It's 4:30 pm on a Tuesday. We've been put a list?  Why it's  Tuesday.  So far we been waiting 15 minutes. Since we got here there are now about 18 people waiting for a table. This is typical for this restaurant. I been here numerous times and there is always a  wait no matter the time of day.  I guess they need to manage their payroll a bit better bring on  more people or cut the wait policy because it doesn't enhance the dining experience."}
{"text":"I understand why the Olive Garden is going out of business nationally. I went to this location after not having been to one for a long time. Olive Garden used to one of my favorite places to eat but my how have the times have changed. Boy oh boy was I disappointed.  Everything I tried was lackluster. The Chicken Gnocchi soup I had barely had any gnocchi in it at all and it was 90% spinach. The breadsticks were rock hard and lukewarm drowning in butter.  I ordered my all time favorite dish from Olive Garden: Chicken Marsala. It was awful and had no flavor but mushrooms.  Remember when the Tuscan potatoes were actually real to goodness roasted potatoes?  Now it's fried taters like at a country restaurant."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is always good for those who enjoy Italian cuisine!

One of my favorite old standbys and they treat Veterans especially well on Veterans Day. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"The manager here was great...our server, Kimberly, was wonderful and we had another server, Rodolfo, checking on us regularly as well. It was the fasted and best service I've gotten anywhere in a very long time. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time visitor, and if I lived in the area, I'd go back often! The salad was crispy cold and delicious. The shrimp alfredo was piping hot and delicious as well. My server was lovely. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was a regular here for years and wish I still could be. They changed the chairs from the comfy chairs on wheels to really hard wood chairs with such sharp edges on the seat that it hurts the back of my legs. They also have a new policy, local if not corporate, that the volume of the music be loud enough to cover conversations at nearby tables. Unfortunately, that makes it difficult to have a conversation at your own table. In addition, I always feel like first and foremost the staff and managers view this as their place of employment. They hang out with each other and have private conversations right on the floor around the customers. They have staff meetings at the beginnings of shifts, talking loud enough to disturb patrons, and leaving tables waiting for service. 

All of these issues overshadow the actual food, which is pricey enough ($24 including tip for yesterday's meal of shrimp alfredo & a coke) to make me not visit frequently anymore when I can go elsewhere and be more comfortable for less money."}
{"text":"I've been to this Olive Garden quite a few times, dining in and to-go. Overall, the food is on par with other Olive Gardens and the service is good. I would recommend this place if you are in the mood for Olive Garden. My favs are the Tour of Italy, Seafood Alfredo, and  Tiramisu."}
{"text":"I have just one word for this restaurant AWSOME. 
Loved the food and the dessert. Special thanks to our server Cooper. He explained us the menu and was very courteous. 
A must visit for all. Waiting to go back again"}
{"text":"Yes, I went to the Olive Garden. Had I not had a $25 gift card (one year old), this would not be my dining spot of choice. We went on a Saturday afternoon around two and the place was packed like a proverbial can of sardines. The wait ended up only about 15 minutes.

Our waiter plain and simply had charisma, energy and a good sense of humor. Nowadays, there are tablet computers at every table which can be used to do everything from Playing games, viewing a menu, calling for your server or paying a bill. Pretty neat technology. My kids kept themselves fully occupied the entire time. What wasn't neat was the $1.99 game fee they tack on your bill at the end. Was there a screen that alerted us to the fee? A click YES screen? Maybe, I don't know - but it would be a nice touch for someone to point this out when you are dining with kids (especially smart, tech savvy ones who like to purchase things when their father isn't watching).

The deep fried artichoke heart appetizer was probably the best thing I ate here all day; really nice dish served with a lemony aioli. Entrees come with your choice of unlimited breadsticks and soup or salad. I am a salad lover, so even though it was a fairly generic bowl of salad and dressing I could appreciate it. The kids enjoyed their meals (ate everything) and I like that it included the drink (no one likes a separate drink cost). The flatbread was okay but my chicken parmesan (you probably even tell in the picture) looked like that old lady on the beach who has been tanning so much she looks like a leather handbag. It was way overdone. Had I been given the opportunity, I would have told someone it was overcooked. \"Oh well\" I thought, \"I probably won't be coming back here anyway\". I know they serve /cook a lot of meals here in a day, but this chicken should not have left the kitchen. I think this is probably a decent place to come during the week for a quick lunch but for more of a sit down situation, I prefer Romano's Macaroni Grill, Carrabba's or Maggiano's - the quality is like night and day. Even with the gift card, we owed an additional $30 - a pretty pricey lunch for a chain."}
{"text":"Food continues to get worse every time we eat there. They used to have an extensive vegan menu. No more."}
{"text":"Called in a take out order for 5 people.  A $112.00 bill.  Picked up order and asked if everything was there.  Got home and were missing kids drink, calamari appetizer, kids side item and the extra dressing we asked for.   This is the second time we have placed a take out order and have had problems. The food we did have was wonderful."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in a very long time... we live in Scottsdale so the one on Cactus is a lot closer. We came to this location after a church program... it ran pretty late so we got there after 9 p.m. there were a few large groups ahead of us and we were a group of about 16 so we did have to wait quite a bit. We were told the servers left due to slow service earlier and they were called back so that's why we probably had to wait a while. Once we were seated we were greeted by two friendly employees and ordered our food with our drinks. The food came out pretty quickly and everything came out just as we asked. The food is always delicious and the service was great! We will definitely be back... we will try not to come so late next time!! Sorry!!"}
{"text":"In the last few years I've tried my best to like this place. I've came 4 times and each time I'm less and less impressed by the quality and flavor of the food. I usually order shrimp Alfredo which if less and less impressive. This last time, new years eve; I ordered a sausage ravioli and it was so bland. It tasted like a frozen dinner that I could buy at frys. I bought 2 meals for 35 dollars and did not like either. I will be choosing to spend my money elsewhere. Sorry olive garden."}
{"text":"In my life I've never walk out of the resturant for 19 years. I understand it was a busy night and we have to wait to be seated. But!!!! The problem was after seat, we been seated as the same time as the next table got their main meals. I was so shock that they finish and we still didn't get any server to ask for how is you day~~. The table next to my family left, so we decide to leave too, cuz it been like half hour without any server come and say hi. Be aware on the busy night, cuz u might wait like an hour to get ur meal."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden. 

The location is good though, it's a nice area. This is one of my favorite Olive Gardens to go to."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an olive garden in years. I was gifted with a gift card, so I decided to go have lunch with a friend. 

The all you can eat salad and breadsticks is never a bad deal. 

The drink I got was fantastic!

Tonic water with berries. Very tasty and no suger added."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner... Or I should say, I intended to have dinner tonight at this restaurant.  I waited about 30 minutes to be seated...during that time I saw 5 people walk out... Several spoke with the manager because they had been waiting for a hour and a half...  I thought... Nah, it would not be that bad... I was seated... I then was ignored by the wait staff for 15 minutes... Finally, the waitress came up and I tried to order.  She warned me that it would be likely an hour more...at this point, I was at 45 minutes at this restaurant... Not even a glass of water.  I said I don't want to be here at midnight for pasta and walked out... They started a promotion today and we're understaffed...  I will not waste my time here... I need to add that the manager was rather rude to a pregnant woman.  This all happened on 10/3/16 from about 6:45 to 7:30"}
{"text":"I did not like our server. She was a little boring and seemed like she didn't want to be around the customers. 

However! The food was fantastic! I had the bruschetta which was very, very yummy. 
The chicken and dumpling like soup was amazing. I loved how creamy it tasted, yet at the same time it wasn't heavy. 

And finally? The Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. Oh my goodness, it almost tasted like my mother's. The breaded chicken was fabulous, for some reason I expected it to be very bland. 

Overall, other than our server: I loved it. I was able to ignore her and happily enjoy my food. :)"}
{"text":"I have been going here ever since I was a kid. The customer service has always been amazing. The newer food options are different than the traditional, but mostly everything I have had has been great. My favorite is the Chicken Parmigiana! It never lets me down!!"}
{"text":"I love getting the soup and salad  the Zuppa Toscana is my favorite cheap light lunch I especially enjoy the dessert zeppoli those are my favorite also with the warm chocolate sauce at the side"}
{"text":"I got take out the food was good but the worker that waited on me was rude and didn't thank me for the tip I gave him."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in the neighborhood and come to this location quite frequently to eat and have some drinks at the bar. We have always had good, friendly service.  The 2 for $25 is our favorite! Also I recommend their Pinot Grigio if you are a wine drinker :)"}
{"text":"The BEST Olive Garden I have ever visited... hands down. What made my experience here so amazing was the quality of service from every single member of the staff, from manager to busperson. The waiter assigned to our table was great, but I was impressed with the fact that any time they were in the area, other waitstaff came to check on us regularly. Everyone provided phenomenal service including suggesting menu items, ensuring our drinks were always full, etc.. I have been to Olive Garden Restaurants across the country and have never had a service experience this phenomenal. It was so good that I left about a 50% tip! I highly recommend this location and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great, great salad. The under 600 calories menu is very good, and so are the favorites. The bread sticks, enough said."}
{"text":"The endless bowl of salad is so awesome and I always go chicken parmesan. Bread sticks her money every single time if not I always ask for a new batch service is pretty good and the peach tea is outstanding."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a late lunch with my three children. Although they ordered off of the kids menu are excellent server saw that they were \"older \"children and brought their peach tea in regular size glasses. Our server was on top of it from start to finish and was one step ahead on everything. Food was delicious, excellent size portions for the kids. We sat against the east wall and I felt like the tables were a little bit too close to each other, but other than that another great meal at the OG!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is always awesome. The salad, pasta, and deserts are absolutely amazing.  The prices are reasonable and I like this location because its on 215/Charleston. One more thing their to go car side pick up is convenient and fast"}
{"text":"I haven't been in an OG in probably a decade or more as the brand just got tired. I was pleasantly surprised with a dish of Rigatoni. Will I come back ? probably not since most Italian meals are scratch and at home and I know whats in it. I would recommend it to others"}
{"text":"gotta love the O.G.! came here the other night for dinner with my roomie because we were craving some breadsticks. great menu, great service. they had a lot of new items on the menu too. i had the seafood brodetta, which was kind of like chopino without the crab. it was good, definitely different from the usual pasta dishes. they were also giving out samples of the lambrusca wine....dangerous. this stuff tastes like grape juice! obviously i had to have a glass with my meal. =P who cares if this place is a chain? i still love it!"}
{"text":"I realllllllly wanted some minestrone soup!
So, we went out to dinner, ordered our drinks and food at the same time (I ordered chicken alfredo w/ soup and my husband order tour of italy w/ salad).
Got our drinks shortly after, he forgot to bring lemons for my water (I won't drink my water without lemons). Shortly after we got our drinks we brought out the salad and breadsticks, which was great. BUT, not my soup or lemons!! After the salad and breadsticks are completely gone, out comes our entrees, STILL NO SOUP! I had to ask for my soup and when I got it, it was horrible. The waiter would disappear and hardly checked on us.
I seriously HATE going to this location, every time we go the service is HORRIBLE!
Definitely will not be returning to this location, I would rather drive 15-20 mins to another location then to have to come back here."}
{"text":"Every time we go it gets worse and worse.  I feel like I am always being rushed to get in and out.  Food is just mediocre.   Worth the time to make it at home to me"}
{"text":"Food was great. Waiter was great. For got my to go box and was left outside looking like a dumb ass but im sure they have their reasons"}
{"text":"Went with my best friend for appetizers. Dana was our server. Very sweet bit in the end she 'Checked in' way too much and inserted herself in the convo. Way too much. Hard to complain bc she was a sweetheart but overdid that. It was difficult me to focus on my social conversation bc it became a source of distraction. 
Food was good especially the naughty lasagna appetizer. Never met a fried food I didn't like but love this one."}
{"text":"We were too tired to cook, and didn't want fast food. My wife suggested Olive Garden.  Sounded good at the time. Ordered simple. Spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs. Knowing the amount of sauce given for the amount of noodles, I asked for extra, extra, extra, sauce. I even stated I would pay for it! Well I got extra sauce, a very small amount that barely covered a meatball. SMFH. Standard salad. Breadsticks. I do t remember what my wife ordered, but she wasn't too thrilled with hers either. When the best part of the meal is the salad dressing, you got problems. As it seems with all corporate owned restaurants lately, quality and taste has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Waiting at the bar for a to go order when I hear the bartender tell a new employee that one of the other bartenders got hand, foot and mouth disease from the murky bar washing water. GROSS! Train your people how to NOT have these types of discussions in front of customers. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD KEEP YOUR RESTAURANT CLEAN!"}
{"text":"Usually my customer service at any Olive Garden location is up to par, but last night was a mess. 

My best friend and I decided on a late dinner and went in around 9pm. We were told there would be a 15 min wait so we decided to wait at the bar. The guy behind the bar said we could sit there and dine in for dinner at the bar top if we chose to do so, which we ended up doing. We had heard of the buy one take one deal and were looking high and low for that option but weren't given the menu so we asked our bartender. 

I'm pretty sure he was new because he wasn't sure what deals they had going and if the buy one take one special was still active. I had eyed one of their promotion menus with the buy one take one way down the bar and pointed it to him. 

I had ordered a glass of wine and he kept double checking the bottle? We both ordered our selection and waited maybe 20 mins. My friend received her dish and everything seemed to look fine. My dish came and the first thing I noticed was about 3-4 pieces of pink chicken. It was not cooked at all. My friend looked at my place and I noticed the bartender look at my plate also but didn't say anything. My friend said shockingly to him that my chicken wasn't cooked. He took it back and said it would be a couple mins. About 2 mins and another bartender brings the plate back. I STILL noticed that my chicken was pink! It was like they just went to warm up the plate expecting it to cook and bring it back without checking. She noticed that the chicken was still pink and took it back again. They went back to the kitchen and said they would make me a new one and brought the old one back and set it on the bar top. She had said she told the manager. Our original bartender came back with the new dish for the third time! 

It shouldn't take 3 attempts to cook chicken! No apology came from the manager. He just came out and looked at the dish and didn't say anything. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I typically love olive garden it has always been a go to for us when we want to dine out. Today's experience was a complete disaster.  Our waitress was nice and all but my the meat on my lasagna was Uncooked and I mentioned it to her and her response was let me ask the kitchen then she didn't say anything else about it the rest of the night I had to stop a manager and explain to him and his response was we went with a new meat sauce so it just taste different.  Ummmmmmmmm no its not cooked I don't think that is a different sauce taste! Then I get my bill to find I was charged for an extra meal and drink she had to take my ticket back 2 times to get it right. Now I have an additional $50 charge on my card because she ran it twice and now I have to wait for it to fall off! Horrible experience, if you are going to spend your money on a meal pick somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Started with a bit of a snafu.  We were quoted a 30 minute wait.  Our buzzer went off about 35 minutes later.  When we went to the hostess stand, they said they seated another group who said they were us.  I asked if they had one of the OG's pagers like we did and the girl said no.  I was a little peturbed because we  woke a sleeping toddler and then had to wait another 15 minutes before they found us a booth.  They clearly knew they made an error and apologized and offered us a free appetizer for the blunder.  After we were seated it was smooth sailing.  

We ordered the fonduta for the app.  I would not recommend it if you're paying for it.  The gouda sliced cheese the put on top is not melted, so it's a bit odd.  The poppyseed bread it's served with was tasty however."}
{"text":"This is a nice above average location. Good food and service. Our waitress was super fast and very happy."}
{"text":"Soup and breadsticks! What's not to love? Our server kayla is really nice and she is doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Took our family for dinner and we had a great experience! The dinner was great, and the service was excellent! Joey especially took great care of us making j sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group the service was awesome, drinks were always filled and very helpful with the menu. The atmosphere was great and not to crowded on Cinco De Mayo. The food was perfect, had the birthday cake for dessert very delicious. $153"}
{"text":"We stopped by for an early dinner.  The atmosphere here is really bad.  We had a family seated next to us that insisted on having the audio for their movie on max.  The staff noticed, but said nothing.  We asked for a new table.  The staff was reluctant to move us, as we would be placed in someone else's section.

Service was slow.  I can't comprehend why there were so many people standing around doing nothing.  Our salad took 15 minutes to come out.  Our drinks were only refilled when we asked.  There were 2 other tables seated on that side of the building.  

If the restaurant invested in some training, there would be no need for the ridiculous tabletop kiosks.  

The food was good, but there is too much competition in the area to return."}
{"text":"Chicken & Shrimp Carbonara is a dish that can't be beat at this location. Lots of food, tasty large portion of chicken and shrimp. I could barely get thru my portion it was so generous, but so yummy I found that I couldn't stop eating long enough to take the remainder home. 

I don't usually order an appetizer, but we had the calamari. Sadly, we could have done without it, frozen and way too much fried breading. Not horrible, just not very memorable either.

I wish I could remember our servers name, cuz she was GOOD. Shame on me, I'm usually better than that. Very attentive and after we finished each course she asked if we wanted more (i.e. soup, breadsticks) and our drinking glasses remained full without us having to ask.

This place also usually has good discounts & coupons available in local media and online, which can always be helpful."}
{"text":"First time ever at Olive Garden.  I have seen the poor reviews.  Service was good, place was clean and I actually enjoyed my shrimp & crab pasta thing.  I thought $50 was a little much for 2 people to eat with only having water to drink.  Drives me nuts to pay good money for pasta you can buy for .88 cents."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my family. They have some new menu items they are promoting. The one I selected was the smoked Mozzarella chicken.  I ate some and when I got to the half mark I saw this lake of oil in my bowl. I called the manager over who said this is normal. She offered me another one to take home. No thanks. Not sure where Olive Garden is going with their new items that cost $17.50 and come with a complimentary quart of oil. We should of gone to Oreganos."}
{"text":"the food was good but the server spilled iced tea on my shorts and did not say anything was kind of in shock when the people at my table noticed and she didn't wont hold it against her but cant give them over three stars for that Fumble"}
{"text":"I ordered the $11.99 special (unlimited breadsticks and salad/soup with a choice of pasta as the main course) and it was truly disappointing. 

Maybe I came on a bad day, but my pasta was very bland and flavorless. The server only came by twice to check on us, and overall I felt rushed even though it was not busy. 

Note: when they say unlimited breadsticks/salads/soups, they will only give you 2 breadsticks and a small soup/salad at a time... My friend and I waited almost 50 minutes for our food, so of course we would be asking for breadsticks and salads every 10 minutes. Our server looked at us like we were crazy every time we asked for more of the unlimited appetizers. I looked around and other tables received bad service too, one couple even got up and waked away."}
{"text":"I worked for OG in another state a few years ago. I admit I have a high standard when it comes to service because of my past. I can honestly say this was the best OG experience I have had outside the store I worked in. Our server was super busy but that never kept us from being taken care of. The staff worked as a TEAM to ensure the pace of the meal was as good as the food itself. This included the managers who were both present in the dining room and not afraid to get their hands dirty. 
I have been to a couple other Olive Gardens in the area and one is dissappointng and the other, well, we don't go to that one anymore and it is the closest to our home. We will gladly drive an extra few miles to go to this one. So happy to have found our new Olive Garden home!
P.S. The rosemary chicken with garlic mashed potatoes is CRAZY good!"}
{"text":"The food here is yummy!!! The unlimited soup & bread sticks are my favorite lol 

Service is great but hate that you can't make a reservation. Services is great."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with the hubby. Sadly it was very disappointing. Started with cold soup and salad we were rushed through eating because our food came in 2 minutes after we got our soup and salad. I told our server my soup was cold and he offered to get me a new one, but we already had our food and I didn't want to eat new soup and then my food gets cold. My husband ordered rigatoni and meatballs, I ordered ziti. Both were bland with no flavor to write home about. My husband didn't even eat his meatballs. Shouldn't that have been a red flag to our server? Needless to say we let it go to waste. The manager stopped by the table but only because she saw me filling out the survey at the table. She did offer dessert but sadly the experience was already ruined. We won't be back."}
{"text":"It was ok, once more people started showing up to the restaurant the service kind of went down. The food was just o.k."}
{"text":"Meh not my best experience at a OG. 

Sat at the bar . Service wasn't quite the best . We ordered soup , salad and breadstick combo . We had to flag someone down to ask for more ( it's unlimited). We also got calamari . I don't mean to be harsh when I say it was the worst calamari I've ever had .... Ever. It tasted like it wasn't cooked . I also got a drink off the happy hour menu, don't do that either . To be fair I know many restaurants pre-make their happy hour drinks ; it just tasted like I was drinking the bottom of a concentrated juice container . I suggest getting a different happy hour drink like wine or beer . 

I did learn you can sample wine for 25cents before you commit to a full glass . 
 
The original soup I got seemed to be the last bowl of the pot, not so good but my second bowl was much much better  . 

All in all I think it was a awkward time to come . It was 3pm so the switch between lunch and dinner was prolly happening . I suggest coming during lunch or as dinner is starting ."}
{"text":"i didn't want to cook and a quick search of the gift card pile turned up one for the OG so we burned it on takeout. i gotta say i'm slightly annoyed they don't do curbside to go. it really isn't that hard to send someone out to my car is it? 

traffic control in the lobby was an issue. service was slightly better than incompetent. but, you get a massive amount of food. massive. unfortunately, it wasn't the greatest food ... i know you're surprised. don't lie. the cheese ravioli was just not good. dry pasta with and completely no flavor in the filling. sauce was scant.  while saucier, the chicken alfredo wasn't any closer to being a winner. the only real winners from the meal were the surprisingly tasty lasagna fritta, the salad and the breadsticks. which i guess makes sense.

in fairness, i must admit that everything was packaged extremely well. the salad tasted just like i remember it from years ago. i like olive garden salad a lot."}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews but I had to for this experience.

I don't have high expectations when I go to Olive Garden. Not because it's a bad restaurant; simply because it's not a particularly fancy restaurant. I go there because I like the food and I think it's worth it to brave the noise level. 

Normally I expect about 2 hours from checking in with the hostess to paying the bill. This dinner only lasted a little over an hour. In no way did I feel rushed, however. It was actually very nice to have things move quickly as my parents and I had just been traveling and we were extremely tired.

Our waiter, Philemon, was very polite, courteous and attentive. Our drink and food orders were at our table within about 10 minutes of ordering. The only issue we had with the food was that my mother's Chicken and Gnocchi soup didn't come with any gnocchi. We're not really sure why that happened but she ate all of it so apparently it didn't bother her overmuch.

There wasn't anything necessarily spectacular about this experience but it took me by surprise and I felt I had to share. I definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"I've been to many olive Gardens but this one by far was superior. My server was courteous and attentive. We ordered the unlimited pasta bowl. It came with either soup or salad, and chose soup. It was a creamy cheesy soup that was superb. I also ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce and crispy chicken. Only one order was enough because they served plenty of food."}
{"text":"The server was great, the salad dressing was on a budget(it's usually dripping), but the bad part was the smell, remove the carpet please."}
{"text":"So I was craving pasta, hadn't ate it in almost a year. So finally the hubs agreed to try out this location {he's not a pasta fan, but likes it's okay enough to take me lol}
So the waiter was very nice. Informed me after we ordered ours drinks that they were out of strawberries for the mango strawberry tea. That's fine, I got the peach raspberry tea instead {pretty tasty}.
Waited for a good while before offered salad & breadsticks. No problem...
Then our food came out, but before our appetizer. Kinda odd.
We both got the shrimp & chicken carbonara. I never have to add salt or pepper to much of anything, but this was kinda bland. The only thing I really enjoyed was the stuffed mushrooms.
Did I get my pasta fix? Sure. 
Will I go back? Probably not.
Good waiter minus the appetizer problem. 3 stars"}
{"text":"Super good! Tyler took great care of us! My boyfriend and i always get dessert first this time we got the pumpkin cheese cake and butter cake both sooo good!"}
{"text":"One of my son's favorite places and we love this Location. We've always gotten great service here."}
{"text":"Not only is the service great, but the technology that the restaurant has incorporated for guests. It was great keeping a track of our order, and contacting our server on the device while eating our pasta."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but on the other hand the service is a bit mediocre. Me and a guest came here for a quick dinner only to have our server be non existent. We were seated promptly but waited over 15min for water, I mean come on really? Brushing this off we ordered immediately after receiving our beverages. Food came out a little faster than our initial service for drinks which was ok in my book. I mean it is what it is, the food is good for what it is but the service can use a little bit of help in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden! We have been here quite a few times and the food is always delicious and consistent with other olive gardens. Cute decor and tables and restrooms are usually very clean. Hostess is always friendly and if there is a wait they manage it well. Service is spotty, we've had some really good ones and we've had some pretty bad ones. Something that makes them unique is one of the servers is a professional opera singer! Very cool if you go on your birthday :-)"}
{"text":"Wonderful attentive waiter!  Had the delicious eggplant parmesan with their delicious salad and breadsticks.  Excellent coffee too!"}
{"text":"We just dropped in on a weekend evening and the restaurant was packed. We were given 30 minutes wait time to be seated but after 10 minutes we were given our table.
There are lots of food/pasta options on the menu; I tried the Olive Garden Trio which had 3 small portions of Lasagna/Parmesan Chicken/Pasta and everything tastes really good; portion was enough for 1 person.
We tried couple of different wines by glasses and they were just OK. Overall good food quality, service was good, atmosphere was good, kid friendly environment.
Price is a bit on the higher side. Location on the NE, parking availability is good."}
{"text":"Our Waiter JD is very friendly and talented. Awesome balancing skills!  Quick service. Portions are huge. My daughters children's Mac n Cheese was more then even I could handle!  My soup was hot and full of large chunks of meat and dumplings.  As always the hubby devoured the salad! 
This location has great high ceilings so the noise is mild.  The waiting area is a tad small and can get congested quick!  
Overall the experience was great! Will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Went here twice within 1 week's time. Both times were great, second was better since we were seated at a booth and had more room than at a table. Both times we were offered a free sample of their house wine, first time the Rosata (my favorite) and then the white one the second visit, which I was only able to take a couple sips - The Rosata is a winner and I am now on a hunt to find it out of OG so I can have it at home whenever I want. Ordered Endless Pasta and hubby loved his angel hair, alfredo, meatball dish and I always get the corkscrew, meat sauce and sausage - yummy.  Servers were wonderful and helpful throughout refilling our drinks, soups and bread, always checking on us and even packed up leftovers.  It's too bad others have had not so great experiences here, luckily I haven't had any problems with my visits - hopefully this keep up."}
{"text":"Make sure to get amber as your waitress! She moves fast knows her menu very polite. She's slim and short but she gets the job done and keeps smiles on everyone's faces. When the place is busy she doesn't fall behind and let's you know what's going on at all times"}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice and attentive. The food was just ok. The ambience was nice. The wine tasting was a good add. The salad was fresh and flavorful. The thing is o wish they would improve the dishes so they are more authenticate Italian. Overall we would come back mostly because it's close to home."}
{"text":"I won't say names, but to start off by saying our server was bad. Horrible service. He said he would be back in 2mins to take our order and kept pushing us off twice when we were ready to order. Took him 25mins to come back to our table and he acted like we hadn't been waiting for him. Food was ok, he asked me if he could bring me another drink I said sure by that time we had got the check and it was too late and we got charged for it. So I had to say something to him about it. And I saw my drink had been sitting at the bar. I know it's busy and all but he needs some more training on multitasking. People who got seated after us got their food way ahead of us and left before we got our meal, that speaks volumes. Its all about service. His whole presence wasn't good. Overall go to another location for better service, one on Cheyenne is great and same thing with the one by red rock casino."}
{"text":"I had Devin S. for lunch on November 2nd and he was extremely good at his job. As a fellow server, I can appreciate the craft for what it is and I wanted to applaud him on his work. Normally I write on receipts but I didn't have the option here. My friend and I came it to have a delicious lunch and acted slightly obnoxious as per usual with us, and Devin handled it very well, keeping us laughing. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"It did not surprise me that there was a wait at a new location, but there were probably 8 employees behind the hostess station looking like they had no idea where they were. After our name was on the waiting list, (40 minutes) I could not find a place to sit, so I thought there may be room to sit in the ladies room. On my way to the bathroom I had to wade through about 50 servers milling about in the aisles. This is a big location, but there is no way they need a staff of 200 inexperienced servers to stand around looking confused in groups of two.

We did wait less than the predicted time, but I think that was due to the fact that the people in line before us were no where to be found when their names were called. We were seated at a decent table, but the building is loud and overcrowded, so we couldn't hear each other talking. That makes a meal awkward enough, but we were also being interrupted constantly by servers delivering items to our table that were meant for other tables.

Our server was nice and tried his best, but I think in general they trained these servers to up sell and serve wine samples, but not on practical things like table numbers or order timing. When I saw the new menu, it made more sense since they are obviously all about the money, money, money. The prices have gone up! I suppose they need more money to help them pay the cost of the new building and maintaining an army of untrained servers to run around being useless and blocking fire exits all the time.

Our entrees were served before we had a chance to eat our salad and the appetizer came out 10 minutes after that. I guess they were going for a reverse dining experience. The food came out so fast and inappropriately timed that I felt we were being rushed out. Combined with the loud atmosphere and the numerous people stopping by the table it felt like eating at a parody of a good  restaurant.

The food itself, while served way too quickly, was also not very good. I am a fan of Olive Garden, so I am not sure if they changed the menu or it is just being executed poorly. The salad was gross and rubbery, my fettuccini was bland and my boyfriend's ziti was so salty he was draining Lake Mead with all the water refills. 

The appetizer was okay, but honestly I'll eat pretty much anything as long as you deep fry it. Additionally, it is hard to enjoy an appetizer when it comes out after you've already started your actual meal. With that much food on the table you start to realize how much you are pigging out right now. Nobody wants to be reminded of the call to Jenny Craig they will have to make as a result of this one meal. The server did apologize for this, but no one offered to take the appetizer off the bill... or even to take it back. Just shut up and eat your pile of food, fatty.

Even though there were people everywhere throwing food at us and asking us how we were doing at the beginning of the meal, they all disappeared at check time. I guess they get yelled at a lot for those sneaky upsells? The manager came by after several minutes, but we just wanted to give them our money and leave by then. Honestly, this Olive Garden needs to call its birth mother and get some guidance about how to win at being a real restaurant. Maybe we will try it again in a year. Until then I think we will stick with the Red Robin right next door."}
{"text":"I've been at the doctor's office all morning long and feel awful. Stopped to get some soup. The girl wanted me to go in to order. I asked if I couldn't just call inside or give my order to her. Apparently, that was asking an awful lot. I got a face and an eye roll. So, I guess I'll be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good food . My server was awesome my son is autistic and is picky about food. she helped me with my order for him and he love what we order for him."}
{"text":"Ok so there are 2 reasons why I'm writing this review. 

1. I love lasagna. I'm seriously Garfield's long lost human sister. 

2. Creepy people make me go into uncontrollable rambling fits. 

I know some people may be offended by this, but I LOVE Olive Garden. I know, I know it's not \"real\" Italian food. I don't care. I love it and you can't stop me. Not to mention, they never look at me all crazy when I walk in there with my ripped jeans and/or ripped t-shirt, my hair a mess in a pony tail, and sporting my rockstar sunglasses because it's way too f-ing bright outside (thanks Vegas heat!). I'm sure I look like I have been living on the street for a week but they don't care. They are always polite and the wait is never long. 

After we are seated, I just sit and impatiently wait for the person I'm with to figure out what they want. I never browse the menu because I get the same thing every time, can you guess what it is? =) So then the waiter or waitress comes by and we order quickly. Sorry waiters and waitresses of the world, but I am the quiet order-er. I can't help it, but to make up for it I will point to what I want on the menu so if you can't hear me, at least (hopefully) you can read. Also, I don't want you f-ing up my order. I do this because I'm shy and if, by chance, I can't pronounce it.. I don't want to sound like a speak n spell. 

I'm a people watcher so I spend a lot of time looking at other people in the restaurant and the employees there. I will usually find someone interesting and make up their life story. Yes, I'm easily amused. The waiter/waitress will bring out bread sticks and I will proceed to hoard them and keep them for my own.. unless the person I'm with is very persuasive. So we get our food, which is always the same and always good. That's when it happens... 

The manager or whatever starts lurking around the tables, watching people eat and looking for his prey. I don't like to be observed like an animal at feeding time, so I carefully track him throughout the meal. Always careful to never make eye contact and slightly slouch down in my seat to avoid detection. Why am I doing this you may ask.. because if I don't, he will make a beeline straight for our table and start asking how things were and blah blah blah. I can appreciate the fact that leadership or managers want to make sure their business is doing well but here its all so FAKE. Every guy at every Olive Garden who is concerned how they are doing is fake fake fake fake fakey mcfakerson. It annoys the crap out of me and since I can't even put my big girl voice on to order, I definitely don't want to talk to them! It just comes off as creepy, like someone just put in fresh batteries and so they are all juiced up with fakeness. I usually remain silent at this point and let my poor dining partner fend for themselves. Sorry, but now you have been warned. 

Basically what I'm saying is stop being a creepy fake. Don't stalk me while I'm eating and don't talk to me unless you are trying to pump me full of bread sticks!"}
{"text":"Chris the manager does a great job. Had a bad experience at another Olive Garden. Chris was very apologetic for that bad experience. Roger the waiter was on top of his game. Will be back, Food was good ."}
{"text":"We got seated right away which is good.  The service was good.  The only down side is the recipes could use improvement, but it was a good break from eating at home."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with family and friends on my birthday at Olive Garden on flamingo. We've been to that Olive Garden 100s of times but for whatever reason this time was a disaster. So many issues and problems with food & drink orders. We are so very disappointed with the service, no discount was offered or anything it even took forever to get the bill."}
{"text":"One star solely due to the fact I cannot give \"0\" stars.  I have tried ordering to-go.  What a joke!  I have tried ordering on weekdays/weekends and regardless of which day ordered- the food is wrong and they are sooooo slow.  I could walk to another location before this place can provide the food ordered and paid for 30 minutes earlier.  I arrive at the time indicated on the on-line ordering request and it never fails- I have never received my food on time or even 10 minutes later than the promised time.  It is insane.  I provide feedback every time I am there and it never fails to disappoint me....the staff is standing around and socializing instead of fulfilling an order.

I am searching for a new pasta place as Olive Garden has finally broke my desire for Italian food."}
{"text":"Im usually a big fan of the OG but lately has lost a little bit of its luster. 
The last few times I have ventured in it has been Ridiculously loud.. Louder than the average restaurant should be.. Ive become accustomed enough that I either pick and choose specific times to avoid the crowds or have meditated long enough to tolerate the noise level.. 
This last time I had a waiter who seemed to have left her customer service skills at home.. I had to ask for drink refills (my personal pet peeve) she was stingy with the breadsticks and would bring out straws silverware and dipping sauce in what I would consider a timely manner. Im not sure how much of it was her or how much was me but either way I was impressed. 
But, its OG, so i'll be back.. !"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review based on the fact that we sat there waiting for a table for over an hour, while people who showed up after us were seated quickly. We asked to speak to a manager. She apologized and admitted that we were \"forgotten\", but didn't offer us anything for the long wait. I thought she would have offered a discount, if not a free meal. We walked out and went to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"I have been here 20 times and the staff from greater, wait staff, bartenders, managers Have been excellent busy slow always the same great service. Have had orders not made to my request and instantly fixed, mangers always come by asking how everything is. The food is excellent"}
{"text":"I love this place- sometimes I crave their house salad and zuppa soup so we go for date night.  The wait can be long on a weekend night but here's a tip- eat at the bar!  Usually there's room and no wait.  If it's just you or two people, eating at the bar beats waiting in line for 20 minutes, especially when you are hungry.  The space is huge- I've seen them fit 10-15 people groups in to a semi-private space.  Really good prices and they always have specials going on.  I usually bring home leftovers."}
{"text":"Typically get above average service for this side of town... which is saying a lot. I have given complements to managers for great service many times. The food is always served as you would expect it from every location, they are on point with their recipes. When you come in here you get to escape the fact that you are in a rougher neighborhood. Best salad for miles and it comes unlimited with your meal!"}
{"text":"Best service I've had in a long time at any restaurant! The server Laura went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and taken care of she was super nice and was very attentive. And the food was cooked to perfection and  came out quick hot and most of all tasty. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"First I'd like to say, I haven't eaten at an Olive Garden in years, and this is the first time I've eaten at one located in AZ after moving here in 2009. I've got to say... this place is disgusting! I felt like I was eating at a soup kitchen... and the people around us (other patrons) made me lose my appetite because they were disgusting as well. The menus were all stuck together, the wine glasses were layered with spots (might've been used?). If it hadn't been for my wife's severe shakiness and sick feeling from not eating, we would've left before ordering our food. Also, when my wife got out of the car upon our arrival, she tripped on a stump from a dead bush that was never removed after it was hacked to death, which actually tore her big toe open causing it to bleed profusely. We then informed the General Manager of the incident who was nice enough to give us a \"discount\", although not comped. We both vowed to one another that we would never attend another Olive Garden AGAIN!      
What a far cry from Houston's Streak House (we eat there a lot). Anyhow, we ate at Houston's on our anniversary last year and someone had stuck their gum under the table when they were done with it, which in turn stuck to my pants at the knee. I mentioned it to the staff, which by my surprise gave us a $20 bill for professional cleaning, comped our $100+ meal; AND....? Told us if the cleaners couldn't fix my pants, to let them know and that they would pay for a new pair of dress pants. The $20 didn't get the gum out, but I didn't go back to them to have them replace the pants. I liked looking at the spot where the gum had remained as a reminder of good people and service! Thank you Houston's!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a highly enjoyable experience thanks in part to our great server Robin who deserves a shout-out. Our service was top notch, non rushed and perfectly paced. 
Enjoyed the salad (who doesn't love it) and perfect bread sticks. My entree of the garlic Rosemary chicken was perfect for me under 575 calories and I took half home to enjoy for lunch the next day. 
My friend is somewhat picky so all of her requests were handled with grace. 
I love Olive Garden and would not hesitate to go to this location again."}
{"text":"Been to this location plenty of times, but this time around was the best service ever! Our server's named was Betsy and she was very pleasant and super attentive. This location was a 3 star but after this visit it deserves a huge 5!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 or 4 times and have always received great service...the only reason why I come is for the zuppa  tuscana soup and breadsticks so I can not comment on the rest of the food. They seem to have a lot of new items on the menu, including some yummy looking desserts."}
{"text":"For some reason they where super busy but we got in by the bar .. But I have to say the two that was working that area where on it big time .. Before we left I told both of them how good they did .. I figure you always hear the complaining never enough good job .. So good job to you both! Hope you liked the tip I left you ...you deserved one better than 20% at least on this night you did ... Yes I would come back to this Olive Garden"}
{"text":"The Olive Garden is bad. Not to jump on the hate train here without just cause, but I went in here a few months ago after being enticed by an almost too good to be true special. It had to do with all you can eat and pasta and I think it was like seven dollars. 

The moral of the story: You get what you pay for. 

The pasta was so bland that I can't even think of an adjective to describe how bland it was. (Did I just blow your mind?)

Service was friendly and as good as it could be but half-hearted, sorta like they knew the food was bad. Hmm. Go figure."}
{"text":"Well, sum sing wrong!  Our server was Maria R. She seemed a little off, just waited 15 minutes for wine, brought out the soup-what happen to the salad? Just poor service.  At the and our bill was $12.05, we could have paid that and left but were honest, went up to the front counter, told the girl our bill was wrong as she never charged us for the two soups or salad.
Everytime I eat here there's a problem, no matter what one I go too"}
{"text":"My family & I eat here pretty often & our service is usually great. We decided to order to go since it was late & yes we were aware that it's Valentines night so they are most likely busy (which was fine). I've never ordered to go, so I enter in the front & approached the front desk & being that of course, it was busy looks like the 3-4 employees working, were trying to figure out a seating situation. I stood their patiently for a minute, a couple comes behind me a few seconds later & gets helped first. The hostess sits them down & when she comes back I then ask her for help. I was fine with waiting, it was more or less that she had an answer back to me. Instead of maybe saying I'm sorry or something else for that matter. Thought this was really rude & inconsiderate as to the fact that I was ignored & clearly was there first.

Went to the Togo window & they said they were still waiting for some of my food items, which I was perfectly fine with waiting again. Long story short, when I called in the person that took my order, made a mistake and rang in for tomorrow instead. They let me know of this so I was aware & I was still fine with waiting. 15 minutes later our food was ready and the kitchen manager comped our order, props to you definitely appreciate it. Thank you Togo department."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at the Olive Garden, I had the 2 for $25 dollar special and enjoyed a lovely dinner with my family for Father's Day! We were so lucky to have Tyler ( from Texas) as our server, he was so efficient in made sure that we are treated as Family. He took our order and made sure that our food was prepared and boxed correctly. I highly recommend this Olive Garden and will be sure to return. Amazing food, experience and service!!"}
{"text":"We are frequent diners at this location and have had consistently great service in a booth in the bar area!!  We have been lucky to have Bridget as our server on several occasions and know we are in for \"great attentive service\"  when she welcomes us back."}
{"text":"The waitress here was phenomenal!  Just me and my niece out to dinner and she was so attentive to her and patient.  Foods always great!"}
{"text":"We went there today and beat the mad rush. Our waitress Suzi was on the ball.  Drinks were never empty, food was fresh. We got all you can eat pasta and when we were done she hooked us up with to go boxes of fresh pasta and bread. The meatballs were a good size too. The place got packed while there so that goes to show you the food is great and the place is clean with team work of employees."}
{"text":"Good carryout fast service offered me an Arnold Palmer free of charge as I waited for my order. The bar staff are fun!"}
{"text":"Nothing like the soup salad and breadsticks.
We never actually sat down and waited for a table because for some reason there is always away so we go straight to the bar since we know we're going to get faster service that way.
Yeah we are nondrinkers but still going to the bar is a Way faster service to get our favorite breadsticks lol
I absolutely love coming to this Olive Garden the staff at the bar are so attentive they're so funny also the managers always come over and talk to us.
We've never had a bad meal everything we have had so far tasty super yummy we always try new specials that they have. we're on the rewards program so we gets a little perks like a free appetizer or free dessert. Definitely can't beat that"}
{"text":"$80 worth of trash. My 'shrimp scampi' sauce tasted rancid and the shrimp was not cleaned properly and tasted fishy. They were also small af. Not worth $16. My brother ordered a pesto dish and the bottom was covered in tablespoons of pure oil. Disgusting. And his noodles were hard as if they weren't fresh. Neither of us ate but a few bites and filled up on breadsticks. My daughters Alfredo sauce tasted off and her chicken was dry."}
{"text":"Our server brought out the entrees immediately after bringing out the salads & breadsticks.  Then the table was cluttered because we had so many dishes on it.  Usually the service is good.  Disappointed considering our bill was $65."}
{"text":"Would of given 5 stars, but service is SLOW! Food is good, but be prepared for a long evening!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Olive Garden experience i ever had. I been to there location many times already, and today I had the worst server ever. My server never come to my table to refill the sauce and my order were off. The server was talking to other table most of time, and she ignored our table multi times. We waited for over 20 minutes with empty water cups and wrong order. All my friend done eating their meal and my meal was just sitting  in the edge. Stayed hunger for over 30 mins and server never apologized for the bad service. I would never return back."}
{"text":"We waited more than an hour for our breadsticks... The waitress mixed up our drinks (and ultimately our checks) at our table, left our waters empty for over 30 minutes, and we didn't have any salads or after over 30 minutes of waiting. The people all around us, who arrived after us, got breadsticks and salad and yet we got nothing. 

When our food finally came, the waitress asked one of us if we wanted cheese, started grating, continued grating after the person asked to stop, lost attention to her task, and then grated cheese on the person without realizing it. She then left the table, came back a few minutes later, and continued grating cheese on the same person's food.

The ageism at this restaurant is ridiculous. We came for our friends 21st birthday and it was horrendously ruined. Abysmal doesn't even begin to describe my overall experience at this Olive Garden. The fact that we were seated at 6:45 and didn't leave until after 9:30 should speak volumes about how the restaurant treats their customers. The worst part of it all? We were never once offered an apology for the lateness or for getting cheese grated on us.

My recommendation: Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Love Olive Garden! My family always has the best time eating & drinking it up! We get the 5 cheese dip 1st & then onto Fettuccine Alfredo - Chicken Parmigiana- Lasagna - salad - breadsticks & zeppoli's for dessert!! Wine flows & bellies are always full!"}
{"text":"Had this last Friday night & it was amazing! Got the Tour of Italy to share. Had the 5 cheese dip which is sooooo good, along with breadsticks & salad. Chicken parmigiana was !! Candice had the tiramisu- Gma got the Sicilian cheesecake & me & Kayleigh shared the zeppoli's with raspberry sauce- fantastic meal with a nice big glass of wine. We love splurging every once in a while!!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch today at this location today around 3. There was a wait so we sat at the bar. The bartender was pretty busy as well so it took a few minutes to get drinks or menus. I had a strawberry mango daiquiri which was great! The food was typical of any OG chain I've been too. It was delivered hot and the wait for it was minimal. Breadsticks seemed to have less butter and seasoning than usual."}
{"text":"Fantastic service by our waiter Tim. If he is not available ask for Greg, or Mona. Lisa the Manager is friendly and she is visible on the floor  throughout the night . I've never had bad service at this particular location and all of the servers help each other so the place runs pretty efficiently.  We did not have a wait because we came around 430 but by the time we left around 600 the place was packed.  Olive Garden is a family style restaurant so those who have complained about screaming kids are just complaining to complain. You can't please everyone but OG does a pretty good job doing it at this one. We had the Shrimp and Crab Ravioli - No bay shrimps here either. Lovely smokey cheese sauce, not too heavy and not garlicky (my Nemesis). We also had the new baked pasta with the beef and spinach. That dish is enough for two to share and our last dish was the cheese ravioli in meat sauce. For our appetizer we had the toasted ravioli and the stuffed mushrooms. We never wanted for anything, drink refills, soup, salad or bread sticks. The food was perfectly spaced between courses so no food (Or dirty dishes)  piled up on our table. I say this is a 5 star OG staffed with very efficient friendly servers and fantastic management.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"me and my wife had a great time this place recently. pretty fast service and food is average. Nothing make you wow but you can't complain 4 course menu for two people for $25.00. that's make you stuffed and take home the leftover too."}
{"text":"Olive garden is one of our favorite places to eat before we moved to Surprise. This was a horrible experience mainly due to the wait staff. I hope Angel was new because he doesn't know what he is doing. We had to grab him after ordering because he never asked us which side my son wanted. Then we had to call him over for refills of drinks and bread when he came by and looked at out table several times. We were planning on ordering desert but he brought the bill over and never even asked us if we wanted anything.

The food was your typical Olive Garden food. Bread sticks we're good. Baked ziti was pretty good but we probably won't be back due to the staff."}
{"text":"We came here from out of town for dinner with our three kids.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  Upon delivering our dishes I was brought the wrong dish.  The server was very apologetic about the mix up and went to fix the order.  This mix up actually gave me the time to split my kids meals and let me finish my salad peacefully.  Minutes later the server returns with the kitchen manager (I think) and the manager apologizes for the inconvenience and gives me my dish on the house.  WOW now that's excellent customer service without me even expecting or asking for that.  Job well done Olive Garden!!!!!"}
{"text":"PROS:
-Phenomenal service :)
-Free breadsticks, soup, or salad with entree
-You don't need to order appetizers because the entree + free sides will be enough AKA $$$ saver :D

FOOD 5/5:
-Breadsticks/salad (FREE): Breadsticks are yummy & crispy while salad had basic ingredients (lettuce, tomato, olive, crouton, and mozzarella)
-Chicken & Gnocchi Soup (FREE): Very impressed with this soup. It's creamy, and it has chicken, dumplings, and spinach. 
-Ravioli di Portobello ($14.99): Raviolis stuffed with mushrooms with cheese and tomato sauce. Super delicious!

END NOTE:
This isn't a high-end Italian restaurant, so you're basically getting what you paid for. Overall for the price, I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars because of our wonderful waitress, Haime. She was on top of everything and constantly checking if things were okay or if needed any help. If it weren't for her my rate would be 3-4 stars because of the food. 

My \"create your own\" pasta wasn't the best. The noodles dried up like it had been left in the window for a while before it came out. And my sausage had to be brought out separately that I ordered on the pasta that was forgotten about. (Kitchen's fault, not our waitress) I'm not picky so I just asked for an extra side of sauce so I could just mix everything. 

Haime, you go girl! Fantastic service and you were so nice and awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been two Fridays in a row and the first night the service was awesome! Our waitress was spunky and very attentive, she even gave my younger brother a small dessert for graduating from high school!! How nice was that?! :) This past Friday was a totally different story though :( our waitress was nice put not attentive at all; we did not get timely refills on drinks, salad or bread sticks! I even heard the customers behind me complain about how slow she was with even bringing them their checks! Oh by the way, my food was cold and I had to get it prepared over and by the time it was brought back to the table everyone was finished eating and I had to take mine home to go :/"}
{"text":"We come here ever so often and we sit in the bar because the girl behind the bar is amazing. Tonight we came in, saw her there and was excited to sit in the bar area. Well she always off, and still helped out. Erich was amazing too. Very helpful and on top of everything!! We are so fortunate to have a place to go to with amazing service on a Sunday night! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came in around 2pm for the Soup,Salad, Bread combo. I think the waitress was a little annoyed by this but she warmed up through the meal. She brought refills and I ate like a whole basket of breadsticks myself..oops..she did offer us to put our drinks in to go cups which I really appreciated as the drinks are a bit spendy and it was very hot. This was something I noticed servers in PHX offered but here in Vegas it never happens. The food was good and timely..."}
{"text":"Today my cousin offered to take us here for lunch! I must be honest, I haven't been to Olive Garden in YEARS because of the service and the food wasn't that great. But today this wasn't the case, my cousin was RAVING about the new duo deal that they offer during lunch time. All you can eat soup and salad. I simply told her if it wasn't all that you're making it out to be I'm going to be MAD {that's what really hungry people say} LOL!

When I walked in I was IMMEDIATELY blown away by the beautiful upgrades, yes its been that long I didn't know that had updated the location. The bar was beautiful, the Italian wording on the walls, and they even had bottles of wine in glass cases on the wall. It had to be about, not sure who or how those are kept clean but kudos to that person lol.

We were seated by our hostess and provided menus, shortly after our server came out. I liked how prompt she was and she greeted us with a smile and her name... VERY important. Alex offered the wine sampling for us and offered to start us with waters. We knew what we wanted to order so we all went with the soup and salad. My cousin and I had the Chicken and Gnocchi - A creamy soup made with roasted chicken, traditional Italian dumplings and spinach, and our other cousin had the Zuppa Toscana - Spicy Italian sausage, fresh kale and russet potatoes in a creamy broth. Made with gluten-free ingredients.

After finishing up our third round of the unlimited soup and salad we were able to able to take what we could not finish home. I was happy about that, usually, when restaurants offer unlimited you're not able to take what's left on your plate and the restaurants throw it away. This made me very happy, and as i'm typing up this review i'm enjoying my leftovers. 

Happy Cusotmer!"}
{"text":"Our server Carrie was terrible. I was very excited to enjoy an afternoon date with my significant other and honestly, it was quickly ruined. She took at least 4 minutes to greet us, and didn't even introduce herself. She went right into asking us what we wanted to eat for lunch. No drink or anything. She didn't seem like she was in a good mood, and that didn't change throughout the whole meal.  We ordered drinks, salads, an appetizer, entrees and dessert to share.

when Carrie brought our meals out, our drinks were empty, salad bowl empty, and not once had she been back to check on us. I asked her if our fried calamari was coming out, and she proceeded to tell me she forgot to place the order. So we canceled it out completely.  The meal itself was Apsolutely delicious, as always. As we finished the meal, we ordered dessert to go. I asked multiple times for it to go. And when she brought it out it was for dinning in. She once again said how she didn't hear me. She then brought out boxes and gave us the bill. It pained me to leave her a 15% tip. But working as a manager myself in a restaurant I normally tip 20%-30% minumum. I really wish that we would have just had a different server to make our dining experience better. Very dissapointing."}
{"text":"All you can eat pasta is a favorite in our household, along with the Zuppa Tuscana! Gets very busy so join wait list online."}
{"text":"I shouldve gone to Bravo.  The service on this trip was poor.  My mussels were run to my table long after I had finished eating my main course.  I ate the mussels anyway, given they tasted a lot better than the capelini pomodoro that was clearly nuked.  For dessert my girl and I got the 3 shooter sampler, and the waiter had no idea what we were talking about, so I had to hold up the table tent and explain slowly what each shooter option was and which 3 of the six we had established we would try while waiting for his return from Oz.  He got only 1 of the choices right.  This trip was very disappointing, from the time I entered the restaurant by walking past the back of the house employee smoking on the bench beside the door to the dessert shooter debacle. Again, I shouldve gone to Bravo."}
{"text":"The meal was the best we've had at Olive Gardens.....while the food is always good at Olive Gardens......it was the best ....service, cleanliness, management looked like they really cared .......but the best thing was a bus boy....we were seated in the farthest booth to the left of the host's station......I went to wash my hands and asked the young man \" where are the rest rooms \" he said 'please follow me \" and he walked me to the other side of the the rest (opposite end ) it was very nice that he did this........... knowing he was busy busing the tables.....he cared about the people and his job !"}
{"text":"My family liked their food but I found the salad which I used to love was really salty from the dressing. Tried both soups which were fails to me. Personally, I would find another Italian restaurant if you want a good meal. Front of the restaurant had a \"cat piss\" smell. Has gone downhill in my experience. As a sidenote, our waitress was very good."}
{"text":"I had to choose a restaurant to write a critique about for one of my classes. Here is some of what I wrote, upon entering Olive Garden, it is noticeable how the pricey menu items are not enough to keep people from entering. The wait is expected to be 25-30 minutes, however, the doors are unable to remain closed for long as starving families and couples come in and exit the establishment, having their hunger satisfied. To say the least, Olive Garden in one of the best restaurants I have tried, and I am glad I picked this location and restaurant to write my critique about."}
{"text":"I was given a gift card for Olive Garden--a restaurant chain that I have not been to for over 15 years at least.  I decided to use the gift card today and I went to this location near my home.

Service was the reason why this review is less than stellar and it started at the host podium.  A woman didn't acknowledge me but walked away to get her ear piece in.  When she came back, she said it would be a short wait as they were cleaning the table.  The place turned out to be 2/3 (at least) empty.  Soon, another host came over and she got menus and gave to a young man who took me to my table.

I was soon asked by my server if I wanted something to drink, iced tea perhaps.  That ordered, I looked over the menu and made my decision.  When my iced tea was brought, I ordered the chicken and gnocchi soup for a starter and the chicken Margherita--one of their \"Tastes of the Mediterranean\" dishes.

Within a short time, the server brought my soup and two breadsticks.  The soup was OK.  I wanted to avoid pasta because I've been spoiled by our independent restaurants that make their pastas in house but I didn't want minestrone.  The soup was OK.  

The chicken was quite good.  The menu describes it as \"Grilled chicken breasts topped with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, basil pesto and a lemon garlic sauce. Served with parmesan-crusted zucchini.\"  The lemon garlic sauce was well executed.  There were two small pounded chicken breasts with cherry tomato halves.

Here's where part 2 of service became an issue.  I ordered the cannoli trio.  When the server brought the dessert, I moved my dirty main course dish to the side of the table.  The server dropped off the cannolis and left the dirty dish on the table.  As I was eating the dessert, the server dropped off my check and said, \"No hurry with this.\"  Still the dirty plate remained.  Just as I had finished the cannoli, the server asked if I was paying with cash or card.  (What happened to no hurry?)  My gift card was already in the black book and I indicated that.  The server left and the dirty dish remained.  It was only after the server brought my slips back and explained the amount left on the gift card that the dirty plate was removed but only after two people at the next table had gone and as the server cleaned that table, my dirty dish was taken along with the other table's.  I had to ask for a refill of my iced tea.

As for the cannoli trio--supposedly imported from Italy--the shells had the softness of not being fresh.  The strawberry filling tasted very artificial.  The chocolate was OK but the classic cream was the best.

All in all, a very mixed experience.  How long does Olive Garden train their servers?  It's obvious that some need re-training or a refresher course at the minimum.

Since I have some credit left on the card, I'll choose a different location to clear the credit and then I'll avoid Olive Garden for another 15 years."}
{"text":"So overall, we had a lovely experience at this location last evening. The guest service was absolutely the most wonderful I've had in quite some time! Before your meal, they serve a basket full of breadsticks which are pretty tasty. For our appetizer, we had chose the \"create a sampler Italiano\" option in which we picked calamari, fried mozzarella, and pork ravioli. The calamari was tender, lightly breaded, and fried served with both a parmesan and marinara sauce. The fried mozzarella was absolutely delicious and the pork ravioli was pretty decent.
Before the entrée, they give you the choice between a soup or salad. I ordered a Caesar salad and my husband ordered the Zuppa Toscana which is a type of creamy potato soup served with greens. The soup was absolutely spectacular! Unfortunately, quite a few pieces of my romaine lettuce in the Caesar salad were mushy and overdressed. 
My husband ordered the Cheese Ravioli and enjoyed it. For my dish, I ordered the grilled sausage and peppers Rustica. The consistency was perfect...the penne was al dente, peppers were tender, and the Italian sausage was flavorful. However, I felt that they went slightly shy on seasoning and spices which I adjusted with table salt (and I don't really do this at a restaurant too often.)
The waiter was absolutely delightful and packed up our food for us. The portions are quite generous so you will most likely find yourself taking home leftovers. He generously also packed some wonderful mint chocolate candies. Overall, we had a nice experience."}
{"text":"We ate here on June 8.  It was a little late in the evening - later than we usually have our 3 year old out.  Our sweet little boy had disappeared, and the GRUMPUS had arrived.  Oh crap.  We feared we would have to get the food to go.

Then along came Molly, our server.  She took our drink order, and immediately started engaging with our son.  Without our having to ask, she brought him out a complimentary plate of black olives, which he loves to stick on his fingers.  (He gets that from his uncle on his Mom's side - definitely!)  Before long, the Grumpus was banished, and my sweet little boy had returned!

As with most Olive Garden restaurants, the food was very good but not outstanding.  But you don't go to the Olive Garden for Gourmet.  In short order, my ravioli, my wife's lasagna, and my boy's mac-n-cheese were demolished, and we were all very happy campers.

Molly got a 25% tip.  She earned it.  If you have a grumpy kid, ask for her section.  We also made sure to get her manager to the table and sing her praises.

We will be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Olive Garden to visit in the Valley. Friendly service and tasty food. I always get the Seafood Alfredo and he gets the Chicken Scampi-You can't mess those dishes up ;) Simple, but always a pleasure to visit and see old friends!"}
{"text":"3 stars because our waitress was very nice.  Our appetizer was the only part of the meal that was not messed up. Literally everything else, check included, was messed up. Probably will not be back to this location. Always have issues"}
{"text":"Barley a 2 star. The food was good the service simply was not good.  Out server was very nice she took our order,  we got our good but then we were just forgot about. Ordered auce soups and salad. Only got 1 salad and 1 soup after a 30 min of waiting finally got someone to get is a second bowl of soup.  

This is strange because I have been to this location several times in the past and have never had a problem even with large parties."}
{"text":"Olive Garden generally has a long wait time, but going to eat at 5:00 PM on a Saturday you would expect the wait time to be less.  We arrived on 3/3 and entered our name from the website on the call a head seating.  The website said generally a 20-25 minute wait.  When we arrived to the host stand to let them know we were there the hostess said it would be a 20-25 minute wait.  Well 25 minutes came and went.  After waiting 35 minutes I walked back up to the hostess stand and the lady said it shouldn't be that much longer.  The total time turned into 1 hour wait.  The website and the hostess shouldn't quote shorter wait times unless it's accurate.  Once we were seated I could immediately tell what the issue was.  Not enough wait staff to accommodate the people waiting to be seated.  There were plenty of empty tables and chairs.  In fact entire sections were empty.  Out waiter was great but had to take care of several large parties spread out over the restaurant."}
{"text":"First off I want to say I usually love the Olive Garden.  But tonight was awful. Never ever order food for puck up!  I ordered fettucini Alfredo with chicken, zuppa Tuscany, and breadsticks. Total was $18 and change. The pasta was so dry I could barely eat it! Where's the alfredo sauce? Definitely no breadstick dunking. Not even enough to coat half the pasta. And 2 breadsticks was it. For $20 bucks this was very disappointing. The only reason I gave 2 stars was the soup was good.  Never again will I order pickup from this restaurant,  and I'm probably going to have to find another convenient Italian place. Bummer."}
{"text":"I wish I could say something different than most of the other comments but alas I cannot. The service was the worst I have had in some time. We waited ten minutes for two glasses of sangria, when that finally arrived the waiter took our order (some couples combo that included an appetizer). The the size of my drink was quite small so I finished it rather quickly and waited for our server to have another ten minute personal conversation with the table next to ours meanwhile we were still waiting for our breadsticks and salad... After about ten more minutes the waiter showed up with the breadsticks and salad. At that very same time our main entree came out. We sent it back since we had not had our salad or even our appetizers yet. I then ordered another drink. Ten minutes go by while we gnawed on old cold breadsticks and soggy salad still waiting on my drink and our appetizers while intently listening to our waiter recall his hometown antics with the table next to us. Finally the drink and appetizers arrive after about five more minutes, shouldn't have waited for it though The ravioli was cold and chewy, I mean cowhide chewy... Then our main course comes back out. Back out as in from the heat lamp. One bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm. Needless to say after a small chat with the manager explaining how I would not return due to poor food and even worse service we left without being charged. In the end, save your time, save your money, and do not eat here, there are much better establishments in champaign."}
{"text":"Went with a part of 11 for a birthday party, service was terrible. The waitress was reaching across the table with hot plates, even asked me if I had a rag to grab the plate because it was hot? My girlfriend ordered a beer with the initial drink order and got it 10 minutes after everyone else got their drink. Orders another with dinner and had to go track down the waitress to see where it was. On the way saw 4 servers cleaning up a plate of food they dropped near someone's table.
The Manager seemed very annoyed that we were unhappy with the service, she did offer to make an adjustment when she realizes her apologies were not going to be enough.
Overall, the food was fine but the service was awful. I would drive to Carabba's next time instead."}
{"text":"We went to this Olive Garden on December 3rd and were blown away by the wonderful service!  The food was, as always, filling and enjoyable.  But the attentive and professional level of service was what made this Olive Garden experience one to remember.  

We will be back!"}
{"text":"This spot really surprised me, it's a cookie cutter Darden restaurant chain. But the food and service were really good.

Fancy style menus, with classic Italian fare, nothing really stands outs but has all the regular common dishes. 

We ordered their grilled stuff mushroom, unique right, were really good that followed with an Alfredo pasta, unique again right - that was really delicious. from a chain like this which is bag and heat operation food is pretty darn good - and the service was great too

In summerlin is the only late open Italian spot."}
{"text":"Very good! Olive Garden may not be cheap, but the quality of the food along with the pleasant atmosphere make it worth the price. This location in particular had very nice wait staff who accomodated our every request. During my most recent visit here, I tried the shrimp scampi and it was very good. After I save up some more money, I'll have to go back."}
{"text":"This was an overall terrible service experience and when the food finally came out, it was also bad! We were greeted promptly and the waitress was nice, we all ordered 3 waters, but we didn't get them until 15 minutes later. Nor were we given any bread or salad. When she finally got back we ordered dipping sauce for the bread and placed our order. She didn't bring the dipping sauce or salad for another 15 minutes. When the food came out the pasta had next to no sauce and was very very dry. We asked for some more sauce and again didn't see her for another 15 minutes. Our drinks barely got refilled and we had to ask. I waited for the manager to stop by because I could see her at other tables, but she never came to ours. I understand they were busy, but this was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Chrissy was my server! She was so sweet! We never had to ask for refills, our food was timed perfect to arrive once our appetizer was completed, and the hostess made sure to open the door for us on the way out! Ask for Chrissy!!"}
{"text":"They say check the bathrooms of an establishment and you'll know how clean they are in the kitchen. Well, today I went straight to the bathroom and I was met with over flowing trash cans and not 1 but 2 toilets that were stained with feces. I'm so grossed out. The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is because I've been here before and never had an issue with the food or the service. This was a disappointing experience. They need to constantly be checking the bathrooms. Not to mention, today's service was slow because according to our waitress, she didn't notice us sitting right in front of her. Geez."}
{"text":"My and husband and I frequent this location often (mainly Friday or Saturday night). To my surprise, there's usually a wait of 5 mins or less whenever we go. This is a good thing considering the locations back in my hometown (Pembroke Pines, FL area) ALWAYS have a minimum wait of 30 mins no matter which day it is. But moving on.... The food is pretty good, paired with Cabernet (as long as it isn't too dry). The best server there is Leo!! He is so chill and just plain good at what he does. He's never disappointed us yet (except when he isn't the server where we get seated ). Over all, we always have good experiences on each visit."}
{"text":"We had a large group of 11 and had 2 people taking care of us the waiter and waitress were awesome and food as usual very happy with Olive Garden except for an overcharge that was corrected"}
{"text":"Is there anything worse then no stars you can give something that this Olive Garden deserves from the hostess to the server who rang up the two go order very unprofessional. Save your money and don't go. Only to get it posted is reason for one star"}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden. I love the salad I get it with Italian dressing and ranch on the side and mix it together, then dip my bread sticks in it. I drink the peach iced tea and both moscatos red or white both delish. I do not venture into the new items on the menu other than drinks because I was disappointed twice to many. So I just  get what's on the OG menu. Oh and yes service is great here, even on the east side."}
{"text":"I really love the salad, dipping my breadsticks in ranch, and the peach iced tea"}
{"text":"We take my 95 year old mother-in-law to the Olive Garden in McIntyre Square in Pittsburgh's North Hills for lunch on a monthly basis.  They consistently spring into action from the moment we pull up to the curb and get her out of the car into her walker.  They hold both doors open and seat us ASAP.  The wait staff is always very attentive, courteous, friendly and efficient.  Today's wait staff person was Jennie, and she earned 5 stars for her today's meal.

This is the level of service that we have had the good fortune to experience for the past several months, so it's no accident.  Kudos to the management and all of the staff for making our visits so enjoyable.

The restaurant's decor is very nice and reasonably authentic (we were in Tuscany last September, so we know what it looks like there).  Do pay them a visit and enjoy the great menu and their good food.  I can't say enough good things about this Olive Garden restaurant and it's staff."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a weekday. There is a shared parking lot with plenty of parking. When I entered I was greeted and there was a wait. I went to the bar instead for immediate service. They were not prepared and were severely understaffed. The bar tender was stressing and dropped some alcohol. When people left the serving areas weren't cleaned. It was quite a unique situation. The persons in the kitchen were able to make some great tasting food in a timely manner. I had soup unlimited with a chicken pitta sandwich and a desert cup of strawberry whites chocolate. It took a while for the food to come out but it was hot and good. That was the best part about the experience. I was asking several times for other needed items like water, silverware, etc. I don't know about returning during lunch hours....."}
{"text":"This was my second time at an Olive Garden and this time was so much better even though my last visit couldn't be considered bad. We had a party of 8 and were seated after almost no waiting. We were given the family room which gave us more of an intimate private experience. Our server was really patient with us as they introduced us to their wines, allowing us to sample a few. 

The food was super filling and delicious even though I honestly didn't care too much for my chicken Marsala. The soup we got was never-ending and they were more than happy to give us our refills. 

They offered us 2 sauces for our breadsticks but offered to take it off our check when we told them we didn't know that they weren't complimentary and we didn't care much for it.

All in all, I think my friends would agree with me when I say that we had a great experience at olive garden."}
{"text":"First time dining at Olive Garden and I like it. They had me at unlimited salad, soup and breadsticks but we had to try their linguini de Mare and their herb grilled salmon too. Stuffed! 

The salad was fresh with just the right amount of dressing, my zuppa toscana was warm and comforting. The linguini de mare was oh so good with lots of juicy shrimps, mussels and roasted garlic. I used the breadsticks to soak up the pomodoro sauce from the bowl. The husband loved his grilled salmon and  broccoli too. He actually insisted we give Olive Garden a 5*

Our server Shaunte was welcoming, helpful and just wonderful. Oh and I got a complimentary black tie mousse cake just for signing up to their mailing list. 

This is a family-oriented restaurant. We will be back but next time, I'll stick with the soup and salad."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing negative to say about our experience tonight! The weight was half the estimated time,  half off wine and beer,  our server was as cute as a button,  and the food was spot on!"}
{"text":"Food is good and consistent.  Prices are beginning to get a bit high.  Service is generally pretty good also."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Olive Garden since I was a little kid, but tonight was by far the best Olive Garden experience I've had. Our server for the night, Tabbie, was absolutely amazing. She was kind and sweet and definitely knew what she was doing. She is 100% the best example of superb customer service and made us feel like a part of the Olive Garden family."}
{"text":"Morgan was the best server I've had here! She's so sweet. So kind & patient with us. I've never had someone take care of us how she did. 

Great person, funny, accommodating. 

My order is very annoying, & she was so understanding & nice about it. 

This girl needs a raise! Thanks so much Morgan!"}
{"text":"I would like to start my review but saying that when I go out to eat, I am extremely understanding and patient when it comes to service and expectations. I understand the difficult nature of serving and know there are a lot of things to remember and keep track of. However, the past couple dining experiences have left me disappointed. The first time we went here, our server failed to greet us and only began her service when we asked for it. Drinks slowly arrived and after another 40 minutes of ordering, food did as well. The manager was accommodating and apologetic for the service which is the only reason we tried to come here again. Upon arriving tonight, June 22nd, we were greeted by the lovely host who took my name down for the wait and told us about the 1/2 off beer/wine available at the bar during the wait. Excellent, I enjoyed this promotion and had a couple of drinks. As promised, we were sat within 20 minutes at a table. Service was again, very slooowww. The server was very friendly and nice but everything still seemed to take a lot longer than usual. Other servers appeared more present than our own and we had to ask another server to find him in order to remind him of something he had clearly forgotten. I have always loved the food here but service plays a very important role in my dining experience which contributes to the reason we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Since it's 106 degrees outside and the hubby wanted lasagna, I was not about to turn on the oven. So last night we ordered take-out and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. We got two salads, one lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs. Half of the lasagna was burnt on the bottom, meatballs tasted horrible-the kids wouldn't even eat them, and the bread was not soft and chewy.  Salads were good. Won't be back:("}
{"text":"Came here with my friend, his sister, and their mom.  I've ate here before and recognized the manager as being a server from a long time ago when I used to eat here.  It's good to see that they promoted within, makes me happy.  

But the establishment was clean, our food was good even though when you ask for more breadsticks they bring it out 2 or 3 at a time and you have to keep asking for more right away.  But the service is always top notch, they keep the sections small so your server is always attentive to you.  The only thing I don't like is the parking.  You only have one entrance and exit and sometimes if it's really busy or crowded the parking lot is congested with people wanting to come in and or leave."}
{"text":"food was excellent, our food server Eleni took good care of us.great place to come with the family, we had fun and will be back"}
{"text":"Stopped for take out, staff was freindly.   Food came quick.    The reason for the 3 stars is due to the fettuccine alfredo, this olive garden is very stingy with their sauce.    There was barely enough to cover the pasta. I had the same issue last time so I remembered to order extra.    The small serving of sauce cost an extra 3.50 and still wasn't enough.  For now on I'll drive to the arrowhead location"}
{"text":"Don't bother calling in your To-Go order ahead, they won't have it when you get there."}
{"text":"First of all.. Let me say that this place must be under new management because it's hugely better than it used to be.  The service is amazing, the food was great and the whole experience was perfect!  If you haven't been in a while, you need to go back it's much better."}
{"text":"Newest Olive Garden in the Centennial area.  It's about as average as a restaurant can get.  So not bad, but far from great.

Honestly, the main reason my family and I ever end up at Olive Garden is for the never ending pasta bowl.  I mean come on, isn't why a lot of folks go?  It's probably one of their better deals.  $9.99 (used to be a few bucks cheaper a few years ago) for all the salad, breadsticks, and pasta you can handle?  I'm sure marathoners carbo-loading give this one a go!  However, I'm a bit weak in the pasta eating area, after two servings consider me down for the count.  Too many carbs!  But I'm more a purist in my pasta dishes, whenever we come in I usually go for the spaghetti with meat sauce, or the fettuccine alfredo.  Every once in a while I'll go for one of Olive Garden's new sauce.  Is it just me or do the breadsticks taste different now?  Seems so not homemade anymore.  It's like the kind you can find in Costco already semi-prebaked.  Not my favorite like long ago.  I like the salad, but since now you can basically buy Olive Garden Italian dressing and croutons in places like Sam's Club, it's super easy to replicate at home.  

Olive Garden does use decent pasta though, and cook it well enough on most occasions.  This new location in Centennial is often packed when we pass by, so obviously they must be doing someting right.  But yes, with the vast amount of choices to get quality Italian dining (anyone for $25 spaghetti in marinara at Scarpetta?) you can have your pick of the moon.  It is convenient though for folks like us on the NW side of town, who aren't exactly the closes the fine dining on The Strip.  I just don't find Olive Garden the most exotic of places is all.  It's an OK chain, but yep it's still a chain.

Our service at this particular Olive Garden was spectacular though.  Our waitress was very friendly, quick to refill our items, not pushy, very patient, and let us go free with the fresh grated pecorino-romano cheese!  We were there for a while for dinner, and she never rushed us once.  I'd go back again if she were our server.  Nice gal.

It's been a long time since I've tried anything else besides the never ending pasta bowl on Olive Garden's menu.  To me, it's just a tad expensive.  For around the same amount of money, you could go to a decent buffet in town, or a place for Happy Hour.  I'm all about cheaper eats, so we rarely choose Olive Garden.  Many of their dishes are just on the expensive side, and I don't usually want to get full off of pasta.  A dish averaging $14 -$16 seems the norm, and I often think I can find a better bargain for dinner somewhere else.  I'm sure the pricing is one of the reasons Olive Garden started heavily promoting their never ending pasta bowl as an excellent value.  

I'll be back to Olive Garden, but only when I see a good bargain!"}
{"text":"About as average as you can get for an Olive Garden.

Yes, even being a Yelper one cannot always go to that hole-in-the-wall or that fancy Michelin star restaurant.  Even we occasionally one has to wind up at that dreaded place for foodies...CHAINS.

Chains (ironic as that name is) are everywhere.  Sandwich chains, burger chains, ice cream chains, pizza chains, taco chains, you name it.  Well here we have your good ol' Italian chain...Olive Garden.  It's about as American (aka, un-Italian) as you can get.  Doesn't necessarily make it all bad, but it doesn't make it all good either.

I know, you Italians and your nonnas scoff at places like Olive Garden.  As well you authentic ITALY Italians should.  In your motherland, nonna wouldn't dare make pasta from a box, or take less than a fortnight to make a da sauce.  Mi scusi, but NO!  

Olive Garden is for those folks who THINK they are having authentic Italian eats.  In some cases, sure, but for the unknowing American masses...no.  But you gotta hand it to Olive Garden for giving it a try.  I guess I really can't say I've had real Italian food until I actually go to Italy.  So I can only dream of one day tasting some true stuff.  Or I must meet a nonna of my own that imports goodies from the heartland to cook a meal for me.

I'm an Asian guy, but damn do I love a good bowl of pasta.  Must be the Asian thing for noodles.  It's like, coursing through our blood.  Anything noodle or rice must be a part of the Asian staple diet.  When I get tired of the sometimes overly-sweet Filipino spaghetti (yes we do make it, try Jollibee), can't afford a bowl of that $25 stuff over at Scarpetta (Scott Conant send me a message and I will gladly come in for a free sample Ha Ha), and can't fathom Fazoli's (oy), I often end up at Olive Garden.  But, it ain't all that bad.

Whoever started this trend capitalized on making some BANK.  I have no reason why Olive Garden is almost always busy.  Is it the Italian deco?  The smell of bread baking?  The semi-hot hostesses?  I don't know.  But I can tell you this, just about every meal you order from Olive Garden comes with fresh breadsticks and their house salad.  That in itself can be very addicting for some folks.  I hate admitting it....but I love that damn salad.  I order on average three bowls of it every time.  It's those damn croutons and that damn dressing that do me in.  It's not even the greatest vinaigrette I've ever had, but the fact that it's so accessible ups its appeal.  Shoot, you can even buy Olive Garden branded croutons and their signature dressing at Sam's Club now!  Yes, I do have some of it at home.  Sellout, I know.  

The pasta at Olive Garden?  How do I say this...my experience with the menu is rather limited.  I've only ever gone to Olive Garden when the all-you-can-eat pasta promo starts up.  So sad!  But makes me so glad!  Where else you gonna get some decent carbs for less than $10 a person?  Plus unlimited breadsticks and salad?  Eh?  In a semi-fancy restaurant?  Consider date night with my wife sold.  I'm guilty.  Someday I may venture into ordering an entree at Olive Garden that is in the $20 range, but...probably not.

I don't have a problem with Olive Garden's chain pasta and sauce, as long as the pasta is cooked RIGHT.  It's gotta be al dente.  At least most times Olive Garden's chefs get this ok.  Good pasta and my go to of meat sauce, and I'm a happy man.  Breadstick for dipping?  Check.  Extra grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese in my bowl?  Check.  A meal like this sure beats the pasta and sauce I usually cook at home.  I suppose I should get at cooking a better Italian meal, and try to at least make someone's nonna proud.

And just who started this trend to give an Andes mint at the end of the meal?  Olive Garden, that's who.  Cheesy (umm...minty?) yes.  But for some reason my chain experience at Olive Garden isn't complete without that silly mint.

Overall I usually do OK at Olive Garden.  The food when made right is pretty exceptional, no way gourmet, but a step above the stuff that chef guy puts in a can.  Plus, at least it gets me out of a night of cooking.  Mangia!"}
{"text":"Love me some Chicken Parm, and when it's never-ending how could you go wrong. When it's not a Friday or Saturday evening, the wait time is almost nonexistent. Came on a Monday and seated right away. Staff on top of things and didn't have to wait for refills of my drink or the chicken parm."}
{"text":"The lunch menu is really good! We beat the Sunday church crowd so we didn't have to wait at all. Our server was great too. They have a pasta lunch special that includes soup or salad and dessert for $9.99. Great deal!"}
{"text":"This rating is based on my most recent visit because it had been quite a long time since I had been here.

Nuts and bolts: Went with the family to celebrate a birthday.

Order: 1 app, 3 orders of soup, salad, and breadsticks, 1 rosemary chicken, and 1 lasagna.

Pros: Everybody left content and very full. Our waiter kept the breadsticks and salad coming. Multiple orders of soup were taken. Love the extra cheese on top of anything you want. Great price- got all that food for around $60 plus tip. Our waiter was very attentive and made us laugh a few times. Even wished my dad a happy birthday because he overheard us mentioning it being his birthday lunch.

Neutral: Rosemary chicken was OK. Chicken gnocchi soup could have been a bit spicier. Minestrone was OK.

Take home: Kinda wish I had tipped my server more (I did a bit over 20%). He was wonderful."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really don't like Olive Garden usually. However, on a rare evening we had a craving for it. We walked in the to go door and the hallway was WAY too tiny. After they got done with the person in front of us, the person in the little window disappeared. He also never came back and the other guy ignored us because he was on the phone forever. We stood around and waited a good 20 to 30 minutes just for someone to acknowledge us. Not one server or the person working to go ever said anything to us. Which I find amazing considering we were standing between the bar and all the booths. Needless to say even if we ever get a craving again for Olive Garden we definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this location and tonight was hands down the best experience that we have had. Not only was our waitress great but we had the chance to meet the manager, Lynn.  What made the experience so unique was seeing a manager that not only really loves their job but the company that she works for. Lynn was personable and you could tell that she is passionate about her job, and thats something to admire.  You don't see that very much now days.  Next time we go, we will be calling ahead to make sure our favorite manager will be there!!!!! Thanks Lynn!!!"}
{"text":"4 cars in the parking lot, 2 families eating, nobody in line and it's a 15 minute wait at 4pm....horrible."}
{"text":"The only reason to come here is for soup, salad and breadsticks.  That's it.  The pasta is gross and so are their sauces and meats."}
{"text":"The theme was extremely Italian and it lends itself very well from the Italian named foods to the Sinatra coming out of the speakers. Our waitress was very nice and a little talkative (which I enjoy very much.) Our food did take a bit to come out, but that didn't matter as our entree soup and breadsticks were delicious and out in a flash. I should also note that the kiwi-melon lemonata was one of the best drinks I've ever had. Order. It. When the food finally came out we discovered the reason for the wait;the food was obviously made with extreme care to taste and I finished every bite. The only deterrent may be the rather expensive price, but that is really the only problem."}
{"text":"This... is prison food. 
And the prices are outrageous for this garbage... I don't know what happened to this place... Used to be good when I was a kid... Chalky ass ready mix fettucini sauce."}
{"text":"I went to this Olive Garden last week and my food took forever. When I finally received it, it was wrong and cold not to mention the service was horrible. So tonight I decided to pick up an order, I just called and was told my order wouldn't be ready for two hours, 9:30pm. It doesn't take 2 hours to cook one order of pasta!!! Last Chance!!! Avoid this place!!! Horrible Service!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with friends. Our server, Dee, was absolutely amazing. Friendly, professional, polite, and funny.  Made the meal very pleasant."}
{"text":"Fernando was really cool. I will be coming back with my significant other. Thanks for the good service man!"}
{"text":"I'm very pleased with our meal. We had pizzas and flatbread, one of the pizzas was wrong, we weren't upset all, we know things happen.  The manager came over to apologize, had the pizza remade and comped it! Very nice. He also came back after a few minutes and asked if we needed anything else. We decided to get a desert to share and when the check came that was also comped!  

Food was all very good, server attentive, and an excellent experience overall."}
{"text":"I'm giving this particular olive garden 2 stars because my pasta is ALWAYS dry, even when I ask for extra sauce. It's very frustrating on to go orders. Other than that, the staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Went here becuase my in-laws wanted to try it out. Not a big fan of Olive Garden but you can't go wrong with their food. 

We went on a weekend so it was busy. The table they sat us at, smelled so badly!!! I did not even want to put my purse down. The area smelled like throw up or smelly feet. This made my food experience not good. 

The place is just older and needs some renovations. Please change your carpets!"}
{"text":"Two stars for our VERY friendly & attentive waitress! Food....-5 stars. Presentation was appealing, food, not so much. Ordered the Create Your Own Tour of Italy:

Shrimp Scampi- the angel hair pasta tasted like ramen noodles and was over salted. 

Fettuccine Alfredo- hello, flavor? Where are you? Noodles REALLY under cooked and chewy.

Cheese & Pesto ravioli- Over cooked and soggy again, with ZERO flavor. 

Bread sticks are oblong, dense wads of undercooked white dough with zero flavor. Haven't been to Olive Garden in YEARS, tonight confirmed that it has not improved AT ALL! Yuck!"}
{"text":"This location is under staffed. There aren't enough servers to accommodate all the tables in the Restraunt, but the service more than makes up for the wait ! I got the chicken Alfredo, my mother got the shrimp scampi, and my sister got the shrimp Alfredo. All of our dishes were cooked great. The gnocchi noodle chicken soup is top notch, it's like potato soup, chicken and dumpling, and chicken noodle got together and said, \"TASTE THIS!\" The garlic breadsticks were a bit heavy on the garlic salt. We were given a full table salad to take home, and each one of us were given personal to go breadsticks. Ask for Natalia, she's very friendly and good at her job! Super sharp, on point, and gives you plenty of Andes mint chocolates as you're gearing up to head out. 4/5 stars for having to wait to be seated so long in the middle of the day."}
{"text":"This place fucking sucks, it's so god damn hot and it's suppose to be winter, i could feel myself sweat in this place. They should fix the A/C immediately. Second off the employees suck at giving wait times, they said 25-30 mins and it took over a hour. 
On top of everything else the staff was horrible"}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't take the time to review an Olive Garden but this one is so good it deserves a mention.  I've eaten at many Olive Gardens throughout the country and this particular location is definitely the best.   The food is consistently good  and NOT SALTY like some other Olive Gardens.     The service is always very friendly.  We did have a problem one time but the manager went above and beyond to remedy the situation.   Give this location a try."}
{"text":"I like Olive Garden.  I know what I am getting and the breadsticks are always good.  This location is okay.  The food is typical.  However, the customers are gross.  I know OG is not an upscale place, but I do think it is better than sweat pants.  I was there last night and I was not overly impressed with my waitress since she looked unkempt and had food stains all over her.  She was very nice and quick with the service so she got a good tip based on that.  But out of the many OG I have been too, this is by far my least favorite due to the people who go there.  A shower, real pants, and brushed hair are not too much to ask for in a decent establishment.  Seriously....I am in my 20s...if you are an adult, you should wear real pants in public, not pajama or sweat pants.  But that is a whole other issue.  Either way, this OG is okay, but I have been to nicer ones."}
{"text":"I have been to many Olive Gardens, but this one just failed the night I went out to eat with my boyfriend... First of all our waiter gave us super hot plates for our COLD salad???? What? You don't do that. Second, she rarely checked on us and she said she would fill our drinks but never came back to do so... so we paid on the electronic thingy and left. We were pissed at the strive especially after having to wait 55 mins to eat. Just a very bad server that night :( We love coming here though because its a great date night and very close to our house"}
{"text":"Pretty bummed about my experience here - food was good as always, service was really bad. I grew up going to Olive Garden & haven't been in ages so we finally decided to go & I was super excited. 

We got to the olive garden around 8PM and there was maybe one other couple there but yet they gave us a 20 minute wait.. no big deal, we went to the bar & got some wine. At the bar there were 3 empty high top tables all dirty with dishes & glasses & no one sitting at them.. three!!! It took the staff a while to clean those off, so we sat at the bar. 15, 20, 25 minutes go by, no one is waiting in the waiting area anymore (its like 8:30pm at this point) and they still haven't called our name. So we go up and ask and they were like \"oh sorry someone else came up and said they were Kerry so we seated them\". Okay odd. But whatever. We go into the area with 5 booths & it took like 15 minutes for our waiter to come over. We see another waiter in the section helping all of his tables, but not ours....Finally I waved him down. And lastly, he took our appetizer before we were done with it because the salads came. Boo!

So the service was pretty crappy but the food, amazing as always. If you don't love Olive Garden, even at least just for the salad & breadsticks, you have some issues. So good. Authentic Italian? Nope. But just good comfort food. Overall, I will probably be back to an Olive Garden sometime, but not this one."}
{"text":"I called the restaurant to place an order for pickup because I was in a rush and didn't want to place the order online. I ordered a spaghetti with pasta e fagioli soup and a peach iced tea. I went and picked up my order, it was quick and easy. I got home and my order was wrong. I called the restaurant immediately and they were so nice and accommodating. The gentleman I was speaking to did everything he could to make it up to me. I love Olive Garden, I crave it often. I usually use  Postmates, but I was already out running errands and decided to just pick it up before I went home. I understand that mistakes happen and I am very glad that the restaurant was willing to make it up to me. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Waitress Kristi (sp) was great very informative, appetizer was cold I mentioned it to her, entrée was cold  I normally don't complain about and I would never send food back for fear of how it will come back to me mentioned it as well. But the manager came out and took those off my bill which I was not looking for.  Will probably never make my way back there."}
{"text":"Chain restaurants seem to get a bad rap, especially from yelpers, self-proclaimed foodies, and those that, in general, dine out a lot. I, myself, am not a big fan of chain restaurants, although there are a few exceptions. And the chains that I like are because the food is consistent, you know what you're getting (which, I admit, can be a good or a bad thing.) 

I haven't been to an Olive Garden in probably five years or so, and have only been to the Monroeville location two or three times ever. However, my mom had a gift card and wanted to go, so we went. We ordered the calamari and stuffed mushrooms for our appetizer and both went with the endless salad and breadsticks for our meal. The food was decent, as expected. For the soup, I got the Pasta e Fagioli which was very good. My mom had a bowl of Chicken & Gnocchi and the Pasta e Fagioli, and said she liked both.

Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. My only real issue was that she brought out our appetizer, soup and salad all at the same time, which was odd. Since the soup and salad were supposed to serve as our entrees, I would have preferred if she at least asked if we wanted it all at once or to wait a bit. If we got a regular dinner, it wouldn't have been served with our app, so the soup and salad should have been no different. Also, the salad had too much dressing and became a little soggy. I did mention this to our waitress, who offered to bring us a new bowl. We declined, but only we were full already. 

Overall, not a bad experience. I would return, but probably not in the near future, simply because I am not in the area often."}
{"text":"Ordered curbside take out at 5:00pm to have it picked up at 5:50pm.  I'm here and its 6:06pm and I'm still waiting on my order.   I asked the server what had happened, and all she could tell me was, \"I'm not sure, they may have forgot to put your order\".  Smh... Poor expectation and poor service!  

Waiting an additional 20 min for curbside is Olive Gardens new thing I guess."}
{"text":"We went early on a thursday night. Our party of 4 was seated immediately. Service was fast and we all liked our entries. Everything tasted fine, hot, good portions. Wine was good. I will return, its a decent alternative to Carrabas."}
{"text":"Everything was AWESOME! We went for dinner on Saturday, Jan 28th and they were super busy. The staff was moving quickly to get people seated. Our server was Emilio and he was the best server we've had in a while. Not just at Olive Garden specifically, but at any restaurant we've been to overall. He was friendly and attentive. Our drinks were always filled and he checked on us often. I was impressed given the amount of people at dinner service. The food was great. I get my usual unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks. My husband had spaghetti and meatballs. Thanks for an awesome dinner service."}
{"text":"There lunch is so awesome bottomless soup or salad and a lunch special my family and I go probably once a week to this location and we have always gotten the best service and the salad and soup are our absolute favorite lunch... Especially paired with a sandwich so much food for great value!"}
{"text":"I don't come to Olive Garden very often as I feel their prices keep on getting more and more expensive, but when they have specials like Never Ending Pasta Bowls starting at $10 I just have to make a trip to get my pasta fill. 

Came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed with maybe 20-30 people waiting in line to be seated. I asked the hostess how long it would be and she said about 20-25 minutes. Okay, not so bad for a weekend and with the pasta special going on, so I decided to wait. Only had to wait about 10 minutes before I was seated. I and my guest was seated way in the back of the restaurant where all the big groups of people where along with the families with their loud children that were running around between tables. Gosh people, control your children especially when you're out in public!!

Our waiter came rather quickly to take our drink order but was slow at bringing them back, which I'm not sure why since we only asked for iced water. Once he brought our waters out, he took our food order. Told him we both wanted to do the Never Ending Pasta bowls and he looked at me as though he didn't understand. I showed him what we wanted on the menu and he wrote it down. Asked if we wanted soup or salad to go with our meal and we said we both wanted a salad. He brought out our salad and breadsticks quickly and within minutes of that our pasta was brought out by someone else. Our waiter didn't come back around for probably 15 minutes to check up on us. 

The salad was good, not much dressing on it, but it was still good. I hardly ever have the breadsticks, so not sure how they were. My pasta was delicious!! I had the whole wheat linguine with the new creamy mushroom sauce. I always ask for extra sauce as I feel like they don't put much sauce on their pasta. Their serving portions are huge, so I hardly was able to eat one bowl. 

Once we were done, we waited around for awhile to see if our waiter would come and bring us our check, but he never did, so I just paid with the paying machine at our table. Not sure if he checked to see if we paid before we left as he never came back around. 

Pros:
1. Pasta was amazing and the price of $10 was even better for all you can eat pasta.
2. Parking at this location is very large with parking on all four sides of the restaurant. 
3. Location is easy to get to as it's right off the I-17 and Peoria. 

Cons:
1. Super busy
2. Long lines on the weekends
3. Wait staff are super slow
4. Tables weren't cleaned off very quickly seeing how there were so many people waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden!! Everything I've ever gotten here has always been so delicious. I could eat here at least once a week if I could. This location is on Flamingo right off of Maryland which is close by my place. The outside of the building looks older, like the inside would look old as well, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was updated on the inside. 

Pros:
1. I was seated immediately.
2. My waitress was super friendly and took my order quickly. She came over multiple times to check up on me and made sure everything was good. She gave me suggestions of items to try also. She treated me very well.
3. Was informed of all the specials that were going on at the time.
4. Food came out super fast and was hot.
5. Manager came by to make sure everything was to my liking.
6. Unlimited Salad!! Their dressing is amazing!
7. Not really a bread person, but the bread was delish and hot when it came out. Also tasted fresh and not reheated. 

Con:
1. I saw a waiter drop some silverware and then put it on a table! Yuck!!

My favorite times to come to Olive Garden are during the time they have the Unlimited Pasta Bowls and Buy one take one home specials. I love the food so much, but I usually get so full on the salad that I'm not really able to finish anything else. So, it's nice to take home and have for another meal."}
{"text":"Delious food as always. Very clean place. The staff and very friendly and helpful. Our server was Alberto, he was very attentive and polite. He has a very positive attitude. He knew what we needed without us having to ask for it. We will definitely keep coming to this location."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. Good for families. Nothing extra spectacular, but always good for the price."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at this location today and I was extremely disappointed with the service. I have a family visiting from Malaysia and I regretted I had taken them to this Olive Garden location. Our waiter seemed not to care at all about our table. He seemed to be angry/annoyed already when taking our order (a minute after we entered). Then we had to ask for the complementary salad/soup combo with main entrees as he forgot/didn't feel like offering these to us. Still, we got just one salad and one soup even though we ordered 3 entrees. We asked for a refill once (\"Can we have one more salad and soup, please?\") and he just said yes and left before I could tell him which soup I wanted to ask for. He brought the same one as the first one. We wanted to try sth else. Oh well. Then he disappeared forever. Luckily, we were able to pay using the little screen on the table. We left him a 10% tip, though if it was up to me, I wouldn't have paid any tip as I had never felt so awkward and unwanted in a restaurant before. I do realize that Olive Garden is not an upscale place, yet I've never experienced such lack of care and professionalism in any other Olive Garden restaurant."}
{"text":"Thank you Aldo for making our visit enjoyable. Our lunch was on point. I love the Zuppa Toscano. My wife Mediterranean flat bread was so picture perfect and exploded with great flavors. We haven't been to Olive Garden in a long while. I'm glad we made it back."}
{"text":"Go to another one. Car side sucks. Girl was awful. Wrong order came out then we sat for 45 min and then she forgot. It was shameful go to macaroni grill."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but I felt like my recent experience at Olive Garden needed one. It started off with a very wobbly table to dirty glasses to bad food. It has been quite a while since I have eaten at Olive Garden and I have to say the food is absolutely TERRIBLE! I would compare it to frozen boxed dinners, it may have been worse. You can tell that not thing is freshly made. My husband and I couldn't even finish our food. It was so hard to pay their outrageous prices for the food we were served. I know that I will not return. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I've been to this Olive Garden quite a few times in the past few years since i've lived on this side of town, and finally can write a review of my recent experience. Each time i go here i usually get my chicken alfredo. Nothing special but the past couple of my experiences i get the never ending pasta bowl.

The pasta is ok, sauce is too thick in my opinion and when i bring home leftovers it doesn't age too well. after 5 to 10 hours it doesnt taste appetizing and you don't feel like eating it.
The soup and salad is tasty i enjoy it more than the pasta.

Service is good as well. We walked in for lunch on a monday and it wasn't full so we got a table quite quickly, and we didn't have to sit down.  Our waiter was fast, friendly and very informative. He told us new menu items and what he personally liked. He was very clean and very professional. Great service.

Overall though, it's just an ok experience, It's Olive Garden, Not really the best pasta, good breadsticks, professional look and great service most the time. it's just the food that isn't \"on par\" with service."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Olive Garden for years. We had a large family dinner to plan and a very fussy group of diners ranging from age 6 to 81, so we decided to give the Metrocenter Olive Garden a try. As a vegan, I was very happy to see their online menu that clearly indicated what I could order, and so happy that the bread sticks are vegan by default now!

The vegan options are still pretty limited - bread sticks, minestrone soup, salad with no croutons or dressing (but they will bring you oil & vinegar), and pasta with marinara. 

We went on a Saturday night fully prepared for chaos. We added our name to the waiting list before leaving home, hoping our table would be ready when we arrived since it said the wait was only 11-15 minutes. However, we still needed to wait about 10 minutes for the table - not an issue really, especially because of the \"half of wine\" when you wait option that kept my mother-in-law happy. The place was packed, but our server was a pro. She managed our table of fussiness just fine and everyone enjoyed the experience. Every item came out as ordered, she kept the flow of drinks, salad, breadsticks and soup coming, and took the time to talk with us and treat us \"like family.\" I was impressed with her skill! 

The food was far from gourmet, but got the job done with no complaints from the crowd. I'd like it if they expanded the vegan options - i.e. make vegetables an option for the build your own pasta toppings, provide vegan salad dressing/crouton options, or offer a vegan cheese option. But the restaurant made what is usually a stressful event for our family quite the success! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Horrible service . Server forgot to put in our appetizer order ....never asked to refill salad. One salad for a group of 4.5. Keep In mind we were there waiting for the appetizer that never arrived. Never going there again ."}
{"text":"if I could give this place 0 stars I would. I have not been to Olive Garden in years & now I remember why. I will start off with how poorly this place manages and how bad the service is. I came in with 2 family members & from the parking lot we thought it was going to be busy since it was about 3ish (dinner hours) but when we walked in we were immediately seated. This is when it starts to get bad. We were sat in a room with one other table. It took 10 minutes for our original server to take our drink orders. Blank--done. we didn't see him for the rest of the time we were there. Somebody else had to come take our order but it was at least another 15 minutes before that happened. Never got refills the whole time we were there. from start to finish I would have to say we were there for about 2 hours. We did not lolly gag around at the end after we got our tab, we wanted to get out of there. do not recommend this location, not even for my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Where to start? At the reservation! I called to make a reservation for eight. I was told they could only make a reservation for six. She also said that their round table could seat eight if some were kids. So I said let's reserve a round table for six. The young lady said, \"But I know you have eight\". Whereupon I said, \" I have six children so they should fit?\". Then she said, \"Wait a minute.\" When she came back on the line she said she could make a reservation but it wouldn't be a hard reservation and that I might have to wait. She took my name and that was that.
An hour or so later we arrived (15 minutes before the scheduled reservation in case we had to wait) and asked about the reservation. The ladies up front said,\"we'll check you in and see where we can seat you.\" Then a manager came up and they asked him how long to seat eight. Without blinking an Eye he said,\"45 minutes.\" I looked at him and asked\"that quick? Whereas he said, \"Well I can make it an hour and a half!\" So I said, \"no you can't because we're leaving. Look for your write up in Yelp.\"
So normally I give more chances at improving customer service but in this case it really seemed like it wouldn't get better and I was just going to subject my family to more poor customer service by waiting to be seated etc.
I expect civility at worst and hold a grudge. So Olive Garden is off the list forever. I had an experience like this at Outback once and have not been back (14 years). So this is not written for an Olive Garden employee to call me and make nice. It isn't going to happen. This is a reminder for others out there like me to skip the irritation and just go to a better rated restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. So much good stuff to try! I had a the chicken Alfredo and it was delicious. My aunt had the eggplant parmesan and that was also yummy as well. They have unlimited breadsticks and salad refills for your meals! I haven't tried the desserts but I am sure it is good! Keep in mind it is known to be busy at times, so plan ahead! It didn't take two long for us because there was only 2 of us"}
{"text":"Service always great when I sit at the bar for lunch. I'm in a rut but always order the soup and salad combination. It's perfect actually and very consistent up until my last visit. This time the pasta e fagole was way too thick - it had crossed from soup to stew-land which was not what I came for. I hope it was just a brief short coming and not a change of recipe.

Another problem this visit is that Olive Garden has decided putting tablets in everyone's face is a really great idea. They were placed up and down the bar with bright animated images. Can we not just sit and have some peace and a little chat with the bartender or another diner? I also wonder if the cameras on the tablets are operational. It just seems intrusive."}
{"text":"Perfect for a lunch hour or a family affair. 
I was able to order my food online and I was ready waiting for me when I came to pick it up"}
{"text":"Went to this Olive Garden last Friday when they still had the never ending pasta bowl. The food was good, our waiter was so friendly, and the host was friendly when seating us & greeting other customers. It was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"this was my third time at olive garden, first time at this location. 

made reservations for date night with my boyfriend. it was on the 5th of March, so it was pretty packed. we were seated in a room that was less crowded which was nice. 

FOOD: 3/5 
started off with complimentary bread sticks & ordered the alfredo sauce to go along. i had the chicken & gnocchi soup, & we both had their house salad. whatever sauce they use on their salad, definitely working for them. it was delicious. the fact that my boyfriend loves it ( he hates veggies ) says something. 

for our main dish, we both decided on their special \"make your own tour of italy\". we both got the lasagna & fettuccine alfredo, & i had the tortellini al forno & he had the ravioli. the fettuccine alfredo was my favorite. the rest was ehh, nothing special. a bit too much cheese & kinda salty for my liking. for the price ( $12.99 ), it was good. 

i signed up for their eclub, so we got a free dessert, their zeppoli with chocolate sauce. best item of the night. it was yummy. a perfect ending of the night. 

SERVICE: 4/5

our server was jason. he took good care of us, even with while serving 3 other tables near us. he would come to check up on us a few times, made sure we were enjoying our meals & had refills. a bit slow with getting a refill on my water, but that was understandable. he made sure the bill was correct & even shook our hands twice in the end before leaving. 

OVERALL: 4/5

will come back to this location again & try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"This is a a great restaurant! The service is always fantastic! They are so friendly and helpful. The food is absolutely delicious and an amazing price. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone for good pasta!"}
{"text":"Yesterday my boyfriend and I went to the concord location. When we ordered our food I did the creat your own pasta with grilled chicken red peppers and bacon, when the food came out it had 5 tablespoons of crushed red peppers on top. I explained to the waitress it was wrong and she told me she would get it fixed. 25 minuets later the pasta came back out with red peppers but no bacon, I asked her for a box because st this point we had been there well over a hour & when we went to pay the bill on the tablet she had charged 9.99 for pasta, 2 dollars for red peppers and 2.30 for the bacon. I flagged her down to ask if she could take the bacon charge off because they're was no bacon and she quickly snatched my plate of food from me and started digging in my pasta with my fork at our table then told us they probably forgot in the back and walked away with my food. At this point I haven't ate yet, I've been waiting on my food for a hour and she takes my pasta and throws it away in the back. She comes back and said it's taken off the bill and I explained I didn't want my pasta taken off the bill just the bacon that was t even on the pasta in the first place. I went and found a manager and told her what happened and she told me the server probably misunderstood me, which was fine. She told me she would remake my food Togo, so I was happy & everything was fine. 

My boyfriend was trying to pay for our food on the tablet and the waitress (who at this point was mad as hell at me) grabbed the tablet from my boyfriends hands and gave her self a 0 perfect tip and threw my food down and walked away. So disrespectful. Never in my life has that happened before..."}
{"text":"I love the food at Olive Garden, the fettuccine alfredo is my go to! However I was not impressed this last visit with our server, Amy who was rather pushy and kept trying to up our tab. 

First she asks my mom if she wants to try out one of the sangrias and when my mom says she will think about it, she instantly replies saying she will bring one out. 

After our meal she asked if anyone wanted dessert and I said I wanted to try the mini $2.99 lemon dessert. She brought out something totally different so I politely say I wanted the small lemon dessert, again she brings out a large slice of lemon cake. I didn't even bother asking her to replace it since I felt like she was purposely trying to leave me with a higher dollar item. 

When we got the tab I noticed she rang in a higher priced dessert than what I ended up with so I asked if she could correct it, she says they are the same price. I point out that the dessert I got was actually cheaper, she then checked and says oh you're right.. I work in sales so I understand upselling but I'm not a fan of being purposely overcharged."}
{"text":"Poor service! Went in for lunch as one guest. Told it would be a while and I'd have to hold one of those table buzzers. Are you kidding me? Parking lot was empty and no one was around! When I asked why, hostess told me, \"there are only two servers available.\" Forget it! I went somewhere else! Terrible way to run a restaurant. I could understand if it was the height of the dinner rush. This location needs new management."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Olive Garden in almost 10 years and my experience is not what I remembered. The food was okay. I ordered Cheese Ravioli and my bf ordered some Steak & Tortellini dish. His dish was pretty damn good. 

I think my problem with this place is the service. We are Asian and we came here with 2 of my friends (white). The waitress seem to only speak to my friends and not us and I found it super rude. She would rarely look our way, only at them. I thought it was just me but the bf mentioned the same thing. People like that should be be waiting tables or doing any sort of customer service."}
{"text":"Thought we would give them a try again and what a disappointment! It always seems that their food sits ready for so long before they bring it out that its dried out like it's sat under a warmer. Then when you do get your food it definitely wasn't worth the wait. The final insult is when you receive the check and see how much they're charging for their lackluster food and slow service. If you want amazing food and service that can't be beat go to Carrabba's down the street...ask for Adrian :)"}
{"text":"Never been to this location. Was craving Olive Garden and so I couldn't wait to dive in. Me and my friend sat at the bar and the service was horrible. She had 3 tables and was suffering. Drink tickets ringing in, no refills, no talking to us. Just worst service ever. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Well it seemed like they had their sh*t together but maybe they are still working the kinks out.  I took my husband here for lunch and while we were seated right away pretty much the dining experience went downhill from there.  The booth we were given was soaking wet, so wet it felt like I had peed myself when I sat down.  To say the least it startled me and I stood straight up into the hostess.  She came back a few minutes later with some paper towels taken from the ladies room and wiped the table down for us.  
     Our server came and introduced himself and ripped the menu out of my hand trying to point to a picture of an appetizer I had no thought of ordering.  Someone else brought all of our food out.  No refills, and no check ups.  Some manager came over and dropped a left over Father's Day coupon on our table without saying a word.  We must have sat for half an hour with empty dishes stacked in the middle of our table while countless servers walked past us.  Our waiter was nowhere to be seen.  Finally he shows and asks us if we want boxes to go.  Our plates were empty for fucks sake.  Our lunch came with dessert and the guy brings my husband the wrong one, but whatever.  Another half hour goes by before we get the check.  The coupon was left on the table and I'll wait a long while before trying this place again."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance here! My waiter was so nice and very patient. However, our food took long to come and so did our appetizers. Thank God my mom and I had salad and breadsticks to keep us busy. They were absolutely delicious. I would have given the restaurant 5 stars in spite of everything I stated above except this one thing I cannot let go. Guess what guys??? I got my plate of mushroom stuffed ravioli (only like 6 of them, really?) and one of the ravioli wasn't even stuffed!!! I got a flat ravioli pocket! I'm chuckling to myself as I write this because it's hilarious yet disturbing since Olive Garden is an Italian restaurant! So funny though! 

I'd like to leave on a good note though....I did get the dish for free after I mentioned it to the waiter. So thank you!!"}
{"text":"Omgosh....no exclamation points here. The food was tasteless and my friend found the longest piece of hair in her drink! I got the al forno dish and I asked for mushrooms to be added. I expected them to sauté the mushrooms with the sauce and I got bland mushrooms on top of my dish, which was so dry. I love Olive Garden but will not come back to this location for a while."}
{"text":"It was my mom and I and we had the best time. It was lunch time and everything was great. Ivory waited on us and she was wonderful. Attentive, kind, and gracious. Please let her know she is a great person. I wish more people like her everyday. Thank you. Made for a great day."}
{"text":"Kelsey my server was the best server I had in years. I come here because my kids like this place it's kind of like Italian fast food or something. bread sticks, salad and soup was good. The dinners was good for pre-made tv dinner type Italian food. But it's no mama's kitchen"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat, my favorite dish is the Chicken parm. They also have delicious salads and the breadsticks are amazing. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a decent Italian place to eat!"}
{"text":"A few co workers and I decided to go during lunch hour. When we walked in, we were greeted right away. We were also seated right away. 

Our waitress was nice and helpful with the menu. We had unlimited bread and salad. I asked for Caesar salad and she said she will just bring out the Caesar dressing. When the salad came out, the salad was already tossed in their signature dressing. Mixing Caesar dressing together was not a good taste so I didn't use it. 

For my main course, I ordered a Sampler: Stuffed mushrooms and calamari. The taste was amazing. Very flavorful. 

The only downfall was instead of all our food come out at once, the food came out one at a time. Me being the last person to get my food, everyone was almost done eating. The manager was informed of this issue and took off $2.50 off my meal and acknowledge their mistake. 

I would go to Olive Garden again for the simple fact of admitting service was not up to par."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Olive Garden that I have been too. I can't comment too much on the menu but with respect to the service, this one stands out. It was a busy Saturday noon and they were quick to find us a table. The entrees arrived quicker than we expected. The lasanga fritters appetizer was something I wouldn't recommend. The mushroom ravioli lacked sauciness.

Typically, I am quite picky about when the waitress/waiter hands the check. This time, they handed over before two of us completed the meal.

Bottomline: Good quick stop place before you head to Ikea !"}
{"text":"First time eating here, I am from Hawai'i. We dont have Olive Garden back home. The wait wasnt too long. We sat down, the waiter was very pleasant. I had a sweet red wine which was awesome. We ordered appetizers but the endless salad & breadsticks & our main meal came BEFORE our appetizer. So I was a bit confused as to why. Anyway im giving this a 3 star because what supposed to be endless salad & bread sticks never happened. I asked twice for more bread sticks. It never came. Our water was never filled. The couple in the back of us, I heard them ask for more bread sticks too & they never got any. It seem that once you get your food, thats it, thats all you will get."}
{"text":"I must start by saying we got seated quick after waiting 15 min for our waiter to finally come for our drink order and apps. Drinks took 10 min thats just for the kids drinks bar drinks took 15 min apps came with no cheese grater waiter said he will bring it back in a min waited 10 min never came back so we started eating our salad then ordered food and another long island. Meanwhile the bartender is sitting at a table shooting the shit for 20 min with friends so i never received my 2nd drink i just told the waiter to forget it the service was so HORRIBLE  that i will never return to this place and i am a very very good tipper i always give atleast 20% sometimes more depending on the service my family gets but last night i left a big 0.00 thats exactly what my server deserved. .. will not be back.."}
{"text":"After debating on where to go for hours, we decide on Olive Garden. Last time wasn't a pleasant trip as they charged us money on extra sauces that they suggested. 

However this time our waiter, Garrett , made this the best visit. Super friendly, throws out amazing suggestions that we couldn't even ask for. 

Good just came out. It's amazing :). Got the chicken and dumpling soup. Waiting on the baked mozzarella chicken. Super exited about the food."}
{"text":"This review is only for take out service, not the food. Poor service. Order suppose to be ready when I came in and waited 15 mins after waiting 15 mins the server tried helping someone else first. Very poor. And while she was busy, 4 of her co workers did nothing to help her and just stood and  talked about going home."}
{"text":"I was very highly dissatisfied with this location. Our server was absent most of our time here and when he was around he ignored our table completely. The food however was really good, but the pasta was way over cooked and dried out.

Service needs improvement big time."}
{"text":"Service was horrible and she kept forgetting our table. I ordered no onions on the salad and it was served to the table next to us. My food came out very dry and not hot and that's not acceptable at all. Our waitress didn't come over to our table to check on us I had to get a refill from someone else.
Overall a horrible experience"}
{"text":"We eat here very often and this time the bad experience took the whole cake. The waitress was very rude first off. When she brought out the salad and breadsticks, the salad bowl was only filled 1/4 of the bowl (not even 2 plate full of salad). Usually your bowl is full of salad! We ordered a second bowl and came out the same way and this time the lettuce looked wilted. Gross! We ordered and my fettuccine Alfredo barely had any sauce so I asked for some and she said she would have to charge me! Really? My pasta is supposed to have sauce!

Ok so forget this, she made the date night really horrible. I went to pay my bill on the table device and noticed that there were extra charges. We mentioned it and she said she would look at it at her station. She came back and said she didn't see it and that we must not have looked at it right, really so customer is always wrong to her. I looked at it again and she removed the extra charges that were there but yet we were treated as if we were lying. Ridiculous!
We were about to leave and we over hear her talking to 2 other employees. She pointed over at our table and told them that we didn't tip. For 1, I did tip even when she didn't deserve 1 penny. But how can you complain about customers where they can hear you. No professional at all!

I don't think I will be returning to this location until she is handled."}
{"text":"Used to be our favorite restaurant.  The last 2 times my husband and I went we had lousy service.  Took them forever to take out order both times.  Then forever to get our food.  Customers around us were being served before us even though we were seated before them. Our soups were watered down and tasteless.  One of the 2 times they gave us the wrong order... More wait.  Hesitant to return."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant often with my family of 7. From the moment we walk in the hostess (Luna) and take out professional (Melina) always give us a warm welcome. 
The best part is the food and excellent service that we receive from Hymie? and Shawn. Always spot on and they both treat us like family."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed with this Olive Garden location.  The service was subpar- I sat at the bar and the bartender was far more interested in talking to coworkers than the few patrons at the bar.

Secondly, the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company. The Zuppa Toscana was devoid of the spiciness that makes the soup as well as full of fatty sausage.

I also ordered the Ravioli di Portobello, it came out stone cold, unacceptable for a baked entree. I sent it back and the second time it came out it was just as cold. I finally spoke to a manager who comp'd my meal. I will never be back to this location."}
{"text":"I'd give it one star, but since it was technically edible, and I didn't get sick afterwards, I'll give it two. I don't know when I will learn, but Olive Garden is basically just Noodles & Company at 3x the cost. While I get a craving for the breadsticks and their popular salad dressing, I'm not sure it's worth soggy, water-logged noodles and weakly flavored sauces. Honestly, I make better and more authentic Italian food in my own home."}
{"text":"My favorite dish is Herb Grilled salmon, I had the dish with my office colleagues in afternoon and I was very Happy so took my family on the weekend and felt the dish is poorly prepared by only grill no herbs. The taste is missing. When I complain to the attendant he only Said he will give the feedback to his manager. My family and me very disappointed. Please think twice before going to this place"}
{"text":"Let's see who gets an A+

Olive Garden is to Italian as:
A) Taco Bell is to Mexican
B) Lindsay Lohan is to sobriety
C) Kim Kardashian is to real boobs
D) All of the above

If you answered D, you get a gold star. The only reason I ever go to Olive Garden is soup and salad for lunch. They have a pretty decent chicken caesar and I really like the pasta fagioli. The breadsticks are their claim to fame and they are certainly addicting. Everything else on the menu bears little resemblence to anything that ever came out of any kitchens inhabited by my relatives (aand we are not that far removed from Sicily) and I never saw anything so cheese smothered and cream laden during my travels in Italy. I also get annoyed by the names they randomly make up for their faux Italian dishes. Rollini. Seriously? Aside from the cheesey atmosphere, the service is usually pretty good but one section of the dining room butts up to a kitchen wall and you keep getting slammed everytime the dishwasher on the other side is opened/closed...it's loud and jarring, not fun."}
{"text":"We arrived about 5:15pm, was seated right away and the hosts was kind enough to switch our seats due to the cold air coming from a vent. The first part of our meal was ok, the waitress was attentive and came right back when we placed an order. After our appetizer, there was a major delay in receiving our entrees. Our waitress got busy and didn't come back to check on us for about 30 minutes. Once the food came out (Shrimp alfredo/ never ending chicken alfredo) the food was hot, but  he noodles was over cooked and it tasted horrible!! I asked for a lasagna instead and this is what they brought me in the picture below. I requested to take it with me. I'm not sure what happened tonight but this is unacceptable. If one dish is horrible and I ask for a replacement, please give the actual entree that's advertised. The manager walked by several times and NEVER stopped to talk with us although she spoke with several patrons around us. I paid $68 for our meal and I could have had a Wendy's fish sandwich for $7 and enjoyed it more!! Just horrible experience! Do better Olive Garden...."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday evening and were seated right away. Friendly staff who were all very helpful and came back to check up on us numerous times. Our food came out hot and fresh and perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"I've only been to Olive Garden a handful of times,  and it's been all positive experiences! We were greeted and seated quickly and politely. The restaurant wasn't too busy, which is exactly what we were hoping for.

I come for the wedding soup and salmon. As I sat there drowning my soup in pepper, the boyfriend looks at me like I'm nuts.
Jennie, however, does not judge me! She's a most phenomenal server, by the way. You should ask for her!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. When you come into the restaurant, they hold the door for you which is very nice. On a usual Friday night the wait is about 15 minutes which is not bad. The waiters are very helpful. The food is fantastic. You feel very Italian when you taste the food. Portions are more than enough to fill you up. The appetizers alone make you full! Every time I've went there, I've always had to take home which is not a bad thing. So when you feel Italian, come to Olive Garden. Oh, and come hungry!!"}
{"text":"I usually like Olive Garden just your normal chain restaurant but today I got really bad service. Hopefully the waiter was just having a bad day, but he literally forgot so much. My plates for my salad. He brought my breadsticks last. And got my order wrong for my little one. I had patience for all of it, even though I had to ask got normal things. Only thing that bugged me the most was the wait for my Change from my check and he gave it to me incorrectly gave me the total due instead of change due. A lot of it could of been prevented if he only paid attention. Food was ok besides the normal salty breadsticks."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Sunday night at 6 pm and our party of 6 was seated immediately.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer of calamari, mozzarella sticks and chicken tenders.   The appetizer came out the same time as the salad and breadsticks.   I get so annoyed when that happens.   Quit rushing me.   Let me enjoy my appetizer and then my salad.  All were good choices.   I had the new sausage stuffed giant rigatoni.  There was plenty of sausage, in fact, way more than I needed.   The dish was very good.  Everyone else liked their food.  

Be sure to ask for containers for the leftover salad and breadsticks!"}
{"text":"We frequent this neighborhood Olive Garden and enjoy it.  Today we walked in around 4pm. The place was nearly empty BUT when we asked for a booth not a table, the hostess said that there are no booths available! I pointed to the multiple empty booths and she said 
\"Well, it is the server change time of the day and if we wanted to wait, we could have a booth\"
What? I said that we could try another restaurant and she let us walk out the door! All was done in a polite exchange, but I cannot believe they let two full paying customers walk out the door!!
We drove across the street and although it was their server change time of day, we were seated where we requested.
I hope corporate or the owner reads this and realize that their hostess training is seriously lacking about customer service ! Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by premising the fact that I was at the mall, I knew I could sit quickly at the bar and I had a gift card since christmas or I would not be eating at a chain restaurant. It was what you expect at all of the chains. I got chicken and shrimp carbonarra (spell check). It was fair. What does one expect for something quick and convenient to what I was doing at the time.  I do wish however that I spent the gift card next door just shoveling cheddar bays down my throat. Good talk."}
{"text":"Chain food. I try to avoid it when I can. But I've got a soft spot for the OG. It's where my family spends every momentous occasion, from buying my new car, to birthdays. I guess it also helps that Joshua works in the same parking lot as this location. What can I say? This Basic loves her Alfredo. 

This review doesn't specifically cover one visit, but every time I'm here. The service is always bar none, better than any other OG I find myself at. They always have amazingly fresh breadsticks (win) and my peach tea is always full. They offer refills of soup and salad that you order with your entree, something I've never heard of at the other ones I regular. And when I ask for extra alfredo sauce with my meal? It's never forgotten, and always overflowing (win some more). 

Never ending pasta bowl is back now. I'll probably be here a few times before it's over. (Gasp, carbs!) 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"As an update I would like to say that the Olive Garden organization is still #1 (5 stars all the way) in my book.  After I sent them my complaint about the service, they made good by sending me a gift certificate.  Although I will NEVER go to THIS particular Olive Garden again, I will gladly spend my money at other Olive Gardens in the area.  If only there was one in Mooresville or Statesville!!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite! We come here all the time for our after church lunch date. Food is always on point and service is more than excellent. I usually order the five cheese ziti that comes with the fagoli soup with a peace tea. This place never fails!"}
{"text":"My negative Yelp review is for Sunset location and several staff members. 

I invited my parents out to lunch over Memorial Weekend and my mother wanted to dine here. Normally, I would have dined elsewhere but she insisted. Restaurant was half empty on Sunday afternoon, plenty of tables to choose from. 

Shortly after receiving our drinks, I noticed a waitress (behind our table) cleaning and she LOADED her tray with tons of heavy entree dishes, silverware, drink glasses etc. You can guess what happens next...

The entire tray fell crashing down behind our table and the neighboring table which had elderly guests. Every glass item on her tray shattered and bounced off the ground and flew everywhere - similar to flying shrapnel. Due to restaurant being half empty, you could hear the sound of crashing plates from main entrance. 

After the incident, the waitress didn't even ask my table or neighboring table if we were okay. She was more concerned with defending her mistake to another waiter that seen the incident. 

Entire situation was handled UNPROFESSIONALLY by several members of staff who were watching and rolling their eyes at her instead of helping to clean the mess and broken glass (everywhere). 

My waiter came to the table and first comment out of his mouth, \"it happens.\" I could insert a comment here but I won't. 

Finally, some other employees came to her aide and helped clean. Two employees asked if we were hit with glass and they were the only employees who appeared concerned with incident. 

This restaurant will be hearing from corporate."}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch with my client who chose Olive Garden. It's been years since I've dined at Olive Garden. I was surprised how busy they were.

Service was exceptional, our waiter and assistant checked in regularly and made sure we received  refills on bread sticks and or salad - both items were yummy. My order the Chicken Scampi - chicken breast tenderloins sautéed with bell peppers, roasted garlic and onions in a garlic cream sauce over angel hair. The chicken was tender  and the entree was tasty and filling. I couldn't  finish all of my entree BC I ate to much salad and bread but still enjoyed it. 

It won't be years again before I return to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Food was good but we got our appetizer after our soup/salad, then our entrées just as we were taking our first bite of our soup/salad and appetizer! Poor timing of the food."}
{"text":"Took a family friend here for her 50th birthday dinner and Fred and Joanie wow'd us. Exceptional service and entertainment. She had the best time and of course the food was good."}
{"text":"Salad breadsticks my all time fave and clasic! Love the consistency. Even when its busy we still get quick and wonderful service. Great price point, great food!"}
{"text":"I'm currently enjoying a meal a the Sweet Tomatoes down the street from the Olive Garden.  I had tried to dine at the Olive Garden with my wife, but were frustrated with our attempt.  It was 5pm on Wed, so it was fairly crowded, but there was no one else waiting to be seated.  Two hostesses talked and then consulted with a manager for at least 30 seconds to decide where to put us.  We were not asked for our preference.

The first hostess led me to a window by the west side of the building.  The shade was down, but it was very bright and would have been unpleasant.  I asked if there was a booth available.  She was not happy.  She said is this one OK?  (It was next to a large party with young, energetic children.  That is a PLUS for two teachers, but not after a full day when we would like a quite meal and pleasant conversation.  She said that is all that she had.  (There were a lot of other empty tables, but none were appropriate for us, I assume.)

I said that we would go elsewhere.  Thanks, anyway.  I gave her a chance to respond, but she just smiled awkwardly.  We walked out after passing two managers who surely knew the situation, since she had communicated our rejection of the first assignment through her communication device.

The real problem that I have with this is that there was no attempt to try to find a solution.  We would have been happy to wait for another booth, but why should we be the ones to offer? When I was younger, I would have taken this treatment and paid the $40 or so while having a mediocre (or worse) experience.  Now, although the money is still important, that is not the issue.  I want every meal that I spend with my wonderful wife to count.  I don't want to suffer through any just because of the lack of consideration shown by the Olive Garden hostess and managers."}
{"text":"Always a great environment when we come here, like most olive gardens you visit. Servers are always friendly and the manager goes above and beyond. Definitely one of our favorite franchises to visit, it never disappoints. Food is always amazing as well. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Drive 15 miles out of my way to have Olive Garden at this particular location. The service and experience are far beyond any other Olive Garden I've ever visited in Arizona. Keep up the incredible work. If you're lucky, get Vanessa. She's absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"I really like this Olive Garden location so close to home for me.  After a very disappointing experience at a different location (see my review of the Olive Garden on Centennial), I came here and received the best service.  I was seated right away.  My drink came out right away.  My soup came out fast and hot.  The Chicken Marsala was delicious and perfectly cooked.  I ordered a dessert to go which my server comped after hearing about my woes at the other location.  I told her that was very unneccessary and I mean that most sincerely.  I would have had no issues paying for my dessert but it was nice of her to care.  This is certainly my go to OG."}
{"text":"Lunch was beyond impressive. I'm talking spot on from beginning to end . Service was great, food was hot, fresh & yummy !
The kids meals were a great deal at $5.50 per kid . 
The breadsticks were hot and tasty . I have to say this was one of the best experiences I have had here ."}
{"text":"Olive Garden, being a chain, is pretty well standard across the board. They all look the same. The food is basically the same. The service is usually friendly and fast. To have a good experience, while nice, is simply forgettable. It is the rare bad experience which leaves the lasting impressions. That is what makes it so difficult to review this Olive Garden. It is consistently solid. That is not to say it isn't without its faults. A couple of times I have gone in for lunch but was not given a lunch menu. These times were on weekends and holidays. I asked if they were not serving the lunch menu do to the specific day but each time they apologized and brought me a lunch menu. I am grateful for that since it was lunch I was craving in the first place. My lunches, whether I get soup, salad or some part of a duo, are always the same quality I have learned to expect regardless which OG I am visiting. What stood out in the positive on my most recent visit to this location was the iced tea to go that my server brought me. On a hot July day that was very much appreciated."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here and given the little time I spent inside, I will keep this review short and sweet.  What makes this visit so frustrating to me is that I was ignored.  I walked in seeing that the restaurant was busy on a Saturday afternoon.  I was seated quickly in what seemed to be the busiest part of the restaurant with two large parties around me.  I saw server after server brigning salad, bread sticks and sauce to all of the tables while all walked past me without so much as a look.  Then I saw a family come in, get seated, and have their drink orders taken right away.  Meanwhile I have been in here for nearly 10 minutes and I have not seen a server or anybody for that matter who would take my drink order.  That is when I stormed out and told the host up front that I had not even been acknowledged.  He asked if I would like to speak to a manager but I chose not to.  I just wanted to leave.  I went to a different Olive Garden and received superb service there.  Not to mention a good meal."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Olive Garden's unlimited soup and salad lunch and I had a very good experience today at this location. I was surprised at how busy the restaurant was at 11:30am on a Saturday afternoon but hey they must be doing something right.

My sister and I were seated right away and our server was very nice and brought drinks and salad very quickly. We ordered Zuppa Toscana and as always it was hot and delicious. Overall good experience. I would definitely come back for lunch."}
{"text":"Love hate relationship lol but over all i wouldn't stop going there.. i go at least once a week until they mess the order up then i dont go for months"}
{"text":"We decided to come here after a night of mini golf and it was a huge mistake. We got a table pretty fast considering how busy it was, but walking to our table we saw so many empty seats and so many people waiting. It was strange. I ordered a starter and its never a good sign when it come after your food gets there. Our waitress would forget things we asked for all the time and then when we would ask about it she would tell us she didnt forget she was getting to it. I would have given more respect if she would have just admited to forgeting and moved on. You dont have to lie. Everyone at the table wasnt happy with how there meal came out. Fish was over cooked, noodles dry, drinks being empty for long periods of time, when salad was brought out there was barley any in the bowl. Just a waste of time and money. Avoid."}
{"text":"Best food in Olive Garden that been is here. 
Friendly staff we ask for private are for six of as the they did gave it to as."}
{"text":"Friday night and time for some after work take out! I frequent this Olive Garden about 2-4 times every month when I don't feel like cooking. Rarely do I eat inside so this review is strictly on take out and the To Go area of the place. 
The staff is always very friendly and helpful and the To Go counter people are fast and friendly as well. Today I ordered off the new lighter menu which is under 575 calories and tried the shrimp scampi. My order time was 20min which was perfectly exceptable. My dish was very very good. It was lightly sauced and my shrimp were huge. The asparagus was yummy and cooked perfectly. I enjoyed every last bite. The only thing I wasn't to pleased with was my soup. I ordered the chicken gnocchi and all I could taste were carrots. I didn't really have any because I didn't like the flavor. That is why I'm giving them a 4 star. The soup is always a hit and miss. It's either really good or other times its lacking flavor or even missing main ingredient. 
The manager there has always been very helpful. I had ordered a huge container of soup for my family for us all to share. It was the zuppa tuscana and when I got home it was missing potatoes and meat. Crazy I know lol so I was pretty upset and called the manager and she ended up sending me a gift card in the mail to make up for the mistake. I was very impressed and that is why I have been loyal to this location. Customer service is exceptional and I appreciate that in a business."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Sunday. It was a little busy and we had to wait about 35 minutes. The service was well worth the wait. We were seated in Tony's section and he was extremely charismatic and fun. The food was very good. The beer was a little expensive but Tony made the experience well worth it. The manager even stopped by our table and gave us a coupon for next time. All in all a great experience. I recommend going there and requesting to sit with Tony!"}
{"text":"Make sure you read the updates below to get the whole picture. It balances out the first review!!!

Not a great experience. Upon arrival there were 6 people working the host(ess) podium and only 3 people in front of us. The people working seemed unorganized and confused. When a table finally was suggested it was in the bar. The restaurant was half empty and there was no one in the bar. We ended up taking the table in the bar because no effort was made by the host to seat us elsewhere in the restaurant after we said we didn't want to sit in the bar.  We ordered two sodas, I had the bruschetta and my partner the lasagne. The food was mediocre, but nothing new there. 

When the bill came we paid, the waiter came out and told us when he tried to run our card he got a message to call the bank. He didn't know what to do so gave us the card back and walked away from the table. OK then. 

I called the bank and they told me that there was no record of the restaurant even attempting to run a transaction on the card. She mentioned their payment processor was having an issue and cards had to be run by being entered manually. Since the staff didn't seem to have a clue, we paid via cash and left. 

We went to this restaurant to honor the memory of a dear friend we lost who liked to go there, and we had the meal we last had with her at the place. It will have to remain a nice memory, because we're not in a hurry to go back to this, or any other Olive Garden.

UPDATE (3/31): Chris with their guest relations department followed up apologizing for our bad experience, which we appreciate. We will give the restaurant another try and update our review after that experience. Follow-up by guest relations is a 5-STAR experience. Thank you Chris!

Update (4/22): So we revisited the restaurant last night and our experience was the polar opposite of our previous visit. The host was courteous and seated us at a great table. Our waiter (Chris if I recall right) was new. Only had been on the job for three days. He did a good job, he'll be excellent in a few days! The food was good and we left the place in a great mood. What a different experience this was. So glad we tried again. Thank you Chris with guest relations for your follow up, and thanks for a great meal to the staff! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal yesterday. Food was fresh and tasty. Service was a tad bit slow but I think they were a bit busy for a typical Monday lunch. Parking was very plentiful. I'm annoyed that app games are no longer free to play at the table. What gives?"}
{"text":"We've ate here quite a few times and have enjoyed ourselves every time. Just don't come in a hurry! They seem to run things pretty slow and they are always busy. Everyone is really friendly and food is always on point. I can never get enough of their breadsticks and salad! Seriously if I could just come in for that I would. I don't care for soup so the soup salad and stick deal is a waste. Pasta is always perfect and hot. I am really enjoying that you can play games at the table and pay at your table on the game tablet. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I was craving some soup and salad today and just had to go to Olive Garden. The service was OK - the restaurant was very busy so our server was a little distant. The salad was a bit overly dressed but I still enjoyed it. The new Chicken and Gnocchi soup was a delightful surprise - definitely an improvement over the 3 soup offerings they've had for years. I will be coming back in several months when I have another soup and salad craving..."}
{"text":"My kids love Olive Garden and we go a lot. We always try to avoid this location because it's usually a nightmare here....bad service, order is wrong/missing stuff, food is bad, etc. However, this location is the closest to our house. 

Today we came in for lunch and our server was Paul H. He was amazing!!! He was super nice, very prompt and he just is great at his job! We've never had good service at this location and we were shocked at how great he was. He brought grapes for my kids to snack on while we waited. He was great about refills on drinks, soups & breadsticks. We will definitely request his section every time we come! 

Thank you so much Paul H. for great service!"}
{"text":"Service was good she was attentive, friendly, and quick. Food was good. Just there are so many true Italian food restaurants with authentic food it's just not comparable to me. It's always a good cheat with the bread sticks and the soup is always good!"}
{"text":"Dad went olive garden and got take out. They forgot his and offered to send him a $10 gift card as an apology. He instead kind of the gift card sent to me,( a college student in Reno). They were so sweet and wrote me a letter with the gift card.

Such sweet people and great customer service."}

{"text":"Ask for Denisse R. For your server! My husband and I love going to Olive Garden. We were just in Friday night and as always they were busy. However that didn't stop Denisse from giving us amazing service!! She is the best server in that place so far and made our dining experience wonderful. I just wish the other servers there were like her because my husband and I have had terrible service their other times. The only other thing that could enhance the experience is if they got rid of that tablet on the table. I hate that thing."}
{"text":"I've never been to an Olive Garden and never will because unlike some people I know the difference between good food and some thing that was cooked up and shipped from Mexico.  They probably have rabbit instead of chicken and the people they call chefs probably walked over from their job at the nearest Taco Bell.  I'm sorry if you like this place but it's obvious that you mistook this place for a Chipotle."}
{"text":"Went for a family dinner out!!!  We had three little ones.  It took a while to be seated and it was a Sunday night. But with that being said the food was good, service was good but the company was Awesome. The price incredible. Reasonable wow!

{"text":"This was the best Olive Garden ever, server was wonderful food was amazing ever thing was very delicious was one of my best experience in Vegas"}
{"text":"Is it me?  Do I somehow bring this out in people?

Last night, 9:30pm, I'm running too close to 10pm for my own good since I don't want a burger.  GrubHub sucks so I called Olive Garden.  This Olive Garden on 75th Avenue and Thomas Road.  Fiesta Mall.

I ordered dinner, jumped in the car, reached the restaurant and by my clock and I'm meticulous about setting the correct time, it was 9:54pm.  When I got the to the front door, it was locked.

Now, let's examine this: I do understand security and I do understand that restaurants are being robbed more than in the past.  But there are no mass murderers in the news, and you are operating a frigging restaurant that is supposedly open to the public, but you gotta lock up before closing time.  A little overbearing?  Yes.  I think so.

But that's not the bad part.  The bad part is, while I pounded on the glass, I counted 11 employees working inside the restaurant that WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ME.  ELEVEN!  

That's training.  Or lack of training.  Seemingly no one has reminded/told them to be courteous.   Not one person motioned, like with a #1 finger, meaning,  \"just a second\", or \"let me get the manager\" nothing.  THEY JUST IGNORED ME.  That is personally offensive.  And it pissed me off.  On my worst day, I've never treated a customer like that.

Today I called Darden Corporate Customer Service, owner of Olive Garden and they were closed.  Monday, 2:15pm Phoenix-time, Customer Service for all of Darden Restaurants, which include Olive Garden, Capitol Grille, Bahama Breeze, Yard House, Eddie V's, Season's 52 and Longhorn Steakhouse is closed.  It's only open from10am-4pm EDT.  How truly underwhelming is that?  \"We don't care because we don't have to\" or something.  Like the locked door, the bunker mentality reception I got was truly underwhelming.

Note to bald manager: you're in the \"P\" business, buddy, but it isn't \"pasta\".  It's \"people\".  You moron."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and personal! They have terrific service and food.  They are consistent and honest.  The wait staff is friendly and helpful! We loved going there again and again~ We would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"You know, sometimes you just need some old school ghetto Italian food, and the OG services that purpose for me! 

Yes....I am a fan of Olive Garden, THERE I said it! I could live off of their salad and bread sticks alone! 

I always order the same thing and it always tastes the same. That's one thing a chain restaurant like the OG has going for them, consistently the same. Doesn't matter where I go in the U.S. my eggplant parmigiana will always taste and look the same. 

Last Friday I didn't want to cook and I wanted Italian. Since we are still somewhat new to the 'hood and don't know all the local spots yet, we jumped in the car and went to Olive Garden. When we pulled up there were people EVERYWHERE, like laying in the grass outside of the restaurant all homeless style. I thought for sure it would be an hour wait, but the hostess said 20-30 minutes. We saddled up to the bar, got an adult beverage and 20 minutes later we were being shown to our seat. 

I must say, our waiter was FANTASTIC! His name was Will and he deserves a raise! He was on top of the ball, had a bit of cheese about him on the delivery of his lines, but it was never annoying (I HATE when waiters pour on the cheese and don't know when to stop, or how to be funny) But no Will, dude was all over it and great! 

Our dinners arrived fast, tasted great and our drinks never got low."}
{"text":"My in-laws came in to town in order to catch a flight out of McCarran. They do not live near an Olive Garden any longer, and were really looking forward to a treat before they left.

Olive Garden used to be a really a pretty decent place to take your family. The salad and breadsticks are always tasty, as they were this time as well. Our food was just okay though .Colin was our waiter, and he was really great. Attentive and seemed to really enjoy his job.

I got the Ravioli di Portobello. When it arrived, it looked as though it sat too long and 'died' in the window. The cream sauce was starting to look separated. It was not steaming hot by any means, but it was warm enough. Barely. I chose this dish because it had sun-dried tomatoes as part of the sauce. I could not tell that there were actually sun-dried tomatoes in any part of this dish. There just was no depth of flavor, it was all just heavy cream sauc-y. I should have used my lemon from my drink to squirt over the top of my meal. That would have brought out the flavor, and I am still kicking myself for not thinking of that sooner.

My husband chose the Chicken Scampi, and only because others had highly recommended this dish. This also looked like it sat too long in the window, and seemed somewhat dried up. It also probably could have used some fresh lemon juice added to it. My in-laws got the Cheese Raviolis with meat sauce. My husband had some of theirs, and he said it was great. He liked it much better than his chicken, and said that it had great flavor. 

My favorite part was the little dessert cup, the chocolate dolcini. THIS was wonderful. I liked that it was a creamy mousse cup that was chilled and had little chocolate shavings on top. It was just the right size, and had great flavor. There was also a lemon flavored one as well as a tiramisu version.

Not in any hurry to get back. It is very loud and somewhat cramped in the restaurant. The food was okay, but just okay."}

I hadn't been to Olive Garden in about 7 years. Nothing has changed. The food is not authentic Italian but you should already know that. It's generous and good however. Although this Olive Garden is always crowded, our party of 3 were seated within 5 minutes. Other than that what can I say? It's Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night and food was great as usual seemed like I had more shrimp in my Alfredo here than any other location. The server was very nice but just a little too pushy but was quick with our order and drinks. Atmosphere was pleasant and the place was clean. No issues here."}

The server (Rome ) was excellent

and took our appetizer order nice
4. When we seen there was a group of 12-15
Being seated next to us we thought ...there goes the great service.... But WE where wrong  Rome was always checking on us and always keeping my husbands ice tea drink full 
5. Food was Excellent Service by Server ( ROME ) ask for him really Nice young Man
Excellent above and More Thank You Rome

{"text":"I USED to like the food at Olive Garden...I certainly WON'T go back anymore though! 

We attended a rather large party at the Surprise location yesterday and it was a disaster from the start. First, I convinced my husband to go based on the fact they have steak and it's known to be pretty good. Well, when we get there to order, there was NO STEAK AT ALL! (It was only 4 p.m. and they didn't close until 10 p.m. - WOW) Apparently there was a promotion that was ending and they decided not to order more steak - whatever sense that makes :-/ The promotional steak and regular steak were 2 different sizes. STRIKE ONE!! 
Second, I inquired about a meal I really enjoyed the last time I was there, the Mixed Grill, and they don't even offer it anymore - and NOTHING close to it. That was ALL I had a taste for. :-( STRIKE TWO!! 
Third, I settled for the Herb-Grilled Salmon with Parmesan broccoli (or what it was described as on the menu). When my food arrived, I knew something was strange right away - the broccoli looked as plain and dry as could be and the salmon looked like it was pan-seared instead of grilled (it was crispy, like it was fried). When I tasted both, I told the waiter about them and ultimately decided to forego dinner there. STRIKE THREE YOU'RE OUT!! 

I'm not sure if it was just this location, but they've lost this family's business."}

Next time we do a party we will definitely use Olive Garden again!!"}

She knew the menu and made suggestions.  The salad and breadsticks were good(as always).  We ordered two mixed drinks and they were wonderful.  The dining area appeared clean and tidy.  The price was average.  I left my server a pretty nice tip and I'm happy to leave them a nice review."}

We didn't wait to be sat, six of us.  We were waited on promptly and politely.  Our food was brought out in a timely manner and exactly as ordered.  Kaitlin was our server and she was GREAT!  I strongly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"If I could get away with no stars I would.  My family and I went there, all six of us.  Not one, not two but three times they tried to seat us at a 4 person table with a chair on one end and a high chair on the other.  There would have been absolutely NO ROOM for food!  It was terrible.  I asked the manager, Lori, on the way out (because I didn't stay to dine) why this happened.  I asked why we weren't given a larger table.  Apparently the large dining table was reserved for 45 minutes from when I spoke to her.  Well if they had sat us there upon arrival, 30 minutes prior to our conversation, we would have been done and gone by then.  Then she said well if you give me 2 minutes I can clear a larger table.  Um, why wasn't that done to begin with?  This location really should just close.  I have been a long time Ahwatukee resident and the service, wait time and food just get worse and worse every year.

We had a newer waitress who was pretty slow and didn't give us very good service. The food she brought out was really delicious, so I can't complain too much. Everything was hot and fresh. The new server put in one of the orders wrong, though. 

The manager, Mr. Sheets, came out and listened to all of my concerns and was super helpful with getting the problems solved. That's all I can ever ask for with management. He turned a meh experience into a fantastic one, and really left a good impression."}
{"text":"This is the best Olive Garden I have been to, and I have recently started a trend of going to an Olive Garden whenever I can.  

My girlfriend and I went on a Friday night and there were people lined up out the door.   When we walked in, however, there was seating at the bar that was open, and we were quickly able to get a table.  We were quickly greeted by our server, whose name escapes me, but he was incredibly attentive the entire time for us.

We left feeling full and ready to continue our night of adventures!"}
{"text":"This experience was excellent. I haven't been able to say that about a Darden restaurant in awhile. Great service from Chelsea and the others. Hot coffee, great lunch choices and of course unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks for 7.99. You can add a little appetizer side for 2.99. Budget eaters can definitely do well here. I would recommend this location for lunch any day."}
{"text":"We celebrated my moms 75th birthday with the family this evening.  It's a place where kids and adults can enjoy great food.  Amber is an exceptional server.  Amber took the time to write my mom a special Happy Birthday note and enclosed it in her dessert box.  Thank you Amber!"}
{"text":"It's been a couple years since I've been to the westside Olive Garden. On my last visit my friend and I grabbed a late lunch/early dinner and took advantage of their unlimited soup/salad/breadsticks option. While tasty, there was a bit of a snafu when we were seated with the lunch menu and charged the dinner price. Not a huge deal, but it was about a $3 jump in price we weren't expecting. 

I recently had food from this location again while visiting my parents. They were heading home from around the mall and my dad hadn't had OG in a long time so he suggested it. A-OK by me. 

I went with my old standby, chicken fettucine alfredo with salad. The to-go salad portion is huge and comes with the dressing, croutons, and cheese packaged separately so nothing gets soggy. As you would expect with their salad, it comes with a ton of iceberg lettuce, one tomato slice, two black olives, two pepperoncini, and a pile of red onion slices. It held up well as packaged to the next day for lunch. 

My fettucine was a little disappointing. The chicken was different than I remembered it; I don't know if they've changed suppliers or the preparation in the kitchen has changed, but the quality felt lesser than previous visits to the chain. The noodles and sauce were fine and a large portion - enough for two meals. 

On to-go orders, each meal comes with two breadsticks. 

My dad and boyfriend got soup as their side, and it's definitely the way to go on takeout. The bowls were huge - we guessed at least double of what you get when you dine in. They got an appetizer of calamari and that didn't fare well as takeout; not surprising in hindsight, but disappointing nonetheless. The pasta also benefits from dining in, but wasn't bad once it got home. 

When we want pasta we usually hit up a small spot on the north side, but OG will always have a soft spot for those of us who grew up in the suburbs. They're generally consistent, offer some good deals, and have a huge menu that holds something for everyone."}
{"text":"The Olive Garden is the best all-you-can-eat restaurant there is. If you don't leave here completely stuffed, you're doing it wrong. 

Our visit happened to be during their Never Ending Pasta Special, which I believe happens every winter and fall. I ordered fettuccine with Asiago Garlic Alfredo with crispy chicken fritta. It was delicious! I ordered it again for my second plate, which promptly went in a to go box. Normally I order the Chicken Scampi, which is an angel based pasta with a white wine sauce. This was not offered as 'never ending'. 

While the pasta is good, what makes this restaurant stand out is the unlimited salad and breadsticks. I am obsessed with the salad dressing. We always order extra salad dressing on the side (free of charge!) because the salad tends to come with just a little dressing. We also dip the breadsticks in the dressing! So good. 

I deducted one star because service here is hit or miss. Our waiter this visit, Rich, was fantastic. Other times the service hasn't been great. I always find myself coming back for more salad and breadsticks though!

Note: This time I didn't order a drink, but their frozen strawberry mango margarita is amazing."}
{"text":"The last couple of times I visited this location was disastrous. On the first occasion I attended a graduation party with 20 people in it. The one waitress was overwhelmed.  She had a bad attitude within the 6th order. Saying, \"Wait a minute\", because she couldn't write or spell fast enough. I then requested to get a second server to help her. Then the service slid  into the toilet.  It felt as if we were being rushed and sub-quality food and drinks  served. It took me a long time to go back.

The second time I visited with my mother and boyfriend.  Her order was good, however, my boyfriend and I ordered the same entree.  One was well made the other looked rushed. The  maitre d just grinned and kept pushing the vinegar tasting house wine. 

I will not return for a 3rd time, nor will I ever recommend this dated fake Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a fan of ALL Olive Gardens... I love this restaurant. So, if you are ever in Vegas and you don't want to pay for the expensive buffets or overpriced food on the strip..... yes, even McDonald's is overpriced people. Drive down to this Olive Garden: Patricia was the hostess and she was a great greeter; she sat us down pretty fast. Nicole was our waitress and she was cool too. P.S. I love the coffee here!"}
{"text":"What a fucking great place. Best quality silverware this side of the Mississippi. Iced tea to die for. Lasagna I'd murder a bitch for. QT right next door to conveniently grab a blunt wrap and a 40oz after dinner. Just be careful by the air pump. There's some sketchy people over there. If you're ever over here you should check out Phoenix Sofa Factory inside the Metro Center Mall. Most amazing furniture prices I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! Placed an order online and my fiancée picked it up. It just so happens I was on the phone with her when she picked up the food, and I witnessed how friendly, polite and fast they were. The moment she walked in she was greeted multiple times and they also asked her how her day was. They immediately grabbed our food and proceeded to ring her up. Our order was correct and ready.  Thank you Tiana (Manager) and rest of the staff. Such an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Been here several times with my wife and a few more with the kids in tow. Food is always good. Servers are usually good. Can get a little congested on certain days. The parking lot is tight and is the only downside to this location."}
{"text":"Solid. Haven't been here in years! Soup salad breadsticks combo is classic and the best thing to get here. I ordered a small plate of fettuccine alfredo as well, pretty bland but does the job. Minestrone is the only vegetarian soup and it's fine, could use some hot sauce. Mom got the Mediterranean flatbread, which had a lot of yummy vegetables on it. We came between lunch and dinner and had excellent service, shoutout to Anne B for being charismatic, understanding and helpful. Good prices."}
{"text":"I was like OK all of garden they're finally open let me come in here and have some lunch. I get inside the music is so freaking loud. The lady goes to set me down at my table on the only one in the section there's no one else around in the music is so freaking loud you can't eat or think. I asked him to turn the music down 15 minutes later music is still loud. Got up and left and I told him the reason why am Leaving is because you're music is too loud. The manager acted like he didn't care. I will never be back to this Olive Garden"}
{"text":"Linex was our server and he is amazing!  Our glasses were never empty. He wasn't without a smile and a chuckle every time we saw him. He made our experience pleasant. This restaurant made a good decision in having him on board. Thanks Linex!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden \"jumped the shark\" years ago.  They are a drain on the income of the company that owns them because they can't justify the prices they charge, thus less people are going in year after year.  The food is bland and overpriced, example, $13.00 for spaghetti and meatballs, $16 for lasagna????  Your food better be damn good at those prices, and Olive Garden is not even close.  There are so many restaurants that have better food and lower prices in Vegas that it's just a matter of time before Olive Garden is no more....one caveat:   the servers are really good, they try their best to do everything right, I can't fault them for the company's food and pricing problems."}
{"text":"I frequently go to this location and the service and food is always great. I have never had an issue once with staff or food. Everyone is friendly and food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay experience. Went during the middle of the day (around 3pm) and wasn't greeted for about 3-4 minutes...nobody out front. After being sat, server didn't come by for about 5 minutes. We were the only table in a section of booths cornered off so perhaps nobody told him we had been seated? Meal was okay, nothing spectacular. Asked for a pint of the alfredo sauce which we have gotten numerous times, not only at other locations but at THIS location also, and were told they can't do that anymore? News to us and they still wren't willing to accommodate. Definitely won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Had the grilled shrimp pasta and was delicious. Love the fresh salad and bread sticks."}
{"text":"I was at Olive Garden today and I have to say it was very pleasant, my wife and I went around 11ish and there was some customers, but waiting was no issue and wasn't to too busy, we had excellent service in my opinion, because were not at a 5 or higher rated restaurant, so I don't expect to have some waitress or waiter act like my personal butler lol and account for every little detail I need. 

Yet the atmosphere, music, food, and service was 4 stars, the 5th star would of been due to pricing, because for a beer 5 bucks is a rip off in my opinion and a glass of regular whine 11.95 is far beyond my reach when I can go out and buy a bottle, but I still felt it was a great place for myself and my wife."}
{"text":"Ok it's Olive Garden what can I say? I ordered take out. Order process was easy and simple, it was about 10 minutes late from the original ETA but I'm not going to complain, they seemed pretty busy. Everyone was nice and the food was good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Catalina is awesome!!  The food was amazing and always a great atmosphere.  Se brought us peach tea cups full to go and even wrote our individual name on our left overs to make sure we didn't get them mixed up when we got home.  She didn't understand the concept of a four course meal and she probably shouldn't since it is t a 4 or 5 star restaurant but she listened and tried to bring everything in courses!  Very sweet girl!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have nothing positive to say about this location. My family has always been long time lovers of Olive Garden but the food at this location was just awful. The calamari was gooey, the salad browned and the flatbread pizza was completely inedible. It tasted like someone just dumped olive juice on bread and called it a pizza. We will not be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of most chain restaurants but Olive Garden is one of the few I enjoy.  I like their recipes and they always have some good deal going on. The toughest choice is always whether to get soup or salad as both are great starters.  Try not to eat too many breadsticks so that you can eat your dinner. :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Olive Garden in quite some years and the food was good.  The salad and breadsticks have not changed, but there were some new additions on the menu thay are worth the try.  Waiter and manager came around frequently to check on service and see how things were going.  Overall a good value for what you pay for."}
{"text":"I usually order pasta with chicken or seafood and so far no complaints. Food is hot and delicious and generously portioned. I must time my arrival perfectly; I've never had to wait at this location. Great service and wait staff. Two thumbs up to Jaime and Kyle"}
{"text":"We walked in and there was some what if a wait saw that there was sitting in the bar area, and it's all open seating! The bartender was on it all! My hat is off to him, he was running around like crazy, but remembered everything."}
{"text":"The food is OK, very bland. The noodles were a little over cooked. However the service was good. 
I thought Olive Garden was better than I remembered."}
{"text":"The OG has been consistent with their food throughout the years. You can get full off their soup, salad and breadsticks quite easily. Their entree prices have definitely increased for the past couple of years, but I guess it's the way the economy is going. Service isn't too terrible and they are quite efficient when it comes to bringing out your appetizers, salad and soup. I would definitely say not bad for a chain restaurant and you can definitely leave full!"}
{"text":"We were seated very fast then when our waiter comes around, we order our food and when my husband was asked soup or salad, he asked the waiter which soup he thought was best. The waiter looked at him confused and asked if he just wanted salad instead, I thought that was very rude when all my husband wanted was an opinion and he couldn't provide that. At first he seemed frustrated to be waiting on us and doing his job but towards the middle and end of our dinner, he seemed to lighten up a little and was willing to help. 3 stars because he improved his attitude."}
{"text":"Service gets a A++, but the gluten free food gets a D-. Of course the gluten free food will matter to me because i am a food junkie and since I can't have gluten or Dairy the taste is extremely important to me. Beware that the gluten free food is pre made, packaged and just heated when you order it, not ok by any means. Gluten Free food needs to be made fresh and served right away, especially pasta. The pasta was extremely hard and I had to return the food. Normally I would just suck it up and eat it, but this just wasn't okay. If they were to reheat it, it would just become more hard. Moving on to the Positive side, the service was amazing. My family and I went late and stayed late ( far after they closed) we didn't even notice we were too busy laughing, talking, sharing stories ETC. The staff didn't mention a word, they kept serving us with a smile on their face. When I finally looked at the time, I was shocked. OMG ITS TIME TO GO, LIKE NOW! I said loudly. The staff laughed and said it was ok, but we were a bit mortified. We quickly paid and packed up and left. I could tell the staff was tired and I'm sure ready to go home but they were so polite and tried to be more pleasant than i could really imagine being. If you don't have to eat Gluten Free, really go! My family said the food was delicious. Gluten Free Foodies beware!  =]"}
{"text":"This Olive garden was good, I came here for my now 2 year olds b'day (I know if she could talk she probably wouldn't want to eat here, it's just an excuse for me to pig out hehe.) 

I hadn't eaten at one in a long time, there prices seem to have sky rocketed and servings are a bit smaller. 

The Salad, is still delicious, thier bread sticks where lagging it and salty, I remeber them being much better. 

The only negative thing was... That although I had a good waitress she was sloow... so I pretty much filled up on the salad and bread sticks. 

I had the Chicken and Shrimp Cabanero, I took a few bites and took it for leftovers... when I did eat it the next day, it was pretty good, ain't gonna lie."}
{"text":"I think there was a change in management.  I know there was a change in decor! Looks much nicer now.  I took a few pictures,  tried to not capture people but ir was difficult since the place was packed at 7:30 pm on  Thursday night.  I ordered the endless lasagna, with chicken gnocchi soup.  Husband got the spaghetti wth the Tuscan sausage, potatoe and kale soup.  The waitress was awesome! Friendly, knowledgeable in regard to the menu, and overall just great company when she was at the table. 

Bathroom was a little messy, but not too bad. The best thing about the ladies room is the family friendly way its set up.  For instance,  i didn't have to try holding my 4 year old with one arm, my purse in the other, turning on the faucet... not dropping one of them . Great job providing that for moms!  The changing table is also in a corner discretely tucked aside a shallow wall divide,  next to a trash bin...a bit of privacy is always nice, not having your child's bum exposed to the world along with all the unpleasantness a dirty diaper can offer!! Another nice consideration. I wonder if the men's room is the same? I didn't check!"}
{"text":"I was in Olive garden today the food was great the service was great would highly recommend this restaurant I would definitely go back to eat at the Olive Garden in Elyria"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I must come to Olive Garden!  We went for a late lunch this past Sunday ( 3pm ) and I was surprised to see that they were busy.  I had the spaghetti with Italian sausage and of course we had to have those little donuts with the chocolate sauce!  Yummy.  We had a very funny waitress.  My only complaint is that we don't have an Olive Garden in Hawaii, not fair!!!  can't wait till we go back."}
{"text":"More often than not the service and food are not good quality. There is always a wait no matter what day or time you come in. I wrote an email to Olive Garden about this restaurant. Their generic response basically said there's a wait when it's peak hours but I can go to the bar if I don't want to wait. How is 8:30 pm on a Sunday night with half of the tables empty \"peak hours?\""}
{"text":"This location is not consistant with the quality of their food. I always split a chicken alfredo with my BF and lately it has been coming out dry. Thier portions also change, sometimes it seems like we get more than other times. The service is usually ok with the exepction of an older waitress who was so rude. She basically threw the dishes on the table and had an unpolite obnoxious voice. My BF spilled his drink and she didnt even offer napkins or help clean it up. Instead she tried making jokes about brining him a kids cup with a lid several times. I regret not complaining to the manager but figured she wouldnt last. From now on I will go out of my way to another location for better food and service."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of 'THE' Olive Garden, yes you have to say THE OLIVE GARDEN.  I've ordered take-out from this location and also have picked numerous UBEReats orders from this location as well.  Well, I finally sat down for my own personal eatery visit.  I love the staff at this location, always nice, very clean, fast service, servers know the menu and can describe the entrees available.  That's always a plus to me.

Special treat for me and my team, Team Lunch - OG Style.  OK, so you have to try the Spicy Calabrian Chicken sandwich.  Spicy chicken tenders sandwiched between those DELICIOUS breadsticks. O-M-G, so good, so tender and to my surprise a little heat.  Yes, I know it a SPICY Calabrian Chicken sandwich, but restaurants usually fall short of \"SPICE\".  Well not this time, it had KICK to it.  Accompanied with fries and endless salad and breadsticks...just take the breadsticks home to the kiddos, your sandwich is a breadstick.  And it's free, who turns down FREE breadsticks...say WHAT, say HUH? You better take those breadsticks home.

This location gets super busy Fri-Sun night, you WILL wait.  Go for lunch, if you get there by 11:30a you will be seated and eating your 1st plate of salad by 11:45a.  

But this is just my opinion, you check it out..."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong here. The chicken fettuccine alfredo is amazing. My waiter, Roman is the best waiter is all the land. He's fast, friendly, and totally attentive. When you're treated well, your experience is great! The downside is that I went on a Sunday and it was pretty packed."}
{"text":"Manager was a dick! He treated the waitress like shit! She was busting ass doing her best and he was just kicking her when she was down. Best waitress ever so sweet and understanding and she was super cute. Shout out to Maria serving table 93. You're my girl! Hope you make it through the night ok."}
{"text":"have eaten at Olive Garden restaurants for numerous years but today was the first time I was charged for having salad from my friend's bowl of salad.  I ordered soup and he ordered salad so he served me some salad on a small plate.  When the bill arrived, I was charged $4.49 for having salad.  I asked her to get the manager, who took the charge off my bill.  My friends and I have always shared the salad even if some of us order soup.  Most servers ask if we need extra salad plates but I have never been charged until today.  I will probably eat at another location next time since there's one on every corner."}
{"text":"I am giving them two because I knew how bad it was going to be. It you have ever had real Italian food or lived on the East Coast, you know better than to fall for those stupid commercials with the 12 Italian family members shouting across the table to one another while enjoying an Olive Garden meal. This is not possible, First of all, bread sticks are not bread at all. 

So, my friend had a birthday and this was his choice and though I tried to talk him into ANY other place, here we ended  up. 

First of all a note to the chef; LAY OFF THE SALT, FELLA!

The salad, SALTY. The pasta sauces, SALTY. The dressings, SALTY. Soup: SALTY.

Nothing worth mentioning, we tried several items and were disappointed, But we had breadsticks, so why worry?

They funny thing is they had wings and they were cooked to perfection. Of course then they put spicy tomato sauce and hot oil on top. 

Hopefully my blood pressure will return to normal before my friends next birthday...

The two stars are for service because he did bring the food."}
{"text":"Wow this is olive garden.?..The company has changed since I've last been..and for the better.

Dec 3rd at 7pmTuesday night

The food. .unexpectedly awesome. ... full flavors and enough to fill you up but not so much... It ll keep you wanting more.

Service above my expectation again.... personally I feel wanted and that I was a special guest.  My server was amazingly attentive

Service. .. my server was Ashley and she went above and beyond and she was very attentive. .I know it's a chain but her hospitality towards me was effective to have me go back and bring friends.

I asked for a sample taste for the smoked Mozerella sauce vs parmesan cream sauce and was brought out two boats and bread sticks...I was only expecting a little spoon taste

When coming here ...expect the unexpecting...even a nice meet and great with the Manager making the rounds showed respect.nice very nice

The food tasted fresh and very good and even the bussers dress professional

Good food good price
Ambiance wasn't too loud with the piped in music and such so it was relaxing."}
{"text":"Sigh!! Went in for drinks, appetizer, and dessert. Could not even get a basic drink...left and went to Longhorns for a stocked bar and much better bar service."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  I usually love this place but the hostess was rude and the waitress wasn't the nicest either.  On top of it, I ordered something new-the tilapia and shrimp.  It smelt so bad!!  I tried to get over the smell but it was tough.  Fish was soggy and just not good altogether.  I would suggest a different location? I've never had a bad experience at this place before."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Olive Garden, but when it come to good service this is not your place. I have been here twice and each time the hostess has been less than pleasant. Not to mention how long it takes to get a waiter to come to your table. If you enjoy spending a few hours at a restaurant for lunch or dinner then this is your place! If not, I'd skip the headache and find somewhere else! 

Fun fact, they will close your bottle of wine up for you if you don't finish it so you can take it home"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Olive Garden for months at lunchtime and have had good to great experiences  I usually head in around 1 , after the rush, and pretty much stick to the soup/ entree lunch menu,  food on their lunch menu has been surprisingly good, and good value.

Yes it's a chain but the consistency of the lunch offering has been wonderful  over the past 4 months , the servers have been great , hostesses great and it's not the understaffed dead-zone  that many of the surrounding chains offer you  should you dine later than average. 

 I recently had a small  issue they were really good re wanting to help,    The manager , and I regret I don't have the name,  overheard and went above and beyond in  remedying the situation so if there were to be another issue I have full confidence that they'd handle it appropriately."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and used the online check in from home so when we walked in only had to wait a few minutes before getting seated so that was awesome ! Our server was Kimberly S. which was very friendly to us and let us try some wine before making a choice with dinner. It's people like her that makes me want to come back to this restaurant and make it enjoyable. Communicating with the customer is huge and more personable rather their \"Ziosk\" tablet. I live the alfredo pasta and it seemed a little less creamy from what I'm use to other than that this will be my regular place to come visit !"}
{"text":"We aren't big on chain restaurants, but the food was good & Alexander our server was wonderful. It is nice to have a Server actually wait on you! A lost art in my opinion. We will request him when we go back, which is frequent. The Manager also visited our table - which I always think is a nice personal touch.
Thumbs up for Olive Garden & Alexander!"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely completely sold on the all you can eat Zuppa Tuscana. Seriously. Especially when you go for lunch. Killer deal. Today I'm going to try a new soup, the chicken and gnocchi. We'll see how it shows . I also like the tried and true chicken Alfredo. I love theirs new branding as well. Might sound funny, but the have the coolest kids menu of pretty much any restaurant. Love it."}
{"text":"It's crazy to think that I've lived here for 10 years... And this is the very first restaurant that I ate at when I first moved here. Holy Canoli!

Olive Garden is always consistent with their food, never really a bad experience... Ok, that was a lie, one time but that was the server.

My go-to is always a Chicken Alfredo. The portion is a bit big for me but o take home the rest to eat later or for lunch at work lol. But when I am here for lunch, I have the endless soup and salad, last I was there it was $6.99 

Unfortunately our last visit was not as good as it usually it, even after telling them that we were on a work lunch and only had 30 mins, they were ever so slow to get us our bill."}
{"text":"I know, they're a chain restaurant, but the Chicken Alfredo is my favorite and not any other restaurant that I've been to can beat it! I like this location, it's nearby to a few stores that just so happen to be my favs, i.e. Marshalls, Borders, Best Buy... So after of hours of spending some time and cash at those places, it's pretty nice to be able to end a shopping day with Olive Garden. 

Like I said, my fav dish is the Chicken Alfredo. The way they cook the chicken is pretty inconsistent but I like their Alfredo sauce. I've tried their other Alfredo dishes, seafood, but it tends to taste too-- fishy? Does that make sense? LOL I have no idea if it's the poor quality of the seafood that they buy but it just does not go well w/ their sauce. So as much as I love trying new things, I always play it safe w/ my chicken Alfredo. 

Along w/ the Chicken Alfredo, I love that they have endless breadsticks and salad or soup, YUM.

I hearts this place."}
{"text":"Me And My Boyfriend Decided to Go Have an Italian Dinner Tonight and Let Me Tell You That Was the Best Decision That We Made In Quite Awhile. The Food Was Beyond Delicious And It All Came Out Very Fast And Everything Was Hot and Fresh But The Best Part Was Our Service That We Had. We Had Ruthanne As Our Server And She Went Above And Beyond to Make Sure Me and my Family Was Satisfied At all Times. If I Was Her Manager I Would Be Giving Her Lots Of Good Compliments and Possibly a Promotion or a Raise. We Will Definitely Be Back And Hopefully we Can Have Her As Our Server Again."}
{"text":"Our table of 7 requested two salads one with not cheese, peppers or onions and dressing on the side.  The other was no dressing, croutons or cheese. When I asked for a \"regular\" salad I was told no. 

Really this restaurant will live or die on one salad. 

I've got this bad taste in my mouth, like .......... rude waiter, yes but there are more tones............. yes bad service. I think a \"regular\" salad would have prevented that bad taste. 

Avoid this joint!!!!"}

{"text":"always excellent and receiving wine samples are always fantastic.  My favorite dish is the cheese ravioli but it seems a few months ago the filling in the ravioli has changed and I don't like it so I order tortlini.  Chicken is always phenomenal it's my favorite part when I order chicken parmesan or I'll pick the chicken from my husband's alfredo!  The Moscato d'Asti is my and hubs favorite wine and my husband loves the sangria FYI he hates wine!  With all of the new choices there's always something to try and who needs breadsticks when you have awesome salad and yummy appetizers!"}
{"text":"My first and my last time eating here the service was bad not to mention the server was hitting on me when I just wanted to have a nice lunch, I needed more soda but the server didn't ask if I needed a refill when my glass was empty, I had to go ind someone to get more and the food was good but could have been made better it taste like a TV dinner to be honest and the manager was super horrible I will not be coming here and I told everyone not to go here cause the service was horrible."}
{"text":"This place is always great on the prices and the food is not bad at all . Always great with, kids. Tonight I am having the salad with soup a tuscana, (spell check) . It's always good and (I assume healthy) . Either way food is always fulfilling and my wallet remains as full as my belly, :) ."}
{"text":"Went to Olive Garden this evening w my friend Fidella. We both ordered the unlimited soup & salad.  The food was delicious & the service was great. The server's name was Casey & he was fast, efficient and he made us laugh.  At the end of dinner,  he offered us wine to sample.  It was very good. All in all, had a great evening!"}
{"text":"Had a graduation dinner tonite. Our servers were Janelle and Kenzie. As graduations go, what was supposed to be a party of 6, turned into 18. And the wait for our graduate to arrive was about an hour. But our servers along with their help were more than patient, they kept our drinks full, brought out bread sticks and the table kiosks for entertainment. Our service this evening was by far some of the best customer service Ive encountered in a long time. As well as being genuinely kind and friendly throughout our dinner. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered a raspberry lemonade. I got 2 refills. I was seated near some high school girls who the waiter needed to fart with. That's the word I meant. He stunk. As far as food I ordered it was the never ending pasta bowl. The chef saw me walk in and sat out 5 bowls right away. My other reviews on yelp are indicative of an overweight person so needless to say 5 bowls was a good over/under. I got 2 bowls total. Whilst farting with those girls the waiter wasn't taking their order or anyone else's. So others had to wait which made my waiting even longer. I think his name is Clayton and he has a twin working there too because he had to tell the girls just everything about himself."}
{"text":"Olive Garden has always been worthy of an in-depth case study by marketing analysts. It's one of those places, much like McDonalds, that everyone on the Internet loves to hate. Everyone claims they never eat there. Yet, every time I drive by, there are crowds. Disturbingly large crowds, in fact.

Of course, we all know that Olive Garden isn't really Italian food - nor does it resemble the \"fancy\" restaurant feel that it's trying to pathetically emulate. In fact, the only reason why my girlfriend and I visited here on a Saturday night is because I was given a gift card from someone I work with.

Once we checked in, I was rather taken back by the amount of families choosing Olive Garden as their primary Saturday night destination. I mean, seriously?!

\"Do these people all have gift cards, too?\" I asked my girlfriend inquisitively. \"Do you mean, they actually came here with their families of ten and are paying for their meal? Like, with money and stuff?\" She assured me that, yes, people do actually come here on their own volition.

I still can't wrap my head around this.

Anyway, if you do some research, you'll find that most people will suggest that if you strictly stick to soup and salad, you'll be fine. It's the pasta's quality, or lack thereof, that really bother most. And I'd have to say that these opinions are pretty accurate.

My girlfriend and I split a chicken and gnocchi soup with their house salad. Combined with their breadsticks, which really aren't all that bad for something that's free, you can't really complain too much. And I guess that's why there's so many people who go just strictly for the soup and salad. But dammit, when you start exploring their pastas, that's when things start going downhill.

Their pasta preparation methods I haven't quite been able to nail just yet, but it's (supposedly) fresh. In fact, aside from the sauces and desserts (which are packaged frozen and nuked), everything else is legitimately prepared - or so they claim.

Nevertheless, their pastas are just so bland and so uninspiring that they remind me of something I'd get at one of those fast-food restaurants in the Midwest or mall food courts. It's corporate food at its finest, complimented by those germ-infested tablets that I've always loathed.

My girlfriend ordered the spaghetti, while I took the \"tour\" of Italy, which included a trio of chicken parmigiana, lasagna, and fettuccine alfredo. What's funny is that all of the dishes kind of taste the same. While alternating between all four, they all just all seem to kind of blend in together into this one giant, dull-tasting, pile of cheesy mush. Ugh! The cafeteria staff at my old school could have probably duplicated this.

The restaurant itself is fine. The server was polite and regularly checked up on us. And all of the food was brought out in a timely manner. So, I'll at least give them some credit for their customer service. Wine samples and an absurdly large pile of mints were dumped on our table with our bill. Hey, at least they're trying!

If you absolutely love Olive Garden, then by all means, it fits the bill just like any other Olive Garden would. But please, if you're in search of good Italian food, open your mind up to new options. You'd be amazed at what's out there if you're willing to look for it."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I don't understand how Olive Garden always has a long wait for dinner. Their food tastes like cardboard.

The only reason I went last weekend is because our very kind neighbor gave us a gift card for Christmas that we haven't used. We should have regifted. 

Let's start with the breadsticks. Salty and drab. Maybe I just got spoiled with other Italian eateries that give you a loaf of fresh bread and either herb butter or herbed olive oil. These are covered with garlic SALT. 

My husband had the salad which was decent, but c'mon. Their dressing is so commercialized now. I had the minestrone soup which was, again, decent. Tastes like it's from a can.

I had the baked ziti which was flavorless. My husband had a chicken garlic pasta dish which is edible but, again, not great. 

Service was very good. I feel sorry for the waiter for having to work at Olive Garden. He should take his good food service skills somewhere else.

I must share my experience at the OG from a couple years ago. I ordered the manicotti- which they don't have anymore. While eating I dug out a huge piece of plastic. The server got the manager who explained to me that it was a  plastic bag that the food comes in. She was extremely apathetic about the whole situation and I only got comped for my meal. 

People can save alot of money by skipping a trip to the Olive Garden and buying a Stouffers frozen Italian meal. If you do want to spend money on a good Italian meal check out the ma and pop local Italian places. Roma Garden and Aiello's are a good start. They are the same price for real homemade Italian food."}
{"text":"So we went back since it is the kids favorite place and my nephew chose it for his birthday on 7/8/14.  We had a fabulous waitress who was wonderful with the kids.  Unfortunately the menu changes so often if you like something too bad it won't be there next time.  They have also started the smaller lunch menu so it is a very small menu and have removed many of the simple Italian basics in favor of sandwich's and fusion dishes.  That's not why I go to Olive Garden.  We really had a hard time finding something we liked, usually it's making up our mind.  They really need to go back to the normal menu."}
{"text":"Horrible management. Parking lot empty, seating occupancy at about 20% and it's a 15 minute wait?"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Olive Garden and I used to go here more often then not in the past. However, starting about 2 years ago (after I took my girlfriend to Carrabba's), she all of a sudden stopped requesting Olive Garden and Carrabba's in its place. 

I always got the tour of Italy and a side order of white and red sauce for our bread sticks. I always like Olive Garden because I could feast like a king and not spend an arm and a leg. Sadly, their food, IMHO, just isn't as good as Carrabba's.

I enjoy Olive Garden's wine too. It is a safe bet. 

For now, we are broken up, but maybe someday, we will reunite and I will get a chance to have their free salad and bread sticks. :-)"}
{"text":"Good ol' fashion Olive Garden is one thing you can never go wrong with! My significant other and I had the best experience at this location! Our waiter was such a helpful and kind person. The foods was very fulfilling and tasteful. Not too busy for being on a Sunday night. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to go to because of the bread sticks and salad and they usually have good service but today I decided to come by myself sat in the bar area were it wasn't busy and the food was very Delish but the service was not so good I needed to flag my server down numerous times because I wanted more cheese on my salad and wouldn't have had to do so if he allowed me to say stop and then when I couldn't get his attention I called on someone else then that took a while and then when someone finally came I noticed it wasn't even my server.i get it it may be late he may have been tired but I would appreciate an alert server..... (not sure if I'm going to come back) .... I did tip him also maybe it might make him more energized for the next customers."}
{"text":"This is the best Olive Garden I've ever been to. Above and beyond expectations. Food and service was so fast and great i am in shock. We went on Valentine's Day it was pretty busy yet everything was so fast. I am in shock!!!"}
{"text":"I moved into the area 4 years ago, and we have been to this Olive Garden many times since then with my family. And I can easily say there is a considerable decline with the food quality, portion sizes and service. Unfortunately, with all these things going down, the prices were going up. My last visit to this restaurant was last week for a family dinner. None of us were satisfied with what we ordered. My wife got a mixed grill, and it was totally dry, and there was no flavor to the veggies or meat. I ordered an egg plant Parmesan, it was soaked, and had no flavor either. We also got calamari and it feels like now the portion of the calamari got smaller and smaller every time I came to this place. Compared to this poor food quality, very small portion sizes, the prices were high. Desert was the same way, we ordered a cake, slice was as thin as one of my fingers, but it was $7.5. I get a whole cheesecake from Trader Joe's for that price. It was so disappointing that I don't think I will ever go to this place again. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is just one of those restaurants that everyone loves, but hates.

This review is more about the hostess than the actual food, as we didn't even get the chance to eat. 

Let it be known that OG is awful on any weekend. There always seems to be a wait even if there are tables that you can see aren't being put to use. But it is also an absolute nightmare on ANY holiday night. 

We opted to use the check in online option thinking that if we checked in, shopped around, by the time our wait time was up, we would be fine. When checking in, it said there was a 30-40 minute wait. That was fine because we were out shopping. When we strolled in, it was absolutely packed in there. We walked up to the hostess to let her know we had checked in online a bit ago. 

Her snotty response was \"Yeeeeeah, it's still going to be another hour.\" So I said, \"Wow, really?\" And this little \"B,\" responded snidely again like \"Well you can see that we're swamped.\" So my friend chimed in, \"Yeah it told us online that the wait was 40 minuets so...\" and we walked out. 

I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow this place is bad. I've been to OG restaurants in over 20 cities across 11 states but this has to be the worst.

I can't say it's one thing that's bad, it's just a combination of bad experiences that start when you walk in the door to when you leave.

We came in here for a family dinner to privately celebrate my daughters 10th birthday dinner. We were given a buzzer when we walked in with no indication on how long the wait would be. After asking twice, someone deigned to answer that they were working on it. On to the table. The waiter wasn't the worst, just mediocre. Food was decidedly poor. I ordered the steak Gorgonzola which the menu stated is served medium. It came well well done. The waiter apologized and tells me he'll get the GM to fix it and make sure to bring it out himself. Comes back 5 min later himself with little medallions of beef in a teacup saucer....I look at them and they're hockey pucks. Waiter asks 'are they ok' I say no but I guess I have no choice but to eat it. He says \"great, ok\" and walks away!!! Everyone's meal was sub par. Ordered a birthday dessert for my daughter and was told they had no candles. Great. Was charged for everything (which is fine but a gesture would've been nice!) no GM apology for bad and incorrectly prepared food, nothing. 

I really think OG needs to clean house by rehiring a brand new staff starting with management. I'm in management myself and there's no excuse for this kind of performance, especially in the hospitality industry."}
{"text":"The food is like any other Olive Garden you have been at. The beauty of corporate food. The service has been good each time that I have been there (3 times)."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. We hade our business meeting here and the servers took care of us very well. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely phenomenal. Olive Garden is probably one of my favorite places for dinner, but sometimes it can be hit or miss with either the food or service. Tonight, everything was amazing. Our server, Sky, kept our drinks filled and promptly brought out our salads and entrees. We stuck to the usual chicken Alfredo and it was saucy, just like we like it. Will continue to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Just went in yesterday and had a great experience. Went with my friend and were seated as soon as we walked in. Jeremiah was our waiter and he was very helpful and attentive. I ordered the chicken fettucini Alfredo and it showed up in a timely manner. My chicken had a lot of fat on it so I didn't enjoy it completely but after some picking at it it was good. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was a little lacking in flavor but after some salt and pepper was good. The breadsticks as usually were good.  I forgot to ask him to split the check until he came with it but he quickly took it back and split it without warrant and had my to go soup ready when I left. All in all good experience and friendly nice attentive staff."}
{"text":"We're ok with Olive Garden. It's predictable. If you like their soup, salad dressing, wines, specialty drinks, appetizers, desserts and entree's on the menu and you have a hankering for one of them, you will get that meal pretty much the same every time. That can be a good thing. It's like going to mom's for that meal she makes that you like so much. That's why the chain restaurants stay in business. Because you can be sure wherever you go the food will be as expected. We like the soup, salad breadsticks for a light lunch or dinner. I almost always get the ravioli, the chicken alfredo or the salmon dish. My husband likes the scampi and the sausage and pasta. My two sons like the tour of Italy. We all like the Italian margaritas and the black tie mouse cake. We have friends who go for the lemon cake and the latte. The service is usually pretty good (unless the NAU families are up) and the place is pretty clean."}
{"text":"We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spaghetti and got to little pieces of sausages lol most of it was noodles I love Olive Garden but not this location I wouldn't even consider giving them one star but unfortunately I had to don't not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Where do you go when you want to celebrate a birthday and all you have are chain restaurants around you?  A place where you have awesome garlic bread sticks and endless salad!  We came here to celebrate a birthday on a Saturday night and it took 45 minutes to get seated.  This place is packed!  The service was great - Jessica was our server and she was awesome.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo many things wrong with this location and the staff.

First of all, we came on a Sunday around noon.  Our server, Jordan, came over and got our drink orders.  He seemed nice.  Because I didn't want a heavy pasta dish at that time of day, I wanted to know how I could get an appetizer with maybe some salad on the side.

Now, back in the day, I remember going to OG and getting endless salad for a whole table, it just came with whatever else you ordered, like the breadsticks.

So I thought I could just get an app and share my boyfriend's salad/soup deal he was getting (the whole bowl comes to the table, all Jordan would've had to do was to bring me an extra salad plate).

But instead, he COULD NOT understand what I wanted to order.  I said \"Can I get this appetizer and then have some of his salad?\"  He looked annoyed, frustrated, and confused.  It might have to do with him being foreign but I really don't think so.  I think all he cared about was how high he could get the check.  

See, the problem with ordering just a little bit at a restaurant is that a lot of servers will get pissed if they know that's what you're going to do.  Forget about the fact that I'll probably give you an EVEN BIGGER TIP if you just help me get what I want.

First he entered in my app order on the screen, then started taking the rest of the table's order with his pad.  When I tried to clarify that I was going to be having some of my boyfriend's salad he just looked at me with blank eyes and was like, \"Well you can order the endless soup/salad.\"  COME ON, I just told you I wanted the appetizer and just some of the salad on the side!  Why would I have to order an additional $7+ to get my \"own\" salad that just comes out in a big bowl for the whole table anyway?!  That's a rip off!  

So I said, ok, cancel the app order and AGAIN with the perplexed, deer in headlights stare at me (really?!), and he tried to mumble something about he already put it in so.......... 

Ok.

But I still don't want it now because you aren't explaining/understanding/accommodating at all!  I told him instead of the app combo (which is more $$) I would just take a single app.  He walked away and we still weren't sure what we actually ordered and what we were going to get, and I see him over in the corner talking to a male manager.

So, we wait.  I get my app.  Then we get our giant salad bowl and soups.  Apparently I had ordered a SEPARATE $7+ soup/salad.... this is ridiculous.  And if this is the policy, it's a stupid policy and it should be changed.  Just bring the people who want a little bit of the salad but don't want a whole extra order (which doesn't mean extra salad comes, the same exact amount comes!) a side plate.  Your salad isn't that extravagant anyway what with the whole 3 olives you put in there, swimming in the excess croutons that help fill people up quicker.

So we eat our salad, our soup, I eat some of my app (it isn't that good, I haven't been here in awhile!) and we don't even order a second salad bowl.  My boyfriend orders another soup after finishing his - and this is where it really starts to get bad - and his second bowl of soup comes out.  Jordan has come to check on us about zero times by now.  I just see him frantically running around from place to place.  I think he can tell I'm not entirely happy with his service.

So then my boyfriend finds a BIG FAT HAIR in his soup.  Yep.  It's not even the color of either of our hair.  So, eventually, Jordan rushes by and I tell him that he found a hair in his soup and show it to him to see that it isn't either one of ours.  He stares at it with the same dopey expression he's had on the whole time and just mumbles something about a manager.  Then dashes away.  No, \"I'm sorry,\" or, \"I will get a manager right away,\" nothing you know, NORMAL that a server should say in that situation.

So more time goes by, he brings my boyfriend another soup but that's it.  Then five minutes later he brings us the check.  Are you for real?  It's the full check.  No manager.  

So I sit there with it and just wait.  I see Jordan peek around the corner (no joke! lol) to see if I've set the check up to be picked up and he quickly dashes away again.  MORE WAITING, and then he comes to the table and I say, \"Where's the manager?\"  Here's the kicker.

HE ACTS LIKE HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!!!  LOL!!  I said, \"You said you were going to get the manager,\" and he looks disappointed and says, \"Oh, ok.\" and runs off.

So some lady (who I'm assuming might be a supervisor?) comes to the table and very professionally tells us that Jordan sent her and she looks at the hair and says, \"I'll take care of this,\" and walks away.  We get the check back from her and she took off the soup and one other item to be nice.  To be fair, no she wasn't the manager, she was probably just saving Jordan's neck, but she was nice.  We pay quickly on the kiosk and leave before we have to see Jordan again."}

{"text":"I visited Olive Garden at Robinson Towne Center last night and wanted to share with you my impressions

I arrived at 5pm on a Wednesday evening (hardly peak traffic time) and I waited exactly 12 minutes to be seated. Once I was seated, I discovered that the place was nearly empty - and therefore wondered what the 12 minute wait was all about. 

 Once I was at my table, the waitress asked if I wanted to place a drink or appetizer order. I ordered an Italian Margarita and Hot Artichoke-Spinach Dip. Both of these items were on the menu...and the drink was horrible. I am not sure of the exact taste, but picture sewer water, with a little white lightening thrown it. The artichoke spinach dip was okay...but nothing too exciting. 

At this point I ordered my main dish...\"Chicken Parmigiana\" which was one of  the most expensive item on the menu at $15. To be honest with you, I can make something that tastes twice as good (at half the cost) in my own kitchen. It tasted like a microwave TV dinner. To make matters worse, the serving size was very small, more like an appetizer. 

At this point, I was pretty frustrated...but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. For desert I ordered Tiramisu. It was good, and the portion size was respectable. If anything, Olive Garden does offer a respectable dessert. 

I spent a grad total of $37 +tip. In the end, I could have made the exact same stuff in my kitchen for $12, and it would have tasted better. Olive Garden is the poster-child of chain restaurants. I am convinced that they simply microwave their food. This is not Italian food....this is American food with a casual-dining twist...and a hint of fake Italian food thrown in to complete the effect. 

Avoid this place like the plague - it is a disgrace to Italians everywhere!

The only reason I am giving this review 2-Stars in because of the waitress. Despite the horrible drinks and the microwave food...she really did try her best."}
{"text":"We always order from Olive Garden Togo but not anymore. This is the 3rd time I'm a row my order has been wrong. My husband ordered the grilled chicken Parmesan and there was no cheese at all on his chicken Parmesan. I ordered the kids fettuccine alfredo and got shells with marinara sauce instead. I am so disappointed in Olive Garden. They have lost my business. I will find another Italian restaurant who can get my order correct. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for quite a few years since they opened. Live less than 3 miles from this place and maybe been here only once now in last year.  The reason for lack of visits is because sometimes their food is on point and other times it's terrible. The drive up pick up is usually very good service, however couple times now I have sat out there for 20 minutes before someone came out. Great location and potential, but maybe need better training for faster service and need to be on point and consistent with the food."}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Ponytail aka Cody and our favorite too Susie. Thanks for a fun night at the bar and a delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"I went with a party of 8 and the service was extremely good, the food was great! The place was extremely clean. Will return in the future!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here earlier this week and had an awful experience with the server. We asked another server for refills, she promptly brought them and sent the manager to our table. We explained what happened and we were understanding because the server was relatively new. The manager comped our entire meal. This is not what we were expecting nor wanting...we simply wanted refills. I really appreciate that the manager went above and beyond for the customer."}
{"text":"Chain food is chain food, the quality is going to stay consistent.
This particular Olive Garden is always packed, I personally would suggest making a reservation during the weekends. 

On an experience I had here, my waiter spilled water all over me, by accident. 
He was clearly flustered, which is probably why I got no apology, from the waiter, nor do I think the manager even knew. 

For me the tables are too close together and I feel cluttered when I'm at this Olive Garden, but overall this is not a terrible place-- its alright."}
{"text":"I hadn't gone to Olive Garden in a while and had not been to this location but went with some friends recently. OG is one of those chains that you have to know what to order. I have never gone wrong with the Lasagna and that is what I got this time. It was very good, a nice sized portion- some of which I had the next day for lunch. The salad is decent- your basic garden salad and the bread sticks are good. We had a very good server who was quite attentive. Overall it is good for an inexpensive chain restaurant Italian food."}
{"text":"That was the worse food I ever had Eeewwww Booooooooo! !!"}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time driving back and forth from central Pa to Pittsburgh to see doctors, so we stop in Monroeville a lot to eat on our way home. This is one of our favorite places. We like it even better then our one back home. I feel it is busy at time and at time the service isn't wonderful, but come on, not every place is. Compared to the one back home, the food sizes are larger, the staff keeps their area cleaner. I usually get the Tour of Italy. A little of everything, take most of it home, because I get salad and breadsticks with it. I think the food is great and everything comes out fast. The server is always is nice and comes back to check on us."}
{"text":"4 stars because our server Nancy was very attentive in spite of valentines day crowd.. she definitely took care of us. We ordered a bottle of Moscato which is not bad for $31 and did the the 2 for 25... of course we did the specialty entrée with an additional price, we ordered the shrimp scampi, which I must say is very good for olive garden material, and new york strip steak.. The steak was tender and almost cook to perfection, there were some very dry parts, but that's okay... Over all the food was very decent..."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is the McDonalds of sit down restaurants. And this location isn't a great one. I only go when my mom or grandparents want to go somewhere to eat, but I'm gradually getting them away from here. We only go because it's somewhere they're used to and they aren't ones to branch out. But there are WAY better choices close by at similar prices! This location is so slow! We waited twenty minutes just for them to process our party's check. Food isn't that great, tastes microwaved half the time. None of the workers really know how to smile."}
{"text":"Eh, the server seemed too busy to actually take care of our needs. The food was kind of dry. I ordered the Steak Gorgonzola and the pasta was dry. We also ordered the Pappardelle Pesctore. Didn't look anything like the picture and was very \"fishy\" smelling. The Norther Tour of Italy was OK too. The salad was also lacking in dressing, like it was coming out of the servers pockets! The calamari was also bland tasting. We asked for more lemon for the calamari but didn't get it toward the end. The \"new\" Italian style buffalo wings was dry. Why a three, because we are loyal Olive Garden people! We come here once every other month and normally we
get EXCELLENT FOOD AND SERVICE. Maybe it was an off day?"}
{"text":"It's always a safe bet at Olive Gardens. Usually good food with great service. So far they haven't disappointed."}
{"text":"The service I received today was the worst. I cannot believe it. Just because I was with a toddler doesn't mean you need to treat me differently. My waiter was awful. He didn't bother much to check on us nor refill our waters when it was evident they were empty. I also waited almost ten minutes for a to go box and my waiter didn't even being it!!! The front host did. Awful service. I understand it was a Sunday afternoon but geez everyone should be trained on what to do when it's busy!!!"}
{"text":"Good friendly service, but as far as the food goes, anyone who thinks this is Italian food has obviously never had real Italian food or needs to have their head examined. One star only because the service people are nice."}
{"text":"They lack customer service. My server was rude and inattentive. I had to repeat my order serveral times and there were missing entrees. Of course the food is good but your employee(s) needs work. I will not be going back to this location. Ever."}
{"text":"Shame on me for going to a chain Italian joint, but we were in the area and soup salad and breadsticks sounded good.  I have not been to an Olive Garden for maybe 7 or so years, and WOW have they gone downhill.  

Food is ok, not good.   Service was poor at best.  Waited for drinks, waited for food, waited for check much much longer than we should have.  

Learned my lesson and will not be going back (to this location anyway.)"}
{"text":"We frequent this establishment and service always seems to be pretty good. I don't know why yelpers seem to dislike this place? It's your typical Olive Garden, nothing more nothing less. Everything comes out the way it should just like an assembly line. I don't know if the server Joey still works there or not, but he makes the best salads. Hands down. 

I also really like the ziosk they have at the tables so that I don't have to wait around for the bill. I wish more restaurants would have that. Just be careful of the games and such that charge you."}
{"text":"It's our family tradition to eat at the Olive Garden after my children's middle school orchestra concerts, so that's what brought us tonight!  I normally don't review a chain restaurant because everyone knows what they are like and it really is the same wherever you go in the US.  But, I was more impressed than usual last night for several reasons.  

First, the drink menu.  I was surprised to see so many original, signature cocktails and non-alcoholic choices.  I tried the Green Apple Moscato Sangria and my daughter had the Green Apple Soda.  Both were fantastic and not overly sweet, except for the soda, which was topped with cotton candy (see photo.)

Next, the seasonal menu had a few creative pasta combinations and quite a bit if new seafood options.  Most of us stuck to the old classics, but none of us were disappointed.  I did try the new Giant Meatball four cheese manicotti.  The portion was enough for three people, so I'll be having it for lunch tomorrow.  It was perfectly seasoned and tasty!  

And finally, parking is always easy and convenient, and getting a table for a large group does not cause a horrible long wait.  

We'll be back for our next family celebration."}
{"text":"We were in town for a vacation and decided to go to this OG to celebrate a birthday.  First, let me say that the waiter was not very friendly.  He made mention that our table was the last one and he could leave after us.  Hi, Rude!  He got drinks mixed up for our group and poured different drinks into people's glasses.  Honestly, I would recommend a drug test because the behavior had chronic written all over him.  When passing the drinks out, he actually told someone \"can you pass this down because I am not going to try going behind the seats\".  HELLO, it is your job!  And if the seats are too close to the wall, then move the table out so the wait staff can get behind people.

When the waitress asked if we wanted marinara dipping sauce for our bread sticks, she should have mentioned that it was for a fee.  We were surprised to find that each one was around $8!  Again, these places tend to nickel and dime you for everything.  Had we known this, we certainly would not have ordered it.

The last straw was when they came out to sing happy birthday, they brought out a small dish with whipped cream, drizzled with chocolate and a candle in it.  REALLY?  We spend a good amount of money and they couldn't spring for a REAL dessert?  It was laughable and became the butt of a running joke amongst us for the rest of our trip.  I mean really, who does that, whipped cream with a candle in it?

We have been to other OG restaurants and have received much better service.  I would skip this one in particular and find another OG where they still believe in good customer service."}
{"text":"Consistently decent food at a fair value.  This OG is near to Red Rock Casino so it is a great stop for dinner or lunch.  Of course the salad and breadsticks are awesome.  Ten times better than Nellis street in Vegas"}
{"text":"Olive Garden, never awful but never good. The mediocrity of cheap Italian dining.

The staff were nice. The food average. The meal uneventful."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and have always had a great dining experience. Very neat and clean. Great customer service."}
{"text":"We got a to go order for alfredo and spaghetti. The amount of sauce they put in the food was a joke. It literally tasted like noodles with a hint of sauce. We couldn't even save our leftovers because there wasn't enough sauce to save the noodles from becoming dried out and crunchy in the microwave. When a place is charging $15 a plate for a basic pasta dish then they need to step it up a notch. Id love to think this was a one off situation but it's not. Oh, and if you try to ask for more sauce (ie, the normal portion) they'll try to charge you."}
{"text":"We were seated right away and the server came up to take our order quickly. It was clean, quiet, the staff seemed to be enjoying their day. Our food came hot, fresh, and fast. Server was friendly and took really good care of us. Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"We went on Friday, March 29, 2018.  Our waitress was new and a little overwhelmed with all the business on Good Friday.  She got what we needed, even though it may have taken a little longer.  We were able to meet and spend time with Jeremiah Roller's sisters, Jami Roemer, Ashley, and his mom and niece Meadow. It was really good to see and spend time with family on Good Friday."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a co-worker last week and we both enjoyed the unlimited soup and salad for only $7.50. You can't beat that deal. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. He happily split up our checks for us and boxed my food to go. 

The sausage soup is by far the best (Zuppa Toscana). It has kale, potato and sausage yum! And I absolutely love love love their homemade salad and their garlic breadsticks. The salad dressing is so good and you can buy it at the store now too! I've always loved coming to the Olive Garden and they are always consistent. Great service and great food. You can't go wrong coming here for lunch or dinner. :)"}
{"text":"Very sad, my wife took our 5 children here to eat and she could hear the employees all talking trash about us having too many children (which were also very well behaved). It is none of your business how many children God blessed us with. I hope all employees see this review and are ashamed of yourselves. My children are very well taken care of, and have everything they need. We aren't in poverty, in fact we are very well blessed. We will not be returning to such a disrespectful business."}
{"text":"Great food almost every time and if not the best management has always been there to make sure it is better. Waitresses and waiters always polite and making sure your drinks and full at all times."}
{"text":"Have been to Olive Garden many times all around the valley. Had the most incredible server, I believe his name was Andrew. Although, I am rating this a 3 due to the fact of how dirty this Olive Garden was. The bathrooms were horrible, our seating area in the both was stained all on the seats, dirt/dust all around the table and behind our seats."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Olive Garden's I've been to.  The waitress was very friendly and quick, she took our order right away and all of our food, including the salad and breadsticks, came out quickly.  The food itself seemed better than the other Olive Garden's too, whether it was cooked better or just had a better flavor I don't know but it just altogether tasted better."}
{"text":"Good place, great service, good food all at a reasonable price. That pretty much describes my experience of this olive garden.

I got the 'make your own pasta'. This comes with a choice of paste/sauce/topping, with breadsticks and soup/salad. The breadsticks and soup combination is so good that it left me in food coma. The pasta was al dente with the right seasoning.

The only downside was that the wait times were very long and we could only manage to get the high top tables. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm currently eating a Olive Garden and I can honestly say Trevor, our waiter, is wonderful! He has been making sure that our drinks are full and that everything is tasting great! Definitely coming back because of him! Keep up the great work Trevor!!!!"}
{"text":"Surroundings were dirty, took forever for our waiter to arrive and get our drinks.  We would have been understanding if it were busy, but it was mostly empty. 
Walked out and went next door to Island's burgers. Way better!"}
{"text":"This Olive Garden was very clean, the staff was very professional and quick and the food was delicious! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. He never let our drinks go down half way and he was very punctual and respectful."}
{"text":"The service is so great, and the price is also pretty good. My stomach is still filled with classic meat sauce."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. The service is always good and the food is always delicious. The only thing knocking them down one star is how the breadstick refills are either forgotten or never come until late in the meal and how they sometimes take a while to bring the check. Besides that, the service is good. Place is friendly. Food is good."}
{"text":"Food is great always having specials & always giving a nice smile to all guest but it seems that the servers make it seem they don't have time to be at your table the whole time. They also give you that look as if they are telling you to hurry up so that they can continue with there day."}
{"text":"This olive garden is right up the street from my house, me and my boyfriend frequent this place as a takeout. We have never eaten inside, but our orders for takeout i would say oh in the past six months that we have lived here have NEVER been messed up, and we order here every  oh i'd say one time every 1.5 week ish. It is what it is in terms of food but it does the job and hey they haven't messed up yet so we are fans."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and chose the unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks.
Our waiter was excellent and the food, service and price were outstanding!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 32 people on a Sunday for 6:30pm. It was a surprise baby shower for a dear friend. Although they did not guarantee a room for us or to have our tables ready at the time reserved, they actually made great effort to accommodate us. The servers were great and very attentive. They had great $10 classic deals and for 32 people, that was a GREAT PRICE! I gotta say we all had a great dinner this last Sunday. Thank you for that!!"}
{"text":"Got home after picking up my order and realized they forgot my breadsticks. I even ordered extra. I called to get a refund on the extra ones and was told I would need to speak to a manager, 10 minutes holding and no one. I hung up. Poor customer service. Food was good though."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for their all you can eat pasta special. I have mixed feelings about it since there were some good points and some bad ones. 

I'll start with the bad points. On my 2nd helping of pasta (I was really hungry), I ordered their new Roasted Portobello Pomodoro on orecchiette. Even though I loved the fact that they didn't slice and dice up the portebello mushroom, the sauce tasted like it was burnt. I took a few bites of it and after I tried to doctor it up with some parmesan cheese and salt, I could still taste the burnt sauce. I ended up not eating the rest of it. 

The other bad point about the whole meal was the plates/bowls were so hot, you couldn't touch them and the meal came out like lava hot. My husband and I had to sit there and wait for the food to cool off a little to be bearable.

Now to the good stuff. Even though the hostess was a bit flighty, we did not have to wait long to be seated. We also were not set at a table where my infant daughter would be in the most crowded and busiest section in the restaurant. I ordered the Creamy Parmesan Florentine one penne and it had the right amount of spinach in it and the sauce had the right amount of alfredo and parmesan in it that none of the ingredients overpowered each other. My husband ordered the five cheese marinara on fettuccine and he was quite pleased with it. 

The breadsticks and salad were very good this time around. Normally we usually get jipped on the salad dressing and croutons but this time it was fully loaded. 

With our meals, we ordered a glass of wine. Normally I tend to stay away from the sparkling wines, but this one was great! The wine was Moscato and it tasted like a sweater Asti (but not too sweat). Each different types of sauce, this wine went quite well with. I highly recommend it!

Olive Garden has a new dessert out called the Pumpkin cheesecake. This was absolutely heavenly! I usually don't order any kind of dessert with whipped cream on it but I decided to brave it. I was not disappointed. It was so rich and creamy and the decoration of caramel drizzle complimented the spice in the pumpkin flavor nicely. The crust was a graham cracker crust, lightly sweetened and they sprinkled more graham cracker bits on the caramel. This was such a great ending to our meal!

I give this restaurant 3 stars because I wasn't completely impressed with our waitress. She kept asking us more than once what we ordered instead of writing it down if she knew she wasn't going to be able to remember it. Also, because of the temperature of the plates and the fact that my meal tasted burnt the 2nd time around. I don't know what it is about NC Olive Gardens, I was never disappointed with the ones in Florida."}
{"text":"Update: Alright, I think this is the first time I've ever moved a review from a 1-star to a 5-star. I got home from this experience, and felt the need to speak with a manager, so I called over to the restaurant. Jim Lloyd, the general manager of the restaurant, answered the phone. I described the experience below, and his response could not have been more appropriate. 

He didn't make excuses. He didn't offer empty apologies or generic reasons. He explained that he had NO reason, but that he would certainly talk to his team to get to the bottom of it. He took responsibility as the manager, and explained how atypical this was based on his 17 years with the company. It's hard to explain exactly what set his response apart other than the fact I could discern that this was genuine concern and not a canned speech that some managers give because they deal with the same complaint 3 times a day. He asked that I come back in again to give them another chance, and that I call/email him personally to set a reservation so that he could meet me. 

These kind of gestures go a long way with me. As I told him, customer service shortfalls happen. How management responds to those situations is what sets a great company apart from a bad one. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

We just left this location after being seated, then waiting for 25 minutes (NO exaggeration) with no one coming by to do so much as take a drink order. We had the stupid order tablet light on and everything. We flagged down one guy and he said he wasn't our server but that he'd get someone to us soon. The rest of the waiters zoomed by our table and never looked over. 

Let me know when you have a new general manager, and maybe we'll be back. (Obviously I was WAY off with this last part of the review!)"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food, but it is definitely a chain restaurant experience.  I always order the endless soup & salad with bread sticks.  Plenty of parking.  The place is usually busy, but I never have a problem getting seated quickly.  The service was a little slow today.  The waitress was not lazy, they were just slightly understaffed.  The salad is fresh.  Not spectacular, but okay.  I like the grated cheese on top.  They have a variety of soups to choose from: Chicken & Gnocchi, Minestrone, Zuppa Tuscana, etc.  I like the Chicken & Gnocchi the best.  It has chicken and dumplings in a creamy sauce.  My second favorite is the Zuppa Tuscana, which has potatoes, sausage, and kale in a creamy sauce.  The bread sticks are warm, buttered, and soft in the middle.  The best part of this meal is dipping the bread sticks in the Chicken & Gnocchi.  For my waistline, I wish they would put a limit on how many bread sticks they let each person eat.  ha ha ha.  Not my favorite place to go eat, but I find myself here often and always enjoy it.  Seems like a safe bet if you are unsure of your eating companion's preferences."}
{"text":"I recently ordered to go for our office lunch. I really felt I needed to post a positive review as this location filled our catering needs without any problems. Food was hot and ready to go. Great job staff"}
{"text":"Really good food fresh and full of flavor service waitress was awesome my cup of tea never ran empty definitely will be back"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Olive Garden locations in Charlotte's surrounding areas. They were packed, but we waited only a short time. Our waitress was friendly and the food came out quickly. I am always a skeptical about Oliva Garden, they are hit or miss. But at this location the food was good! It was a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Usually, I stay away from popular chain restaurants, however we decided to give Olive Garden a shot, and while the food was passable, the service put the icing on the cake!

Atmosphere, you know the drill. \"Fancy\" interior for a chain restaurant, quaint music in the background, and decent lighting.

My girlfriend got a pork/ravioli dish, it was tasty, and I decided to be a cheapass and ordered the never ending pasta bowl with meat. Everything was pretty good, it did not taste bland or cheap like you imagine a special would taste. We also shared the sampler appetizer which had the chicken fingers/calamari, all equally delicious, especially their herb tarter sauce. The seasonal pumpkin cheesecake was FANTASTIC. Seriously, pumpkin and cheesecake, my two favorite things, done deal.

Alright, the best part, the service. Our waiter's name was Tony, and he was absolutely the highlight of our dining experience. I'm a manager at a popular cafe on the strip, and I know great service when I see it. We never had empty glasses, and he was on top of the table ensuring everything we needed was there and more. Tony went above and beyond and his service was honestly the best I've ever had. 

Go see Tony, have a great time!"}
{"text":"Good tasting food and atmosphere, I hadn't  been to Olive Garden in a long time. The waitstaff shouldn't be sharing their  Political opinions with patrons..it really is IMPROPER, people come to  a restaurant to relax not listen to other people's Political Agenda. It will be a long time before I recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Meh... Food is adequate and service is acceptable one you get in. The last time we went was a Tuesday night around 6. The wait was 30 minutes and we were the third person in line. After 45 minutes, we were still the third person in line. I can't necessarily complain about the place, but there isn't anything exciting, memorable, or something that makes it stand out and makes me choose here over a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Go To Place for my family.  Almost every Saturday night we go there and enjoy our dinner.  They have amazing wine collection.  Almost every one knows us so when we get there, we get sited right away (in a way, we cut the line)... Services is really good and place is nice and clean.  Always bring extra kid color set for my daughter and w/out telling or asking or requesting, we get extra fresh backed bread TO GO with our every visit.  

Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Ate the seafood alfredo and was VERY disappointed. The sauce was very watery and bland. I basically loaded up on soup and breadsticks. Definitely a pass."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner at this location, then walked out. The people were nice but it smells old, musty and like cockroaches. I wouldn't have been able to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I have had a wonderful experience EVERY SINGLE TIME I've been here. I love the atmosphere, the service and the food! Prices are great too  Antonio and Jessica are fabulous! There's were others too... basically, i don't feel like one could go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden!!! I just wished their fried Zucchini can be improved... But overall always love the service, raspberry Lemonade, and do much more!!!"}
{"text":"Best service I have ever gotten at this Olive Garden. Definitely coming back if service stays at this level."}
{"text":"Every couple of years I have an Olive Garden craving. After a long day at work I knew OG would be a good choice. It's a huge draw that they serve salad and bread before the meal so I know I can go in hangry and get food fast. The dining experience is also somewhere in between fast food and sit down dining so the entire meal can be wrapped up quickly.

Even with a packed parking lot we were seated right away. Our waitress came by quickly and took our orders. The bread and salad came out quickly and our meals came out not long after that. The speed at which food arrives would make this a great option for those with little ones. Our waitress checked in often and was friendly.

The food is the main reason for the three star. It's not bad, but it isn't fresh cooked food either. The food to me is similar to heating frozen food from the grocery store. There are several options in the area that would be significantly higher quality and taste for only a little more money. 

Overall, Olive Garden is constantly busy because they fill a certain niche. The service is consistently good, no reservations are required, the food arrives quickly, and the food is decent."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch before a 6 hour drive back to San Diego. We were seated promptly in a booth; the place was nearly empty at 1:45 pm on a Thursday. 

Within a short moment, our waitress, a lovely Middle Aged woman, asked for our drink orders and offered us wine samples. Although we thought we already knew what we wanted to eat, our server suggested the new promotional lunch combo, for $7.99

My partner had the fettuccine Alfredo and i had the spaghetti with sausage/meat sauce. We each had salad. Everything was fresh, and overall the whole experience made us feel like we just got a great deal, even after eating for 2 days in downtown vegas.

Keep it up Olive Garden! You always know what to expect, and they always seem to deliver! This location does not dissappoint!"}
{"text":"Olive garden is a staple restaurant I've come to for years around the US. Unfortunately, they're in financial trouble, but they keep having deals to bring people back into the restaurant. The salad is always amazing, and it's my favorite part of the menu since they removed my favorite degree entree the chicken vino bianco.

The waitress was friendly and bubbly. She would keep stopping heating the cheese before we asked, that's not a big issue, it just requires more cheese."}
{"text":"This is not the kind of food that I usually like to eat (Olive Garden is mostly pre-packaged type stuff, very salty and prob loaded with chemical preservatives) but, it is what it is and having limited choices in Monroe, I occasionally eat here or take out when I'm feeling too lazy to fix something at home. I've never had a problem with the service, and I've ordered take out during the busiest part of the evening. And you get A LOT of food, usually enough for me to save half so I can continue my lazy streak and not cook again the next night! lol!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've used their curbside service and it won't be the last time I'm using it.  The process was seamless from start to finish.  I ordered online and provided the time for pick up which was 30 minutes from the time I submitted the order and paid with my credit card.  There were several available parking spots for to go order and the number to call when you arrive is already posted as soon as you pull up.  The service was prompt and my order was delivered to my car by a very friendly associate!"}
{"text":"This restaurant seem to never fail us.  Today dining experience was beyond amazing.  Humberto went above and beyond providing us with nothing but excellent service.  The staff in general was attentive to their guest.  
The atmosphere was full of positive vibe coming from all directions.  We started at the bar, the bartender provided us with the menu and had explained the services and option we were have.  We ordered our drinks and seated at a booth which was available at the bar area.  It made it very convenient for us to order our drinks and be able to move over to a booth.  As soon as we sat down, Humberto came and helped us with the digital ordering device that was available.  The digital ordering tool was helpful, in case if we wanted to add or change our appetizer selection.  You can also pay from the device.  
I am happy that we came here & I do recommend this location.  Jennie, have an awesome team, by observation, a great leader makes a great team.  Jennie, thank you and continue to be the best manager you are.  Thank you Humberto and the Olive Garden team for the great services that was given to us today."}
{"text":"Not bad , everyone liked what they had I had salad as I'm trying to stay on track with what I eat as I have Diabetes and running low on my meds ."}
{"text":"I am enjoying a super relaxing afternoon... Here at Olive Garden... I am mind blown about there seasonal Toasted Marshmallow Martini ... It is simply amazing !!!  It is a must try... Also i am eating their unlimited Soup and Salad... My favorite items on the menu when i want something quick and easy."}
{"text":"Wonderful night had the ladies n day and she was very pleased. Bread was on point! Are favorite part! Ha but the unlimited pasta was better! :) a+ ill be back next year for her b day again. So creative I am :)"}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly.  The food was okay. I liked my grilled chicken flatbread, but the meatballs with the kids meals could've used more flavor and seasoning. My husband's dinner was very \"earthy\" tasting even though it was supposed to be covered in Alfredo sauce. No complaints about anything but the bland flavor of 3/4 of the meals served to our table."}
{"text":"This location is generally pretty easy to get a seat quickly .  The service is decent, food quality is typical Olive Garden.  One thing that surprised me was the amount of un-bussed tables.  Something sort of gross about that.  Other than that everything was fine for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful. It is a great place for friends & family with a great environment. Their staff is great. They have been very friendly every time I have visited so far. 

First off, their drink selection is amazing. There are many to choose from. The Bellini peach-raspberry ice tea is my favorite from the list of non-alcoholic drinks they serve. They also serve beer, special cocktails and a selection of wines. My favorite alcoholic drink would be the moscato for white wine & lambrusco for the red wine. There has never been a time when I wouldn't enjoy my trip to Olive Garden without having at least 2 of my favorite drinks!

The food. My favorite part. If I were to order off the menu and not order a special, I would go with the shrimp & scallop fettuccini alfredo. I love seafood in my pasta. Olive Garden was actually the first place I have ever tried scallops in my life and I enjoy the taste of it. The other thing I like to order is the Soup Salad & Breadsticks with unlimited refills for only $7.95 for lunch! Nothing can top that! Plus their breadsticks are the best in the whole world!!!

They have an amazing special going on right now. The never ending pasta bowl is an amazing deal, yet I dont think I could eat so much pasta in one sitting. I recommend someone with a big appetite to order that. 

Overall, it is a great place to enjoy a meal that will satisfy your taste buds with your favorite company."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely amazing the waitress was very attentive,  everything was on time the flavors were delish. I had the zuppa tuscana and the ravioli shrimp, lobster great. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"two pieces of chicken - one tasty and tender; one tough and bland - add one server that is disinterested [also showed no attention to refills or low salad bowl] - result: try near-by Oreganos"}
{"text":"Always on top of their game Olive Garden never disappoints. The food is excellent, the servers are friendly and very efficient. The place is always packed. We went to the S. Decatur location 1st but they had an hour wait so we thought we'd try the summerlin location instead and guess what? They had an hour wait too. But really it was 15 minutes and they were seating us. FREE wine samples, great salad and fresh out of the oven bread sticks with tangy marinara. The traditional dishes of spaghetti, chicken Parmesan, Alfredo and lasagna are always a home run. But the new stuff is great too. The steak was very tender and well-seasoned with balsamic and the pasta was very good & cheesy with small chunks of Gorgonzola throughout.. The NEW Flat bread appetizers looked Delicious."}
{"text":"I don't typically review chains like this because most people know what to expect, but I am making an xception here. First, I'm not a big fan of olive garden food, but I like it well enough that when given a gift card I'm willing to go. My wife got chicken that was completely burned to the point we couldn't be sure it was chicken. They did bring another one out and it was much better.
The real disappointment in this particular OG is the wait staff. Our waitress was very frindly and a descent server, but the rest of the servers congregated behind us and held conversations that interupted out dinner. It was distracting and made the entire meal less pleasurable. One guy was cleaning on one end of the room while another kept yelling to him all the way across the room. The reason they use vaccuum rollers without power is so they don't disturb the dinners, yet they are illing to yell across the dinning area ateach other. No manager ever came to check on us."}
{"text":"If you are out at the Red Rock & everything is busy or you are feeling like some good italian food & family atmosphere otr maybe just wanna get away from the casino for awhile.

Go across the street to Olive Garden. The pasta is great, the salad & breadsticks are great and so is everything else on the menu.

This time I tried the chianti braised ribs over portabello mushroom risotto and it was out of this world.

One of the best locations I have ever been to."}
{"text":"good food-good drinks-good atmosphere-always a little iffy on the service but they treat you like family, right?? a must try!!
this is a real no-brainer
superb, hot & tasty. the sauces were perfect. the chicken was crisp & juicy. the meatballs were savory & cooked to perfection. the salad & breadsticks as always were tops!!"}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad experience at Olive garden, we eat there about once a week or so, I always have the soup, salad breadstick deal.  Consistently good food, excellent, polite service, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Perfect as always for what it is.  As always great service and help from the staff.  I asked what he recommended and took his advice and enjoyed it.  The waiter did point out a couple of specials that included \"buy one - take one\". Great value for the money (basically between me and my wife and the promotion we got four meals for the price of two).  

I would say 4 stars only for the fact that I reserve 5 stars for specialty placed that are not chain related.  As for service - 5 stars as always.  

Can't wait to take home the lemon cream cake and have it with my coffee in the morning (just another recommendation from the waiter)!

Our server was Cooper - he was beyond great!  Great evening, great food and great value!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parm. You would think they could put a small slice of lasagna on instead of the spaghetti.  She just says no not even I will ask. 
Very rude ."}
{"text":"Everytime we eat here the food gets worse, if that's even possible. The five cheese ziti was dry and hardly had any \"sauce\". And the lasagna we ordered was falling apart and a lousy portion for the price. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went to Olive Garden on a Saturday night and got right in which surprised me.  Friendly staff, and waitress.  Great service and food.  More of a 4 1/2 stars, but we can't rate that way.

I've been going to Olive Garden restaurants for approximately 22 years across the country.  I don't recall having a bad experience.  It may not be \"authentic\", but I'm not in Sicily!  It's odd some bitch about having to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated some nights, yet can't write a proper sentence.  What do you expect?  If you don't want a wait go to a drive thru.  Should be a compliment to the establishment if there is a wait."}
{"text":"Fairly new location.  We've been here 4 times.  Have always received great service and food."}
{"text":"What can I say.  Service is great and nice decor. Had the lunch specials- if you are hungry- you can get your fill of salad and bread with your main dish."}
{"text":"soup, salad and breadsticks. we were in and out in 20 min with two bowls of soup each. watch out, the drinks will get you. soft drinks and iced tea are like $2.50 each."}
{"text":"I have never been to an Olive Garden with such a great staff!  The food was good, but the staff made the experience great!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the mood to get some pasta, so we came here! We were seated immediately. The waiter was nice, and not over bearing which is what we like. He offered a sample of wine which happened to be great so we each got a glass of that with our dinner. I got the Shrimp Scampi and he got the Shrimp Alfredo. Both were good and were exactly what we were craving. Overall our time there was great, but not super amazing. There was nothing extraordinary with our experience, so thats the only reason for the four stars. We will come back anytime a pasta craving comes along :)."}
{"text":"I've came in several times a year and throughout each dining experience, I've never had such a wonderful server like Kyle. He is such an amazing employee and completely outdoes his job, without a single hesitation. Throughout my many years of dining, I was amazed to witness such greatness straight from Olive Garden. He has such great charisma and an amazing sense of humor, it was a very enjoyable experience for me."}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago for lunch. We had the unlimited soup/salad special. When our second bowl of salad arrived, there was a white hair on top of one of the tomatoes! We quickly looked for our waitress, she did not return to our table for another ten minutes. She saw the white hair and said she was gonna show her manager. The manager arrived at our table, apologized for the human hair in our salad and offered a free dessert. We declined, all we wanted to do was pay and leave with our loss of appetite. He removed one entree/lunch special from our ticket. When we exited the restaurant we passed by several serving staff and host(s)... no one acknowledged us. In summary, the service was poor and finding hair in your food is one hundred percent preventable. We have not returned to an Olive Garden since."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food. A truly great experience! The children enjoyed the experience, server really did a great job!!!!"}
{"text":"Reviews about the food in major chains are pointless, it's all about service. drinks were filled promptly without being asked, and our server was very friendly. If you like Olive Garden this location is recommended."}

{"text":"Came here to have a Birthday dinner, and was pleasantly surprised with the prompt service. Came in about 5:30 (Saturday) and was told it would be 15-20 min wait but ended up being sat down after only waiting less than 5 mins. Took advantage of their \"Buy one, Take one\" special with the Zupa Toscana soup and fresh breadsticks as are usual \"appetizers\". Ordered the Chicken Scampi and Fetuccinni Alfredo to go and can't complain (Very good). We remember the service being very typical as with any chain restaurants before, but our server Amanda was very courteous and greeted us with a smile. In fact as our meals were coming out, she was very attentive to our meals and refills on our drinks. Good food and good service with a \"smile\" is all that it takes to make us all feel and enjoy the menu even that much better. Thanks Amanda!"}
{"text":"No big surprise at this restaurant. You know what you going to get. However: the 4 stars related to the service more than to the food. 
Penny - our server - was great and happy and ready to do whatever it's take to makes us happy. And she did. Way to go Penny"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed this evening. The service was very slow. My tour of Italy combo look like the lunch lady had slapped together with the large spoon at the cafeteria. My guest ordered the same except substituted an entree. Our server told us there would be no difference in charge. He was incorrect, it was actually an $8 increase in the bill. Instead of haggling with the manager we decided to not dispute the bill because we were there long enough already. In the future I would highly recommend that your servers get acquainted with menu substitutions. I will probably more than likely not return to this Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Rainbow location in the IHOP shopping center. Plenty of parking, never had an issue with that. Dinner time is typically busy and you may have to wait to be seated. 

I had a hankering for OG tonight and decided to order to go. I've been to this location before and dined in and had a good time so I thought I'd have a good experience again with my ToGo order. ...WRONG. 

My ToGo order was not good tonight 2-11-16. I had the create your own pasta with marinara.....that pasta was so dry! I don't know if was over cooked or what. Clearly they did not enough marinara for the huge portion of noodles AND it was luke warm! EXCUSE me but I like my good hot. 

I added the Italian sausage which  tasted like it had been left over from a few days and reheated. Just dry. And the salad...they gave me all the yellow pieces of the lettuce. Gross. I've never had a meal so bad from OG. I can't do this location again...Sorry."}
{"text":"Located at Decatur / Oakey area. Parking fills up quickly especially during dinner time. 

10-30-2015 Went to Olive Garden with friends for dinner. Great service, very warm and friendly. 

I had the all you can eat pasta with Italian sausage. It was most delicious and of course the classic salad and breadsticks were great.

 I've always loved OG, always have, always will. As I've learned it just depends on What location you go to."}
{"text":"I had to give this restaurant a good rating because of their hospitality. I made a reservation and only mentioned 8 adults and they said a table would be ready by the time we arrived. The table wasnt ready for us because i forgot to mention one thing.. the two little boys with us! I was in a hurry at the time and thought they would have booths to squeeze the little ones between, so it was just unfortunate for me and the manager saw my frustration. Long story short, they put something together for us within 5 minutes and everything rolled as smooth as ever.

We always enjoy coming to the Gardens of Olive for their tasty pasta, great deals, and never miss a time bringing home a bunch of bread sticks for the kids."}
{"text":"This OG is okay.  It's consistent with all the others in town.  We mainly go there cause our kids LOVE the OG.  My kids go crazy with the stickers, bread sticks and the Zupa Toscana.  One thing I will give this location a lot of credit for is problem resolution.  The two times I've encountered issues (which the employees brought to attention) and the manager always does a superb job with the follow up.  I have found this location to own up to their mistakes, but make a true conscious effort to ensure their patron is happy.  This is one reason I go back and the other is they take good care of my kids. That attention always holds a special place within me."}
{"text":"We were seated within minutes and had great service...waitress very attentive and friendly. Salad and bread sticks delicious as always and good size entrées except for the salmon which was overpriced and not that tasty."}
{"text":"Manager James on duty.. had an issue with the coupon... That our server could not resolve... So he came to the table with an attitude!! Got real smart when I ask him what about customer service... and he walked away. He is not Manager material with an attitude like he has. Manager Jim has always been super friendly and visits the tables.... unfortunately this location has lost a customer... And Mr. James doesn't seem to care."}
{"text":"I am giving a 5 star rating for one thing , it's the service I have received twice at this Olive Garden by Marcus R. I have dined twice here and Marcus has been my server his customer service is one of the reasons we will continue to return. You can tell
He enjoys his job and is always willing to go above and beyond"}

{"text":"My husband and I visited on 4-28-17 and the experience left much to be desired.  Once we were seated it took almost 20 minutes just to take our drink order.  Appetizer and meal came out at almost the same time and since we were at a VERY small table it was overcrowded.  My husband's pasta had very little sauce and my Salmon was overcooked.  We never got a drink refill even after my husband asked for one.  I am assuming the waitress was new (I hope so) as everyone around us either had their order messed up or it took forever to get service.  If she was new I would think the Manager would have offered some assistance to her but that was not the case.  Very disappointed with our visit."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden. They are so good and polite and I love all the staff. Especially Jennifer. I love drinks and beer and pasta."}
{"text":"The hostess was beyond inconsiderate. Having someone in the group who is obviously handicap, she sat us in the back as far as you could go when I asked for a table, by passing MANY open ones. Then \" forgot \" to tell anyone we were there. Not only were we seated in the back but there was a huge, noisy party in that room. Wait staff was excellent after she discovered us. Food was average."}
{"text":"The waitress was a b***h, she also told us that 3 different things we asked for were all out, she told us there were no chocolate mints when the table right next to us had been given some by the other waiter. And oh yeah... I am typing this from my toilet (: because apparently the gnocchi soup got me sick.  It came out of the kitchen lukewarm but I didn't complain but I wish I did. The kitchen must be f***ing disgusting to actually get someone sick."}
{"text":"probably you all have been to Olive Garden before, so i wont review the food too much.  It's the same as any Olive Garden, good food, good service, and as expected, I am always full before my main dish comes out because of all the soup and bread.  Our waitress was really nice, although in that shes too sweet, she'll give you a cavity sorta way.  but to each his own, and no complaints...

however, it  was a friends birthday.  They sang an italian song which was nice.  

here is where you know how the economy is bad...they used to give you a free dessert, like ice cream or a brownie.  thats a fact that i swear by since this is my family's staple at least twice a month.  

anyhow, they bring out this cupcake looking thing, but the dish was like a cupcake wrapper shaped bowl, there was whipped cream on top, a single lit candle and smiles all around.  but when my friend dug into her cupcake, our smile faded when we discovered that it was a cupcake wrapper shaped bowl filled with whipped cream.
 
talk about a buzz kill....anyways we went and got desserts at sonic so alls well that ends well"}
{"text":"Soup salad and breadsticks are fantastic for lunch or up until 3pm. You can fill yourself up for 7.49.. great deal and great taste."}
{"text":"Man, this place is packed with moms, dads, and their UIUC-enrolled kids.  I swear, they used this location to film their latest commercial, about a college girl, her parents, and her (freeloading) roommates/friends.

Sometimes you gotta fill a craving, and that means waiting an hour for a table.  And all Conan O'Brien/Jim Cramer jokes* aside, it's a pretty damn good place to go for the money. And the chairs have wheels! WEEEEEE!

I swear, the soup/salad/breadsticks have sprinkles of crack and MSG, they're pretty addicting.  And I'm pretty sure they use one can of Morton's salt per serving bowl of salad.

Tip: Make sure you ask for more salad and breadsticks as soon as you get your first batch, or the waiter will disappear until your entrees arrive.  By then, they know they got you pinned against a psychological wall, because who eats more salad with their entree?  Break past that wall of uncomfortability and continue to ask for refills until the check arrives.  Heck, ask for it after the check arrives.  It's like a glass of water - it should always be full.

FYI, the sangria is f-ing expensive. BEWARE!

*If you haven't seen Conan's impression of an Italian grandfather going to Olive Garden or the Conan/Cramer interview about Olive Garden, do so immediately."}
{"text":"On 1-31-18, I brought a co-worker there to celebrate her birthday.  Because there was a wait if 10 mins. on tables, we decided to sit in the bar area and get the celebration started with a few drinks. While we were sitting there the manager Eric came over and graciously introduced himself, then asked us would we like to sample some elixirs before taking our orders. Luckily we said yes, then we ordered. Also, he made sure that we wasn't waiting long and before we could finish our drinks our table was ready. Our waitress Betsy was one of the most gracious and attentive waitress I've had the pleasure to experience to date. She is definitely a people's person. Eric and Betsy made our dining experience feel like royalty, especially for two Divas like us. More restaurants need to model their example. Thanks for making a Diva's BD celebration special."}
{"text":"It always amazes me how much people rave about Olive Garden as the best Italian they've ever had.  These people really need to get out more because even compared with the other Italian chains, they are last on my list.  

I don't know how I ended up here today.  I guess my car made me come here due to the fact I couldn't make up my mind where to go for lunch.

I will give OG one thing....The Zuppa Tuscana is pretty darn good..good enough for 2-3 bowls.  The salad was awful..,,no wonder it was all you can eat.  Who wants to eat gobs and gobs of iceberg lettuce?

The server was really good but he wasn't busy either.  He only had another table besides mine so it was like he was hawking over me which is just as bad as not being around at all.

And then he gave me a water to go without asking.  I will say this...It's the first place I've ever had a togo cup filled with water."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this restaurant gets so busy. But I have to say this location of olive garden was the worst one I have been to. 
1. Water cup tasted soapy
2. Utensils not cleaned properly
3. The shrimp that came with our DIY pastas were super small, reminded me of the $5.99 bag of shrimps I get from walmart. 
4. The garlic and wine sauce was really heavy and not appetizing. Honestly my pasta would have tasted better if you just give me some olive oil dressing with a dash of salt and pepper.
5. The garlic bread were super greasy and honestly not very good
6. Salad dressing very sour. 
7. Minestrone soup was very bland I had to add an obscene amount of pepper to it to give it flavor
8. Games on the tablet that comes with every table, costs money. Seriously, before I was about to compliment their technology, this is how they get you. Some of the games are free apps from the app store, so why would I pay $1.99 to pay while I am waiting for the food?
9. Bathrooms at this restroom needs attention"}
{"text":"Food was FANTASTIC!! A+.....as for the Service D-.  There where 2 waiters, still service was slow.  Both waiters where rude and condescending.  Also, no kidding Yelpers but this placed smelled like Butt,  I mean it stunk.  We thought maybe when we where seated away from the lobby it would not be so bad, but it was.  I will still eat at Olive Garden Restaurants because their food is GREAT, just not at this location.  This place Blows!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location for our date night..... and had a great dinner. Food was fresh and so good. Our server had awesome customer service. I forgot her name :( we will definitely be back. If your on the north west part of town be sure to pay them a visit. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Clean and nice environment. Parking is kinda full but did take out. Was going to stay but decided rather go back to the hotel and eat there. Overall friendly hostess. Food is the same as usual. Nothing changed."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a quick lunch before baseball and our waiter was great his name was Rome and he was exceptional. Very respectful. He didn't write anything down and still didn't mess anything up. We don't eat beef and pork and we mistakenly ordered a soup with beef and he didn't hesitate to bring us a new soup and spoon. He understood that we were in a rush and worked with us. Definitely coming back and requesting him!"}
{"text":"Noisy restaurant!  

Waitress had trouble hearing us there was so much noise.  Probably due to the congested atmosphere and the low ceilings.  

This is a new location for the Olive Garden previously on Metro Parkway. The new Olive Garden has a much smaller waiting area. Imagine when it is busy...

Lunch buddy and I had the 2 for 25 dollar special with choice of 5 different entrees plus one appetizer. A good deal I think as prices have increased over time.

I had eggplant parmesan that was okay but oil-soaked. The appetizer was delicious - lasagna fritta. Similar to deep fried raviolis, these were filled with alfredo sauce and covered with marinara. Yumm. The breadsticks needed seasoning which happens sometimes.

Bottom line, due to the noise factor don't plan on a quiet lunch at this location."}
{"text":"A Sunday visit to Olive Garden's unlimited soup and salad combo made for a tasty satisfying meal.  The addition of crab stuffed mushrooms hit the spot too.  Pasta fagioli soup was very good.  We liked the extra peppercinis added to our salad.

Service was excellent!  Teaming by a couple of servers meant that all of our needs/refills were anticipated or handled right away.  Refills for more iced tea, breadsticks, soup and salad were speedy.  The server even gave us an iced tea to go - a plus!

For my next visit I like that I can pretty much expect the same good  food.  Olive Gardens food is consistently good.  Of course I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service at this new Olive Garden location! The configuration of tables and booths gives everyone a lot of space and a feeling of privacy. The decor is modern but still warm and welcoming. The food is perfectly prepared and tastes better than other Olive Garden locations!"}
{"text":"Customer service is amazing and their dishes are so delicious. It's always our favorite place to eat and it is very kid friendly which very convenient for us since we have 2 kids and a teen."}
{"text":"Great service however the food could use some work! I would come back however. I had the chicken Parmesan that day, maybe I'll try something else soon."}
{"text":"Wait and wait and wait and.... wait some more?

My boyfriend and I went to this Olive Garden this past weekend on Friday night. I had just worked a long shift outside and I was hankering for their bread sticks. The craving just hit me and I could have nothing else.

Of course, on a Friday night the place was packed, especially with a lot of families. We asked how long the wait was and we were informed it would be 30 minutes. Typical, so we went outside and waited. Luckily, I don't believe we waited much more than 30 minutes until we were seated.

The place was really loud, but what can you expect? Tons of families and it's Olive Garden, so I guess you just get over it. I decided to get their dish that is featured on the menu: Stuffed Rigatoni with Grilled Chicken. My boyfriend opted for the Chicken Ceaser Salad. Of course, my meal came with the huge salad and bread sticks. The salad was on par with what you normally get. The bread sticks always came out yummy and buttery and slightly salty. I don't know what they do to them, but they're so good!

Next - the meals were okay, nothing spectacular. The chicken was disappointing, obviously Olive Garden gets their chicken strips out of frozen bags. The pasta was pretty good and the white sauce, well I can't complain about it. Boyfriend said his salad was pretty good. What I don't get is Olive Garden's prices - they seem a bit high to me. I mean, I realize it's \"Italian\" (ha ha), but it's Olive Garden... I shouldn't have to pay $13.95 for mediocre lasagna. 

What was the worst part of the experience was the waiting for our food and waters to arrive. The service was so slow my boyfriend and I commented on it several times. That's when you know your service is bad - you notice it. Yes, they were busy and yes, it was Saturday night, but still, I gotta say the service was rather mediocre.

All in all, Olive Garden is still as mediocre as it ever was. I don't think I'll be returning for dinner on a Friday night any time soon. Probably gonna stick to lunch and their unlimited salad, soup, bread sticks promo."}
{"text":"Chris from Olive Garden was our server he was not only amazing but he took very good care of us and the service was amazing he recommended me the pesto chicken and I fell in love with it. Five stars is not enough"}
{"text":"Went with my family to Olive Garden tonight, our server was really nice and we didn't walked out just because of him. However it took a long time before our food was ready and when they brought our food the picture on the menu and what they delivered to our table had nothing to do with it. It didn't even had the main ingredients of the dish and I understand that mistakes happen but this was too much. I wish the menu were ore accurate  to the dishes they delivered to your table. We called the manager and her approach was not the most appropriate either, she got to our table asking who was the person who didn't like their food and when we explained our problem instead of just owning the mistake she said nothing was wrong with the dish anyways we didn't had the re make it, we didn't finish eating we just left. Really bad customer service from the manager"}
{"text":"Jennifer from the To Go line has horrible customer service and shouldn't be handling customers!! We placed a to go order and when we got home the fried lasagna appetizer was dried, semi burnt, and had no sauce. My husband called to speak with the manager and Jennifer placed him on hold for 10 minutes. He hung up and tried calling back. Each time, he would get hung up on. Ironically, when he used my phone to call for the 3rd time, he wasn't hung up on. Clearly being upset, when Jennifer answered the call again, my husband said he was on hold for 10 minutes before waiting to speak with the manager and that she had 1 minute to get the manager on the phone before...which she promptly interrupted him and said \"Before what?\" He then replied before escalating it to corporate. When the manager got on, he said he had no idea my husband was on hold for him the first time. Although the manager, Ron, was friendly and helpful, Jennifer left such a horrible impression with us that we will NEVER eat there again. 
Do NOT go there unless you want confrontational service. And if you do go there, against my warning, avoid the girl named Jennifer. She should find a job where she doesn't have to deal with people."}
{"text":"I've been to MANY Olive Garden locations & this location is by far the best. I live pretty far from this Olive Garden but from now on I will be willing to commute. 
Our server Carmen was the MAIN reason why we had one of the best dine in experiences. She was very courteous and polite. She definitely EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS. I must have said \"Thank you\" a million times! One more time... THANK YOU Carmen and your  team."}
{"text":"Olive garden is basically the cheap and fast food for Italian.  If you're expecting fine dining Italian, not the place, you're better off at Brio.  But if you want no non-sense, dirt cheap food at fast service, Olive Garden fills that roll.  

They always have specials going on, so its best to go for that.  I went for 2 for $25.  That's unlimited soup and also salad, 2 entrees and your choice of desert or appetizer.  Salad is alright, just a house salad nothing special and also you can choose from 4 different soups and you change your soups.  I tried 3 of them.  They're not the best soups but they're not bad.  It is what is.  The entrees are alright too, good portions, the Seafood Lasagna had actual seafood and even the scallops are real and plentiful. which was surprising to me.  Overall the quality and taste are sup-par nothing special.   But you already knew that.  everything is on the cheesy side if anything.   

As long as you come go to Olive Garden with the right expectations, fast italian for cheap, you'll have a good dinner and a good experience.  If you're expecting fancy high class authentic Italian... you  will be disapointed

Pro
Cheap italian food
good selection

{"text":"I maybe give chain restaurants too much of a bad rap, & in Gastonia you're so bombarded with chains that it's tough to always eat at independently owned places. But Olive Garden is a great Italian chain restaurant.

They serve up some great dishes, along with my favorite appetizer, bruschetta. Every dish I've had has been very good & your portions are pretty large. You'll pay a pretty good price for all of it though, but nothing crazy.

Olive Garden isn't a bad pick for lunch or dinner, as their food is pretty good. But who doesn't like Italian?"}
{"text":"Our server Whitney was very pleasant and got our drink order right on and we ordered the soup and salad all you can eat. The food came super fast and was fresh. we had the all inall you could eat soup and salad.  We loved the minastroni the best. Make to ask to make sure the soup is hot.  The salad was fresh and the bread sticks never ended coming and they were nice enough to give us some to take home. Thanks Whitney for a great experience."}
{"text":"The thing about the suburbs of Chicago is that small business like Biaggi's, Minneci's, and Mia Zia's Cafe is they are a dime a dozen. Now, CU-area has these restaurants, but not with the density that my old home had!

Anyway, I had a gift card to Olive Garden that I received from a student over Christmas Break and I decided to use it. I will always default to a \"local joint\" (said in Guy Fieri voice) because I assume it will be hand crafted rather than a \"cookie cutter' recipe. I am a small business advocate, but that doesn't mean I won't support chains like OG!

I love Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and Cracker Barrel, but if given the choice I think little places like SO many of my reviews like Gianorio's of Winfield, Red Apple of Carol Stream, or Thipi Thai in Glen Ellyn have their own little charm and personality you just can't get in chain restaurants!

So, speaking of chains...there is a Bob Evans nearby! But this visit to OG was going to be a goodie. I knew I'd get the minestrone and I limited myself to just two bread sticks that I think bathe in olive oil (I can have as much of it as I want, right? No, because too much of ANYTHING will add that extra poundage...just because it's all natural doesn't mean you should eat it ALL). It's actually garlic butter, but who's counting? Certainly not Americans watching their waistlines.

So I started with soup and some empty carbohydrates. I knew they would be pretty good, but I also knew that my entree was going to be average at best. I've always loved their pizza but I am having some pizza tomorrow night (from a local joint in Gibson City). I was going in with the idea that I would just get linguine alla marinara and would add some shrimp, but a special caught my eye and stomach. I decided on the Three Cheese Pomodoro Ravioli! 

It was a solid choice as part of my three course menu from 12.95. OG has a lot of \"lighter\" options, which are actually normal sized portions in disguise due to our \"growing\" problem. I will give you the advice that the fancier it sounds and more words the title of the dish has, the more likely it will be a caloric nightmare (Five Cheese Ravioli Al Forno for 1200 cals...my guess). I know I went off a nutrition tangent, sorry!

I knew I was getting that chocolate mousse cake for dessert which was a bit dry. My water cup as well as the servers' attitude were also lacking substance. ZING!

Will I be back? No, probably not due to running into way too many of my students families (2) than I wanted to. Plus I know the kids think this is an awesome place just because they saw it on TV. Damn you, TV marketers!"}
{"text":"4/30/18  I ordered yesterday.  I ordered an eggplant sandwich and a salad.  I was kinda disappointed that it came with fries:-(  An order taker who listens to your ordering a vegetable sandwich and salad should warn of the fries, but it didn't.  I was at least happy that they put ketchup on the side.  It came in a nice big compostable paper bag.  The salad was not the best.  I trashed the soggy tomatoes.  The black olives were good. What really messed up the salad were the rancid croutons.

5/1/18

The eggplant sandwich was good so I ordered it again today.  I asked for them not to put the garlic and salt on the top.  They did, BUT they also did NOT give a side of ketchup:-(  I am a ketchup lover so I came home and opened a new bottle of ketchup.  I had the sense not to order the salad.  I informed the ladies at the counters that the croutons were rancid.  Hopefully this will prevent you from getting the rancid croutons.  I got the Pasta Fagioli soup and it was WAY better than the salad.  The price of this light lunch is good. $7.48 all in.  You also get (2) breadsticks."}
{"text":"The ONE time in a long time that i go and eat here i find a bug in my drink. Also our food took an hour to get to us. I don't know if thats normal but I did not like it."}
{"text":"Gross. So ridiculously overpriced, its all premade and frozen, 3rd time trying an olive garden. The bar took 15 minutes to make 2 bloody marys and she says sorry its not as good as other places. What. The lettuce is soggy, breadsticks all oily, what is it people love about this? This isnt Italian. The soups are all gross, besides the 3 tries waitstaff brought the wrong ones. The olive garden at this location is outdated, nix the faux olive \" bush\" next to the tables, they are dusty  and hideous to look at."}
{"text":"About once a year, I inevitably eat at the Olive Garden.  It's never good, and I say I'll never go back.  Then somehow, that thought slips my mind, and because of its convenient location (or in this case, having an old gift certificate), I return.

Items I would not recommend:
- Eggplant Parmesan (oily and you can tell it used to be frozen)
- Shrimp Primavera (undercooked shrimp and chewy pasta)

Salad's actually pretty tasty, and the middle of the breadsticks good (but ends are hard).

Considering that they charge you $14-18 per entree and the place was crowded at 8:30 on a Tuesday night, they must be raking in the dough, which is pretty sad.  Next time you're craving Italian, try a delicious locally owned establishment with some character, like Michelina's - I know I will!"}
{"text":"Come here to have lunch with the fam at least twice a month. Gotta say the lunch specials are ok and the place as a whole is mediocre... Soooooorry .

But I did not understand why none of the restaurants manager could not come to talk to us about our bad experience.  Even though they did reduce the bill.  Why could they come and talk to our table."}
{"text":"Went here the other night, had a small wait time and was then led to our table. 

Didn't really care for the table itself as it had a support stand that wouldn't let the chair given fully sit under the table, so it was a little ackward to get used to.

The waiter seemed new at his job, brought us out breadsticks and menus. As we ordered our drinks we looked the menu over and we waited a bit for him to come back. We finished our first drink when we had placed our orders. He said he would bring refills but that didn't come until after our food arrived, by another waiter who was asked by our original to get it for us.

My husband enjoyed his food, I felt my own dish was lacking in sauce and it seemed a little dry, in comparison to the sister restaurant at Arrowhead. 

Rest of the meal was fine though."}

Extra bread sticks with 5 cheese mariners sauce and Zeppoli.

My order was ready in 15 minutes and I was helped as soon as I arrived. My food was still hot by the time I got home. 

I prefer shrimp Alfredo over the carbenera. 
First time  ordering the Zeppoli and omg they are like little pillows of heaven. Dusted with sugar, served with chocolate or raspberry dipping sauce. 
My favorite soup is the Zuppa Toscana. Large chunks of potatoes, bits of sausage, full of flavor."}

{"text":"Our server, Krystal was amazing. She was really nice and seemed to know the menu well. She gave us great suggestions on what to get and gave really good customer service. The food was great too, Olive Garden never disappoints me. Got the tour of Italy and it's so great because you get a little bit of everything. They also have a three choice sampler which was nice too. All in all, it was a great dinner."}
{"text":"It's an Olive Garden.  I like their food and it's consistent.  They are good about switching up sauces. Of course the salad and breadsticks are a bonus.

I had the mushroom ravioli, but got the lemon creme sauce on it.  I liked it but the sauce was a bit salty for me.

We sat at the bar (no tv), just because it's always a wait for a table. (I don't know how Olive Gardens are not doing well, they are always packed)

Sitting at the bar was a great choice because we got to meet Vildan (I hope I'm remembering that correctly)!  She was so wonderful!  She was aware of what we needed and when and would chat a bit with us then leave us to have our own conversation.  She is really charming and friendly and I would go back here just for her personality and service.  

I think they could use a really good cleaning at the restaurant.  I've said this in another review, but things just seem a bit grimy.  Also at the drink stations on either side of the bar the iced-tea and lemonade dispensers were uncovered (i know they are supposed have a lid on them), so that was a little gross, to me.  I was glad I hadn't ordered tea or lemonade."}
{"text":"For the most part the food is VERY AVERAGE for Italian taste.  The marinara sauce is \"pretty tasteless and not good at all\".  Reminds me that they open a can of diced tomatoes and add NO seasonings whatsoever.  For the most part the pasta is cooked perfectly, but all in all the food is AVERAGE for anyone looking for authentic Italian."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss, my first experience was great.

Been here twice this year~ first time, food is good but service is bad. Not a busy night and it took two hours to have a meal with friends.

The second time service is great, perfect. But the food might be unclean/undercooked. A shrimp appetizer seemed chewy and that led to some stomach pains. 

Inconsistent service and dining experiences are very strange but I'll try again if someone else really wants to go :/ 

A bit disappointing~ as the usual entrees are nice, just not this time."}
{"text":"When I tried their new menu, I really love the new kale salad topper salad and the strawberry panna cotta. Best of all the tastings. I am not sure when I will be back but I would love to try the dessert again."}
{"text":"we dont normally eat at Olive Garden.  In the past we haven't been impressed but this location was different.  Very clean!  Very friendly service.  Nice greeting upon arrival.  Waitress (Ana?) was very friendly and quick efficient service.  The hostess opened the door for us and wished us well as we left.  We were impressed with the level of training and politeness.  The food was good too!  would recommend!"}
{"text":"Just had Sunday family dinner here. Very clean place, brand new carpets on the floor.  Unlimited salad, soup and breadsticks!!!"}
{"text":"So I normally don't review chain restaurants but the experience at Olive Garden tonight was amazing. We have an army at our house and decided to do take out. While it may sound like something easy, most of the order had something special that needed to be done with the food. Michelle was amazing taking the time to listen to the order and reading it back to us to ensure that everything was correct. She made sure we had enough silverware and refilled our drinks while we were waiting. She bagged up the order in front of us showing us each dish to ensure that it was correct. I will definitely be back to this Olive Garden to see how their dine in service compares."}
{"text":"Got takeout.  20 mins late on prep.  A smile and eye contact go a long way.  For limited human interaction, very poor job."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Olive Garden in ages, so when my mom and I were furniture shopping in the area, we decided to pop in for a quick lunch. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the strong cheese smell...not that pleasant, but we were starving. We sat down and were given menus, dirty ones at that, and ordered some bruschetta to start just to have something to eat. Although the bread was delicious, the bruschetta tasted like cut up tomatoes - that's it. No seasonings or anything. Needless to say, we did not finish it.

The salad and breadsticks are ALWAYS delish, so we devoured those. My mom ordered a pasta dish with steak and goat cheese, and I ordered a chicken caesar salad. Her pasta was delicious!!! My salad was pretty good as well (hard to screw that up) but had too much dressing and became soggy towards the end.

What really irked me about Olive Garden was the lack of knowledge from the server. They knew absolutely nothing about the wine, my mom had ordered a glass of white but wanted a second glass afterwards - of red. The waitress COULD NOT comprehend this, even when my mom named the wine she wanted, and we both said RED multiple times. After a manager came over to confirm, they still brought her the glass of white. We had to repeat AGAIN that she wanted a DIFFERENT glass - the red she asked for. The manager was nice enough to comp the wine but it was as if they were completely incompetent. That was really annoying. 

The bill was unexpectedly high for lunch, but it was quick and satisfying. I would probably come back for the never ending pasta bowl special and that damn delicious salad but that's pretty much it. Don't expect anything glamorous, or the servers to know anything about the menu."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Olive Garden in years after opening 3 in the Midwest. Our starter was Calamari and it tasted old and frozen. The mains were 2 Alfredo and two Ravioli one was mushroom which was not bad. Service was very slow and we had to ask for refills on everything. We May be back but you can tell corners have been cut. My wife's Marinara looked and tasted like Ragu but for a quick inexpensive meal it was priced right."}
{"text":"Food is very good.  Had excellent service from Chad. Dessert was delicious. Definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"I just love there zuppa toscana soup. The salad is also great. Not really a big fan of there new tomato garlic sauce didn't really have much flavor. They are very consistent on how they make their breadsticks one day it's warm and soft the next it's barely warm and hard"}
{"text":"I went there on a Monday and ordered there dinner duo between 3 and 5 deal  . I normally order there soup and salad  The coupon said good for any dinner Monday threw Friday and cannot be used with other coupons nothing else They wouldn't allow me to use my coupon so Shady That's not the first issue I've had there it used to be a great place but lately it's going down hill After what happen I'm going to stay away and try other placesI raised the star level because I called the Darren customer service and they sent me a gift card and told me that there office was trying to change the print on the coupons so people know r
Ahead of time that they can't use them on special meals"}
{"text":"I would say the food here is average, but the reason I get four stars is because of the great service and the great deals they have. My wife and I really enjoy the buy one and take one deals you can get from Olive Garden. This deal pray much brings us in on a regular basis when they do it. We think the value is pretty good and we filled up soup and salad honestly"}
{"text":"I was at Olive Garden today around 3pm with my family. I think we had a new waiter since there was two helping us out. The experience at first was a little irritating since our servers forgot to bring us straws for the first 6 minutes. We had to ask over three times for straws and peppers and we reminded both of them. We then ordered our food and when they brought it out they explained one of our meals was input incorrectly and we had already been waiting for a good while even though the restaurant wasn't so busy. I asked them to cancel it and to just bring me more soup instead because I didn't want to wait any longer. Five minutes later the manager came out and introduced himself. He apologized and explained that he was embarrassed that someone didn't have a meal while everyone else was eating. He insisted on buying me the meal I had originally ordered. He went above and beyond to turn the experience around and I myself am in the food industry as well and was impressed by how much he cared for our experience. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"No doubt about it! Olive Garden is the McDonald's of Italian Cuisine. My Sister, her daughters and one beau, and myself had a wait of over an half hour before our Dinner... and as we left, there were MORE people waiting two hours later... and EVERY table in this Olive Garden was filled with a mass of people!

I really can't give a negative review to Olive Garden with so many people that are fans. Who am I to say that they're totally lacking in good taste? And while being a fan of Italian Cuisine... the Pasta that Olive Garden serves is not half-bad! If only a quarter of the people that had Dinner tonight ever got wind of Yelp, Olive Garden would be the most reviewed restaurant site on Yelp!

On the menu tonight...

Dinner Salad (^^) Their standard-fare Dinner Salad with Iceberg Lettuce. Not one positive thing I can say about this...

Bread Sticks (*****) One of the few positive things about Olive Garden. Soft and Plump, with a Buttery Coating. You don't really have to Butter this Bread! Always liked their Bread Sticks.

Service (^^) Our waitress seemed very robotic and lifeless. I can see why! If a typical wait-person has responsibility for ten tables at Olive Garden... he/she will be harried all night! The tactic at Olive Garden is to not monitor your drinks that much... that would require too much independent thinking... Just hand over to the customer another glass of Water or Soda or whatever they ordered to drink... no questions asked! Half the table had second drinks that were not touched at all! What a waste!

Never-Ending Pasta Bowl (*** 1/2 $9.95) First plate was Linguine with Aioli Garlic Alfredo Sauce.... Not that bad! Pasta cooked just right. Alfredo Sauce a little dry... but passable.

Raspberry Lemonade (****) Pretty refreshing, I would say!

Second Serving - Spaghetti with Meat Sauce (** 1/2)  Very plain and lifeless Meat Sauce. Passable... that's about all I can say that's positive. When did Olive Garden decide to place the Pasta and Sauce in a small bowl on the second serving?

Only Olive Garden and some Casinos in Las Vegas can serve so many people in one evening! It is literally amazing the amount of traffic they can handle! I feel for their support staff, though. There is a definite lack of enthusiasm in such an environment.... Just an endless line of people wanting to be fed!"}
{"text":"Haters gonna hate. I love Olive Garden. Because everyone and their momma has been there, I'm gonna rack up a list of hits and misses.

Say Yes To:
-unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks. I like the Minestrone best (vegetarian).
-Roscato Berry cocktail
-ravioli di portobello
-herb grilled salmon
-seafood brodetto
-Andes dessert mints with your bill
-did I mention breadsticks?!

Politely Decline:
-the five wine \"blend\" offered table side... really? bleh.
-stuffed mushrooms: really greasy/oily, very few for what you're paying
-the Italiano burger. I haven't tried it... but really, who would? it's a BURGER at Olive Garden.
-being seated next to a table of 5 kids under the age of 4. 

At this particular location, I love their outdoor patio and the location of their bar, both are separate from the main galley crowded with people. Parking here is difficult and the wait (especially on weekends) is long. Waitstaff is above average in terms of service, but a bit rough-looking. 

Andes Mints for all! Why do they taste so much better here?"}
{"text":"Had dinner at 4pm.  Not really busy in the restaurant but the service was horrible. We finished the first round of salad with out the bread.  Second salad bowl took forever.   Dinner came but had to wait 15 min for second serving of soup.  The food was very good but the delivery was below normal standards.  We do like this place.....  Maybe just a bad day."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Jessie was an awesome hostess. She was very friendly and was awesome to us! She even packed our food to go for us, when usually the waitresses would just give us the boxes. Only regret I have was being unable to find the general manager to give her more kudos!"}
{"text":"Had such a wonderful experience here. Our server was awesome. I believe his name was Thomas. Younger guy with brown hair. I think we made him laugh a few times. As soon as we got there he was there to greet us with a smile on his face. They had wine samples that they were offering but that day we weren't drinking so we declined. We got calamari for our appetizer and it was AMAZING! Some calamari I've gotten had been rubbery and tasted like oil. This was not soggy, crunchy, fresh and was cooked perfectly. Came with marinara and ranch dressing (really good with ranch). They had the endless pasta bowls, so we obviously got that. I got the garlic Alfredo with shrimp for my first bowl and my second bowl was classic marinara and meatballs. The first noodles were linguine noodles and the second was gluten free noodles because I have issues with gluten although I will suffer the consequences for some good food. Didn't really care for the gluten free noodles but it's all a learning in process for me so no biggie in my book. We got two bowls of salad and breadsticks. All fresh and obviously we got the cheese on it. He said \"just tell me when to stop\" and we just stared at him like bring it on! Then the 3 of us laughed. We were so full from pasta so when he asked if we wanted dessert we just couldn't do it. But the pumpkin cheesecake really looked good though. Tables were cleaned and not sticky, floors were cleaned and booths are fluffy people friendly. Can't wait to go back. We will be sure to request Thomas."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing here. Never fails. I always get the tour of Italy with salad. Usual have to eat less than half the salad because the tour is so big I can't finish it. Definitely recommend (:"}
{"text":"It's a typical Olive Garden I normally just get the soup and salad so nothing really spectacular. This place has clean restrooms and none of the servers looked cracked out... As good as Olive Garden gets."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I have been to Olive Garden and it was the same as I remember.  Good food,  good wine,  decent prices, and wait times haven't been too bad.  

Kyle was our waiter and was awesome."}
{"text":"Try the new ravioli appetizer. AMAZING!
Soup and salad are the standards for my family. We all love the salad and bread sticks, although I must say the breadsticks are not as good as they used to be. Not sure what's changed but OG is going downhill. Too loud, too crowded and becoming overpriced! 
I still enjoy lunch or just the soup, salad and breadsticks. But ordering a full meal requires way more time than I usually have for dinner out with the kids. 
Their dessert is still wonderful and as stated at the beginning the new ravioli appetizer was amazing. The food is still ok, again not authentic Italian (I've been there) but better than some of the \"fast food\" Italian places I've been. The noise level in here is just way too high especially at peak times and the service is atrociously slow!"}
{"text":"Always great food and services here. Always come back. Big fan of the salad and cheese fondue. Love it"}
{"text":"My service was awesome as always here. The chicken gnocchi was a little watery but everything else was perfect! My son loves olive garden. I'm not the biggest fan but I did enjoy my meal tonight."}
{"text":"Nice servers at our little family dinner. The eggplant parm us always good. 
This is not a Mom and Pop little Italian place. As long as you know what you're ordering you can enjoy. The eggplant parm is always good. Breadsticks and salad are the best part and the decaf is always good!
Had tiramisu for dessert.  Decadent and wonderful!"}
{"text":"The service is so bad at this location that we will not return.  We always sit in the bar area.  We went back a second time thinking that maybe the server was just having a bad day.  Unfortunately after sitting there for awhile, a server did come by and asked us for our drink order.  We both ordered water.  She proceeded to tell us that she would be \"Back in a little bit\".  We waited and waited and then we left!  Unfortunately there is nothing on their menu that I can not live without."}
{"text":"I been escorted to my table .... I asked for a booth. This hostess rolls her eyes n shows me to my booth n sets my place settings down walks away ....  I then wait seemed like 10 minutes I approach a Different hostess stating \" I been waiting 10 mins and have yet been greeted or anything?\" She goes n says \"No you haven't it's been 6! , THANK YOU\" WTH 

SO , I was then approached by the manager Michelle who was just the most sweetest woman for this situation. Made me calm n feel relaxed. Which is just amazing in my books... As well as my waitress Alysa who also came to my table n apologized n went over n beyound to make sure I was good through the rest of my Visit.Rough start but amazing SERVICE N THE COMMUNICATION WAS GREAT! I'll be ba"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Meals were delivered timely to our table. Food was good, service was good.  The table top tablet screens have games to play while waiting on food. The trivia game allows you to play against other patrons. While trivia games are free at restaurants all over town. Olive Garden chooses to charge $1.99 without ever showing the charge in a well marked manner. Hostess should tell guests when seating that there is a charge. We were vey surprised when waitress asked which person would be paying for the game.  We would never have even kept the tablet on the table had we known.  We complained and waitress said GM will look at putting a tape with price for notifing customer of price in future. Disappinted Olive Garden would choose to tick off table after table over $1.99 hidden fees."}
{"text":"The quality of service at this restaurant has gone downhill BIG TIME. The last 3-4 times My family has gone to this location, it has taken anywhere from 20 to 45 mins to be seated (not during busy hours) about 30 minutes just to get drinks, and even longer to get our food. It seems a lot of the Norterra area restaurants are going way downhill quality wise, which is very unfortunate."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden to begin with. I am a \"classic\" menu person and I always enjoy the Chicken Alfredo. I love the atmosphere and the friendliness of the employees. In Particular tonight, (which is why I am giving 5 stars) a gentleman named Ramon waited on us. He was an AWESOME waiter/server behind the bar and I hope that the next time my husband and I come back, we will encounter with this young man again."}
{"text":"This was the worst service we have ever had at O.G. I had never been to this location before but was with a friend that does go to this location often. The server did not write down the order. He got the soup wrong, then the entrees wrong as well. Slow lunch service even though we ordered off the lunch menu that is supposed to be quicker."}
{"text":"Thank you Summer (manager)and Leslie (manager)for all that you are doing to support our Wish Kid Madilyn. She just turned 4 and her favorite restaurant and food is Olive Gardens Chicken Alfredo. Summer and Leslie are assisting us in making Madilyn's Dinners plans. She is so excited to go to dinner with us and to meet Summer and Leslie. Unfortunately we have to wait a bit until her counts are up. Stacey and I can't thank you enough for supporting our Wish Kid. We all are excited to dine with you soon. Thank you ladies."}
{"text":"Extremely busy Friday night.

We had reservations for a party of 10, but that didn't seem to matter very much.  After waiting for about 15-20 minutes passed our reservation, we were finally squeezed into two small tables.

The manager was very apologetic and provided us with free appetizers.  The serving staff also accommodated us by providing a third table a few minutes after we sat down.

Overall, the food wasn't inspiring, but it was adequate.  At this point, we all know what to expect when we go to Olive Garden.

However, in this case, the staff and the management really stepped up their game.  We were continually bombarded by service and asked if we were doing well or if we needed anything.

While the food may be mediocre, the people working here certainly are not.  In fact, they all deserve to be paid more for putting up with my crazy relatives.

On another positive note, the triple chocolate whatever cake was awesome!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience waited an hour with horrible service.  Receptionist was rude and lied constantly to customers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Olive Garden location in the city. We have had terrible luck at the Summerlin location on Charleston. It is always slammed, we have waited forever for seating, food, initial service and had mushy awful food. It is worth the extra drive to come to this location! 

We come here every few weeks and almost every single time with a myriad of servers have had very fast and attentive servers who have great personalities and are very bubbly. We appreciate the attentiveness to extra breadsticks or drinks when low, and even if they are slammed the server will let you know the food is coming soon so that you are never left waiting and wondering. 

We usually get the pasta fagioli soup and it is cooked just right with good seasoning. Are entrees are usually a various choice of classic pastas, no chicken or seafood and we have had good luck with these. You can often catch them during a promotion with buy one take one or in the fall during the never ending pasta bowl for a decent price. 

Overall I would highly recommend this location over any other in the city. You can get in and out with 2-4 person table in 30 to 40 minutes if you want a quick dinner. We always ask for booth seating and have great luck with the servers that cover these sections midweek."}
{"text":"AWFUL costumer service! I've been to this location a few times for lunch. It's usually a very busy and loud location. Last week I decided to beat the lunch rush and get there shorty after they opened. Surprisingly it was a very slow afternoon. I sat in the bar area and waited. I waited some more. No one came out to greet me. There were two bartenders there talking to one another about situations regarding the restaurant and complaining about another employees. Still.. I was waiting for a waiter to greet me and take my order. After waiting for about 10 minutes a waiter comes out to greet me. He asked if I was in my lunch hour and I replied yes and simply ordered soup and salad. Nothing complicated. The salad came out but the soup never did! After 40 minutes of waiting it was almost time for me to leave. I waved the waiter down and asked if my soup was almost ready. His answer was \"I assumed you would ask me when to bring it out\" I was upset! I sat there for 40 minutes picking on a salad waiting on a soup that never came out! He offered to place the soup in a to go container but I left the restaurant only eating half a meal. I've been to Olive Garden plenty of times. Soup and salad usually comes out together. 

I was very upset! I normally don't do this but I decided to call the restaurant and speak to a manager or supervisor. I spoke to \"Hunter\", He asked for my email and phone number. I was told he was going to look into the situation and email me a gift card that evening. I never heard from him and that's totally fine. I do feel that some of the staff needs to be better trained."}
{"text":"Please read my original review, but the service here is always the best!!  
I love the wait staff...Maria is always accommodating and actually seems to care about your happiness. She is such a sweetie!
The tomato cream sauce with sundried tomatoes and bacon is no longer on the menu. I was so disappointed, so the waitress asked the chef if they could make the dish and the cook agreed. 
I thanked the manager when she came by to check on us and she said as long as they have the items in the fridge, they would try to accommodate. 
The dish was not exactly the same as the old one, as I think this was just an Alfredo type sauce, but it had sundried tomatoes, bacon and tons of mushrooms that were once again cooked to perfection!!!  I wish I could get the cook to show me how to make such perfect mushrooms. 
Once again, Olive Garden staff did not disappoint. So glad this is my Grandpa's favorite spot to come, because I'm not sure I would come to a chain restaurant as often if it wasn't for him. Yeah Grandpa! :P"}
{"text":"I'd rather look at dog crap then eat the grilled chicken. It's nasty! The chicken separated in my teeth when I bit it! This is worse than Walmart chicken. This $14 pasta wasn't worth it! Imma vomit. Please save yourselves."}
{"text":"The food is always good here.  We always get an order of Calamari and Fried Mozzarella.  I always feel stuffed after soup, salad, and breadsticks.

Now the reason for the 3 star rating.  What I have noticed is that the main entree servings are a lot smaller and the prices got higher?  They now use smaller dishes to make it larger but my stomach knows better.  

In addition to that, they have the portable kiosk that the kids play the $3 dollar games on.  

And to top it off, this place was hot.  It is over 100 degrees outside but yet it seemed warmer inside.  It was so warm that we got a strong breeze of body order from our waiter a couple of times.  

The saving grace is that place still sings and gives a free dessert.  Not many places still do this so my daughter was happy.  I know there are better Italian restaurants but my bday girl picked it."}
{"text":"We have always loved Olive Garden, but I will never return to this one.  It has really gone downhill over the past few years.  The drinks all tasted terrible.  The Coke did not taste right.  I paid for a frozen drink, and it was awful.  We asked for dressing on the side and got it on the salad.  We asked for a bread refill and never got it.  The marina sauce was so spicy it tasted (and looked) like salsa.  The floors were filthy.  We walked out with most of the food and drink still on the table."}
{"text":"Five Daughters Red blend wine was on point. Duo appetizer was good, though cheese was very greasy and salty (spinach and artichoke dip was great). Stuffed Chicken Marsala was tasty though a little under temp (ie cold)."}
{"text":"John Oliver already did a perfect review of this chain.  Plenty of parking at this location, even if it is often full.  You have plenty of choices to eat at if you show up and the wait is too long.  They often have some promotion or other going on."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this location! The service was bad the portions were lunch size at dinner prices! Severs really need to step up their game. The new wages in Arizona increased the pay the prices went up and the service went down! If you really want to piss me off bring me my food before bringing me a drink!"}
{"text":"what can you say about this place, its a chain, everything is supposed to be prepared the same exact way in all locations, how good it is depends on the person in the kitchen preparing it.  The waitress was awesome, which made the experience an enjoyable one.  I would return for the salad, soup and the service if I could get the same server again, other then that, we probably would not go back as it was just ok.  We had a party of five and having the soup and salad made me the most satisfied person in our party other then my wife who enjoyed the wine and the humor the waitress brought to our table.  But then again, where does my wife NOT like the wine???"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in quite a while, but I was digging the new look and feel of the place. Came in for for soup, salad and breadsticks. I am not a huge fan of Olive Garden, but I am a sucker for their soup and salad! As usual, it was delicious. The service was OK. Overall, it's Olive Garden and what you would expect."}
{"text":"As much as I would rather have authentic Italian food at a local place, I occasionally crave the salad and breadsticks. Visited a couple weeks ago and ended up ordering a build-your-own pasta. The salad and breadsticks, delicious as usual. The pasta was OK. The chicken meatballs were very dry and not juicy at all. However, I never expect anything to wow me here. 

Nonetheless, it was a good meal, the place was busy and our waitress was great. 

I will be back.....for the salad and breadsticks :)"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Never will eat there again. Management is rude. Worst Olive Garden experience ever."}
{"text":"Yay I love this place for lunch on the east side. It's reasonably priced but it's usually pretty busy so the service is pretty good the food is good and you get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"The Breadsticks and salad are consistently good. The entrees are subpar in my opinion. Its commercial grade fake italian food and I get that, although, I feel like they are falling short of even doing that well. This olive garden was better a year ago when i went there than it was tonight."}
{"text":"Service is great at this location. Tina provided us with excellent customer service. We had and we always have the soup and salad most of the time. Prices are reasonable. It's truly a family restaurant. One of my favorite locations aside from the one on flamingo."}
{"text":"It's silly to write about Olive Garden. It's Olive Garden.  Though I have to agree about staff. There is one waitress that isn't my favorite, but the rest are super."}
{"text":"So I upgraded a star after my most recent experience. The only reason I'm docking a star is for the long wait, which isn't something they can help. It's just naturally a very busy location.

I ordered pickup, hoping not to have to wait for long. Since it was Valentines Day there was even a line for pickups haha. 

Even though it was CRAZY busy, our food was perfect, still warm (even after a 15 min drive home), and high quality like we were eating in. The server that rang me up was so polite and nice. I give her big kudos for her attitude and smile amidst all the chaos. Fantastic Customer Service from all staff."}
{"text":"Another gift card review from me.  The trick I think we are finding with larger chain restaurants is to order off the healthy options menus.  They can't just drown your food in butter, give you a ton of it and call it a day.

So that's what we did.  We both had a chicken dish that was fine if not a tad forgettable. This was a couple weeks back now.  The service was prompt , polite and attentive."}
{"text":"I love me some OG when I'm in Vegas. The waiter here was amazing!! Service is always excellent and the food was so delicious! Left so full that I had to take home dessert!"}
{"text":"I had a darden restaurants gift card so we decided to use it here for lunch today. Not much to really say besides Olive Garden is like the fast food of italian food and overpriced. I ordered the tour of Italy and it was good. And my boyfriend had the seafood Alfredo and it was good also. Like I said the food is alright but I would never come here and pay full price Unless someone gave me a gift card again. 

Service was great!! Waitress was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Before our most recent visit this week, we had not been to Olive Garden in quite some time.

Surprisingly, my husband gave me an Olive Garden gift card for Christmas this year. My daughter and I happened to be in the neighborhood that day so we decided to drop in for lunch.

Our server (Dreama) was excellent. If my review was based only on her service, I would give this review fours stars.

The woman who greeted us at the front wasn't unpleasant but she greeted us as if she wasn't sure why we were there. Which I found odd, to say the least.

We were seated immediately. In no time, our server appeared to take our drink and appetizer order. 

My daughter wanted to try the fried calamari so we did. Along with the salad and bread sticks, it really could have been a meal by itself.

For our main course, my daughter ordered the \"make your own\" pizza and I made a special order of grilled chicken and pasta with no sauce and a side of the Olive Garden's tasty salad dressing.

A different server brought our food. My daughter's pizza was perfect. Although my plate was very hot, my pasta was cold. When Dreama came back, I told her about my pasta and she immediately whisked my plate away and had a replacement out to me very soon. 

Dreama was a great server. Her banter was witty, she checked on us at the perfect intervals, and our drinks were refilled just when they needed to be.

We had enough to eat and enough leftovers to take home.

Although I love Italian food and we used to dine at the Olive Garden a few times a month, I can no longer eat alfredo sauce and I have to limit my tomato intake.

Sadly, this removes Olive Garden from our list of favorite restaurants. But for every now and again, this location is our preferred Olive Garden and Dreama is definitely our preferred server."}
{"text":"Went to eat there with my babies and I love this location. very clean and our server Kevin was super nice and professional. always check on our drinks n if we needed anything. Thanks Kevin"}
{"text":"I'm not a chain snob. It doesn't matter to me if a restaurant is a chain or indy, as long as the service and food are good.  I haven't been to olive garden in a long time. . Four of us went today to celebrate my sisters birthday, and I was sad to find a nearly empty restaurant at 1pm.  

I have to say our waiter was amazing. Friendly, engaging, efficient. And the food was really good! 

I got the chicken piccata lunch portion. It's two pieces of chicken breast, and the sauce was so good on it! It's on the lighter fare menu, and it comes with zucchini instead of pasta so you don't leave feeling like you ate a huge brick. It was one of the better versions of this dish that I've tried! 

My sister got the the Flatbread, my dad got spaghetti and meatballs, and my mom got a piadini.  Everyone loved their lunches. 

They sang to my sister for her bday and even comped her apple crostada.  I'd rather come here to an evil chain than go to a very popular indy italian place in bethel where I've had hideous obnoxious service. 

Well done OG, I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"What to write about an already popular restaurant.  Oh wait.. it's this exact location.  I love this location!  Maybe it's the people who work there, maybe it's the layout of the building, but I think it's just great.

For those who have never been to the Olive Garden (which I doubt is many), you have to make sure and ask them for FRESH bread sticks.  This last trip there they gave us what seemed to be the last of the lunch breadsticks.. yeah.  They quickly fixed it and gave us plenty of fresh ones.

I usually enjoy simple dishes, but decided to try one of their new specials.  Completely forgot the name of the dish, but there was chicken, pasta and some other goodies.  A big plus about Olive Garden is that every so often they have all you can eat pasta bowls. MMmmmm.. 

Great \"Italian\" food.. hehe."}
{"text":"We love the Olive Garden because the quality of food you're so dependable we especially love the Olive Garden close to our home which is always extremely clean great service and the meals are absolutely perfect we would recommend this particular Olive Garden to anyone and everyone"}
{"text":"Came in for the desert.  So far friendly service from a waitress who although writes down what was ordered repeats the wrong thing thrice, asked me if I wanted any water I told her no, 15 min later she comes back with my Irish coffee and a tall glass of ice water.  Was glad she asked first if I wanted water yet disapointed she came back with what I didn't ask for.  Nearing the end, the waitress asked my wife if she would like anything else like more Irish coffee or water.  One thing that grinds my gears worse that shitty service is when the waiter or waitress doesn't ask me directly and assumes that it is just my wife that would want or not want something more.  I would have given more than one star but due to the unprofessionalness of asking one and not the other customer at the table if they would like something else had the downgrading of rating to one.  Would have hated to see if they would screw my fries up since I always ask for them to be well done and crispy but that will be another time."}
{"text":"I do have to say we Love going to restaurants in our area. We'd love to continue to support these places just because they are close by! 
BUT if the service is not good( much less great) or the food is okay ( much less Great) we won't be able to continue to support these restaurants! The price is the same weather your eating on the East side of town or the West. But you can definitely see the difference in the SERVICE! Wise up Olive Garden we will leave the area to get GOOD service! Over $50.00 for pasta is not a bargain so service better be great!"}
{"text":"Since their opening in January, we've been back a few times.  Each time has been just as good as the last.  We've tried to order different things when we go, so we're getting a good variety of their offerings.  So far, everything has been on point!

Tonight, we went in at 9pm, and got another delicious meal.  Our server, Veronica, was incredibly friendly and attentive.  The overall experience is always made better when your server has a smile, and this was no different.

We're already looking forward to our next trek down the street to OG!!"}
{"text":"NOPE - complete let down. Yes I know it's a chain, but this location was rock bottom - the worst!

The food was horrible - bland and over microwaves. I mean come on - when you cannot even microwave my meal right - we have an issue. 

I'd never go back even though the meals we complained about were removed from the bill - nothing was really resolved."}
{"text":"This is my first ever review.We called Olive Garden on Sunday(03/15/15) and asked to reserve a table . They said the wait time is one hour. So we went there after an hour. We told them that we had a reservation but they said they don't take reservations on Sundays. Then their manager talked to us in a very irresponsible way. He is asking for the name of the person that I talked on the phone and call history. 

I couldn't remember the name of the lady that I talked. And he told us to wait for one more hour which will be 3 in the noon. He is talking in a way that it was our mistake.
 
  I felt so ashamed in front of my friends.I gave one star because the website is not allowing me to post without a star."}
{"text":"Our service was very good. The food was so so... They have a big menu here, which is a plus. The negative side to that is , if u r a true food aficionado, u realize the majority of the food here is just over a bit ok. Unless u come here on the regular & know the menu, & your \"favorites\", u r gambling with your choice. Some of the dishes are really tasty while others can bel disappointing, nothing special. Today,  I had a dessert! Pumpkin cheesecake!!! I cannot resist anything that has pumpkin in it..  While it wasn't the best dessert I've ever had, if u love pumpkin & cheesecake, you will be happy with this. It is very flavorful. Has the taste of pumpkin & light cinnamon with a cheese cake texture & Carmel drizzled over. That was the highlight at Olive Garden this time. Pumpkin pumpkin pumpkin, yes please:))"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of all things Olive Garden. The minestrone soup is my favorite. I ordered it tonight, it was good but the shell pasta was a little mushy. Maybe over cooked but still good. The breadsticks were amazing!  My son had cheese pizza and grapes and enjoyed it. The hubby had lasagna and said it was delicious but the portion size was smaller than usual and we went at dinner time so it shouldn't have been a lunch portion...this is our first trip to OG since moving to NV so maybe portions are different than what we had in FL. I also had the create your own pasta and was able to get had cheese marinara and half Asiago garlic Alfredo.  Very yummy!!  My peach Bellini tea had a hint of coffee taste...very weird. All in all good experience and we will go back."}
{"text":"Haven't been to an Olive Garden in FOREVER!  We decided to stop in for lunch while waiting for our number to be called at the DMV and it was much better than my last experience (not this location). They had the never ending pasta bowl when we went but I couldn't add grilled chicken - that's why I took off 1 star. It just doesn't make sense that you can't add grilled chicken but you can add fried chicken.  I ended up ordering a standard meal of fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken.  He had calamari and loved it. The service was great.  I'd def go back to this location."}
{"text":"This place has the most uncomfortable seats ever! It made it a little hard to enjoy my meal, but the food was good so I quickly got over that. The service was great and we even got a free show... Apparently the lady behind us threw a fit because they wouldn't let her take the \"all you can eat\" home. Seriously, people suck! But the manager handled it with class and even walked over to us to see if we were ok... We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just got take out and it was amazing. We were really impressed with how neat, organized, and delicious it was. Will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"so i normally like olive garden being what it is. but this time it was not at all a pleasant experience. because when i asked  for a refill on the bread sticks they never came back either did our waitress. then we finished our food 30 minuets later she magically appeared and was like \" oh how was your meal  is there anything else i can get for you\" and my response was \"yeah more bread sticks that i asked for 30 min ago\" she then was gone again for another 15 min and only came back with 3 bread sticks and the check and no reason to why or what took so long. also i never even asked for the check."}
{"text":"i hadnt eaten at olive garden for a long time at least 10 years and i ate at one in cali...but anyways i had sat on this gift card for a long time and finally decided to use it...i give one star for my fiances food and two stars for the great service but have to knock one off for how sick i got after eating there. But our waitress was fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for many many years, ever since I moved to Las Vegas twenty years ago. I'm basing this review on my last experience and only because I've had good experiences in the past I'm giving them a three otherwise it would be a two :/

It was Valentines Day (I know, I know.. they are SUPER busy) but I had just been discharged from the hospital and we needed some REAL food so my friend ordered three meals to go from their website so we could just go and pick it up (the wait was about an hour and 40 minutes). 

We arrive right on time and of course the parking lot is crazy busy and all the to go spaces are filled. We park in another area and you can see the runner going from car to car getting names and bringing out the bags of orders. I volunteer to go inside to try to get our order from the actual to go area only to find a big line. After waiting for like 10 mins and the line not moving and no one telling us anything, I finally see an employee walk by and ask them what am I supposed to do because I havent see anyone even at the counter. While talking to him an employee finally comes to the counter so he says talk to him. He explains that they are busy and whats the name my order is under so I tell him. And he just stood there. Doesn't check anything. I'm like, ok? Then he says there is someone coming by getting names. So at that point I go back to the line and this person \"taking names\" finally shows their face and I give them the name BUT I tell her that we (our party) is now in the to go parking spot (they texted me) and we will be waiting outside. To which she acknowledged and wrote that DOWN next to our name.

So, I go outside and wait in the car in the to go parking lot. And wait. And wait. The runner girl NEVER came to check on us. So we call the number on the to go parking sign (it's been over 30 mins since our order should have been ready) and the person on the phone yells if our order is ready and someone replied to \"Yeah it is\". UM?? What the heck? They finally bring it out and we bring the food home. You can tell it's been sitting around. The alfredo has congealed, the cheese is rubbery and the bread sticks were HARD.

 NOT cool Olive Garden.We made numerous attempts to get our order and they failed miserably on their execution to bring it to us when it was DONE. And to make matters worse, we ordered TWO \"Tour of Italy\" meals. We got one that was correct, the other was just an order of chicken parmesan. BUT we were charged the full amount for a second Tour of Italy which is way more expensive. And my eggplant parmesan meal which I had their marinara spaghetti side replaced with alfredo fettuccine had the tiniest bit of alfredo sauce (alfredo= EXTRA charge). It was like they only sauced half of it and said forget it, but my boyfriends pasta was completely covered in alfredo. 
Not a pleasant experience, poor execution and charged/over charged for items not received and not enough of sauce that we paid extra for. I really hope this isnt a trend."}
{"text":"I really just want to emphasize on the service we had today. Marian was awesome! So friendly helpful! The food was good... Nothing extraordinary. But she made it that much better! It shows she enjoys her job! Customer service is everything IMO."}
{"text":"I don't come to Olive Garden often as there is always a wait. My son wanted to come here so we did. I feel bad saying this but the hostess really seemed very unhappy, She wasn't friendly at all. We weren't told how long the wait would be other than a few moments which turned into 25 minutes. We were finally seated, our waitress was sweet, our food was typical... Nothing spectacular. I would go back only because it's a familiar place but really nothing great about it."}
{"text":"I had planned on placing a to go order, the hostess told me to go to the bar to place the order. A woman came over didn't greet me like hi how are you etc. but she asked me if I was going to be ordering to go. I asked her if I could actually just eat at the bar and she said sure, since I knew what I wanted already I started to tell her she said ok let me get the bartender to take your order. The bartender never came over. They looked busy but it what been nice if they said I'll be right with you or something. I let out a long sigh and still no one came over so I got up and left."}
{"text":"Food Good.  Service Awful.

I ordered Soup and Salad (unlimited), and for the entree, ordered Shrimp Scampi.

Service:
Waited 15 minutes to get someone to take my drink order.  Honestly, ?I never knew who my waiter/tress was.  I ordered food at the same time as drink fearing the waitress would never come back to take my order!  Food came out in normal time; however, never checked on.  Water never refilled.  Breadsticks never delivered until I specifically asked.  Check out my picture!  I was eating by myself and this was my table.  Service here is a joke."}
{"text":"I went here with my friends for my birthday dinner and I have to say that the atmosphere was quite all over the place, we were sat in this small red room. It was pretty tight. Our server was really nice and patient since she was serving about 10 of us. 

I ended up getting the Tour of Italy because I couldn't decide between a lasagna or Alfredo. I was pleased with the unlimited salad and breadsticks that are included when you order an entree. I get my food without waiting too long. I liked the Alfredo and the lasagna was okay. I mean how good can non home cooked lasagna taste right, but the food I do not recommend is the chicken Parmesan, it tasted burnt and mainly was just batter. I didn't end up finishing it. If I could order one thing I would just stick to Alfredo, you can't go wrong with it. 

In the end it was a good dinner. Fast service, friendly server, and subpar food. It tastes as good as the price is."}
{"text":"Service was great. Didn't have to wait too long on a busy night.

Portobello ravioli w/ sun dried tomato sauce was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This Olive Garden was the place to go to as a poor student at Baldwin-Wallace if you were really looking to \"splurge\" on yourself.  This location is always really busy with people but the service is still satisfactory.  I love the little chocolate mints they give you with your bill."}
{"text":"So so disappointed. Took my extended family, and my Dad there last night. We had just had my mothers funeral, and wanted to celebrate her memory by going to one of her favorite restaurants, Olive Garden. We had a party of 13, and were told it would be a 30 minute wait. It took them over an hour to seat us. When we finally were seated it took the servers 15 minutes before coming to the table. We ordered wine. They brought out the water, and other drinks, then the one server brought wine bottles, but no wine glasses. We had to flag another server who told us that the restaurant was currently out of wine glasses, and had to wait until a load went through the washer. The salads were delivered to our table with no salad bowls, and when those who had soup were served some had no spoons. The period between the salad and main course was too long. When our main courses arrived two weren't served, and my wife was told her order had been given away! This was overall just a bad experience. I'm in the process of contacting their corporate offices, because the service at this particular Olive Garden was way, way below the standards that made It one of my Mom's favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"We have been to quite a few Olive Gardens. This one for lunch was excellent. Pasta was good and our server Phillip was excellent. Check back on us constantly and the coffee serviced with a carafe at the table."}
{"text":"Yeah, one star for stealing my honey's credit card.  Thank goodness American Express is more loyal to its customers than you people are.  Using his credit card up & down Nellis blvd is retarded. 
Eat a dick & gain some integrity."}
{"text":"If you go to the Olive Garden expecting to get an awesome Italian meal, you're gonna be VERY disappointed. If you go with low expectations (as weird as that might sound) it's really not that bad. 

Even though my parents can eat wherever they want, they willingly choose to eat at places like this, Red Lobster, Applebee's, etc., on a regular basis so when I was in town for Christmas we decided to come here for lunch the day I was leaving to go back to SF. When I lived in Scottsdale, however, I did come to this location on a few occasions with the parental units. 

I actually think there soups (there's about four to choose from), salad (nothing that will blow your mind, but does tastes fresh), and bread sticks (hot and fresh) are really good. I think they run some sort of special during the week where you can do all-you-can eat of these things for like 5 or 6 bucks. I would definitely take advantage of this if I lived close by, and these items and special alone is worthy of four stars. 

The appetizers and entrees here are all pretty meh, however. There's nothing on the menu that's all that inspiring, but the food isn't all THAT bad. When I came here this last time I had portobello ravioli in some sort of cream sauce. The ravioli were overcooked IMO and the sauce was bland (my mom had manicotti, which had the same cream sauce). My dad decided just to get an appetizer sampler, and I tried a stuffed mushroom, and I will admit, Olive Garden or not that was a pretty good stuffed mushroom. 

Our server, Cara, was very attentive, but the place wasn't very crowded when we there. Still though, an uncrowded restaurant hasn't stopped some servers I've had over the years from providing crappy service. 

I probably wouldn't choose to come here, especially for dinner. However, the soup and salad is good enough where I wouldn't mind coming in for lunch every now and then. Plus, Kendra Wilkinson of \"The Girls Next Door\" fame freakin' loves this place so it can't be that bad, right?"}
{"text":"Lady has taken off her shoes.... I have lost my appetite!! 
And servers didn't say a thing to her. The times that I have come to Olive Garden just seems like a bad experience. Has gone down a lot!!"}
{"text":"For those who haven't never been to an Olive Garden, it's basically what you can expect from any well known chain Italian restaurant. I think you can get a solid meal here but it lacks the uniqueness you get from smaller family owned business. I've never had a bad experience eating at any Olive Garden. It's a reliable choice. 

You can never go wrong with unlimited salad and breadsticks. I'm a fan of cheese ravioli which are good here. Recently tried their new cheese studded gnocchi which was rich and very filling. A good choice if you like Alfredo sauce and little pillows of potato pasta stuffed with cheese! My husband always gets the tour of Italy because it gives you a little of everything - lasagna, fettuccine alfredo and chicken parm. Only thing I've actually disliked is the \"wedding soup\" which is not what I know as traditional wedding soups. Here it is essentially a bowl of broth with a few meatballs and spinach leaves. Just meh. Prices for entrees average approx $15 per person."}
{"text":"Atrebela.  Our waitress was professional and very pleasant. We will go back to the restaurant for the food and the great service"}
{"text":"I had previously had an issue with an online order and they made it right. I had the Lasagna Mia with four cheese lasagna with Alfredo sauce and grilled chicken. Absolutely Devine!  Husband had the braised beef bolonese. He loved it!! The best meal we have had here in awhile!
Our Server, Ervin T.  was awesome! I had some custom changes in my order and he got everything right! perfect!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times very satisfied. Service was friendly and the food excellent. We actually ended up ordering too much on both occasions, because it was so good.
However, the third time on a Sunday night for a birthday was a disaster. Cold food, pushy waitress, tasteless dishes, terrible. A couple of kids got sick. We got a refund, but it will be awhile before going to OG again.."}
{"text":"The salad was phenomenal, as usual. I ordered one of my favorite entrees: cheese ravioli with meat sauce. The sauce was good and loaded with meat. However, the ravioli were stuffed with mozzarella instead of ricotta. Extremely disappointing and not as appetizing."}
{"text":"Step into this place and you are transported back to Olive Garden circa 1994.  The decor has not changed since.  The only thing worse was the service.  From the time we sat down and ordered (1 app, 1 entree, and 2 kids meals), our meal took 1 hour to arrive.  How do I know this, just as we were being served, my watch reminded me to get up and move as I had been sitting idle for an hour.  The breadsticks were cold with no butter, and we were afraid to finish our drinks as it took 20 minutes to get a refill.  To top it off, it was my daughter's birthday and her dessert was dropped off at the table with a single candle as the waitress walked past (not even a \"happy birthday.\"  Way to make a kids birthday a special day!"}
{"text":"How can you not like it? Actually, I hadn't been in years and recently stopped in. Their pasta has definitely improved - almost tastes fresh....like I didn't feel as if I were eating in a commercial restaurant....

The ravioli filled with mushrooms is so good and the sauce they put on top - just amazing! 

The rest of the family ordered the typical fare which looked corporate and pre made....I guess it really depends on what you order...."}
{"text":"We've been here since it opened and now that Sammy's took a turn for the worse this is our new second home. 

Michael is a great manager and the staff is great. We always have fun here. This location is clean, modern and family oriented. Arrivederci!"}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden. Fresh breadsticks, yummy salad with dressing and Chicken Parmesan. Their soup is good too so every third or fourth visit I skip the salad and get bowls of their hot, steaming, delicious soup. 


Mostly good service. They're on refills pretty good. Now I'm making myself hungry!!"}
{"text":"Eh. It's Olive Garden. I probably haven't eaten at one in years. We had a gift card to use up so we figured now was a good time as any to dine here. 

I had the spinach-ricotta ravioli with shrimp scampi and tried some of the grilled herb salmon and garlic rosemary chicken. The nice thing about Olive Garden is that your entrees will come with unlimited breadsticks, and soup or salad. Unfortunately the breadsticks we had tasted like they were a little old and had been reheated, with a hard, chewy crust at the ends. The salad tasted like it had also been made way ahead of time then spruced up a bit. The lettuce tasted wilted by the time we got it. I tried a bit of the pasta fagioli soup which was well seasoned and enjoyable so if I were to go here again I'd get soup instead of salad.

The entree I had was a generous portion of shrimp and ravioli. The shrimp was well cooked and very tender. The pasta was al dente but I wasn't a big fan of the filling. The whole thing was swimming in a puddle of yellow sauce. The salmon I tried was slightly overcooked for my tastes but I liked the grilled flavor of the chicken I had a bite of with the fresh rosemary it came with.

We used the tablet on our table to put in an order of zeppoli with raspberry sauce. They were kind of like a cross between a beignet and sopapilla. They had a lightly crisp outer layer, soft pillowy dough on the inside and were coated with a special type of very finely ground sugar. I didn't care too much for the raspberry sauce. It tasted like I was dipping my dessert in Smucker's jam.

You can also pay for your meal using the tablet with credit card and leave tip which makes it convenient.

Service was impeccable. Chris provided friendly, warm, and engaging service and was very attentive to our table.

Since there are a lot of options for Italian dining in the East Valley, Olive Garden isn't really my #1 pick, especially when Rigatony's is so close by to me. But if I do get another gift card, this location is A-OK."}
{"text":"Every time I've come here it has been a good experience except once. Normally everything is great. The environment is great and the service is exceptional. The breadsticks are to die for and the free salad is delicious. I've liked every dish I've ever had there. The price is competitive if not lower than other Italian food restaurants in the valley. The last time I was here I did have my first bad experience though. Unfortunately we happened to sit at a long table facing the front of the restaurant.  During our meal an infestation of cockroaches started coming out of the wall along the cracks of the booth. Needless to say this freaked out my grandmother and about gave her a heart attack. Olive Garden gave us a give card and did a good job trying to make up for everything that happened. I assume this is a very rare and unfortunate situation."}
{"text":"This place was so disappointing! From the tea, to the ranch dressing to my entree....I cannot believe they serve generic, Walmart counter dressing, it's gross!!  The service was barely ok, and the lasagna was horrible. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"My boo and I stopped in for a late dinner Friday night. I called before hand and was told there was no wait yet we waited for 10 mins when we got there... But it seemed we were just waiting for the staff to like ... Figure out where to put us. We sat real close to other people when the restaurant was clearly half empty (I realize they do this for a reason but it wasn't that late and it just bothers me). The waitress greeted us and immediately took away our wine glasses which rubbed me the wrong way.... Good thing I didn't want a glass considering that could've added at least $8 to the check... Anyway. The whole time I could just tell our server was trying to get us outta there so she could go home which to me is unacceptable but I never cop an attitude back or anything because I'm a decent human being. Our food came SUPER fast which always makes me wary... And also the server was super pushy to suggest what she would get (I asked for angel hair instead of spaghetti with my carbonara, she adamantly disagreed with my noodle choice ...) and I also overheard her do the same to other tables. My food was very good, no complaints but my boo got the shrimp Alfredo and it had those baby shrimp with no tails on them . Mine had tails . Always wondered what that was about. Anyway we ended up just casually asking her why she took the wine glasses away and she said we both \"look like we're 18\". ... We're 26. Quit Lyin. Lol. Also she had me use the little electronic doo-hickey to pay with my card then awkwardly stood there as she showed me how to tip on it and how to adjust the tip to \"make it less than 20% if I wanted to\". It was just super weird and it made me feel like I was a 16 yr old out to eat without my parents for the first time. It'll probably be awhile before I go back to the OG"}
{"text":"I am almost embarrassed to Yelp the O.G. because when it comes to a good Italian meal, this isn't a place I would typically place on the list. But tonight I was attending the evening show of Phantom of the Opera and wanted to get in somewhere close for a fast meal. Again, when thinking of a fast meal, Olive Garden doesn't usually come to mind with the traditional full lobby and line out the door - but as I drove past, I noticed parking...and it was about 5:15 pm, so I took a chance it would not be at capacity.

I was immediately seated and the waiter, Stu, arrived quickly. He provided the free sample of Chardonnay, which actually was pretty good. I ordered the eggplant parmesan with salad. The salad arrived immediately and was the standard Olive Garden salad. Warm, fresh breadsticks were brought with the salad. As I neared the end of the salad, the entrée arrived. It was good and very filling. I was out the door and headed out by 6:00 PM.

The reason I decided to Yelp Olive Garden was the impressive service. Stu was very attentive, quick with the water refill, fast delivery of the salad and bread. He even risked burning his hands on the extremely hot plate for the entrée as the pot holder could not be located quickly. He took what is typically an average meal and environment and created a great experience. I left a nice tip for his efforts. Good job, Stu."}
{"text":"I love the Olive Garden and I've been a fan for over twenty years now. I will say that my experience at the Northlake location last night was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, and I wish I was exaggerating. 

The night started off with the waiter telling my parents (who got there before my twin sister and I did) after they asked that the breadstick chicken parmesan sandwich was available at dinner time. The only difference would be that the sandwich would be $10.99 instead of $6.99. I made sure to order it when I heard it was available!

After my family ordered, the waiter came back twice to ask questions about my parents'  orders and still didn't seem clear about what they wanted from the \"2 for 25\" Tuscan dinner items. He never wrote anything down, which was alarming and I believe added to his confusion.

The waiter brought us breadsticks with DIRTY PLATES. When we asked for more plates, he brought us salad with DIRTY BOWLS. What was going on in that kitchen?! My dad is a restaurant owner and we do understand how things happen so we thought it was a one off situation the first time, but multiple dirty plates is inexcusable.

Then the waiter came back and said he was wrong, the breadstick chicken parm sandwich was NOT available at dinner and I'd have to order something else. I asked why he had told us it was after we asked earlier and he said another coworker told him the wrong thing. I thought it was ridiculous they couldn't just make it since it's not like they don't have the ingredients, so I got up and found the manager.

I told the manager I was unhappy and asked why the sandwich was unavailable and he said it is, they just have to clear it with me since it's not on the dinner menu.  Olive Garden clearly needs to work on their communication issue about the breadstick sandwiches if the employees don't know what's going on and this has been a huge promotion for them.

We were hoping the sandwich issue would be the last issue, but it was just the beginning of a downward spiral. My dad asked for a beer FIVE TIMES and the waiter didn't bring it - not a refill, but the beer he ordered when he sat down!  He finally got it after all of those requests. We never got salad or bread at the same time  - it was always one or the other, despite our repeated requests for both.

The table behind us had two kids who were screaming most of the meal. I know that is not on Olive Garden, but it definitely put us on the edge and we didn't ask to move since we knew we'd probably already been written off by the staff as \"that table\" and we didn't want to make our waiter even more confused.

When our entrees came, it got even worse. Both of my parents' entrees looked disgusting. My mom's pasta looked like it was half cooked and my dad's pasta barely had any sauce on it. They told the waiter that the food wasn't good and he did switch them out for two other entrees.

At the end of the meal, we were all just completely fed up and we asked to talk to the manager about the experience. He seemed patronizing and kept trying to minimize our feedback. At that point, we were just ready to go. We got our bill and it had an extra charge for an antipasti salad that no one ordered. We told the waiter about that (and also gave him our 20% off coupon) and when he came back, he told us the manager decided to comp the entrees and we only paid for two soft drinks and a beer. We did still leave a 25% tip based on the original total because we knew it wasn't fair for us to only spend $13.

We didn't expect the meals to be comped, but we were grateful and appreciative. However, the manager ruined his act of goodwill when as we were walking out, we saw him and my dad thanked him, but also said he didn't have to comp all of the entrees and the manager said it was no problem.  After we walked by him and I sat in the lobby waiting for my family members at the end of the night, I witnessed him talking loudly and mocking my family to another employee. I glared at him until he felt the gaze, and he came over to me and tried to laugh it off, but the damage was done. That was unprofessional and should never happen! I was polite since I didn't want to cause a scene and we all just wanted to leave, but are you kidding me?! What a way to add disgusting icing to an already inedible cake!

I'm giving 2 stars because we've had good experiences at this location in the past. I'd give -10 stars based on last night."}
{"text":"Food is great.  The shrimp scampi is awesome. The rosemary chicken absolutely wonderful. Our waitress Jessica was awesome. Definitely a place for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Yet again another updated review on Olive Garden! I went for another date night with hubby last night . The food was wonderful ( as usual ) as was the service . Everyone has an off night just remember that ! The food is consistently good as is the service . I'm glad I gave OG another chance. I don't regret it ! Plus they have the buy one take one home deal going on right now , plus you can get a free red box !! How cool !"}

Parking: 4/5

The food is great at Olive Garden.  All you can eat salad, and fantastic pasta dishes.  Try the Seafood Portofino!  The down side of Olive Garden in Calgary is that there is only 1 location and they don't take reservations.  That means that unless you go really early, or really late, you'll be waiting in the lobby like a knob for an hour or more.

Once you get in, the service staff are quick to take your order and on a good night, the kitchen has your order done quickly and correctly.  On a bad night, it may take half an hour or more to get your dishes out to your table.  You'll love them when you do get them though.

For the entrepreneurs out there, think about putting a burger stand in the parking lot, the people waiting will make you a millionaire!  Seriously Olive Garden, just open another location in the south!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed, and even looked forward, to eating at the OLIVE GARDEN.  I was bitterly disappointed when this location closed and became a HOOTERS.  Other than somewhat hot chicks in orange shorts, HOOTERS leaves a lot to be desired in the way of food.  It's overly expensive, and bland. But that is the topic for another review.  Back to this OLIVE GARDEN.  I was overjoyed that they built a new building.  I eagerly looked forward to going there. The food was great at the old location, and I expected the same at the new one. I was disappointed. Bitterly disappointed. The food was way below expectations.  I am a big eater, so the NEVER ENDING PASTA BOWL was just up my alley.  Unfortunately, that alley turned out to be a dead end.  The food tasted like it was store bought and not freshly made.  I could have done the same thing at home and saved on the gas.  Both in the car, and my stomach!  The three cheese marinara tasted like it came from a store-brand can, not even the somewhat good CAMBELLS SOUP version.  That may have been acceptable.  The Italian sausage was not fresh by any means.  It was like they had left over pasta and sauce from dinner three days ago and pawned it off for lunch.  The staff was friendly, if a bit hurried because of the crowd.  It wasn't bad enough to erase the place from the preferred list, but close.  I'll give it a try again in the future, but not for awhile."}
{"text":"Did you know \"reservations\" are only able to be made at this location if you call 12-24 hours ahead? I was informed that this is the definition of \"reservations\" - who knew?! I guess calling ahead even if there are tables at the time you want to arrive then it is just too bad. They must like people sitting in the entry area."}
{"text":"WOW! Amazing dining experience! Adam had a great attitude, and took great care of my family! He took the time to make sure everything was perfect, and even took the time to make sure the kids were having a good time. He even brought extra grapes for my little boy, and extra chocolates for my daughter. The food was good, but Adam provided first class service!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but had to tonight. So my family and I usually go to the one on Decatur but decided to come to this one due to how close it is to our home. Well, let's start off by saying when we were seated we all got utensils except my kids. Next, when we received our appetizers they didn't give us plates so we all had to pick at the appetizers. Ok. My husband and son had to constantly ask for more drinks instead of the waitress asking if they wanted or needed more. Or even just simply bringing them a new on. When we were done eating she asked if we needed to go boxes. We got them but I had to ask for a bread bag for the breadsticks. So there we were w 3 to go boxes and a bread bag. She didn't even bring us a bag to put the boxes in. If you've ever been to Olive Garden then you know that they usually bring a bag to put your to go boxes in. I had to ask another waitress for one. And I know this isn't important but when you go to Olive Garden they end your dinner with the Andes chocolate mints. We didn't even get that. SMH... Service was not that great. Therefore they get 2 stars. It's all about customer service!"}
{"text":"We don't typically dine at chain restaurants, but this was a special request for a birthday dinner due to location and other factors. We chose call ahead seating and that helped with our wait on a Saturday night.  The wait was nearly an hour for walk-ins, but we waited approximately 30 mins. 

Service was friendly, but our server appeared to be overloaded. She was frazzled and was a bit \"snappy\" in her interactions with us. Clearly she was stressed because otherwise, she was very nice and friendly. Service was very slow for and some items that were requested either arrived too late to be used (sauce for an appetizer, for example) or not at all (drinks).   

The food was decent. Served hot and pretty tasty. However, the prices have increased, but the portions are much smaller than they have been historically. I can completely understand the increase in prices (costs have gone up on everything, right?!?), but it's disheartening that portions have reduced so significantly.

Soup, Salad, and Breadsticks still completely on-point!"}
{"text":"Now, while I enjoy OG's food - Soup, Salad, and Breadsticks galore!!  The service here the night I came her with my husband's family, was terrible!!  Did not get drink refills.  The server brought another bowl of soup, a few minutes after he had brought my dinner.  I'm in the middle of feeding Baby C and am like...Yeah...I'm no where near needing another bowl as I havent even started the one in front of me.  And I had to ask as to where my salad was and then a salad plate when he brought the salad finally out.  

I unfortunately had to leave more of a tip than I wanted to, cause it was already added to my bill - there were 15 of us in our party."}
{"text":"Chianti Braised Short Ribs!!! Second time having this for dinner, my favorite! Service was good as usual. They gotta open one of these in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Been here before for dinner and had a good experience. But this time for lunch it wasn't. It wasn't bad but, well let me explain. 

It started off good. My gf and I were greeted at the door and led to a table. They just opened for lunch so we were maybe the third party in. Our server offered some wine to try but declined, just ordered a coke for me and an ice tea for my gf. 

Drinks came out then we put in our order, my gf had the soup and salad (endless) and I had the steak and chicken skewers and soup. Shrimp for appetizer.

Appetizer came out pretty quick. After that her salad and my soup were next. Then it went downhill. I know our server was busy with a party of nine that came in after us, but it was like we were forgotten. 

My bowl was taken away but no refill for my gf's ice tea.  We waited like 30 minutes then our server came by and apologized saying they overcooked my steak and that the manager would come out and talk to us and possibly take our appetizer off the bill. Maybe five minutes later the manager came out and apologized and did remove the appetizer from our bill which was nice. Supposedly they screwed up my order but all the while my gf never got her soup!?! A total wait time of about 40 minutes then my order came out with my gf's warm (not hot) bowl of soup. She didn't want to complain just wanted to eat and get out of there. Don't blame her. She did finally get a ice tea refill! Yay! My food was okay kinda lost my appetite by then. She was never asked if she wanted to try any other soups. (endless my ass).

The manager did take care of the long wait for our food but there were more problems than that. Like I said we've been here before for dinner and left completely satisfied. Maybe this was just a fluke but I can only give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Kayleigh knocked our dinner out of the park... Never ran out of anything, she knew every answer & moved dinner along at a perfect pace.  Table #28 thinks ur a great server... Gold star :-)"}
{"text":"This is your typical Olive Garden, which is good or bad, depending on whether or not you like Olive Garden.  I happen to enjoy their food.  I ordered the Shrimp and Asparagus Risotto.  The rice was undercooked, but the overall flavor of the dish was excellent.  You probably need to go to a more traditional Italian restaurant to get good risotto (or make it yourself, which I have done a couple of times).  The Pasta E Fagioli was awesome as always."}
{"text":"It's hard not to enjoy this food.  Unfortunately, No military or senior discounts offered.  What a shame.  Waiter was extremely attentive.  Choice of foods is excellent and the noise level is acceptable so that you do not have to shout at each other.  You may have to wait for a booth if you ask but since you are the customer you should ask.  Desserts are very good and is an enjoyable way to end your meal."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 or 4 times and the service is generally a bit above average but never amazing.  Food is always good.  I most often just get salad and bread sticks if we're in for lunch but if we're in for dinner I'll get the fettuccine alfredo or the portabello ravioli, the ravioli is my favorite I absolutely love it.  My mom had the muscles which are on the featured items menu and she said they were amazing.  My husband had the featured cheese ravioli with carbonara sauce and chicken...said it was amazing! Overall I'd say this is one of the few consistently good places on the west side.

I do wish they had a vegetarian soup option, I loved the soups when I ate meat and it would be great to enjoy them again."}
{"text":"Ever since they remanaged this place . It has been great servers have good customer service and the food is pretty good. The noise level is above average . But they have no control over that really."}
{"text":"Food, bland and tasteless. Service, horrible. Decor, outdated and old fashioned. Now I know why it has been 20 years between visits!"}
{"text":"Now...this place is food Heaven!!!!! This is my favorite restaurant of all time hands down! The staff is wonderful and the food is out of this world!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food! Definitely check out the chicken Alfredo and fresh salad! It's my favorite place."}
{"text":"To end spring break, my friend and I decided to mellow down at an ambiant place besides Sambalatte - our usual hangout. Upon entering Olive Garden, we knew we made the right choice. There was an almost traditional and classy touch to the restaurant that made it very accomodating for groups small or large, families, dates and children. 

Our server was really nice. She started us off with salad and breadsticks - they came with our entrees apparently. I then ordered the Five Cheese Ziti Al Forno and by the time we were done, I was stuffed! If we had known the portions were that big, maybe we would've reconsidered sharing. Nonetheless, it was a very fulfilling experience and I highly recommend the place!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Olive garden in terms of the food and the ambiance.
The food has to be out of this world to make me wait for more than 20 minutes for a table. The food is good ..... but far from O O T W.
I have not been back for ages and likely won't be any time soon.
Build more restaurants!"}
{"text":"i went to olive garden june 14 2017 for my granddaughter shanique who graduated that afternoon.  this was my first time going there.  the food was so good  and i fell in love with the soup zuppa toscana ,that for 3 days i was sending my other granddaughter to go buy me some more. i was to give special thanks to  chef manger lamont.  the staff were very friendly and polite.  i was a very happy customer, BY ERNESTINE."}
{"text":"Stephanie is an amazing server! This has been my best Olive Garden experience ever. The restaurant was beautiful, clean, and all of the staff were extremely pleasant. The food was on point!"}
{"text":"Eh... I ordered a steak dish with cheese raviolis. It is one of their limited time menu items. The steak pieces were little medallions and they were suppose to come out medium but they were definitely well done... no pink at all. My sister had the steak skewers and hers were just as well done also ordered medium.  The salad was good as usual and service was decent."}
{"text":"Alicia was our server today and she was great. She was attentive but not overbearing and took our orders quickly with a smile.

I went there for lunch today, with my sister and mother and everything was wonderful. I ordered the Capellini di Mare and it was just right. The desserts were delicious. We got three of the little desserts in shooter glasses. The Limoncella was to die for!

I can't think of a single negative thing about our experience at the Robinson Olive Garden. 

Kudos!"}
{"text":"We need an Olive Garden in Hawaii!!! Seriously I would go once every weekend to eat!! The service, the food, the atmosphere was great!! Our waitress Katherine had the best customer service skills!! I will definitely go back my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Olive Garden because the healthy choices seem rather limited, but it's a decent place to visit on a budget for a big group.

My last experience a few days ago was incredibly lackluster. The server was very nice and I appreciate nice people who are in the service industry. You'd think that would be a given, but it's definitely not always the case. She was a very nice server and knowledgeable about the menu but she did forget a few of our requests from the table more than once. Other than that, the 2 stars are in regard to the food.

Food: Really bad. I started with the Seafood Bordetta. I like to eat healthy and that was one of the few choices from the menu (which of course was the priciest). For a whopping $18,95 (pretty pricey for Olive Garden) I was willing to pay the high price for a healthy and tasty meal. The server told me that it was the better of my two options - the other being the Lasagna Pomodora. I was so disappointed. The scallops were rubbery, the shrimp was way too chewy, and the smell of fish was incredibly pungent. After I tried a few bites, I simply couldn't take it anymore. I LOATHE sending dishes back, but for $19, I couldn't throw it away. I asked to substitute the dish with my second choice, the Lasagna Pomodora. I should've gotten that dish in the first place because it was delicious. The portion was really small for a dinner course but delicious none the less. I like my portions smaller anyway because I don't like leftovers.

Overall, this is the 2nd time at this Olive Garden that I have been disappointed with the food. The wine is overpriced and the wait for the food is too long. The good points are the servers and the manager. I wouldn't return if I had the choice."}
{"text":"Love the food here and the servers are very nice.  The bread are a little bit salty though."}
{"text":"This was the best visit I have ever had here! Our waiter, Jerod, was amazing and beyond accommodating. He served us with a smile and truly made our visit worthwhile. My entree was cooked to perfection! I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana and was blown away at the quality. I always love Olive Garden's unlimited salad and breadsticks, I mean that Italian dressing and those breadsticks make my heart so happy. I will definitely be coming back again soon!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend lives and dies for Olive Garden, and I always give in to going. I tried the tour of Italy this time, and I thought it was extremely overpriced for what I got. I will never come here again. I always leave feeling more bloated than a pregnant mule during lactation. The one thing they had going was we had a cool waitress. Otherwise, olive lobster is a complete, complete waste of money."}
{"text":"My family & I came here celebrating a birthday and if it wasn't for our server & staff I think I'd give this place 2 or stars. Being from Hawaii (where theres no olive garden) you get excited to finally try this place because of how good the place is portrayed in commercials. Actually eating here is ehhh okay. The food is to me a little overpriced for what is actually brought out. I think we enjoyed the breadsticks & salad more than our entrees. I had a herb salmon with veggies $18. What was brought out to me was an average sized salmon in oil with broccoli. It was the saddest plate ever I wish I took a picture. On the other hand our server was AMAZING. She made the visit there much better being patient with our large table & was very professional. I think this place needs a revamp to bring it back! Spice up the menu, new decor & lighting & some good music!"}
{"text":"I feel a little funny leaving a review for an Olive Garden. After all, it's a major chain and they are all pretty much the same. However, this location has provided me with some of my best experiences at an Olive Garden. The staff is always very friendly, the place is kept clean, and the service is prompt. 

About once a month we have a family dinner here. I always get either the Shrimp Alfredo or the Garlic Rosemary Chicken. After eating a ton of salad and some breadsticks I usually only can finish half of my entree. The good news is that I have leftovers and it always heats up nicely! One area of disappointment is their water and fountain drinks. They must not have a great filtration system because the water definitely doesn't taste good. The solution? Order alcohol."}
{"text":"This is the place for people who want mass quantities of food/pasta. If you want real authentic Italian food, don't go to Olive Garden. When I have to go here, I always get the minestrone and house salad because it's actually not too bad. So my husband and I were post operation looking for soup, and this was the only place left. We decided to order to go soup and salad. The salad we paid $8 for was tiny and rather pathetic. Bagged salad with a packet of croutons and dressing. I guess they are known for their dressing but it's not worth $8! When you dine in you get endless refills of a huge bowl of salad, so that was a rip off. Then our soups were $6 each, when, if you were to dine in, you get endless refills for $6. I guess thats how they try and get you to come in instead, but still, we were disappointed at the quality of food when compared to the price."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Had  the Chicken  Alfredo,  was good.  Chicken  could have been a little hotter but no other complaints"}
{"text":"Waiting for our other guests to arrive Hungry!!! Check back later to post a review of our dinning experience!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, last night we had dinner at Olive Garden and had the  Shrimp Alfredo. The dinner was fun with friends and the service was good.  Two hours later violently ill coming out at both ends. We went to a movie after dinner and was praying the movie would be over.  Either bad shrimp or Alfredo sauce that was left out. Either way, my last time going here. Next day, i still feel like someone punched me in the stomach. If you were there last night , Saturday 06-10-17 and got sick after eating the Shrimp Alfredo feel fee to post."}
{"text":"We came to this Olive Garden for the first time in a long time for lunch. We were impressed with our waitress Jessica M. She was polite, friendly, and fast. She kept checking on us and kept us informed on the status of our meals. 

The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was a great vibe. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"This particular location is lacking on good service. We waited a very very long time between bowls of our unlimited soup, salad and bread sticks. It's sad bc Olive Garden is such a staple but this location left us annoyed and hungry!"}
{"text":"Great service !! Thank you Kyle best server ever! Also thank you Olive Garden for getting us in so fast."}
{"text":"This particular Olive Garden is below par. It took 20 mins to be seated for 2 people at 3pm. There were two hostesses and two servers at the front lobby talking And goofing around while we were waiting to be seated. The food was below standard. The bread sticks were still doughy and the entrees were cold. We asked for boxes and our waitress did not bring containers for the soup and leftover bread sticks (at other OG the servers give us fresh bread and salad to go). Also at the end of our meal we had to ask for the mints instead of the usual complimentary candies that are supposed to come w the bill. I will never come back to this location ."}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty.  Service is friendly and quick.  Our family eats here about twice a month."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and the bread sticks are always warm. The servers are always fast and friendly. I know that there are so many restaurants out there but this is my go to place for pasta AND for soup & salad! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Olive Garden because my son really wanted pasta and breadsticks. We got there after 8:00 PM there was no wait. We sat down and we placed orders pretty quickly. Service was OK. Our server forgot our breadsticks and that she was looking for cheese to put on her salad but she remembered when she came back. However after our meal service was horrible. I was done eating dinner at 9:15 PM.  Our server did not come to the table after our food was dropped off. I decided to pay on the kiosk on the table. My receipt was timed for 9:24 PM.  We pushed the call server button on the kiosk, and multiple servers walked past without helping us. Finally at 9:35 PM A server came by to see if she could help us. I explained that we had been waiting for 20 minutes now for our server because we needed boxes before we left.

The unfortunate thing about the kiosk at the table for me was that when I paid I also gave her a tip. Had I have known that she would not come back and check on us after dropping off our food and would basically ignore us until we left I would not have tipped her the way I did, and would tip accordingly.

Also unfortunately I gave her a good review on the kiosk because she was ok until she dropped off the food.  After that we were ignored.  Unfortunately I never got a store receipt because my sever never came back to do a online review."}
{"text":"As far as Olive Gardens go this is one of the worst I've been to. 

I know what to expect when coming to a chain Italian restaurant but they under delivered even with my low expectations. My food arrived like it was slopped on a plate from a giant ladle, it had no seasoning, there were fingerprints all across the dish and the service seemed to ignore half of my section. I waited for my waiter far longer than it probably took to actually prepare my food. 

Really an embarrassment to Olive Gardens."}
{"text":"Went during lunch and it was pretty busy but it didn't take too long to get a seat, maybe about 15 minutes. The waitress was nice and friendly. The food came out pretty fast. Had the trio and it was so much food."}
{"text":"I'm not usually impressed with Olive Garden. I honestly don't ever actually think to myself \"I want to go to Olive Garden today\". That could be either because I don't rank Italian as one of my favorite food categories, or because Olive Garden itself just doesn't appeal to me. This one is getting my review solely because it's closest to home and where I go anytime I'm invited by one of the several people I know that love it.

Now, I've been here several times. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad it's just average. On my most recent trip I ordered the mussels app as my meal and planned to dip the endless breadsticks in the broth. They were made well and I'm sure exactly as they were meant but I just didn't like them. The tomato-based broth was too acidic for me. Their pastas are good enough - it's hard to get pasta wrong I think, especially when it's what you're known for. The seafood based dishes are never up to my standards. I'd prefer to get my seafood elsewhere. And, last but certainly not least, the dislike that will get me killed by any Olive Garden fan: I don't like the breadsticks. Nope, not in the least. They're warm and that's about it. They're too salty and too soft without that extra \"crunch\" along the outside crust. I seriously think they could improve them with a crispier crust. All of my friends may now commence beating me up! haha

For service here I've never been disappointed. They really go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy yourself and feel as if you're having a classy Italian restaurant experience. The banter with the waitstaff is always friendly and you're made to feel welcome here. Now if only they can get their flavors down to match the service quality I think they could rank up with my favorite Italian place: Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"If you've been to an Olive Garden before the food is no different at this location, and if you haven't expect mediocre Italian food and to have it be somewhat overpriced. Generally I would, give 3 stars for it being on par with what to expect, but today our service was horrible. For just one small example I sat with an empty glass for soda about 10 mins before our server came and grabbed the glass for a refill. It then took over 8 mins for him to return with it. At that point our meal was done and we had already asked for the check. Yes, things were mentioned to management on the way out. Not likely go to back again unless someone in my group really wants to."}
{"text":"For a chain, Olive Garden gets the formula right for fast service, good food, nice atmosphere, and most importantly, consistency in food quality.  I've never had to send back a meal because the pasta was under or over cooked. I'm saying this because at more pricey venues, I have had to do just that.

What I enjoy most ordering is the unlimited breadsticks, salad, and soup -- all for 10.99.  If you don't see that option on the menu, ask.  They do have it. Satisfying every time. Their flat breads are very nice, too.  Oh, and I also enjoy a glass of Reisling with my meal.  Quite nice.

As far as this particular locale, my husband and I almost always are able to dine in the bar area at either a high top or regular table even if the waiting area is packed.  The bar is first-come, first-serve and I actually enjoy dining there more than the dining room.  It's cozier and the service is just as good.

Paying is your choice -- either self-serve with a table-top credit-card taker or via the server.  

And chocolate mints.  I like that as a nice touch at the end.  But diner beware -- do NOT put them in your purse and forget they are there on a warm day... you have been warned."}
{"text":"I visited here on Dec 15th and finally have a chance to write this review. I hardly every write reviews but I couldn't let this one pass me by. I generally like Olive Garden but this location is the worst. I have visited this location on several occasions and I am always disappointed when I come here. My favorite dish is the Fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken which is such a basic dish that is usually good. Here, this dish is bland, tasteless and has little to no seasonings. IT SUCKS! When I received my food I had to request more Alfredo sauce since my food was extremely dry. My pasta was so dry that it was almost sticking together. I am a lover of their salad and bread sticks but have always been let down here. When they brought  the salad out, I had to ask for more dressing because it was as if they had literally put only 2 drops of dressing on the salad. I also had to ask for FRESH bread sticks since the first ones that the waitress brought out were very hard and dark like they had been sitting under the heating lamp for a very long time. It was just a very unpleasant meal. The only thing that I did enjoy was the fact that I was spending time with family and friends."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service could have been better. We asked for extra bread sticks many times but by the time they brought them out everyone was done with their meal. 

If that is the biggest thing I have to complain about, then it is still a good experience, but they could have been better. 4 starts."}
{"text":"We can definitely say we have experienced better after this return trip to the same Olive Garden restaurant.

Again, we were seated promptly.  However, our server wasn't so fast at arriving at our table to take the drinks.  We were beginning to wonder if we had a server.  Eventually, he did show up.  Our drinks arrived and so did the bread sticks.  Then, we had to walk to the hostess to ask if we were to use the table as plates or if we could get bread plates for the bread sticks.

Again, another long wait for the salad to appear but very little wait for the meal to arrive when we'd hardly had time for the salad.

Spaghetti was good but would be better had the meat sauce not been so sparse.  One order at the table was for the salad with unlimited soup.  The second bowl of soup was thin broth only ... no potatoes, nothing.
 What happened to the larger soup bowls too?  It's like a cup of soup served in the bottom of a bowl.

Server (Luke) was described as \"pushy\" by Grandma.  Table has a credit card reader and his explanation of it included the suggested gratuity was 20%.  There are many times a 20% (or more) tip is warranted.  This particular visit did not deserve that tip."}
{"text":"The stars are strictly on the service.   We've been to this location a several times.  The food is always good.  In the past there seems to be a few glitches with the servers.  Once I ordered hot water and instead of being brought in a cup, it was brought in a glass.  That I couldn't believe.

I'm always amazed why management doesn't stress to their servers the importance of timing a meal.  You just don't bring the appetizer, salad and main dish on top of each other. Such was the case on a recent visit.  When the entree did come, we got nothing but excuses. Training, training, training.  We weren't happy. Thus, the 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place can be described with one word .incompetent . I normally don't speak bad about restaurants unless I have to. If the manager Robin Toppin is on duty , just walk out . Not willing to help in any way shape or form. Talk about custumer service and ethics.... well those are out the door. No genuine interest in helping to accommodate in  special needs. So if you're planning a special event here and she's working... just do it in your backyard. Very unsatisfied with her managing skills . Me personally being one,  and making things happen on the fly. But to each their own ."}
{"text":"Great service from Aldo  . He was very professional with a good personality and made suggestions on anything we were thinking about trying. The food came out fast ans hot. Our server also made sure to check on us just enough so that our drinks never emptied all the way but also not to the point where he was watching over our shoulder. The  last two visits I have had great service the last two times I came here and will continue to keep coming back. Keep up the good work Aldo!!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at an Olive Garden. The waitress was rude and wasn't listening to us when we said no lemon in the water.  This isn't even the start THERE WAS A PUBIC HAIR IN THE BREAD STICKS. I was so disappointed and disgusted. I definitely don't ever want to go back. I I could have given it 0 stars believe me, I would have."}
{"text":"When I think of Italian, I have to admit that I really don't think \"Olive Garden\".  But our son wanted to go to a movie to meet some friends, and around the Northlake mall, there isn't a huge selection (there is a large selection, but most are chains) so we decided to try the new location and see how it was.  The building is awesome.  It's like a Tuscan villa.  The food is pretty standard fare.

You probably won't be disappointed, and the bill won't be too bad, but it's not going to knock your socks off either.  It left us just feeling so-so.  The baked cheese appetizer was the bet thing we had, and that left quite a bit of time for realizing just how average the rest of the meal was.  Even the desserts weren't that great.  Better to have something good than nothing, but they should finish well instead of starting well, so you're not sitting there thinking about how good the first thing was."}
{"text":"First time at this location although we have frequented Olive Garden in Southern California and in other parts of North Carolina.
Overall it was a very pleasant dining experience for our whole family. We had a wonderful server named Josh. He was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"They have good specials where for $40 you can get 4 meals.  Lasagna is very good.  Minestrone soup and all you can eat salad and bread sticks hit the spot."}
{"text":"Is it me or has chain restaurants gone way down hill the last few years?   So we order the calimari appetizer and no kidding it came out with in five minutes. So basicaly someone grabbed it from under a heat lamp.  Ordered tortelini for our 2 year old and was brought raviolli.  No biggie she eats whatever.  When the server came out and asked how everything was, we said we ordered tortelini and the server said that it wasn't on the kids menu....Ahhhhh yes it is.  Our food was lackluster to say the least.  I have never been a real fan of this place but we can now officially take it off our list YUCK."}
{"text":"I criticize chain restaurants like this all the time, but maybe I shouldn't. When you aren't in the mood to trek around and find something super unique,  sometimes places like the Olive Garden can really hit the spot. Let's admit it, the food is consistent and delicious, and the they're always piping in good, jazzy, classic music like Sinatra or Bennett or whatever.

The Zuppa Toscana is a creamy soup with potatoes, sausage, onion, kale, and other stuff. This is a perfect soup! For the entree I had the Stuffed Chicken Marsala, which is stuffed with cheese and mushrooms, served with garlic mashed potatoes...delicious. 

With dinner I enjoyed a 9 oz mini carafe of the Francis Coppola Diamond Cabernet, which was just so-so. 

Service was friendly, food was pleasing, price was easy. What more do you want heh? About $30 for myself."}
{"text":"We dined for lunch at the Olive Garden restaurant off Germann Road. ordered as soup and salad combo. I asked for the chicken and gnocchi soup. I asked for no gnocchi in my soup and the server did that right. However, we didn't get our drinks till half way through our meal which I was pretty thirsty. Otherwise, our meal was as usual. Our server was nice and smiled a lot but we had to ask other servers to bring our water. I wouldn't write home about it."}
{"text":"Last time after I visited OG, I promised myself I will never go back to a chain Italian joint.....the food was ok, i guess, but it always tastes better in a family-run restaurant.
The stuffed mushrooms seemed ok, but nothing to rave about. I would give 4 stars to the entrees but the tiramisu was below average.
The service was reasonably efficient, but impersonal and hurried...as if the waitress was keen to get us out!
All in all, decent lunch-time place but that's it!"}
{"text":"There is usually a wait but not too bad. Parking can be a pain since it shares a lot with Red Lobster. Zuppa Toscana is my favorite soup there. You can't go wrong when ordering the chicken scampi or seafood Alfredo. Their stuffed mushrooms is so delicious. Their secret is the tiny pieces of clam in it. Calamari is excellent especially with the Parmesan peppercorn sauce."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain italian restaurants but my friend wanted to come here for her birthday. We got sat at a larger table in the middle of the dining area. We waited a good bit before we were even greeted. A girl told us she would be right with us. A few minutes still passed by and she never came around. We all ended up talking and catching up and heard a big boom on the table. We turned and saw that she had a tray in her hand and place a wine bottle on the table and walked off. She came back and greeted us. She was nice but service was slow. 

I ordered the sampler appetizer because I wasn't that hungry. I got the mushrooms, calamari and toasted meat ravioli. Ravioli and mushrooms were pretty good. I was NOT pleased with the calamari if that's what you call it!! It was NOTHING but breading. It honestly looked like I ordered popcorn shrimp. My friend asked for a piece and she tried one and spit it out and said there wasn't even any calamari in there. I wasn't expecting it to be perfect but I did calamari and not breading. Gross. 

The server told my friend she can have whatever she wanted on the dessert menu since it was her birthday. She picked the tiramisu. Server later came back and said the tiramisu was FROZEN! My friend wanted to get the cheesecake and the server also told her that it was frozen too! That is ridiculous! She finally got the chocolate lasagna. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Our server JD was absolutely awesome!  He was efficient, friendly, and attentive.  It's been some time since we've been to Olive Garden.  The menu hadn't changed in many years and was no longer exciting.  We were happy to see a few new items along with old standard favorites.  This location previously had some service issues but based on tonight's experience, I guess they've corrected that."}
{"text":"We had a pretty good experience tonight at This Olive Garden.  It started their trying to squeeze our party of five into a table of four but when we said it wouldn't work they immediately remedied it.  Our server was a bit unorganized...or flustered...or something, but he was friendly and definitely trying.  The food was good and came to the table hot.  Paying with the little table device is quite convenient as well."}
{"text":"We had a very nice experience at this Olive Garden.  Our server Diandra was very good - she was prompt, pleasant, helpful, and accurate, which we very much appreciate in a server.  Our food was good and came out promptly.  The only issue I had was with the hostess station.  The restaurant was relatively empty but we needed to wait 10 minutes for a table.  There were three of them at the hostess station and at one point needed a fourth to come over to explain something to them. Honestly I think they just didn't know what they were doing.  But they were friendly enough so it wasn't a big impact on our night."}
{"text":"We went on a Satuday night, busy but not too bad.  Good service and really good food.  They even catered to my picky childs request, sauce on the side and no cheese.  Until recently I wasn't a fan of Olive Garden and couldn't understand why it was so busy.  Years ago I had tried it and wasn't impressed.  Decided to give it a chance and have now gone twice in the last month.  Breadsticks and salad and then some good pasta, can't complain about that.  Plus the reasonable prices put it back on my list of places to go."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE FOOD. Last night  2/4/17 approximately 9:00pm me and wifey decided we wanted some soup and salad. When I entered the restaurant there were four people at the front desk one of which was on the phone. I stood there for at least a minute and a half and not one of the other staff asked me can I help you. Once the lady got off the phone she immediately asked me can I help you as the other staff continued to talk amongst themselves. I told her a table for two and she told me it will be about a half hour wait and gave me a buzzer. I took the buzzer and went outside and told the wife it will be a half hour wait but I didn't like how I was left unattended and I don't want to stay because of it. I took the buzzer back inside and informed the lady who gave it to me that we changed our mind and we ended up going somewhere else too eat. Service was on the back burner this night and Olive Garden lost our business. Fortunately not forever but this night, yes."}
{"text":"I'm giving this Olive Garden 5 stars mainly because of the server we had. Matt did a superb job at making sure we had a pleasant meal. I also was amazed at the fact that the parking lot was jam packed and yet we only had to wait 5-10 min to be seated. So ask for Matt when you go for dinner."}
{"text":"During lunch, their famous Unlimited Soup, Salad, and Breadsticks is only $7.99. They've added a new promotion called Tuscan Trio Combination that invites you to add Salad Toppers (Antipasti Italian Meats and Cheeses or Roasted Tomato Caprese), Pasta Sides (Spaghetti with Meat Sauce, Fettuccine Alfredo, or Ziti with Five Cheese Marinara), or Tastes of Italy Small Plates (Chicken Meatballs, Tuscan White Bean Hummus, Crispy Risotto Bites, or Parmesan Roasted Asparagus). All selections are just $3.99. Even at $11.98, the lunch is a great value.

I've been to this location at least once or twice, but it's been at least four years since my last visit. I'm not a big fan of their restaurants, so I usually stay away. My mom has been talking about coming to fulfill her unlimited soup and salad craving, so we visited for lunch today. We both opted for unlimited salad and soup and a side of Spaghetti with Meat Sauce from the new Tuscan Trio promotion.

The salad is nothing grand; a mixture of (mostly) Iceburg and Romaine, red onion, tomato, whole black olives, peppercini, and seasoned croutons. They are extremely sparse on everything except Iceburg lettuce. There was literally two olives, two small slices of tomato, and six small rings/layers of onion in the first bowl of salad. For our second bowl, I requested no olives and extra tomatoes and thankfully, they were much more generous with the tomatoes and onions. I'm not crazy about their dressing, but it's manageable when we ask for it on the side.

We both chose the Zuppa Toscana for our soup because we've always enjoyed it. It's a creamy broth filled with spicy sausage, russet potatoes, and fresh kale and it's always delicious. As much as I don't care for Olive Garden, this soup is really great (especially with freshly shaved parmesan and black pepper). My only complaint is its consistency and sometimes lack of kale. We had a couple bowls and each bowl was different. Some had too much sausage, some had too many potatoes (making it starchier), and it always had too little kale (we love kale).

The Spaghetti with Meat Sauce was also nothing special. I don't have a preference for their sauce and overall flavor. The noodles were nicely cooked. Silly portion for four dollars. I would say skip the Tuscan Trio combination. Oh, and the breadsticks? Meh. Not worth the carbs or the calories.

Service was mostly great. After placing our orders, I realized that it may be advantageous to share a Spaghetti with Meat Sauce entrée rather than ordering two sides, so I decided to ask our server. All we asked was the size and price of the entrée portion and his response was bizarre. This was his side of the conversation: \"Oh, but if you order the spaghetti, then it costs more to add on the soup or salad ... I don't know, I guess It's about $10 ... No, I had someone else order the entrée and when they split it, they basically gave them two sides, so you're getting the better deal ... Oh, the one over there is our dinner portion .. It's like 13-14 dollars ... You'll get the salad with the entrée, but it'll cost you like $4 to add the soup ... But, you can do whatever you want ... I'm not being lazy, I just don't want my customers spending more money because we're already charging you enough.\" UHH, WHAT? My mom was becoming annoyed, so she said, \"Nevermind,\" and dismissed him. We just wanted to know what our options were and every time we tried to ask a question, it was met with a rebuttal of why the Tuscan Trio Combination was better (without actually making that statement). I had to reiterate more than once that we each wanted to order the Unlimited Soup and Salad AND a Spaghetti entrée to share. My mom felt duped and I also felt that there must have been a reason that he was so adamant about keeping the Tuscan Trio order.

Anyway, I still enjoyed my meal, but my return is unlikely. It would have been a two-star rating had it not been for the yummy soup. I love my salads and this one is definitely not worthwhile. Also, this isn't the first time that I've had really strange service at an Olive Garden franchise."}
{"text":"this place was amazing went here with my friend and it was the first time we went here the food was so delicious and we barely waited for our food we got there around 7pm at night and probably the best pasta and salad and bread sticks we had the lasagna appetizer was delicious our waitress told us it was her favorite and it was delicious i will definitely be coming back here again best food i have had in a restaurant hands down."}
{"text":"We came in at peak traffic time and we were a party of 7. We are POLYNESIANS and was put in a space that blocked off the entrance (almost completely ) to the table seated behind us. Here goes:

SERVICE:
Even though we waited almost 10-15 mins for our server to come and say \"Hi\" or even just offer us water: well I was observing and noticed it was really busy and in the middle of finishing up renovations. I'd like to think she tried her best(our server was Yani). Manager even came to check on us and apologize. It was  really busy. Just wish she came to check on our drinks more often if we needed refills. 

FOOD:
Everyone loved their food and said it was delicious. Bread  was fresh out of the oven, salad was fresh and soup was delicious (chicken noodle and sausage ). My only problem was the angel hair pasta in my spaghetti meatballs and Italian sausage was over cooked and chopped to pieces (the pasta was all small pieces ). Couple ordered chicken and shrimp fettuccine pasta and chicken parmigiana and couple other ic ant remember and they all thoroughly enjoyed their food. The Manager came and told us to please order desserts that would be on the house and that plus my party enjoying their meals gave them a 4 star rating. 

We left a very generous tip to show that we appreciate Manager and server accommodating us and just being classy."}
{"text":"My son ate there last night, dined on Fettuccine Alfredo, and has been up since 5:00 am throwing up...reporting this...cannot even get out of bed...trip to the ER...you people need to check your temperatures, and how long this is sitting out...your getting the bill, and not ever dining at your establishment again..."}
{"text":"Ok service was absolutely FANTASTIC, Kella our server was a sweetheart, food hot, served just as we were finishing our soup or salad. Never ran out of drinks she stayed upon everything. If you are ever in this restaurant request her"}
{"text":"I love the minestrone soup and salad, what makes it even better is you can eat as much as you want without getting charged! Plus, they don't ever mind about giving you a different soup after finishing your first bowl. It lost one star because I don't like anything else from Olive Garden..."}
{"text":"My mother, little sister & I ate here & our service was excellent & our food was nice & hot! Kinda nice to find an Olive Garden that still has some hustle."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Olive Garden in awhile and now I remember why. The food is more of an Americanized Italian food. 

Well the place was half empty when we arrived but still had to sit around for about 10-15 mins to get a table. One of the staff was having an issue when I decided to grab a coloring book a crayon to entertain myself during the wait. When we sat down they took their time giving us bread sticks and even longer to get this dip that a friend wanted. 

When we ordered our food, they ended up mixing a few of our orders together instead of just asking who ordered what. When the bill came the change took forever without coming back to explain that they had trouble making change."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed with the breadsticks and salad today the salad was watery they didn't dry it off our server was phenomenal"}
{"text":"When seated the table was not clean. It took us asking 5 times for utensils. We were sat all the way in the corner so we didn't get much attention from the waiter"}
{"text":"For them jus opening up I expect for them to be busy. I didn't have to wait to long. But the thing that disappointed me was that cut back on the plate size. I figured that they probably was doing that cause maybe they had limited supply and  wanted to make sure they were able to feed everybody. I don't know, but that kinda disappointed me. Cause I been 2 several locations and this is the first. Overall the food was still great, but i just hope they go back to their regular portion sizes. Like getting a bowl of Gnocci soup with no chicken or dumplings lol Really!"}
{"text":"We love Olive Garden! I don't know the last time I went to an Olive Garden, but it doesn't matter because it did not disappoint. 
We were greeted by our server Cisco in a timely manner and he was wonderful.
We ordered a boat of Alfredo to go with our breadsticks (you must do this) but when we got the breadsticks, they weren't that fresh. We did go at 10pm on a Friday, but it was decently full when we walked in... I just thought they would have been better. Anyway, not a big deal.
We ordered the fresh salad which is my favorite and add extra peppers! 
After the salad and breadsticks were through, we ordered ANOTHER boat of Alfredo (I know, but it was our cheat meal) and extra breadsticks. These breadsticks were cooked to perfection. And I mean, like soft and salty and buttery and perfectly dipped with a white cream sauce.

I then ordered the steak Gorgonzola Alfredo... Omg how this dish hits the spot every time! It's been years since I've had it and it's still perfect. My dinner date ordered the tour of Italy, which is if course, another classic and was perfectly cooked. I had to try some of his chicken Parmesan ! I love OG and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I feel that I come to chains for the consistency. However, this location did not provide the type of service or quality that we usually enjoy from Olive Garden. We got on the wait list 45 minutes before we came to the restaurant. When we arrived the hostess told us that even though we are on the waitlist, we would have to be put in line like any other walk in. I realize being on the waitlist doesn't mean you skip the line, but she made it sound like we shouldn't have even tried, like there was no point to being on the waitlist because we would have to wait just as if we walked in without it. We sat at the bar. I have to say, I had never gotten a cocktail at Olive Garden before and the Watermelon Margarita was amazing. It tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher. The bartender was very kind and we enjoyed her serving us. We waited 45 minutes to be seated. When we were seated we waiting 15 minutes before someone came to our table. The resturaunt was very slow at this point, so that seemed unneccessary. We ordered drinks and had to wait 10 minutes to get our drinks. We waited another 10 before she took our order even though we tried to order when we sat down. Then we finally got our salad. Twenty minutes after that we got our food. We ordered never ending pasta but were never able to order a second round because she didnt come back to the table and at that point, we had just been there for way too long. I really hope the service gets better at this location!"}
{"text":"My family and another family dined here last Thursday night to celebrate my birthday. We called ahead and said there would be 9 of us. We were seated and the table was not large enough to seat everyone. They could have easily added another small table to make it more comfortable, but they did not. It was very cramped and difficult to have a conversation because it was so loud. I have always loved, loved OG.  This time, the food was not great. I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan and it did not taste good. The batter on the eggplant seemed dough-y and uncooked. It really ruined my appetite and I ended up tossing it, which I have NEVER had to do. The server was mostly attentive though. It may be awhile before i try OG again."}
{"text":"We went there as a family and we enjoyed the service, the food, and the ambience!
Well done!! I would recommend this place for sure!!"}
{"text":"I'm still going to give 4 stars even though I found a hair in my food. We came in around 4pm on Friday the 26th of May. We were also the ones that left behind a little boys pink iPhone (it's grandmas old one and likes to look at the pictures) our server was very nice our refills were always there, salad and breadsticks were always refilled promptly when we were asked. The food did not take that long. I guess keeping a 2 year old from tearing up the table past the time. I did find a hair in my food. The server quickly apologized and had a new entree started. That I took to go ( I knew I was going to have to wait a little bit, plus I was full from salad and breadsticks) I had the seafood manicotti. The manager also came over to apologize and made the entree gratis. Our server was a stockier Caucasian gentleman with spiky dark hair and the manager was a slender blond with a pony tail and a red sweater. They both handled the situation perfectly. I was very satisfied at the customer service in this place. I also know that front of house catches crap for back of houses mistakes. Very happy with customer service. That's why they get 4 stars even with a hair in my food. I took the new entree home and ate it. The seafood manicotti was delicious. And there was a lot of seafood on it. And the manicotti is huge. I don't expect a 3 Michelin star dining experience because it's not. It's a neighborhood family friendly Italian place. It's casual dining. I am pleased with my dining experience."}
{"text":"No.   Just No. My son and I went out to lunch with friends today. We ended up at this Olive Garden.  I had recently done a Yelp Event where I had the opportunity to try their new menu items.  I was really impressed. I was expecting a good experience. Instead what I got was 1) stale breadsticks 2) wedding soup that was a yellow tasteless broth with a chopped up spinach leaf, 3 meatballs, and some firm pasta shells that was served room temperature  3) the Northern Tour of Italy that was also served room temperature. And the chicken Parm wasn't golden brown and crispy but gray and so gross that both bites that I took ended up in my napkin because it was cold, nasty and all gristle. I ate my tortellini and took the mushroom pasta home. It was just a really bad experience. 
The only reason I am giving one star is that the server, Raven, was excellent."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped in for dinner. We only waited about 10 minutes for a table. Our waitress was extremely nice. She was one of the best wait staff that we've had in awhile. (Sorry that I can't remember her name ). I ordered the Tour of Italy where you choose your 3 items. I chose the Crab Ravioli with Lobster sauce, spaghetti with meat sauce, and another Alfredo sauce type pasta. We were already enjoying our salad and breadsticks when our meal came. Two of the 3 pastas were excellent. I was bummed about the crab ravioli because it was very salty. I can be sensitive to salt so I had my husband try it. He thought it was too salty also. 
I'm glad we decided to try this Olive Garden. They can be hit or miss with there food. This one was a hit."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I was picking up 2 orders. However, I forgot to submit my own order. Megan displayed incredible customer service. Even promptly assisted me when I realized I messed up my second order. Even if the food was garbage, which it was not, Megan earned the store 5 stars. Very kind, attentive, not overdoing it. Her happiness to assist me felt very genuine. Thank you Megan! Great customer service still exists."}
{"text":"I love olive garden... The server Damara was fantastic!!!! She treated my daughter to a desert because it was her first time, I thought that was special. The food was fresh and it came out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch on a very hot afternoon today. You can always count on.
Olive Garden for great basic food. I have learned it is the server who keeps
You coming back and Miss Taylor did not create a single regret with us. Taylor brought her A game with her to work today! She made a pretty ordinary lunch into an extraordinary one today. Thank you Taylor for giving us
Your best !!! We will be back and yes we will ask for you! In fact we Recommend every ask for you too!!!!"}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden that much is true but this location has an issue with their staff, I almost want to send an email to Food Network and have them come in and do an episode of Restaurant Stakeout. 

Pretty much everything that happens on that show, happens in this location. Sitting at the bar I can clearly hear some sort of an altercation in the kitchen, loud enough that it got everyone's attention. Although it might have been some staff involved in horseplay, the management appeared absent or unwilling to look into it. 

Shortly thereafter the bar became a hangout for the waitstaff and even some members of the kitchen staff, mundane stuff talked about but none the less very unprofessional. 

Again, the food is what you expect, don't expect much from the help."}
{"text":"-Consistant food.

-Good service.

-Not too long of a wait.

-Parking was convenient.

-Updated decor.

-Area is questionable."}
{"text":"Serve great! The witress really enjoyed her job and kept my brother and I entertained throughout the entire afternoon. She had a smile on her face the entire time. Although the 2nd helping of bread sticks was hard, the rest of the dinner was amazing. We both had different Create your own Tour of  Dish! Great time spent."}
{"text":"After reading these reviews, I'm SO happy we got an awesome server. Eric was on it and friendly from the start. Didnt hesitate to start a conversation but wasnt trying too hard to impress us. He had good recommendations and we ended up only paying $80(without tip) for 3 people. Idk if this is cheap for Vegas but that's definitely cheap for where i live, in hawaii. My bf got the trout dish which was AMAZING. My friend and i shared the 2 for $25 deal which is a serious steal! You save between $10-20 at least. Totally overdid it with the second salad though we could barely eat our entrees lol. Eric brought and packed most of our stuff for us. Its nice to see people who actually enjoy their job.

We left him 25% tip without thinking twice. Eric, THANK YOU for ending our vacation wonderfully! Hold on to him OG!!!! Will be back next year!"}
{"text":"It is amazing how this restaurant always has long wait times when I honesty don't believe that the food is great. I have gone a couple of times and each time that I have gone I have gotten different dishes. I feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something. You can definitely find better chain Italian restaurants like Maggiano's or Bravo! Come here if you like bland dishes."}
{"text":"Those new Olive Garden commercials wheeled me in. Stopped in for lunch about 130pm. It was pretty busy, I suppose because it is near all the shopping and the stores were busy as well. Our waiter seemed to be off his game. He was dropping things, mixed up an order (that he was able to correct before it came out) he seemed nervous. He was a sweetheart though but I felt awkward. Lunch was good. The salad never disappoints."}
{"text":"Dinner was hot and delicious and pretty quick for a busy Friday. The waiter was on his game. I had a great experience."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden hands down is the worst. If u ask a server for something they completely forget from a couple of min. From you telling them. Asked for a man. Total incompetent! Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Party of 3 adults and 1 child
Billy was our server and he was great. Very friendly and attentive. He offered wine tasting and made helpful suggestions for entreés. Two of us wanted the endless soup and salad. Always online point! 
The Zuppa Toscana is divine!! So tasty, and let me suggest a squeeze of lemon in the soup.
May seem out of the ordinary but it only added to the already delicious flavor it has! 
We tried the appetizer pizza Fritta something or other, wasn't the best thing I've tasted and the portion for the price didn't seem that great either. 
We ordered the Italian Margarita which was delicious with the amaretto shot!!"}
{"text":"Heavy sauces, bland dishes and so-so service.  I really wouldn't call Olive Garden an Italian Restaurant, its a chain that serves Americanized  dishes loosely based on recipes that might have an Italian ingredient or two in them.

The soup was cold, our food was served lukewarm and the service was slow.

I suppose if you only ordered the salad and bread-sticks it might be worth going to.  It's sad because the menu items sound good but they are just so poorly executed it's just not worth wasting your time here."}
{"text":"I've always loved Olive Garden, but this visit was not quite up to par, salad was great as usual, but I had new chicken dish that was offered for limited time and must say that the chicken was not the usual. Maybe they have changed the chicken, but it was not flavored well and was kinda hard to cut. I guess next time it will be the usual pasta, and never fail salad and breadsticks I will say when you go here go at an off time, otherwise you have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to eat at this location tonight. We came with our party of 9 and were told that it would be a 1-2 hour wait??? Which I could understand if there had been more then 4 people in the waiting area. I even ask what if we split up our table. The hostess then says she can't even sit us close together?? Like she wouldn't  even try! Have they never heard of pushing some tables together. Frustrated I called the next closest location and fortunately the Westgate location only had a 20 minute wait time for a party our size.  We drive right over. We waited even less then that, had wonderful service there.
Thank you Westgate you have earned our patronage from here on out. Arrowhead has lost it."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is one of my favorite places for lunch; it's unfortunate that I'm not able to dine here often on weekdays due to it being far from my work.  Whenever I am able to eat here, though, I always get the same thing:

Soup, Salad & Breadsticks
(Unlimited refills!)
Our garden-fresh salad, choice of homemade soup and warm garlic breadsticks.
Available until 4 p.m. daily at this special price.
7.95

And for my soup I always get:

Chicken & Gnocchi
A creamy soup made with roasted chicken, traditional Italian dumplings and spinach.

This pairing makes my tummy very happy.  The salad always seems fresh and crisp, and I'm in love with their tomatoes.  The breadsticks are delicious and CONSISTENT!  I always know what to expect.  And lastly, the chicken and gnocchi soup is light for your stomach but full of flavor.  I can't just have one bowl of soup!  Two is plenty, and three bowls, well, I'll be falling asleep at my desk back at the office!  And to finish off your meal, your check is brought to you with a tasty Andes mint.  Now maybe it's due to the fact that my order is always pretty simple, but I've never had bad service here.  Servers are top notch and keep my soup bowl replenished and my drinks full.  Four stars easily for lunch."}
{"text":"I can tolerate the Olive Garden, but what I found is that in a lot of the chains that are particularly in Las Vegas is that the level of quality that I expect coming from the Olive Garden (as low as it is) isn't kept up.

I'll admit that we were a large group and the manager came out to apologize before we complained that there was a backlog in the kitchen and that was the reason it took so long. But there was also an issue with the level of heat on our dishes. They weren't hot and out waiter assured us that the food came out hot.

The Minestrone (other than the heat factors) just didn't taste right and didn't sit well with me and by the time we got our mains I was just thinking to myself \"why?\".

We also got conflicting responses to what we would and wouldn't be charged if we made substitutions or additions to our meal which was upsetting.

I think I'll skip this location next time..."}
{"text":"The food was very good,fresh and hott.best part was the service.our waiter max was very attentive but not over bearing.he made sure our food was brought out together so our family of six was eating together.kept an eye on our drinks.this was by far the best service I've experienced in some time.once again,this dude Max was on point and I would recommend this location based off of the very great and pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many many times and I always get great service!!! Also I LOVE their deals such as 2 for $20 or appetizer meal and a dessert for ONLY $13!!!!"}
{"text":"Marisol, the server was excellent, kind with my 4 years old and so knowledgeable. 5 stars for Marisol and for another server who was smiling at all times, excellent customer service, I don't remember his name, tall, skinny Afro hair. I love the Gnocchi soup.
Only reason no 5 stars : The food took forever."}
{"text":"Server was over sat by the host staff, had to ask for a manager to get our first course of soup and salad after 35 minutes. I had it time stamped on my phone. After that the GM Lin took good care of us. Worst part is the serving staff complained about my girlfriend and I to fellow servers I know. What a terrible staff, to complain about tip when they are not actually doing the job they are there to do. I have ran restaurants, designed menus and worked my way up through food running, hosting, bussing, bar tending and serving. I know this industry very well, and it's hard to say something good about a staff when I can visually see them lolly gagging in the server area and not serving their clients. Food was great as normal, Zuppa Tuscana is always good! Lin you were awesome!"}
{"text":"Description of Beef and Gnocchi from menu:  
Twice braised beef in a Chianti red wine sauce served over light ricotta gnocchi in a creamy carbonara sauce. 

Our party of four was thinking of going to another small Italian restaurant for dinner on Saturday night but not seeing what we wanted on their menu we decided to go to Olive Garden... for a sure bet. Three of us ordered the braised beef with gnocchi $18...the beef was tender and flavorful and the gnocchi was melt on your mouth! I highly recommend this delicious dinner. With the salad, breadsticks, and a nice glass of wine it was great.

ps no wait at 915pm."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my pops, who was fiending for their $6.95 soup/salad/breadsticks extravaganza. He is a huge fan of this deal, but unfortunately did NOT receive it, since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, and they only offer their lunch specials on WEEKDAYS.

Another slight issue I had was the fact that the waiter messed up my order, but the manager gladly replaced it free-of-charge for me, and gave me her humble apologies. Once I received the dish I ordered - beef medallions over fettuccine alfredo - it was actually pretty tasty. It featured green onions, chives, sauteed spinach, and tasted pretty fresh, discounting the strong vinaigrette coating on the steak. My dad would have given this place four stars, but I am not my dad!"}
{"text":"Usually have quick service when Im here. There is usually no wait time or its minimal. There is a lot of seating here so they can handle some of the busiest days. The food is always good. Pretty much what you would expect from an Olive Garden."}
{"text":"If you're a marathoner or if it's your first marathon, you know by now that it's marathon tradition to eat a pasta dinner before the big race.

I wanted to find a decent Italian restaurant on the strip or hit a buffet, but my friend was hell bent on finding an Old Spaghetti Factory somewhere in Nevada.  Whip out the trusty iPhone and there's supposedly a restaurant 8 miles away in Henderson and she's willing to drive us there. We go to the supposed location and it doesn't exist, go to a nearby mall and discover there's no such thing as an Old Spaghetti Factory in Nevada so what do we do?  And what's the next best option?  Olive Garden.

It's convenient.  It's close and it'll be too late to get dinner and go to bed at a reasonable hour if we try to eat on the strip.  I shudder at the thought of it but agree.  I'm staying a few extra nights so I can make up for it later.  

The redeeming qualities about this experience are the quick and friendly staff, virtually no wait time since we're out in the middle of nowhere, and a complementary tasting of the Moscato Castello del Poggio.  This was a light effervescent white wine with hints of peach.  Very refreshing and sweet and possibly a new favorite.  

Our meals were average and sub par.  My bellini peach iced tea was too sweet and the mushroom ravioli was dry and overcooked and hard to chew.  The bread and pasta weren't bad but I still would have preferred to go elsewhere.  Olive Garden is a little too pricey for the food they serve and next year, we'll be finding something on the strip."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:30PM on a Thursday, was pretty busy so we got stuck at a table by the kitchen (and two screaming kids).  Why is there even a table there?  

Waitress was nice and attentive.  I was surprised at the quality of service considering my previous Olive Garden experiences.  

I have a weakness for their salads, I can't deny the onions, sweet peppers and croutons.  Tie me up and take aware my epicurean card, but I will never deny the salad.  

Drinks are syrupy sweet and overpriced, so no recommendation there.  This visit I had the Tour of Italy which is fettuccine alfredo, chicken parmigiana and meat lasagna.  Fettuccine was tv-dinner quality, Chicken was overbreaded, overseasoned and dry, Lasagna was actually good, I'd eat another plate for sure.  

Super fatty and delicious desserts.  

Best part of Olive Garden is people watching.  Hilarious high school first dates and a healthy mix of beer-bellied family gatherings.  Extra prize if you can spot someone who just exudes \"I'm too good for this place\"."}
{"text":"No one was friendly walking in. Someone got seated after us but they had their food before we received water. The waitress did not check on us during our meal. We had to tell the busboy to get our server 2 times. I had a simple soup and salad which took 30 mins to bring out. Then she never brought us our check. When we asked for it the check took another 10 mins. It was terrible service I don't understand how someone can serve a table like that. I know this is not fine dining but McDonalds has better service that. Come on Olive Garden seriously? Maybe she had a bad day but don't take it out on customers. I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I advise against taking out at this Olive Garden. The customer service is not good and they take a very long time to get you your order. 
I ordered on my way from work a meal for my yesterday. I arrive 40 minutes after placing the order and no one, not even a host, was at the front desk. There were other people waiting as well for someone to greet them or take their order. 
We waited for about 6 minutes until one of the other customers went in the kitchen, where most of the employees were talking and eating at the time, to request service. Then three gentlemen came out to take care of us. 
One of the gentlemen told me my order was ready and went to the back to get it. 10 minutes later...he had not returned. I'm utterly confused because now it's been over 55minutes since I placed my order and it took long for him to return with my food. 
I left out because I was disgusted with the customer service. Before completely pulling off a worker came to my car and said my food was ready. Of course I expressed my disappointment in their service and told him I would not be paying so unless I'm getting the food free I do not want it. He said he would ask his manager when he went back inside. I pulled off after 5 minutes of waiting and went to chic fil a across the street because they have impeccable customer service. 
Do NOT go to this restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii, so of course we're doing an Olive Garden dinner at least once during the trip.  I love pasta, and I love garlic bread. I am a fettuccini alfredo eater to be exact. If it's on the menu, thats what I'm getting. Always satisfied :]

After going to the Vegas one, I decided to give Olive Garden 4 stars. Majority of the servers there seemed a bit on the older side. Ours seemed like she was maybe early 60's? She was nice, but a bit slow. It took a while to get our drinks, and take our order. So it seemed like FOREVER to get our food. My bf got the braised shortribs. I can honestly say, I've never once had a bad braised shortribs. But this one was pretty terrible. When we were ordering, our server said it was a \"good choice\" because they were going to take it off the menu. But it tasted awful... no wonder they were taking it off the menu! I cant quite put my finger on it but it had a very odd taste.

Aside from that, the endless breadsticks, a yummy salad, delicious fettuccini, and refreshing peach iced tea were a win."}
{"text":"Since I had a gift card, I decided to have Olive Garden for dinner. I ordered online the 3 Course Alfredo meal consisting of: Salad, Grilled Chicken W/ Roasted Garlic Alfredo, and the strawberry whatever that is they call dessert. Strike 1 the brown ass breadsticks that tasted burnt. Those were the worse breadsticks I've ever had from OG. It's like the cook said \"Hey, let me put these 2-3 min cooked too long ass breadsticks in this to go order instead of the damn trash\". Strike 2 the dry ass chicken alfredo... How is it that all the sauce soaked into the noodles by the time I got home? Like...whet? Strike 3 the little black strand of hair in the dry ass chicken alfredo. I knew I should've ordered from the OG by my job in Tempe instead of this one. Maybe they would've been better. Will never order from this one again. Better yet, Carrabas (sp?) might be taking Olive Garden's place. In regards to where the food ended up...Today's trash day sooooo yea."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had to ask for water 4 times. Finally got it at the end of the meal. Almost had to give my first born for bread sticks. Seriously worst service I have ever had."}
{"text":"I had lunch with my mom and co workers. My mom and I ordered soup and salad. I found a long back hair full of chunks  in my soup. My mom woke up, in the middle of the night with food poisoning."}
{"text":"I am not a big pasta eater. Actually, it was my first time going to Olive Garden ever. I only went because I had a gift card. 
Anyways, I went with my brother on New Years because my parents were out (yes, they're more popular than I am). We ordered a flat bread thing as an appetizer and I ordered some pasta thing and my brother got ravioli. Because I ordered an adult meal, we got unlimited bread sticks and salad. That was nice. The food was also good. 

The service was really really good. The server was so kind, friendly and funny. If I crave Italian food, I'll come back."}
{"text":"Our favorite location. If you are lucky enough to get Sarah C. as your waitress, she is amazing! Fun, energetic, attentive, and cute as can be. Always a pleasure, to dine here with my boys."}
{"text":"It was an hour from start to finish.  

Let me say this. I can't be a stripper so I am not a stripper.  Our waitress is clueless when it comes to being a waitress and needs to find a new career. 

Slowest service. I would recommend heading down 95 and going to a different location.  

Worst OG EVER."}
{"text":"Love the pasta e fagoil (sp?) I normally order the chicken alfredo, i love it fresh, not the best when reheating. This area serves more on your plate compared to the one on Maryland and Flamingo, that one reminds you that we are in a recession. Either than that, the staff has been pretty good and checking up on us. They do have a wait at times, and their estimates on waiting are pretty spot on."}
{"text":"Sadly, I can't give this place a higher rating despite the good service. Two stars for the service.

The food... Oh the food... Mind you, I've been to numerous olive gardens in my lifetime so I feel this review is justified. 

We went at approx 530pm on a weeknight.
It wasn't very busy and we were seated quickly. We got the chicken parm, build your own pasta and a fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp for the kiddo.
The soup, salad and breadsticks were standard you get at any Olive Garden. Never disappoints.

However. However. The main dishes... All three dishes were pretty much inedible. The pasta was shriveled and dried up like it has been sitting under the heat lamp. The sauce was horribly thick and salty like it had been condensed. My kids who pretty much eat anything were not having any of it which is a good measure of how good/bad the meal is. 

The food was a bust in my opinion. I looked at the other patrons meals and couldn't quite tell if they were enjoying theirs. Oh well, it could've just been our table I can't say. I definitely won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Last weekend my wife, 14 month-old son, and I had soup, salad, and breadsticks lunch.  We were seated in the family area but got great service.  The server even brought unoiled breadsticks for my baby son to eat.  She took such great care of us and baby.  Thanks Olive Garden.  You made us feel like family."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Olive Garden mainly because of the Ivan and his twin brother. The food is exceptionally better than the other locations I have dined at, but that may also be influenced by good customer service. 

Another benefit of this location is that it is right next door to my favorite theater. This convenient location also makes it a very busy one.

Forgive me for not remembering your name Ivan's twin brother, but you make great cocktails and I appreciate the pride you take in them. I'll be sure to catch your name on my next visit because I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Olive Garden in over 10 years but I was impressed with the food and waiter we had. The food was perfect and service was spot on. Our waiter Hunter was very friendly. A++"}
{"text":"This place is great for informal and formal. Great service and great food. Managers do rounds every few to check on everyone. It was much appreciated."}
{"text":"So I absolutely LOVE the Olive Garden! I love coming here when I want to get sick from eating too much lol. Well this time I came with a few friends and we left pretty unsure of our experience. We've been to this location many times before and have always left happy but this time it was a bit of a mess. The place was extremely packed which is normal but has never kept the service from being bad. This time I think we got the bad end of the stick though. We ordered our food and waited...waited... waited... Not only were we waiting for our food we were still waiting for our drinks which is strange. Drinks always come out before the food. Anyway. When out waiter came he brought us cold soup and breadsticks, the salad looked fine. I don't eat lettuce so I can't tell you..

Finally when we received our food it was actually hot but we still hadn't received our waters/wines. It was just one thing after another and I actually felt bad for our server. He seemed stressed out of his mind and dropped a glass/shattered a glass when going back to the employee section. 

Of course i'll come back but this really wasn't a great experience."}
{"text":"The Service Was Great !!Our Waiter Justin H was AWESOME And Made Our Dinner Very Enjoyable! I Highly Recommend This Location For A Family Get Together Or Just Going Out On A Nice Date. It is by far the nicest Olive Garden in Las Vegas for sure.

Tip* Ask for Justin H.  This location has more than one Justin. This guy is very friendly and one great waiter! He really goes out of his way to make your dinner experience nice Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Typical Olive Garden  bar when you enter , you pass the \"to go \" table and sit at tables In the back. I go for the salad and soup. They can't mess that up much. I some times get the mushrooms(greasy lately) and the lasagna. 
You have to tell them to be sure they make it hot or I may come lukewarm 
My issue is the servers. The experience can be good or very bad depending on the server. I think the management needs to train better and monitor them"}
{"text":"Big fan of Olive Garden. Traveling on business so dining alone, I ate at the bar (very crowded). Had a very poor service from my waitress, never got her name either. 

The food was great and the other bartender was awesome. Her name was Kita. She was nice and very engaging. Even handled a rude customer with great class. 

Whoever the bartender was that took my order, hope it was just an off day. If not, it's time for a change. Maybe a new position at the restaurant. Kita makes you look 10 times worse than you are, and that's not good to start with."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant in town. I used to go here for all special occasions and any day I didn't feel like cooking. I've been a loyal customer for years and now I will no longer eat here anymore. I ate here about a week ago(March 6) First off I get walked to booth #52 which was dirty. So we go back in the waiting area. Then when it was clean get walked back. Which wasn't too big of a deal. I work at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. I know how it works. I wasn't upset at all until I hear 2 servers arguing over who was going to take care of our table. Neither of them wanted to take care of us because I had \"2 kids\" with me. Typical stereotyping that we won't tip or that we'll be cheap. After arguing for 10 minutes finally a server walks up to us and obviously annoyed says \" I literally just got sat so I can start you with some water for now\" and walked away. 10 min later a new server takes over I think his name was Hugo. Takes our order (by now I've been waiting for 25min) . It took more than half hour for me and my kids to actually get our food. My kids had lost their appetite by then since we've been here for almost an hour now. Food had no flavor. It was cold. Disgusting. We literally left all the food on our plates. The server disappeared so I never had the chance to tell him I didn't like my food. I waited so long without seeing our server that I figured out how to pay the bill on my own through the little tablet they have on the table. Left no tip. And left. Sad thing is I'm a server. I'm a good tipper. But I got stereotyped and given bad service. It was very unprofessional to argue about not wanting me in your section! The restaurant wasn't even THAT busy. At my job when it gets busy you see us servers literally running back and forth. Here there was no sense of urgency. And even if the server is overwhelmed it should not affect the kind of service you give your guest. Very disappointed. Not only did you miss out on a good tip but lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I'm not going to say that olive garden is the greatest Italian food I've ever had but every now and then I submit to my craving for their lunchtime breadsticks and salad deal and binge heavily.  Most of the other items on the menu are pretty mundane (I do like the chicken carbonara pasta tho) but the breadsticks, those darn breadsticks...."}
{"text":"I've gone here on multiple occasions and always had a pleasant experience. They get VERY busy though so certain times you may have to wait quite a while, however the food is worth the wait. 
We will be going back a lot. This location is a good one."}
{"text":"I frequent this location and I have always experienced  good service . My issue is that as of late the food has become flavorless everything is bland and without taste very disappointing."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is OK for inexpensive Italian food. The best thing is they are always open. But if you want really good Italian food like you could get in New York then go to Don Michaels on Decatur and Lone Mtn. The prices are about the same but the food is way better. It's also more of a family style restaurant. The owners are from New York. You get treated like family
here. They will make your chicken any way you want even if it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"Best Olive Garden I've ever been to. Ambience is gorgeous, service is divine, and food is most certainly on point. Rather impressed, they have set themselves apart from any other location. Keep up the great work guys"}
{"text":"This is one of the better OG's in the Charlotte area. Why? Service.

I popped in here to grab some food after an event at Concord Mils. This location is easy to access from 85 and the mall. Make sure you drive on up past the Red Lobster and go to the stoplight.

Our server was on point. Not only with us, but all of his tables. He didn't skip a beat. I noticed the other server in our section was the same way. Even more impressive, there were several large groups there and about five different birthdays. I laughed with the table behind us as we both said at the same time, \"is it everyone's birthday today?\"

I always order the same thing when I go to Olive Garden, soup-salad-breadsticks. My stomach was a little update, so I didn't really eat much. Our server boxed me up a fresh soup to take home with me to enjoy. He also hooked me up with a handful of those Andies-type after dinner mint chocolates. This man definitely knew his audience. 

After a super long day, thanks for making my night easy and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks. Olive Garden, you will always have a piece of my heart because of this glorious meal.

It's the Olive Garden. You know what you're getting when you go to one. This location is up by Northlake Mall, so if you don't want the food court here's another option.

The big pro and con here: the staff. I've been here for lunch, dinner and take out numerous times. The one consistent: the workers are all really nice and friendly. Unfortunately, the service is hit and miss. If you are on a strict time limit for lunch, this may not be a good option for you.

I'll still come here. Why? I just can't stay away from dipping breadsticks in the chicken and gnocchi soup."}
{"text":"I went to the Olive Garden location at w Cheyenne ave I ordered the shrimp skippy linguini that was the nastiest food I ever tasted!! It taste like microwave over cook ramen noodles and the shrimp smells so bad I would never eat there eve again, I wish I didn't have to give them any stars...."}
{"text":"Ok, so the first thing that comes to mind when walking in and taking a deep inhale: puke. I'm sorry, but it smells like puke to me. The soup and salad deal at lunch is pretty good, if you need to be on a high sodium diet. Bread? This is bread? Since when is a low budget puffed bleached wheat considered Italian bread? Hello, is there anyone listening? Does anyone care? Apparently not. People flock to this place regardless of the quality, bit that's the case in a lot of the chain-food establishments. After about 30 minutes or so, the puke smell permeates your clothing and you get used to the smell. Eating the sodium sauce soup n'at for a bargain price does not make me feel much better though. I think I am gonna go vegan. You may pay more, but in the end, you'll also feel a lot better. I think the smell comes from chlorine cleanser and low-grade parmesan hear remnants. If you don't mind the smell of puke, like styrofoam-like breads, then this is your spot. Two stars because I am feeling nice."}
{"text":"The 'Olive Garden' is one of the few national chains that I can sing high praises about!  At least this location.  We've been coming here for over ten years, and the food and service is consistently excellent.  Not many places can live up to that kind of claim.  All of the servers we've had the pleasure of dealing with here were top notch as well.  Attentive, friendly, competent, and truly professional.  And they know how to cater to the elderly or fussy children too.  Last night, I truly enjoyed their creamy chicken dumpling soup, cheese ravioli (with very fresh tasting marinara sauce), and lemoncello dessert in a 'shot glass'.  And of course, I love the salads and breadsticks they bring to each table as well.  Nice mix of both crunchy iceberg and leafy romaine lettuce.  My only minor negative point is that they need to put much less salt on their breadsticks, which remind me of one of those street vendor pretzels that is often drenched in salt, to the point where you have to rub some off (which I do with a napkin)!


UPDATE: November 2015

My family has not been here in a while, so we decided to come back.  The food was good, our server was nice, BUT I was very dissapointed in that we did NOT get the table salad and breadsticks that we usually get when dining here!  We were sitting for about 10 minutes (maybe more), when finally we placed our order with still no salad or breadsticks brought to us!  One of the appeals (to me) of The Olive Garden is the large 'community salad' with breadsticks that they usually bring to you when you sit down (at least in the past they did).  This time, when finally ordering food, the server asked us if we wanted soup or salad, and I was a bit confused.  I said \"salad\", given the fact that one was not brought out to us, but I really wanted soup, *IF* they had done what they did in the past, and brought out the 'community salad'.  Being I did not get our large salad by the time we ordered, I went with my salad, but couldn't help thinking how cheap they got because they had, in my estimation, discontinued their large 'community salads' and breadsticks!  Bottom line:  I was very unhappy with this visit, since we did not get our large salad and breadsticks when we sat down.  The confusion that ensued made me order a salad with my meal (he eventually brought out my salad and breadsticks), even though in the past I would order a soup, having ALREADY been served our large salad for the whole table.  Now, I don't know if they are 'cutting corners' here to maximize profits or whatever, but this was a HUGE 'turn off' for me, and I think I will take my business to Brio's or Carabba's next time I want Italian food.  Olive Garden Management, if you are reading this, large table salad and breadsticks for everyone at the table was one of the appeals of dining there in the past.  I've dined at Olive Gardens in NY, NJ, CT, and OH many times in the past, but this time I was not happy.

UPDATE: January 2017

I had to take 2 stars away, because clearly the quality of their chicken in the chicken dumpling soup has gone down!  The last 2 times I was here, the chicken was rubbery and slimy like an oyster!  It didn't look or taste like quality chicken at all.  In fact, I bit into a few fatty pieces that I had to spit out!  Not sure if I want to come back any time soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The service was good but the food sux'd... won't be back"}
{"text":"Went there with my friends and family on a Saturday. Granted it was busy. However 20 minutes after ordering we are told that one of the dishes is not available. The waiter never came back to refill our water, breadsticks or salad. I had to get up and get the water jug from the server station and serve myself! He also never bothered to get our appetizer or salad plates off of the table. We just stack them in the corner   After 40 minutes our food had not arrived at the table and the server asked us if we wanted our check??? WTH???? Needless to say we walked out. Lazy lazy lazy.  If you don't want to serve why be a server."}
{"text":"Great value for good food with friendly service. Their menu is predictable and affordable."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I like the Olive Garden and have been here numerous times but never have I been so uncomfortable eating here. Felt like I was in a damn sweat shop! It was so hot and miserable inside. Even as the hostess sat us down she was fanning herself with the menus. As the waitress came to take our drink order and she noticed my husband dripping with sweat and fanning himself she was like \"it's hot in here isn't it? We keep telling the manager but they won't listen\" So we told her to send him over. 5 minutes later she came back and said the manager got some more complaints so they are going to turn the air down some. We were sitting under a vent and not once did we feel the air kick on. I flagged down what seemed like a manager 20 minutes later and was like you guys really need to put the air on and he said \"oh yeah I think something may be wrong with it I'll have to put a service call in\" (nothing was wrong, it went on literally as we got up to leave) Like are you freaking kidding me stop being stingy with the damn air like that electric bill is coming out your paycheck. Everyone in that place was fanning themselves including workers. We won't be back as long as it's hot outside and in Arizona sorry guess we won't be back at all. 

P.S Our waitress Michelle was great. This review has absolutely nothing to do with her and her service"}
{"text":"Normally a decent dining experience but we had a server  who apparently was very new. First he took a while to even get our drinks out then he didn't have a pen to take our order down had to leave and come back and then he went to place our orders he came back and asked did we see his black book? We're like \"What book?\" He said the book he has to have to place our order. Then I guess he found it and the salad took forever and then their were no breadsticks for a while then they came and another while or so our appetizer came out. I for some reason let my son fill up on salad and breadsticks and stuff from the appetizer and after he and my husband went thru 2 salads the server came and said the food was on its way soon. Then like 15 mins later he comes and says somehow the order just didn't get put in and he just did it but it will be a while; would we want our stuff to go?! Crazy! I was calm bc my son wasn't hungry because I had let him fill up on bread and salad; but was pissed bc it was just a poor experience for us. He was super apologetic and sent a manager named Pete who was nice who comped our entire meal and gave a gift card for next time. I will for sure go again because it was such an odd thing to happen for the chain but I was very disappointed. It may take a while before I actually use the gift card card. 

Also, to put the icing on the cake the order was wrong but I didn't find it out until I got home; I was just so ready to go after being there hours with no real food but appetizers, bread and salad."}

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I think the food here is gross.  The chicken on the grilled chicken was garbage, but if you're bringing a date here and she loves to eat...you are guaranteed a homerun when you get back to her place."}
{"text":"Parents wanted to come for the buy one take one deal. The offer is buy one meal and take one home. They have 7 total options. There are 4 basic options and 3 with an up charge. However the take home choices are only the 4 basic options. Service was amazing!!! We had the most accommodating easiest server ever. The kitchen on the other hand was very slow.  The complimentary soup and salad was fine as normal but we had to wait for our main dishes to come out. Then we have a few complainant about the meals. The server was willing to fix the issues but we were tired and ready to go so we just kept the original meals. This is not my fav place for Italian but we will probably be back in the future for one of their many promotions."}
{"text":"Just decided to stop by this Olive Garden with my boyfriend today to get a really early dinner. As soon as we walked in we encountered what you would expect at an Olive Garden at 4 in the afternoon, a loud baby and people wearing pajamas as clothes. Little did we know that we were going to have the best service we have ever had in our entire lives. Being 21 and 22 means we usually get treated like we aren't good tippers at restaurants. But our waitress Nichole was so on top of everything I barely had to take a sip of my drink before she was filling it to the top. She was very friendly and efficient. And on our way out she boxed everything for us and even supplied extra soup. I felt like I was walking out the door with a weeks worth of groceries. Bottom line, thank you Nichole for being an awesome waitress! We will be back."}
{"text":"Still a solid choice for good food. This restaurant has a strange odor? Sort of a musty, sour smell? Its not overwhelming, but instead of this location we will probably try another one from now on. Food was good, service was good."}
{"text":"Seated within 10 min at 4:30pm. :)Waitress asks for drink order we have no wine menu. Brings menu came back I asked if a certain wine had Strawberries her reply oh I doubt it. Really! I am seriously allergic. Find out bring bottle read bottle.
Then we order appetizers brings salad before appetizers then brings appetizers out with meal.
What the what!!!! Felt forced to eat fast out by 5:10. WE'RE DONE
Sad my daughter worked then managed an OG 22 years total. Not the usual routine"}
{"text":"Soup, Salad, and Bread sticks.
The commercials I have seen for Olive Garden has made me remember those three phrases about Olive Garden.

From my personal experience, the service has always been amazing. They were always welcoming and promptly coming to refill the soup, salad, breadstick, if we wanted dessert, and how things were.
Every time I go to Olive Garden, I try to get something new to share. I love when they have their specials. Can't beat having 12.95 three course meals or 2 for $25. Be sure to take advantage of their current specials! It will save you money, and you will have enough food for another meal. The special I'm definitely looking forward to again is the \"All you can eat pasta!\"  

I never leave Olive Garden without a to-go box. By the time I'm done with the soup or salad and bread stick that comes with my main course order, I'm already full. 

If you want something 'lighter' compared to pasta. They do have the soup,salad, bread stick alternative which can be very filling.
What I've learned is, don't be afraid to ask to try another type of soup they have. I tend to feel weird even though its endless soup to ask for more. But as long as it doesn't go to waste and into your tummy, be sure to try the soups!

Their food is always delicious and I've never had any problems with their food.
If you are not full by dessert time, be sure to try their tiramisu. it is one dessert I'm always looking forward to having at Olive Garden.

Definitely will come back here again with my family."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here last night on March 8 2016, and the quality of food and service has seriously gone down hill.  We wanted to enjoy some Zuppa Toscana on a cold windy evening and we got soup that was over cooked, super thick, and cold. We brought this attention to the waitress and it took her 15 min to get us some soup. Our main course came out before the soup! So bad on not checking on us for refills, forgot my friends daughter food! And we didn't even get chocolates with the check! The worse service ever! Do not go here and waste your money!"}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE!! Went last night for dinner with my husband, 5yr old son and my 14yr old nephew. We all order the never ending pasta bowls, besides my son. It took 20 minutes for our waiter to get our drink order, as he was too busy with serving peoples salads for them!!?? Never have seen that before. When he made his way back (another 15 minutes) to get our food order - We all ordered and then I asked him - In about 5 minutes - Can you put the other bowl orders through - just to keep them coming. Another 30 minutes went by and we all still had our original bowl in front of us. No longer hungry because it took sooooo long - Went to the manager JAMIE to get our check and let him know. He offered no sorrys or comps nothing. So much for customer service. We were there for about hour and a half for ONE small bowl of pasta. HORRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"I hate this place more than I can express. Service is always wishy-washy and the food cannot be called Italian. The waiter made a mistake on my order and I get it, mistakes happen. What I really hate is when I am told that they are going to fix it and I wait 32 extra minutes for it to return. My husband was pretty much done with his lunch so I sat there eating by myself. Our alcoholic beverages had more ice than any other place I've been to. Never again."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here the other day for a delicious birthday lunch. Of course we went into this with the intention of demolishing the soup, salad, breadstick meal and calling it a day. However, there is a fancy new additive for a couple bucks...a small plate of pasta!! WHAT?! Although in heinsight, it really was to much food. I barely finished my meal. Oh I finished it don't worry, but barely.

We both had the Zuppa Toscana soup which was delicious. Potatoes and sausage, what's not to like? Then I added the five cheese ziti and my sister had the chicken meatballs. Wow...it was so much food but oh so good. I honestly couldnt tell you the last time I was at Olive Garden before that, but now I'll be keeping it on my suggestion list.

Our waiter was awesome! Such a good sense of humor (which you need with the two of us), and he was on point with beverage refills. Very impressed. I will definitely be back here again soon to try some more of the new menu items.

A small P.S.
This review was going to have four stars until my Yelp event last night. After trying the new menu items and having, yet again excellent service, I immediately bumped this up to a well deserved five stars! Great work Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Went there on Black Friday for lunch. I booked on line so we could keep on shopping. I had a meatball sub sandwich and fries and salad. The sandwich was very good. The fries are okay, not the best. And the salad was great as always. I wish this meal was on the dinner list for people who don't like the pasta each time there. The service was okay, we had to listen to our server on how tired she was and how many hours she had to work today. Was not paying attention to my wife about her drink brought out a wrong one. It's my wife favorite place so I know I'll have to go back."}
{"text":"Two things to know about me: number one I hate olives, and number two, I detest gardening. However, when the two things are combined, the activity turns out positive. The service was spot on amazing, and the atmosphere maintained a casual yet fancy kind of feel, (if that makes sense)  that's perfect for first dates, or formal dining options with your friends and beloved others. The food itself was not authentic Italian, but mimicked the appearance and taste of it marginally well. My group waited on the food for about 20 minutes, which is not bad, but the unlimited crispy and buttery breadsticks facilitated our short tempered patience with the food. (Side note: the breadsticks were freaking beautiful; inside and out.) So after those 20 blissful minutes with the breadsticks, the food had finally arrived and set onto the table. It was seriously a tumblr worthy picture to capture in my opinion, so of course I was obligated to capture the beauty of my food. The taste though, wasn't terrible, but was just average. Nothing exulted pizzazz; so it was just eh. One could honestly get at Za's for a lower price if one wanted to.  The place overall was credible and benignly cute, but nothing would make you super excited to come back. I mean, unless you're a sucker for unlimited breadsticks and Andes mint chocolates (which I guiltily am)"}
{"text":"Great service, super nice managerial staff, and supurb food.

We went one Saturday night for a belated birthday dinner. After a 15 minute wait (no reservation so to be expected) we were seated. The waiter we had was shockly good! He was formal and poliet, he did not try to act like we were his best friends but that he was providing a service to us. His manners were outstanding. 

The food was made perfectly and our order came in exactally how we ordered it. We got the mozzerella cheese fonda as our appitizer. We split a chicken alfredo dish, which they separated for us as our main course with salad and soup. We finished the meal with dessert, white rasberry cheesecake.

 At the end of our meal the manager came to our table to ask how everything was. We of course let him know the service was great!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience, or bad food here!! Love their selection of cocktails, and dessert! Steak Gorgonzola is fantastic, appetizers we started with calamari and stuffed mushrooms was great!! Had the Sangrita which is with tequila and it was great!! Bartenders were friendly and helpful!! Sit in lounge so you don't have to wait for a table!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing my review from my visit a week ago. I had called 2 months ago to set up reservations for a large party. My sons first communion dinner. I was offered some menus and had a very friendly experience with Shelly(?) the manager. I called Monday before the party to give my final head count and ask for high chairs to a gentleman manager (didn't get the name). I get there Sunday and the guy upfront doesn't seem to know what I was talking about. They tell us to take a seat. Then they seat us. Now I budgeted for this dinner with the special menu.  There was no high chairs at the table and I had to go find someone for them. Then I realize we have regular menus at our table. No kids menus and not even water. We finally get the right menus and the server was awesome but still waiting on a drink. We just came from church it's hot and now my little guy is not feeling well. I took the bottle water from my purse to give him a drink. I'm really disappointed that I called and tried to have this set up for a relaxing dinner and ended up with a headache! But I will say that our server was awesome once things got rolling. Just sad we had to wait so long for drinks."}
{"text":"Empty parking lot and for 13 people it's a 2 hour wait because they only have one room to accommodate a group of that size. Pathetic!"}
{"text":"Took my toddlers here after church, we must have gotten there around 1115 ish and already had more people than expected on a gloomy morning - guess everyone was craving for those awesome soups. Got sat and served rather quickly which I was happy about. Ordered zuppa Toscana to start with the \"choose a pasta deal\" then changed my mind after seeing their \"buy one, take one\" - server Lisa honored what I ordered without the need to change and not a lick of attitude (impressive). She also anticipated her guests needs as she never failed to check with us for anything. When the food came and I thought that the pasta needed more sauce and without any questions she brought me 2 extra - resolved the issue right there and then. She also tried helping my 3 yo on this little screen that they have which had games and all and as bad as that sounds -'consenting kids to play games while eating thus kind of helped (since we don't allow that at home). Overall food was consistent, service was great - better than expected. Finally a place I can bring my little ones that's not a fast food or plain pizza place. One day I'll be able to take them to a more fine dine seating but for now OG is a great place to train them good table manners. Thank you Lisa! We surely will be back."}
{"text":"We had take out. Ordering was easy. However, when I got there, there was a backup at the take out counter. One person working there with no backup, a very large order to deal with and four people in line. This is at 6 PM, peak dinner time. So it took over 10 minutes to get my order which was ready and therefore not hot when we got it home. Much too much black pepper in the food. Quality was good, but overall I did not enjoy it much. There are a lot better Italian restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"This OG location was really bad with their service, we never got our food, because we left.  I never do that, but this place did it for me.  the waitress kept saying that the food was coming but after 30 minutes, we decided to leave because she wasn't  going to return until our food was ready to serve.. the manager's excuse was that all food was  going to a large party on the other side of the house.. we didn't have to pay for our drinks or the dough soup we ate, which kind of made me happy :) haha... I love Olive garden but this one sucked."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location 5 stars solely based on the service provided by our server John. The service that he provided was beyond superb. He greeted us immediately, asked for our drink orders and offered the complimentary wine upon sitting. His friendly and welcoming demeanor was impeccable and deserves a 5 rating. He went above and beyond in explaining the menu, what specials were new, what the popular choices were and even went in to his favorite dishes. I've been to Olive Garden plenty of times but having a waiter like John who clearly loved his job and was happy doing his job made this experience a different one.

I feel like great service is often overlooked. Yes, when given bad service someone would gladly write a negative review on their experience but often good service is overlooked and not recognized. 

Olive garden is a place where you leave feeling like you get your moneys worth and feel like you made a great restaurant choice. My boyfriend and I came in on a Friday afternoon for lunch was seated immediately. My boyfriend ordered a \"Cucina Mia\" and created his own pasta bowl. This was a great because:

* You can choose your own pasta: Rigatoni, Cavatappi, Spaghetti, Tri-Colored Vegetable Penne, Whole Wheat Linguine, or Gluten Free Rotini. 
* Choose your own sauce: Five Cheese Marinara, Traditional Meat Sauce, Asiago Garlic Alfredo, Garlic with White Wine (topped with fresh tomatoes and garlic) or Primavera (Basil garlic marinara with a blend of fresh vegetables).
* Choose your topping: Meatballs, Italian Sausage, Chicken Meatballs, Grilled Chicken, Crispy Chicken Frittatta or Sauteed Shrimp. 

Olive garden is known from their awesome bottomless salads, soups and amazing breadsticks. I've been to many locations where the food was always good and has tasted the same. What made this experience a 5 star experience was truly John's service."}
{"text":"I just want to write a review for my waitress. Olive garden is what it always is everywhere you go, food tastes the same. Waiters and waitresses are not. Joy at the McDowell Olive garden in Goodyear was quite possibly the best waitress I have had in a long time. She was friendly and even though they were busy she was attentive and was always smiling. She definitely made my experience there tonight. My son loved her aswell. I will be asking to sit in her section anytime I come back."}
{"text":"Dominic and Chad at the bar make this place one of our favorite places to eat! My advice .... eat at the bar and have a mimosa :) and remember tip well :)"}
{"text":"Called ahead before we got there around 5pm and was told there was no wait for a booth so I didn't need to put my name on the list. Get there about 12 minutes later and there is a 15-20 minute wait. Told the hostess we would like a booth. As we were waiting another couple walked in and was offered a booth in the bar. If we would of been offered that we definitely would of taken it. We had been waiting a while and the manager took us to a table. I let her know we had been waiting quite some time for a booth and didn't want a table. Their was two cleaned booths but she wouldn't seat us at either and walked us up back front to continue to wait. After a while we just decided to go sit in the bar. We put in an order for an appetizer on the ziosk. Right after the server came to take our food order and I asked her to please hold off on putting in our dinner order because we would like to have time to eat the appetizer. The appetizer took 25 minutes to come out. Our food came literally 30 seconds later. The chef who brought out our appetizer was the same person bringing out our food and he even said I know I just brought the appetizer but your food is ready. I kindly asked him to hold it back in the kitchen so we could have a moment to eat the appetizer. He came back two minutes later with our food again and then looked at us and said oh looks like you aren't finished with the appetizer I'll hold it again. This was frustrating because I specifically asked the server to wait to enter the dinner order. When our server came back with the dinners she said they had been remade but they definitely weren't, the noodles were extremely dried out probably from baking under the heat lamp for the last half hour. I had to ask for a water refill twice and it took 20 minutes to get it. Overall HORRIBLE service, will never return here again."}
{"text":"I was completely done with the Olive Garden company, until this experience. My last experience was at the Centennial location & I was so angry I would have left 0 stars, if possible. I complained to corporate about the unprofessionalism & horrendous service, in which I was given a gift card to give them another chance. I decided one more chance wouldn't hurt but I would go to a different location. 

At the Decatur location, Rodolfo gave my husband & I the best service I've ever had at any restaurant. He had so much amazing, positive energy! He was thoughtful & offered his opinion on drink & food selections when my husband asked his preferences. Refills of bread & drinks were always quick. He was prompt & friendly every time he came to our table. 

What I truly loved was that although we did come close to their closing time, he never made us feel rushed or unwanted. Rodolfo told us how blessed he is to have a job & how much he genuinely loves working with people. Typically in the service industry you encounter people working solely for the paycheck & you can tell in their energy that they do not want to be at work. We told Rodolfo how amazing we thought his personality & his level of service was & his response was that it's just who he is. He told us where he's from there are people without jobs & opportunities, so in his life he has truly loved any job he's had the opportunity of having from service jobs to simply washing dishes. He brings up a good point that life is too short to be negative & how even at work you must always be positive because you have the power to positively change someone's day. 

THANK YOU RODOLFO! You truly made my day. I left with a smile on my face & good food in my stomach. It's someone like you that will ensure that I will come back to Olive Garden & specifically your location. My husband & I can't wait to bring our 4 year old in to meet you & have some great food again!"}
{"text":"As I sit here in the Olive Garden To-Go section I am absolutely livid. I often come to this location with my family but I will never come back again after tonight. I placed an order online for pickup. My pick up time is 9:40pm & I arrive at 9:43pm. I stand in the To-Go section waiting with the young black woman with braids is across from me & it takes awhile standing there before I am acknowledged. I receive no greeting or a smile. I state that I am there to pick up and order for Crystal. She reads off an order for Briana & I repeat that the order is under Crystal. She states, \"We have no order for Crystal.\" 

I pulled out my emailed confirmation with confirmation number & location. I try to show her & she repeats that they have no order for me. I tell her again that I have a confirmation of my order & she glances at the order, looks at a screen and repeats again there is no order. A woman next to her chimes in, \"Maybe it's a different location.\" With my confirmation in hand I show it is for the Centennial location I am standing inside of. The black woman checks her screen again, \"I have no order for you.\" 

I wait there in silence waiting for her to assist me in the situation because something had obviously gone wrong with me order and she simply turns away. I speak up and say, \"Is it too late to place my order because I've been waiting?\" Her response, \"No. What did you want?\" Instead of showing her the confirmation she obviously had no intention of actually looking at I read it off to her. She charges me the amount. I ask how long and she states 15-20 mins. I tell her I will go in my car because my husband and child are waiting for me & she says, \"You need to wait inside because we're locking our doors.\" I said I need to at least tell my husband what is going on & her response is 'fine'. 

Her service is absolutely INEXCUSABLE! I have dealt with her previously with a To-Go order and she wasn't pleasant before either. This time with a mistake not being of my own I should be shown a resolution to the situation, her trying to keep my business & make a sale that I had confirmation that I made & show an ounce of kindness. I hope her management team sees this. I hope other Yelpers see this & choose to forgo this location. My family & I will take our business elsewhere. Buca De Bepo's isn't too far."}
{"text":"I was leery about eating at a restaurant in an over populated area. Usually the service is so overwhelmed the food lack the quality that you would receive in another area. Fortunately,  I was wrong. The food, service and atmosphere was fantastic, in spite of the remodeling going on. But I'm not here to eat the walls.  I will be coming back, great job everyone."}
{"text":"Its OG...what do you expect??

OG always has a special place in my heart.  Its cheap, decent food.  

And who doesnt love unlimited salad, soup, and breadsticks????  I love to feed my fat self...and here its easy and cheap."}
{"text":"I have had mixed experiences here, including possibly the worst service ever received in a corporate restaurant: out of four entrees, two were incorrect and not a single drink refill was brought in a 40 minute meal."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second chance and again I was disappointed. It took a very long time for our food to be served + my pasta looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long time. the waiter did an ok job but again he seemed overwhelmed with customers. The only thing this OV has going for it is location."}
{"text":"If I had wanted Denny's service and Denny's food I would have gone to Denny's. 

What happened to Olive Garden??? You used to be regarded with a higher standard now, you are barely one step above fast food!!!

Went in around lunch time and the service was so slow.  I ordered and iced tea with lemon and was brought a raspberry tea which I detest.  I told the server right away and I didn't get a replacement until after I had already finished the soup and bread sticks.  Mind you she brought the drink before any of the food, and I told her before she brought any of the food.  I didn't get a refill until after a box was brought for my order. Pathetic! I love your iced tea and you deprived me of having it. 

The food came and I asked for a extra Alfredo Sauce on my Chicken Alfredo. I didn't get it, so I asked for it on the side.  10 minutes later she brought it and it was the smallest cup of nothing I have ever seen in my life, not even a full cup of nothing!  My order came with the buy one take one and I got the 3 cheese zitti to go.  When I got home to eat it, it was do disgusting it went straight to the dog.  My daughter ordered the lunch lasagna and the portion size she received was that equivalent to a Fancy Feast dinner you would feed you cat. You all know which dinners I am talking about.  

I am done with Olive Garden.  Macaroni Grill here comes our lifetime business.  You have great iced tea, and Alfredo too. 

I did something I don't normally do, and I didn't leave a tip.  You don't go to a sit down location and not expect a drink."}
{"text":"Never going back for sure this time... I never complain to the staff. Tonight when I called \"stephi\" the \"store manager\"  answered my call. I explained my fettuccine noodles were crunchy,  our salmon was dry and the veggies were shriveled , she could not care less. No apology, nothing. She put me on hold for 4 mins and asked the cook.  When she came back. . She by rebutted my complaint by saying all their food is made fresh.  Obviously not or I wouldn't be complaining.    I will go to bucca di peppo or carrabas from now on.. $45 for 2 people to eat take out and you get snappy when someone complains? ! Thanks for nothing! !"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad.  It wasn't great.  But it was OK.  I haven't eaten there for at least 15 years but decided to try it hoping they had seafood pasta in a vodka sauce which was what I was craving.  They had a seafood dish with shrimp, clams and scallops, pasta and vodka sauce.  Perfect.  It tasted good and the serving was plentiful. $17 plus an $8 glass of wine and it was no longer a cheap lunch meal so my expectations for the rest of the meal were more demanding.  Bread sticks not what I remember - crummy.  Endless salad - throw a few more tomatoes and olives in.  My expectation for creamy Italian dressing is white - not a clear traditional oil and vinegar.  I asked the question but they answered it wrong.  Had they answered it correctly I would have ordered Ranch dressing.  Service - fast, good and efficient.  So what will I do next?  Have my son-in-law make the seafood pasta dish at home with good bread, good salad and good wine."}
{"text":"Although we had a negative experience at the beginning of our dinner, Steve Johnson (general manager) really stepped it up to make our experience good. Service was slower than usual for this location, which is why only 4 stars this time. Food excellent as always."}
{"text":"For a chain of Italian food it's pretty good actually.
Service efficient and pleasant.
We ask for salad dressing on the side, no problem.

But do double check your check - we were overcharged on a few items, including a bottle of wine.

Been to this location several times, and we will return"}
{"text":"The service & food here is excellent. The restaurant is clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated.  It's also not far from Galaxy Theater. A perfect pair for dinner &  a movie, no reservations required"}
{"text":"Olive garden is always a bit of a crap shoot when it comes to service, but this one is really impressive. There is a dairy allergy in our group, I know I know we chose Italian, the wait staff made sure everyone was aware of it, the manager even came out to personally cover the dairy menu AND even offered to whip something up using what ever the kitchen had! Simply outstanding, well done Olive Garden, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"So I'll start by saying my family LOVES Olive Garden. Beside a mediocre server here and there, I've never really had a complaint. I have been to this location often and am usually very satisfied. 

However, today was a little different. When I sat down, I immediately noticed the extreme amount of dust on the blinds which was super unappetizing. My other complaint is the portion of food I received! I ordered one of the new stuffed pastas, the chicken gnocchi. It was very good (a little too cheesy for me, which is saying A LOT). However, the portion was laughably small. My meals here usually last me about 3 separate meals but this one I ate in one sitting. I thought maybe it was a lunch portion until we got the check and were charged $17 for such a small amount of food. I probably should have said something, but didn't which is my fault. 

Overall, I love Olive Garden and this location. They need to step up the cleanliness of the dining area and I will NEVER order from the special menus again, but I will return."}
{"text":"After driving for 15 hours we were just craving a extra large salad per person a little late at night (930pm)... This Olive Garden did the trick! Nothing fancy but fulfilled its purpose! The take out containers are large, entirely filled up and have a little place for the dressing, croutons, etc."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service I will never eat here at this dirty olive garden again waitress was rude in unprofessional"}
{"text":"All you can eat soup salad and bread...on a rainy day you can't beat it"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my meals at Olive Garden. The past two times I have gone to this location, I'm not so impressed with my meals. The food seemed quite bland. I hope they can work on their spice game."}
{"text":"It's a garden, with olives, what is not to like?

I can not comment on this particular locations entree's, because i keep coming back for the famed SOUP & SALAD lunch special.. more please!"}
{"text":"New location! So i ordered the soup and salad as always, asked for the fresh ground pepper.. hold on.. ok yeah still waiting. Asked the nearest staff member for it again.. waiting..  manager comes back and said they weren't sure what 'cracked paper' was .. So I picked up the pepper shaker and ten was brought the pepper. Everything was fine after that, oh and it doesn't smell like mold as the old building did."}
{"text":"We to eat here out of convenience again cause it's close to work. I had to take a picture of Fred's chicken parm sandwich. He usually orders the half but went with the full size today. You can tell by the picture they must of had one already made then hurried to come up with the other half; apparently no quality control. 

Food here is consistantly just ok. We arrived right at 11am sonic was baffled why the first order of breadsticks came out so hard like they had been sitting for a while.  We didn't get the side of alfredo we ordered and refills on drinks, breadsticks, and soup was non-existent."}
{"text":"Still trying to get it right... Went there last Saturday night and of course it was busy.  However the service was fine except our server was in the weeds, an older gentleman and seemed he could only focus on one task at a time.  My main concern was the food. That being said, the salad and soup were their usual hits, it's pretty hard to mess up this restaurants franchise staples and were to our expectation. However our main entree course's were not up to par. I had the seafood mare which was a large dish but the pasta was over cooked and the sauces were quite bland, the lobster ravioli was dried up and the sauce was too hot, ( it was breaking up and separating, butter and cream.) My girlfriend had the eggplant parm and that was overcooked and dried out.  Our server upsold me a Italian margarita that had armaretto shot served with it and it was quite horrible to say the least.  I think this place has to work on their food more before I would feel comfortable coming back.  Also had our payment on the table for over 20 minutes before our server brought the check and then he hovered at the table while we signed the credit card slip which I am not a big fan of."}
{"text":"Came in On A Sunday before the church crowd 11:30, service was terrible  and slow. Guy only had 3 tables. His greeting was, are you ready to order?  We asked for salad, dressing on the side. He came back and said, i forgot to ask if you want soup or salad. Salad then took forever. Food came slow and was cold. This just affirmed my decision to stop eating out."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*

I've eaten here twice now, and it's been a mixed bag of experiences.  The first time I came here, the service was great! Today, the service was slow and questionable.

My friend and I ate here today for a late afternoon bite, and even though our server was nice, she was slow about bringing out our food and refilling our drinks.  Not such a big deal, but even when I asked another server for more sprite, it still took the other waitress to come over and refill our drinks.

I still like eating here even though it's been a long time since I've dined here, for whatever reason. The food is good, place is well staffed (mostly) and overall I really enjoy going out to eat here.  Lately I've been getting the soup, salad and breadsticks, as that seems to be what I like the most right now. I do know that their spaghetti and Lasagna is tasty as well, along with a few other items I've had in the past.

Overall not a half bad place, and I really do enjoy going here from time to time.  Will return in the future."}
{"text":"Great location with plenty of parking space to accommodate lots of people. Inside is your usually Olive Garden look. Lots of tables and booths. However, this place is very popular and gets very busy. 

Came here for dinner and there was a line of people waiting to be seated. Note, I did come on a Sunday, so maybe during the week, it isn't as busy. Was told my wait would be about 25 minutes but was seated more like 10 minutes in. As I was walked to my table, I noticed that there were several tables empty that hadn't been cleaned off yet. With as many people as there were waiting to be seated, I would've thought that they would be on top of getting tables cleaned off as soon as possible. 

Once seated my waiter came by and took my drink order. Came back fairly quickly, but left before taking my food order. Maybe he was also attending to other tables at the same time. Anyways, after about 10 minutes he came back and took my food order. I decided to get the Never Ending Pasta Bowls as it is a good deal, $10 for unlimited servings of pasta and you can mix and match the different pasta and sauces and for an extra cost, you can add some kind of meat. I went with the Fettuccini Alfredo for my first bowl, with the free salad and garlic bread. My salad and garlic bread came out first and my pasta within a few minutes after that. Pasta was well cooked, but the sauce was just average. I've bought better tasting Alfredo from the grocery store! The second bowl I got the Fettuccini with 5 cheese marinara. This one was delicious!! Love the cheese marinara sauce. 

During my whole visit, my waiter only came by once to check up on me. He didn't even bring me my check, so it's a good thing they have the paying machines on each table. Not the best experience at an Olive Garden. Too loud and my waiter didn't seem to really care about my table."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Olive Garden? I don't come often, but when I do come I usually enjoy my visit and this last visit was no exception. We came on a Saturday during dinner time and were seated immediately, even though the place was really busy!

Our waitress was busy with several other large parties of people so we ended up having to wait around before finally another lady (I think the manager?) came around and took our drink and food order. Our waitress finally did come around to our table to bring us our salad and bread, but other than that she didn't come back around. 

I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and my girl got the 5 cheese Ziti al Forno. Both of us got the salad with our meal as well. We didn't have to wait long before our food came out, but I do have to say that we were disappointed with the portion that we got, especially since the price on their entrees keep on going up. My fettuccine cost $14.99 and the Ziti cost $15.99. Usually, we get so much that we have to take to-go boxes home, but this time we had no problem eating our dinner. My girl's ziti was in a dish that was maybe 1/2\" deep and they only gave her enough to cover the bottom of the dish. Mind you, the noodles were single stacked and they gave her what seemed like just 1/4th of a cup of sauce!! I think we may have been able to ask for more sauce but didn't want to have to pay extra for that. 

Overall though, the experience was good. Would come back again. Probably more around lunch time so we can take advantage of the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I came here to have lunch with a friend because this Olive Garden is never too busy and the service is always fast. I never care for the salad because it's usually over dressed, but this time it wasn't completely drenched in dressing so that was nice. I ordered the $10 build your own pasta & got Cavatappi with roasted garlic Alfredo & asked them to put mushrooms in it in place of the meat choices. I wish they had veggie choices on the menu instead of only meat choices (Note to vegetarians, you can add broccoli, zuchinni, mushrooms & tomatoes). I just have to say the one thing I don't understand is why people are obsessed with Olive Garden's  breadsticks. There is seriously nothing special about them. They're bland, lacking in texture, & are only seasoned with garlic salt. Not impressed. Go ahead, judge me."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at this Olive Garden. We got the soup and salad.  Beware!!!! The waiter in bar area dropped the cheese grater in the floor and the cheese fell out. He picked it off the floor and said, \"would you like cheese on your salad\".   
Did he actually have a food handlers license?   That was scary!  
Service was average!  I don't know if we will return.  We didn't say anything about him dropping the cheese and grater on floor for fear of more issues."}
{"text":"Hannah and the front desk were amazing. Our server was definitely overwhelmed with a group. Food took forever. Paying seemed to take even longer. After a better than expected wait took more than 20 minutes to order and receive breadsticks."}
{"text":"I used to love Olive Garden but its become so blah. This is the new location and its nice but nothing special, these days they are all basic carbon copies of each other. When we first came in the hostess told us there was a wait... Odd because there was hardly anyone there... So we sat there for 15 minutes before she even sat us. We finally get seated and our waiter is basically a frat boy stoner who just nods and says \"yeah man\". Service wasn't friendly but he didn't screw up our order and the food came out in a timely manner. Not thrilled with this place, probably won't come here again. If you're into the chain restaurant thing it's perfectly fine but I guess I'm just bored with the generic food and below par service."}
{"text":"Ridiculously awesome soup and salad! Can't beat the lunch price."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my boyfriend and his family on our way home from a Pirates game. We were seated immediately, to which I was very surprised. 

The endless salad and breadsticks are enough to fill me up, but I thought what-the-heck and ordered chicken alfredo. Also to drink I ordered the Peach/Raspberry iced tea... I'm almost ashamed to say I had four glasses of it! Very tasty! My chicken alfredo was good, nothing special. One member of my group got a particular pasta dish (I forget which one it was exactly) and she had to order more sauce... there was very little on it when it was brought to the table. Other than that, everything was very good. 

Tip: It's definitely a bargain if you and another person can do the two for $25 deal! You get the soup/salad, breadsticks, entree, and desert to share. I'll be the first to admit that I do like Olive Garden, but I do think their prices are high. So when you can save a little by doing their meal deals, definitely do it. 

Service was good! No complaints there. Our waitress was attentive and very sweet. I\"ll be back!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden has decent food...the bread sticks and salad are always a favorite. We ordered the Alfredo pizza...but when the waiter brought out the food it was the Alfredo pasta, easy mix up. However, the manager came over and apologize for the confusion and offered a free appetizer, which was nice. Overall, the food was good and the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Came here for a celebratory lunch and left feeling deflated. The second star is being given to our fabulous waitress, who kept the salad, breadsticks, and drinks coming.  We were all excited to get our lunch food; I ordered the new chicken parmigiana lasagna. When it came out, I took a bite of the chicken and immediately felt sick. It had a horrible taste and when I looked at the chicken, it was thin, rubbery, and gray. The inside of the lasagna was cold. Makes one wonder if the food is heated in a microwave. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical going to Olive Garden for the first time since I imagined it would be gross chain restaurant food whose only redeeming point would be the enormous quantities but I was actually pleasantly surprised! I had pasta primavera with minestrone soup and, of course, their unlimited bread sticks. My least favourite thing was their bread sticks, which I found to be a bit doughy but still delicious enough to warrant eating like 6 of them. But that might be because I like bread a little too much... The minestrone soup was packed with stuff and not overly salty and made extra amazing by the fact that it's unlimited! The pasta primavera was very good, with lots of fresh veggies in a savoury tomato sauce. You could just eat mostly sides and pack your entree to go and then you got two meals out of one LOL! It's a place you come to gorge yourself, and, I'm not gonna lie, I love gorging once in a while. I'm surprised to find myself saying this but I would definitely come back to the Olive Garden (but maybe fast the day before next time)."}
{"text":"Walked out!!! Zero service. Sat down at the table and waited and waited till I just gave up and walked out. It wasn't even busy! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"My reivew is a little late, but better late than never.

We celebrated my son's first birthday here, So yes this is a very very special place and will always be in our hearts.

We just wanted to host a dinner, as my son is too small to play anywhere.. we wanted something elegant and fine dine. so we Zeroed in on Olive Garden Happy Valley. We have been here before many times 

We talked to many other restraunts, but believe me nobody will work with mr or cooperate with me at all... somewhere we could not choose our menu, or they would not let us decorate something or the other. But the staff here was amazing, they completely were flexible and and they let us decorate our party area. we finalised on everything.

So my son's birthday came, I got the cake and asked them to keep it in the fridge, and was handing over the number 1 that was suppposed to stuck up on the cake and this old lady employee grabbed it from me not realizing it was not a candle but made from chocolate and fondants... and actually broke it. I was kinda upset with it, I tried to join it again but thanks to the old lady it was not going to be intact again. 

Anyways,  everyone gathered there. we were around 25-30 people. We got great service, we had 2 servers who kept track of everything were very polite and understanding, but refused to help me in cake cutting and distributing. Never Mind.

We had a great birthday party, everyone was happy. Thanks."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start...the service was AMAZING! thanks to Omar, Jordan and Jose that took really good care of us.  We had a party a big  and 9 of them were kids...

They first off took our reservations with no issues EVEN though we were running late from the field and our reservation was late too (845pm) we showed up at 905 and we were seated at 920pm...

We had several  checks and many many orders....
They made sure we were assisted, kept our glasses full, our kids happy and no stress..

We were beyond impressed with our servers OMAR, JORDAN AND JOSE! WELL DONE GUYS.....WELL DONE!

For me ..I'm big on customer service being from Hawaii and las vegas. ..and boy they went above and beyond! Great job for hiring phenomenal workers...Kudos to management and those 3 servers...oh yeah I can't forget about the wonderful woman who took our reservation.

Fyi: we were referred by Holiday Inn Mesa hotel.....great job building that relationship. ..

Thank you again Omar..Jordan...and Jose...."}
{"text":"Got really great service (a woman named Chris was serving us) and the food was awesome. All the other employees were equally cheerful and happy to serve us. 
we left with a full belly and a smile on our faces :) perfect dinner."}
{"text":"I usually love Olive Garden but today I think they were off their game. My soup came out slightly warm, my chk alfredo was pretty dry they didn't put enough sauce on it, & my bf's seafood alfredo was the same. We came here to celebrate our birthday and it was cool that we each got a free dessert but other than that I don't think I'll be back for awhile."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of microwaved, cheap Italian food sold at high prices."}
{"text":"Don't lie. You know the food. You know the chain. You eat too many breadsticks, too much soup and salad. 

The service at this location is excellent. To help sell their wines, they will offer your table small tastings. This was done congenially, with friendly attentiveness for my 84yo grandmother and 90yo grandfather. Accommodations were made to ease my grandpa's infirmities and someone helped him navigate the restaurant to our table. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak and lobster ravioli. I couldn't cut the steak or chew it. The edges of the ravioli were dry and crisp. The manager offered a discount of $5 from the $19 meal.  But did not give us the discount. You should think twice if you plan to order steak from olive garden."}
{"text":"I think we have all been to an OG (Olive Garden) so I'll just rate the service here.  The service is just a tad slow.  Part of it, I think, is because of the amount of people show up day in and day out at this location.  I'd be tired as F$%^ too.  For this reason I just sit at the bar, usually never bad service there, just have to deal with others so close to you while eating.  Also, don't really expect any help with wine selections, the people working there are not knowledgeable at all so take the selection the menu gives or stick with the white meat - white wine rule (red - red).

Food is cooked as described.  If you haven't tried the Alfredo dipping sauce with the bread sticks, you are missing out.  I'd have to recommend the local Italian joints over this place though, sorry OG."}
{"text":"I know why just about every Olive Garden is packed each night from 4-8, I get it, I know its reasonably priced, above average food, specifically catering to families and older 30 something / 40 / 50's groups, and obviously me and my wife.  We went to this location for a couple reasons: 1) the Mentor location is ridiculously packed and the wait can exceed 45 minutes at times and 2) I had a gift card  3) we were craving soup, salad, and breadsticks.

So we rolled in starving at around 5pm on Saturday and was told it was a 15 minute wait, turned out it was only 3 minutes.  The wife and I had the kiddo so we requested a booth for her car seat.  The hostess was nice and hooked us up.  

We each ordered house red (rosso) because we really were there to eat and needed something to wash everything down with that was cheap and recognizable.  We both went with the SSB deal ($6.50) with a boat of Alfredo sauce for the breadsticks.  I went with the potato / sausage soup and she went with the minestrone.  Everything came out fresh and as expected.  I ate much more then I should have but enjoyed every bite; wife had a little shot glass desert and also had an overall tasty experience.

Olive Garden is a chain but everyone needs the AYCE SSB fix.  Whether its twice a year or once a month, whatever, its just worth the money spent.   Funny thing is that I looked around while eating and didn't notice any food being sent out by our table that was anything different the SSB.  There must have been something in the air that Saturday."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love their salad?  It's always a must for me.

I bought a dish that was on the healthy menu.  Although it was very tasty, it was also very rich.  Would I order it again, YES!"}
{"text":"Visited the Olive Garden in Surprise, Az last week. What a great surprise in Surprise! The food was FANTASTIC! Loved the BOGO deal! The meal also comes with soup, or salad, and breadsticks. You can't go wrong here! I hadn't been to an Olive Garden in years (wasn't my favorite place) . We thought we'd give it try due to convenience of close to home, and the recent t.v. ad. So glad we did. We felt so 'at home', and 'welcome' due to hospitality of Rachel! Her expertise, and customer service made this visit all the more a wonderful experience. Rachel, and that pot pie are the reasons we will be back to this location! Keep up the great work! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places I love the food the salad the service the appetizers very convenient for me.Every time we have a reunion we come to this place I like the prices they are affordable and the people who works right there are very friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered online. Food was done on time. But my chicken fettuccine  Alfredo had no flavor and was dry. Sad because I got the by one take one and got the same plates so now  stuck eating nasty no flavor food. My salad was not fresh, had lots of brown in it. Very disappointed never will I order take out."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden and I travel around to various locations in the Pittsburgh area, but now that I've experienced the service of Dave at the McIntyre Square location, I won't let anyone else serve me!!!! He is the G.O.A.T. and deserves medals for all the effort he puts in every day!!! He is very attentive and actually really funny too, and that's saying a lot coming from me (considering I think I'm pretty funny myself). GO DAVE!!!!! DAVE FOR PRESIDENT!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hostess at this location are awesome.
What else would I say about this classic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"LooooOOove the food, the food was WONDERFUL and Ms. Kelley was great, we will come back sooon..."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a word of praise to Ms. Brittany and all of her polite, professional and well-trained employees.  The teamwork is evident and greatly appreciated.  I noticed  how Ms. Brittany would go by customer's tables to make sure the customer is satisfied with their food and service.  The food is always fresh, hot and delicious.  The restaurant is always clean inside and outside.  To all the managers and well-trained employees, please keep up the fantastic job!!"}
{"text":"I, like I'm sure every other American, love Olive Garden. I haven't experienced anything different about this location compared to another except the wait times. The wait times are almost always 45 minutes minimum and for me it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"My family and I came here at a busy time of the night, and we were lucky enough to find a spot in the bar area.  The food was great, the service from David our waiter was excellent, and the endless salad was refilled numerous time.  The only complaint I ever have with Olive Garden is the fact that the sides are always so, so stingy.  Come on, 4 pieces of broccoli and 4 pieces of asparagus.  Little skimpy, but always good."}
{"text":"this is the second time weve been to this location and this time service was exemplary! it was very busy on a thursday evening and there were several people waiting to be seated.  we were seated in less than 15 minutes and acknowledged promptly.  we ordered the 2 for $25 special and our salad and breadsticks came out right away.  i forgot to tell our waitress i prefer dressing on the side so asked her to please do that with the second bowl - thankfully the first bowl wasnt drowned in dressing.  sure enough she remembered! our appetizer didnt come - we think it went to the table in front of us as they sat down after us and received the appetizer before the salad.  when our entrees came out via someone else we explained we didnt get our appetizer and believe it was mistakenly taken to another table - honest mistake.  i flagged down the manager on duty - kris - and told her what happened.  both the manager, our waitress, sarah, and the waitress who brought our entrees all apologized profusely.  our food came out hot and fresh and our entrees followed very hot and fresh with a reasonable amount of time in between.  as we were leaving the manager presented us with a $15 gc and asked us to please return.

we definitely will! the service was great and food was better than a catered event we had the night before! its nice to know our patronage is appreciated!"}
{"text":"The food is GREAT and the service is excellent! We love coming back especially when they have the UNLIMITED Specials. Yesterday we came here for lunch and in the middle of our meal we got a phone call from school that make us leave ASAP and our SERVER ask if we would like to take home more food since we didn't even finish our first round of the  Unlimited specials. It's so GREAT that we come here 2 to 3 times a week."}
{"text":"Wow, such promise yet such tragic service.  Late on coffee, late on refills, late on my toddler's dinner (literally worst thing) - had to reenter food and then I just had to share with said toddler, late on breadsticks, late on alfredo sauce, late on salad.  Late on beverage for my toddler. I love Olive Garden, but the service here was really, really poor."}
{"text":"We had reservations yesterday for my sons graduation dinner. We had a wonderful experience! Jeanie was our server. She was kind, and seemed to really care that our celebration was enjoyable! The food was excellent! I had a gluten free pasta with sausage. Delicious!!   Thanks !!!"}
{"text":"After visiting this Olive Garden three times and all three times thinking \"this is the best Olive Garden experience I've ever had\" I've decided I must write a review. After working here my self in a Florida location, with extensive knowledge of how this restaurant runs, I must say that this by far, is the cleanest, has the best tasting and quality food, and great servers! Today we had Melissa, who was so sweet and gave us an experience! 
Keep up the great work and go see them!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I arrived around noon and we were immediately seated in a booth near the bar area. The waiter took our drink order and gave us a minute to review the menu.
Our drinks arrived and we had decided what we wanted to order, so the waiter took our order. The two lunch items (advertised as \"Pronto Lunch\") we ordered came with a choice of house salad or soup and breadsticks.
We got the house salad and breadsticks brought to our table 20 minutes later and then another 15 minutes for our lunch order. When we got our food, the waiter did not take any of the bowls or plates we used for the salad and the breadsticks. The table was now crowded and we had to maneuver the plates to make room on the table to eat.
The waiter did not take the liberty to apologize for the long wait and never followed up with us after we received our order to see if everything was ok. We had to ask for refills since he never came back to check on us. Refills were handled by another waiter and one other waitress.
We asked for our check and will not be returning to this location based on the customer service we received."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is undergoing changes and some of them are for the better, but on my last visit I was the victim of a minor fraud.

Tables now have tablets which are useful for calling your waiter.  They also have games on them.  One of the games, Trivia, started running without our ever touching the device, so we played it.  Later our bill came and we find we had been charged $1.99 for using the game.  Only then did we go back to the menu, bring up the list of games, and see that virtually all of the games are listed as \"Premium Games\" but no mention is made of a charge or what that charge would be.  Our waiter never mentioned this to us either.

I feel that this \"sharp\" practice and the introduction of higher-priced menu items is an attempt by the new management to make a profit no matter how.  What else are they doing that we don't see? Better idea -- cut down on the absurdly large portion sizes."}
{"text":"I enjoy Olive Garden food and this location is one I've been to several times over the past year.  I tried curbside pick up for the first time this past month and they got the order perfect (including side items like grated cheese, plasticware, etc).  Impressed.  The menu changes once in a while adding new and interesting items that are typically very tasty.  The only thing I wish is they would try a different recipe for the garlic bread sticks (too dry in my opinion and I find it lacking overall).  Service has always been top notch.  Stuffed mushrooms are always ordered and I like the mini dessert options.  The addition of the \"laptop ordering station\" at the tables has always worked well for us; anything we ordered has been delivered to the table in a timely manner along with anything we've ordered from the actual waiter.  I like the option to pay at the table using the machine as well; especially on the occasions when we've been in a hurry and the waiter was busy at the time we wanted to pay and go."}
{"text":"Each time we've been to this location it has been a very good experience.  Staff and service is friendly and attentive.  The menu has many choices available.  The food quality has been very good.  The prices are reasonable.  We typically have some food to take home.  As long as they have stuffed mushrooms, I'll be back."}
{"text":"We keep going back hoping for a great experience.  The service is great but we keep getting dissappointed with some of the food items we order that are brought out at less than desirable temperature.  Some of the food is served hot and satisfying BUT we always seem to get at least one item brought to the table that is practically room temperature.  The plate is hotter than the food.  We go back for certain favorite items and the fact that the service is great, but come on, check the food temperature before serving!"}
{"text":"waiter would disappear.
tried apricot chicken or fit menu.  sauce tasted good."}
{"text":"I don't know if Olive Garden went down down down in food quality or if it's always just been bad. Haha In high school we used to always eat at Olive Garden and it was so delicious! 

My most recent visit the service was not good, Zoupa Toscana was too salty, salad looked old and my ravioli was nothing special ... 

Hmmm sorry OG even your unlimited soup & breadsticks can't save you~"}
{"text":"Asians not served here.

I came in with my wife for lunch today. Nobody was at the front, so we went to the restrooms to wash up.

When I came out, my wife was seated, waiting, while the staff was talking with a white family who was just coming in the door.

After a couple more minutes of waiting, I could tell my wife was a little upset. Turns out the staff never even addressed her but continued to seat white customers as they came in while she was just standing there all invisible.

So we walked out.

Nice job, Olive Garden.

When you're here, you're family (unless you're asian)."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm writing a review on Olive Garden. But I was here on Saturday night and the story needs to be told. 

Let's just say the group I was rollin with was a tad bit inebriated when we decided to do a family dinner. I mean what better place than the Gardens? Because when you're there, you're family. At least that's what we kept repeating all night long. 

So they set up our party of 10 or in this little alcove with one long dining table. Great move on their part - keep the drunk asses separated from the rest of the dining room. It took about 30 minutes to get bread and WATER! Let's not even get into how many times we asked for service. Honestly, I felt bad for the chick. They probably thought we weren't gonna tip. But hey, you have auto grat. Don't overlook us. This other guy server came out and was helping and ultimately he became our server. Typically, when I patron these corporate restaurant chains, I expect good service. I know they have corporate training and I know they have really high standards. I mean come on, they want your feedback. They give you those surveys to fill out. This particular occasion, the service was awful in the beginning. They started to make up for it, but it was already too far gone. 

So the food. Here's the thing about the Garden. They get you all kinds of stoked when you're watching their commercials. The food always look so melty and delicious. And then when you get there, FAIL. The food is cold and lackluster. I mean the only thing they have going for them is the endless salad. I can get down on that salad. But even the bread, I don't know why I say it's good. I really don't think it's good. I know it just comes in a bag frozen and they heat 'em up. 

I'm sure I'll be sucked in again by their commercials and then be disappointed. For the same prices, you can go to a local joint and get way better food and service."}
{"text":"Great Food, Good Prices.

Took my parents there for a nice dinner and Olive Garden didn't disappoint. We beat the crowd there so we didn't have to wait. All of our food came out hot, our drinks were refilled without waiting and the service was friendly.

Have eaten there four times before and I have never had a problem with this location.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had to scramble to arrive before closing time. We were given the table and a n excellent waitress took our order. We both ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and the salad. The proportions was large and very tasty. Even though we ate after closing time we were not rushed to leave.  This is one of the better Olive Garden restaurants we have visited"}
{"text":"Food was very good. We were very satisfied. Three of us ate and besides the entrees, the soups were excellent."}
{"text":"Food taste but, but service sucks, restaurant smells rotten, waiters don't know the menus"}
{"text":"Food is always good here. It is nice knowing that your meal in Pennsylvania will be the same in Georgia. I really like their specials and the server was very knowledgable about the menu. Had an iPad at the table that you could order drinks and apps from which was kinda cool."}
{"text":"I have to tell you, this is a 2.5 star review masquerading as a 3-star review.  And I only went with three because our server happened to write something cute on the little card that they pass out with every check now.

The food was really \"meh\" at this location.  I realize Olive Garden is not gourmet Italian food by any stretch, but the location I usually frequent has more more \"flavor.\"  

We also went and noon and were \"frowned upon\" by the wine server for not tasting (sorry, fresh out of church - not on a date!) and were not even OFFERED the lunch menu until we asked (which is a savings of $3/plate.)

As I said, our waitress was about 4 stars, the rest of the place about 2.  I think a solid 2.5 is good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were great experiences for me despite the bad reviews on here.

This location does get ridiculously packed all the time for some reason.  (Expect at least a 30 minute wait during dinner hours) but after we finally got seated, our service and food was always surprisingly good.  

The complimentary and delicious bread sticks and salad always came out to our table within 5 minutes, and let's not forget these are endless!  Drinks and food came really quick, surprisingly quick actually considering the huge crowd waiting outside.  Our servers have always been attentive and friendly.

Food is priced very expensive, but I think one knows that before they come here.  If you don't... well then you're in for a surprise.  Everything I've ever ordered though has been delicious and a big enough portion that I have enough for two big meals.  

I don't go here all the time because of the price,  but when I do, the experience has always been great.  Let's not forget that every time I went they were offering complimentary wine, pouring us full glasses of it.  If you don't mind the wait to get seated, I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know what happen to the Olive Garden company, but I can say that quality and service is not what is use to be. This location in particular is just plain horrible. Went in for lunch today and it really took them about 10 min for any waiter,busier. human being that works there to acknowledge me. When the waiter finally came and took my order she did deliver it pretty fast, although it was just a soup and salad meal, but when she brought my meal, the plate the she served me had left over sauce on the side very noticeable but then she just wipe it off like quickly with her hand thats just plain disgusting, also the soup that i got was just broth. I will probably never come back to this place, I do hope the health district on the other hand pays this place a visit."}
{"text":"Ordered to go and had to wait 20 minutes past the expected pickup time. The restaurant was not busy. My food was cold after a 6 minute drive home. Probably the worst looking calamari I've ever been served. Cold and it just tasted like bread.

 This particular Olive garden has issues. I could have sat down, ordered food, probably received it faster than the takeout here."}
{"text":"Is there any time you can come here and not wait for 35 minutes?  Why do people wait at this place? if ole Clint Eastwood was reviewing this, it would be like his \"spaghetti\" western - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

Good - salad bar and soup.

Bad - The italian food here is very expensive and doesn't really excite my taste buds.

Ugly - The price. How can this food cost the same as a proper italian restaurant. 

Service - not bad at all!



This is a great place to bring kids, but the wait is atrocious."}
{"text":"This place must be hit or miss from the reviews. Everything was on point for lunch. Got the chicken parm sandwich with fries and it was actually freakin delicious. Salad and bread sticks were good as normal. I give the experience a 4.5"}

{"text":"Went for dinner with mom.I had chicken parm.,she had lasagna.I thought maybe mine was the only one that was gross, had really no taste at all besides greasy.Her's was worst by far being black on bottom,yet was very uncooked in the middle.So disappointed,didn't even bother with dessert.We both have big sweet tooth's so that was major."}
{"text":"I have two small children one which happens to be in his TERRIBLE THREES. He saw a episode of Umi Zoomi that was all about meatballs. Which of course meant I had to find a place to get him some for dinner. 

It had been quite sometime since I had gone to Olive Garden. Generally the food leaves something to be desired but more so is back in the BAY AREA the service was TERRIBLE. 
This location totally CHANGED my mind. I will be back OFTEN. Our server Crystal was friendly, helpful and spot on. 

Not only did she make sure our glasses were filled but she always provided a smile.However the best part of the evening was when my son dropped one of his meatballs. She made sure to send two new ones over to our table free of charge . She saw it happened and took action. She didn't take time to even ask if we wanted more because she CARED enough to recall the whole reason we were even there was for MEATBALLS.

Often I get terrible service these days especially with my kids but this was one time a Restaurant Chain WON me as a customer."}
{"text":"They made my Mom happy but my eggplant parm was so hot it fogged my glasses and I couldn't eat it for so long they seriously need to be careful if I'd of eaten it not to mention the plate and the silver weAr had to be boxed with over mitts by my waitress overall beware of temps on your food"}
{"text":"I ordered to-go and it only took about 15 minutes. The food is good, the service was fast, overall good experience. Only complaint is I think the to go portions should be larger."}
{"text":"Food was too salty and waiter surly, was better at one time, maybe new cook or new management, have eaten there about 10 times over the years"}
{"text":"Today is my birthday and I wanted to celebrate with my family. It was a group of 16, and we called to make reservations. They told us they can't take reservations and it's BULLSHIT. Since when did that happen? Especially for such a large group? Hopefully they'll change their policy so someone else's birthday isn't ruined."}
{"text":"The service here during lunch hours has been amazing, thanks to our server Joey, and it being my first time... literally everything tastes great, the breadsticks, our appatizers, the soup, my entrees, even their salad here is amazing, 100% recommend and will come back!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful free Veterans Day meal at the Olive Garden at 4440 E.Sunset. Great selection of complete meals. The tiramisu was less than perfect...1 star deduction. Service was excellent . Be sure to arrive before 4:30
as it tends to get very busy. 
Thank You Olive Garden from myself and all Veterans past and present."}
{"text":"Worst Olive Garden ever!!! Bad service, server spilt drinks on our table, brought out wrong food, left a order off the ticket"}
{"text":"We've been here plenty of times before and it seems like its always crowded no matter what time or day.  The food is good and what I especially like is the unlimited soup or salad. In addition, the breadsticks are great and my 4 year old daughter can attest to this. 

The entrees here are very good and I know I'm going to get shunned for saying this but I'm not a big cheese eater. I come here due to my wife loving Italian food. Nevertheless I still love it here due to the breadsticks, spaghetti and soup.

I hope this review helps and Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Everything was good I just had the Zupa Toscana and the Salad tasty as ever and our waitress was so nice did a great job"}
{"text":"I used to really like the Olive Garden even though it is the Applebee's of Italian cuisine-so I knew what I was getting myself into.  The food has gone downhill.  Nothing seemed fresh, there was a \"frozen dinner heated in the microwave\" vibe to everything.  The other thing I noticed was the raunchy azz smell at this location.  The place didn't smell like food, it smelled like old, mildewed carpet.  The restaurant could use a slight remodel."}
{"text":"Seems every time I go to an Olive Garden, I leave completely satisfied.  This location, in which I went to while visiting in the area, was no different.  Like all Olive Gardens, quality of service and speed of food delivered is always in correlation to the time you patronize the restaurant.  I make it a point to stay away from this and these types of places during their busiest times.  I showed up this time pre-dinner on a Friday. Sat right down in the bar area, not crowded whatsoever. Kelly was my waitress, very nice and attentive.
Received the customary bread sticks (yummy) and my drink.  Wanted to go light and went with the Caprellini Pomodoro.  Excellent as always. Began with the always delicious minestrone soup. 

Finished my meal and departed.  Upon leaving, the lobby was PACKED!  And this is why I go early.  Great location, just across the street from the mall. 

There are a lot of other places in the area to eat, but I seem to get lucky whenever I visit Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I want the hours wasted in this place back. Waitress was clueless.  Waited half an hour for drinks after ordering.  Bread sticks arrived after main course was served.  Waitress never checked on us. Had to ask another waitress to find ours so we could order food. After ordering another 30 minute wait. When food showed up it was obvious it had been ready and sitting for some time. Pasta was starting to harden. We were there to celebrate my mother's birthday. Again couldn't find waitress so went to front to arrange a dessert for Mom. (by the way if you want you can buy a birthday cake but they don't do anything special or complimentary). So now waitress stops by and asks who wants the birthday cake? So much for that surprise.  20 minutes later waitress returns with slice of cake and proceeds to inform my mother that nobody is available to sing to her. \"here's your cake and happy birthday\". she's walks away. at this point all we could do was laugh.
thanks for the comic relief Olive Garden. You won't be seeing us again. 
oh the soup was good by the way!"}
{"text":"Olive Garden has been around for as far back as I can remember. I've been eating at this place my whole life, and while their food is nothing short of excellent, other elements of the restaurant leave a lot to be desired. 

First and foremost, the food. It's great. Olive Garden's Italian cuisine is far better than that of most other \"chain\" restaurants, and their prices won't break the bank either. I don't think I have ever come to this restaurant and not thoroughly enjoyed my entree. There is something for everyone on their menu - soups, salads, pasta dishes, italian sodas, desserts, it's all here. 

However, this location's service leaves a lot to be desired. The wait times are often ridiculous, even for a party of two! The employees are always friendly, but sometimes lacking mentally. One time, when I was seated in the cafe area, the waitress took our order without even writing it down. Minutes later, she comes out with a salad when my girlfriend clearly ordered soup. She was nice and corrected the mistake promptly, but said she \"though [my girlfriend] said salad.\" A, you should have written our order down. B, the words SOUND NOTHING ALIKE. Additionally, there have been times where they have been very slow in bringing out entrees/drinks/etc.

One thing I DO like about the restaurant, however, is that managers frequently come around and ask if everything is good. This way, if there IS a problem with your order, you have someone you can convey it to. They often give you the opportunity to perform surveys regarding your service, offering discounts on future visits for doing such. 

Olive Garden has great food and I will always eat here. However, don't come in here expecting the best of service.

{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day with a friend.  I'm not a big fan of OG to begin with, but my friend wanted to go there so I said ok.  I ordered the soup, salad and breadsticks.  My friend also had salad with her lunch. I got the minestrone soup and it was decent.  I finished that, and the waitress asked me if I wanted some more soup, I said, no thank you. Can you bring some more salad? I was almost done with it and was planning on sharing more with my friend.  The salad never showed up.  She came back to refill my drink with some weird flavored iced tea when I had unsweetened tea with a lemon still in my glass.

After a few minutes, she came back and asked if we wanted more bread, we said no.  

Finally, we got all the way to the end of our lunch and before she brought our check, she asked if we wanted anything else.  At this point, I said no.  I had been waiting the last half hour for more salad that never showed up, now I just want to leave.

Since I don't normally come to OG, I probably won't start especially after this experience."}
{"text":"Not sure how I have not reviewed this place yet. We go here at least once a month.

I love the soup salad and breadsticks...could make myself sick.

Their peach tea is fantastic (but be prepared for it to be really sweet, if you don't like sweet tea order something else).

Can't say I have had a bad experience here, there have been busy experiences where the place is packed but never horribly bad experiences. 

It is a fun place to go with the family and the food is good. I like the new promotion to order and take the entree for the next day (cause seriously isn't that what everyone does now anyway?)

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Mediocre pasta.  Looks like they actually reduced the number of pasta dishes on their menu since we were last here.  I don't know what that's about, but I think that LESS pasta on the menu of an Italian restaurant is not a good idea.  Salad was great at first, then I bit into a pepperoncini that about burned the sh*t out of my mouth.  I've had spicy ones before-- this one was like a jalapeño.  Wrecked my tongue for the next ten minutes.  Bread sticks were great at always.

Service was pretty good.  Overall ok.  Still better than Lo Cascio's in Tempe--any place would be better for Italian food than Lo Cascio's.  I'd make a Yelp list for Italian joints called \"Better than Lo Cascio's,\" but that would pretty much include every Italian restaurant in the Valley.

So-so pasta in a semi-formal environment--that's Olive Garden.  It's a place for birthday dinners, first dates, and \"I'm retired, it's been forever since I took my family out to some place nice, so I'm going to take them all out to the Olive Garden--here's my Visa card.\"

'Nuff said."}
{"text":"It started off good the server was nice and took our order right away, answered our questions and filled our drinks when they were empty. Right after our food came out the issues began, my food was cold and I could tell it had been sitting up in the window for a while before it was brought out to me. I waited for the server to come over so I could tell her and she could hopefully resolve the issue but she never came. I waited about 15 minutes (enough time for my boyfriend to finish his food and pay over the tablets they keep at the table) after waiting I got annoyed and just wanted to go home. I went to the host stand and got a box and left. As I was leaving I saw the server in the back on her phone still wasn't checking on us. Definitely won't be back there any time soon."}
{"text":"After several bad experiences this was a nice break.  Thanks to Catharine our server who was very attentive and quick to check on us often!  A big smile and friendly attitude is always nice thanks.  I tried the apricot chicken low fat meal and was pleasantly surprised, it was still of flavor and enough to fulfill my appetite."}
{"text":"5 stars goes to BRENDA! Came here with my family at 11:30am before I start my afternoon class. Our server was Brenda and she has to be one of the best server I've ever had! Throughout our experience, she kept a big smile on her face and had a positive/ upbeat energy. She's absolutely the sweetest! She was VERY attentive and made sure to have our food come out fast so I wouldn't be late for school. Thank you Brenda!"}
{"text":"This was an awful experience! I was craving Olive Gardens unlimited salad and breadsticks and it was better left as a memory.  The hostess was zombie like and never smiled once and even though the entire restaurant was empty we were seated in a booth where a section of carpet was missing?!! The calamari tasted like microwaved rubber and I sent it back. The only highlight was our waitress an older woman who was really sweet. I won't go back."}
{"text":"What a fun experience!! Came here for the last day of my pasta pass, and this place was a rock'n'!!  That didn't slow the service 1 bit!!  Manager Sarah and bar staff Rebecca and Britney were on point, regardless of the obstacles thrown their way. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"For a very busy Friday night I have no complaints. Our wait time was about 25 minutes and once we were seated everything ran smoothly. I highly recommend our server Leo he was a really nice guy. I also recommend their pumpkin cheesecake it's a seasonal thing but amazing. It was a little loud on Friday lots of birthday parties but it wasn't terrible.

All in all it's good food that tastes exactly the same every time you order it which is why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tour of Italy and everything was great except the lasagna. It had entirely too much fennel seed and was over cooked. I informed the waitress and she offered another item and I given fettuccine Alfredo. The waitress was wonderful, she advised us that she was hard of hearing at her beginning of service, and I appreciated that. Otherwise we would have kept repeating ourselves and becoming frustrated. Overall the service was amazing, but the food lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I've been to Olive Garden before but not this location.  The night started out on a bad note when another customer outside the restaurant got a little irritated with my husband for walking between her and her group. She gets one star and a Quick Tip: Don't block the walkway beyatch!! Moving on to the actual restaurant: They have the best minestrone and breadsticks!! I could have filled up on those alone but I forced myself to save room for Seafood Alfredo. My dish was good although I like my shrimp and scallops a little bigger. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed, as she was obviously rushing. Overall, a pretty good experience. The soup and breadsticks will always bring me back!"}
{"text":"While the food was adequate what made this such a great experience was our server. Our server was Sunday and she did an absolutely amazing job and was one of the best servers we've ever had at any restaurant. Thank you for the service."}
{"text":"If you want terrible service and microwaved food for way too much money, this is the place for you! $42 for 2 lunches with no drinks!!!  Everyone who works here was obviously unhappy and it shows. Took forever. Maybe need more microwaves???  Looked for manager to complain, he is as hard to find as the waitress - perhaps he knows it's terrible?!"}
{"text":"Just want to start by saying that whenever I dine in my experience is always good. But it seems like whenever I have a to-go order there's always something to upset me. 

This past experience was just unacceptable. So I placed an online order, which for those who don't know is a 30 mins in advance prefer so there should have no problems at all when going to pick up. Well, that's what I expected/thought it should be like. I came in about 10 minutes after the time I was given that my food would be ready, it wasn't. Finally comes out in a basket and is sitting on top of a counter and I'm next in line waiting for the lady to run my card. She Runs it and tells me \"I have another order to bag then yours will be ready\".. i say okay thinking she would go do those orders right away that are paid and ready to go, I was wrong again. instead of getting those bagged up she started taking other orders. Another guy joins her at the counter just standing there watching the lady type on the cash register. So at this point I'm becoming frustrated cause not only is my food already paid for and just sitting there, but it's also not under a heating lamp so it's getting colder as time goes on. about 10 mins later I was approached assuming by the manager since she wasn't in the same uniform as every other worker was, she could tell I was becoming impatient so she asked if she could get me a drink while I waited. I let her know that I didn't want a drink, I just wanted my already paid for food that was just sitting on the counter for the past 10 mins that wasn't being acknowledged. She then apologized and helped me herself. I live 4 mins away from this location and by the time I got there my food was barely even warm anymore.

But what I'm getting at is that the To-Go services needs a lot of work or more help because this wasn't my first bad experience with it But thank you to the manager for jumping in and helping me when the workers wouldn't"}
{"text":"I was craving some Soup, Salad and Breadsticks. We sat at the bar area. Our waitress took forever, I asked for menus and then went into the bathroom. It look like they have not been cleaned in months! Totally disgusted. Went back to the table, still no menus. I asked the hostess. All set, ready to order.

They brought the Food, the salad looked old, lettuce was dry. Dressing was on the side of the bowl, so messy. Breadsticks we stale, hard, and hardly any flavor. Soup was just ok.  The restaurant has definitely gone down hill. Maybe it's just this location? But we won't be back."}
{"text":"Friends and I went to OG Monday for chicken fettuccine alfredo.  We had not been to this location before.  Big mistake... this was the worst meal ever.  We had been to OG's before at different locations.  My friend got sick from it and mine was so bad that I could hardly eat it. The fettuccine was rubbery & hard, alfredo sause was worse than the \"jar\" nasty stuff.  If we had sent it back the meal would have been the same.
We will Never, never..ever go back to this OG!
I really love fettuccine alfredo and have purchased
store bought which was so much better than this OG restraunt's!  
We have not tried any other foods here. When we asked for water  the waitress never brought it so my friend found some at the bar for us.
If you like fettuccine alfredo go go here for it!
It could be that the cook was just not good at making it, the meal definitely was Not good!
If i could give a minus Zero I would!"}
{"text":"I came here for a weekday lunch.  My server was friendly and delivered fast service.  I was informed that my choices were fast and I was asked if I was OK with that and how I wanted things timed.  In addition, I requested an order to-go.  After I was finished eating, my server realized they forgot to place an order for the stuffed mushrooms I requested.  The server apologized and I asked for them to-go.  In addition, they were removed from the bill, which I found to be generous.

While service was great, I wasn't impressed with the food.  The chicken and gnocchi soup was flavorful, but it was lukewarm.  The minestrone soup I had to-go was bottom of the kettle from the day before, with small vegetable pieces and a lot of broth.  The pasta to-go was not cooked through and was doughy.  I highly doubt a pasta can go from properly cooked to the consistency of raw bread dough within 5 hours.  In addition, I found the amount of sauce and flavor to not be quite up to par."}
{"text":"Why is it I always order the chicken parmigiana and am always disappointed with the chicken. Great service. Not in a great area but the inside is nice. Breadsticks are one of the best things you can have. I love breadsticks."}
{"text":"I love love Olive Garden when it comes to simple pasta and salad. But never have I ever received such horrible service from the kitchen. It makes me feel sick to my stomach thinking about it. 

After a long day of work and just wanting to relax for the evening with my friend, my friend was served legit raw chicken on top of her Alfredo! 
First off we sat in the bar because we didn't want to wait for a table in the dining area. I believe the bartender was in training because he seemed lost and was taking direction from the woman behind the bar. 

My friend and I ordered the pasta to go specials, order one take one home. So we both got the chicken Alfredo with the salad and bread sticks. 
The wait for our food wasn't so long, when the waiter/bartender brought out our food my plate looked great however my friends plate clearly still had raw red chicken laying on top of the pasta. (To be clear this WAS NOT the one you TAKE HOME) We both just stared and thought it was a joke to see if we would notice it or not.  You would think the sever grabbing it from the kitchen would notice the chicken still raw, I mean cmon it sliced up for you to see that I'm about to get E. coli if I don't look at it myself. And secondly what the hell is wrong with the kitchen, the cook?! Seriously it quality not quantity and how fast you can get it out of the kitchen. The bartender/ waiter just out our plates down and luckily the woman behind the bar heard us and Immediately took the plate back and apologized. Second attempt the food was brought out and the chicken was still raw?!?! How is that possible ?!!! Third attempt the sous chef or whatever you want to call him brought out the plate and looked pissed off layed the plate down didn't apologize and just walked away. Ok by the third time my friend was not having it and already lost her appetite. What a way to ruin the night after a long work day. The guy who was in training laughed and said \"third times a charm \" not it's not third time shouldn't have happened and that plate should of been removed from my bill and an apology from management and kitchen! 
Next time your here take a look at your plate because the kitchen and staff don't know the difference between raw and cooked chicken."}
{"text":"Came here upon the request of a family member. We would never go here. The food was basic, lacked flavor, and was inauthentic. The service was okay, our server was nice but didn't know how to do her job. She forgot to ask about a couple of things and had to come back with her pen and pad. The restaurant smells of a cheese every time, and I don't like the smell at all. There are small children everywhere with parents that could not care, as why we stray away from places like this. The prices are good but the food is cheap and flavorless. The salad is bad because of the extremely large vegetables not cut well. The bathrooms are dirty, smell of uncleanliness, and are impractical. The breadsticks are extremely fake and tasteless. Stick to the real Italian if you don't have picky children or an extremely empty wallet. One positive is the mints they give after the meal, very good!"}
{"text":"Before I moved to Arizona I did go to Olive Garden. Please don't tell any of the Italian restaurants that I respect. My only defense is a $25 gift card, can't let that go to waist.

1st Note:  When I walked in I did realize how much I miss the bread sticks and the salad served at the table is always a great way to start a meal.

This might be my third chain review but the service deserves to be yelped about.  My server started off with an free offer for a tasting of a glass of red wine.  I said \"why not\"
After dinner a manager offered a complimentary small dessert  with  choice between strawberry or lemon tart.

What an experience, I actually want to go back to this Olive garden. 

Also joan B. with one review and one star, I'm a minority, I even walked in a half hour before close and everyone seemed please greet us at restaurant.  Maybe they have shaped up their policies.  

This place deserved the very hard to give corporate 4 star and sets this place a little higher than the other Olive Gardens, Bottom line the service was so hospitable I had to be the fourth person to yelp about it.

{"text":"Breadsticks breadsticks breadsticks  lmao I can't get enough! Especially with Alfredo sauce!!! Mmm anyway haha we ordered it to go 2days ago because I can't really go out of the house (had a baby) and I was concerned it would not be as good. . . However it still tasted great and the way they package everything up keeps it fresh. The soup was still hot and breadsticks were still really good."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my parents after we worked out, so we were starving. Monique was our server and she was spectacular and attentive. The entire staff was effective together it seemed as several people came by to help bag our to go boxes etc. Noreena also came by and chatted with us for a bit and she was also absolutely wonderful. It seems like they have a great team here and it really boosted our experience from being just a quick dinner since we couldn't get together for Mother's Day yesterday to a really enjoyable and memorable experience. Food was great, waters were regularly refilled. Absolutely no complaints, keep on rocking!"}
{"text":"deliziosa italiano stasera!! 

We usually don't do chain -restaurant Italian but we were in a rush and it sounded great!! We were greeted at the door and sat immediately in a cute little BOOTH!( one other reason we avoid OG is they never used to have booths) Our waitress, I wish I'd written down her name, was prompt, polite, knowledgeable and super friendly!! 
We tried the wine of the night and it was a nice crisp Sauvignon Blanc and also the House moscato red. Both were delish. 
I ordered theChicken Marsala with garlic mashed potatoes and my daughter had some type of chicken with roasted peppers and angel hair pasta!! Excellente' !! 
The house salad was perfectly dressed and the warm fresh soft breadsticks were on point tonight!  Just the perfect amount of Parmesan cheese was freshly grated and even though we may have wanted it heavy, our waitress obliged with a smile! 
Can't wait for the holidays; might just go back again!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Olive Garden location. Me and my husband live in Indian trail and we drive the 30 mins every time to come here. Today we came during the dinner rush, and it was absolutely packed. But that didn't faze our server. Brandon was incredible. He was on top of things, made excellent and delicious suggestions, our drinks were never empty, and he answered all of our questions with kindness and grace. He was so patient. The manager (unfortunately I didn't get her name) was also very polite and also incredible. I got the create your own pasta, with the Rigatoni pasta, and the asiago garlic Alfredo, and I added the sautéed shrimp as well as the Grilled chicken. It was splendid and mouth watering. My husband got the tour of Italy and loved it. We recommend getting the Angry Alfredo sauce for your bread sticks, we couldn't get enough!"}
{"text":"Friendly, professional serious staff, with prompt service, good food & drinks...phew, what more can one ask! Will be back,?especially since across from superb Galaxy Green Valley theatre!"}
{"text":"Fairly decent with a group of 14 for a birthday party. Certainly not going to be done within an hour, but would have been had it only been 4 of us. Well over 2 hours; but service was good. Food was consistent and hot. Drinks flowed throughout. Just need them to properly plan better for a party."}
{"text":"So far I've had a really terrible experience here which included offensive language from staff and a mediocre meal. But our recent visit was amazing. Moving forward, we'll request the \"bar dining\".  Service was the complete opposite as our first visit."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak Gorgonzola, eating my food only to find someone's disgusting finger nail in there. Not to mention your standing waiting forever to be serviced when two girls are right by the front chatting it up paying no attention to the customers waiting to place a hold for their seat. I will make the drive out to the one on Parma from here on."}
{"text":"If you enjoy humorous and super engaging servers, along with great service, ask for Bre or Austin. Was hesitant about going to lunch alone but I was over it as soon as they started serving me. I'll be back for sure, just for them. Tried the Smoked Mozzarella Chicken for the first time, sooo good."}
{"text":"The only good thing is can say about this restaurant was the greeters were very nice. Our server is definitely in the wrong business. I ordered soup and salad to brought out with my husbands meatball fritter. Next thing I know I have my food. My husband received his after I ate my meal. He asked for no mushrooms. He received mushrooms. I had to ask for more soup and water. A party of 4 were seated and it took the same waiter 5 minutes before even acknowledging them and that was to only tell them it would be awhile before he could even take their drink order. I also witnessed another server setting at his customers table when he took their order and dropped off their drinks. Food was very bland. No garlic taste to the bread sticks and we're hard as a rock and hardly any dressing on the salad. Won't be going back to this place again."}
{"text":"We come to this location every once in a while.  Thus is about m6 last two visits.  We are a family of 4.  The first rolled silverware had food still stuck on it, the next rolled silverware looked like it never even went thru the dishwasher.  They say the third times a charm - I finally got clean utensils so I could eat my salad.

Most recent visit we decided to order an appetizer, something we never do and probably never will again.  See the picture included to show what almost $12 buys you as an app.  They don't even dress the apps the same as when they are a sampler.  See fried cheese and Parmesan zucchini. 

Waitress indicated that if she brought the mgr over he would double it. He did but it hardly makes up for the initial impression."}
{"text":"This review is bittersweet because I am a former employee (until 1997), but the truth must be told.

We arrive very excited at our table, only to sit there 5-6 minutes before a server comes to greet us. I would have been more tolerant had the place been packed to the gills, but surprisingly this Saturday afternoon at 1pm was relatively slow.

Found out they no longer carry Sicilian Splash, that was a real downer (gone for 8 months apprently)

Our server was great, once she actually arrived on the scene, and was attentive to our needs. Above average.

Now the bottom line: pricing. This location is gorgeous, ,totally decked out and beautiful. It has to be build into the prices because they ARE too expensive for what they offer.

Don't get me wrong, the food itself is above average, but the prices are above above above average. Get it? :)

I think with Oregano's opening in Chandler (Feb '11) is going to take away from Olive Garden's share, ALOT, as they are now running 1 1/2-2 hours waits in the evening.

I used to have an intimate love affair with you OG, but alas I have a new mistress"}
{"text":"It's American style food, service is nice welcoming. Foods are cheesy and tasty. You should definitely get both starter and desserts and share"}
{"text":"Ray with his cool mustache is an awesome waiter. It is so rare to come across customer service skills like his. The hostess was also very friendly, I didn't catch her name though and the food was on point."}
{"text":"This actually happened a while back and I just remembered to write this review. My mom and I decided to go to Olive Garden one day after a few hours of shopping. She had already had food before but didn't mind going with me. We decided to only order one plate of chicken scampi to share between us. The waitress asked if we would like the noodles to be split into two plates and I didn't see why not. You know what? I made the wrong choice. I was shocked when I saw the chicken scampi. The size of those two plates of noodles added together was even smaller than the normal one plate with no split. I immediately complained to the waitress and she suggested speaking to the manager. The manager didn't seem very friendly, and said this is the normal size and we would have to pay extra money if we wanted more noodles. That's absolutely ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with two people ordering only one plate of food. For anyone that's reading this review, next time you want to share food with your friends, make sure you tell the waiters not to split the food for you, because the size will magically shrink!"}
{"text":"I have always loved the Olive Garden--as one of the best chain-type restaurants.  They have the best bread sticks and all you can eat salad.  The salad is my favorite!  It's always so fresh & tasty!  

Tonight we're in Madison WI and decided to dine at the Olive Garden.  When we arrived we were told the wait would be 10 minutes--not bad for a Friday.  We were seated in less than 7 minutes!  Our waiter was great & the salad and breadsticks are always awesome!   I ordered the shrimp primavera.  It was a large portion, tasty--but the shrimp were a bit fishy tasting.  I ate what I could and boxed up the rest--about 1/2, leaving the rest of the shrimp there.   My son had the capellini pomodoro, my husband--the chicken Parmesan.  Both enjoyed their meals as well.  I'll avoid the shrimp dishes here, from now on!  But--still like Olive Garden restaurants!!"}

 Thru have changed the sauce in the Portobello Ravioli, not for the better. Heartbreaking, luckily I was able to console myself with breadsticks and salad. The server was listening as I explained to my family that I NEEDED their garlicky goodness, and when she saw a new batch pop out of the oven she brought me my own toasty basket! Love!
 We had my Grandson, the first time we brought him to a restaurant without his Mama, and he was served his very own apple juice, and checked on as often as the rest of us! I think he would rate 5 stars, we won't know for a while as his communication skills are lacking.
 My Daughter was missing a drink they used to have and the server worked with the bartender to get one as close as possible, and succeeded.
 My Son loves the Zuppa Tuscano, and it was hot and good. My Mom, after saying she hates wine, got a glass the waitress talked her into trying and promptly ordered a glass.
 My Girlfriend ordered the Lasagna, which she said tasted great, it smelled like dirty crotch.  :/. It did taste good. Why she makes me smell things and insists I taste them is beyond me.
 Finished our night with Lemon Chiffon Cake, Tiramisu, and a rousing Happy Birthday, and if it weren't for the manager looking sour, and off putting sauce on my fungus ravioli it would have been 5+!"}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE!!  OVERPRICED AND THE FOOD WAS/IS TERRIBLE! The food was salty, bland for a price that is outrageous!  

I will NEVER return to this establishment!  IF this is how ALL Olive Garden's operate then I will never eat at ANY Olive Garden again!  This whole meal was a joke and disaster from the start.  My roommate and I only ordered water with lemon to start our meal along with the two choice appetizer option for around $10.  We received our water and then we ordered lunch.  I had ordered the classic lasagna for $8.99 and my roommate ordered the Shrimp Scampi for $15.99.  Pricey but we have eaten at Olive Garden before and you do have to pay a little more for Italian food in some restaurants.  This was NOT worth it. It was not worth the price for anything we ordered.  We actually received refills of our water before we actually received our appetizer and \"endless\" salad.  When the appetizer arrived, we were speechless and not in a good way.  
Our endless salad bowl was barely half filled and there was hardly any leaves of lettuce, probably a WHOLE onion sliced, several dozen croutons, a few olives and a few grape tomatoes covered and smothered in the saltiest Italian dressing that seriously could not have been their signature Italian salad dressing as I have purchased the bottle from the stores and actually enjoy that. Our endless bread sticks?  We received 3 bread sticks for 2 people.  Not a big deal but if they are ENDLESS then give us an even number if there is an even number of people.  This didn't make any sense to either of us.  Do we split a bread stick and ask for more??
    Our appetizer wasn't much better.  It was the two choice appetizer option.  I chose mozzarella sticks and my roommate chose the calamari.  What we received was an absolute disgrace to what Olive Garden used to serve.  The calamari was so small, it resembled crumbs and the rings wouldn't even fit around my little finger.  I received three mozzarella sticks. Yes, THREE. They resembled three thin slices of mozzarella cheese coated in breading.  THIS WAS $10! Not impressed.  We waited another 15 minutes for the rest of our food.  My roommate received her shrimp scampi and immediately saw something was wrong.  The noodles were drowning.  My roommate began to eat her food and it was worse than it looked.  The noodles were extremely soft, drowning in a sauce that was too salty at first taste then an overload of pepper.  The shrimp tasted like it was cooked an hour ago because it was warm at best but edible.  I know this because she had me taste her meal because: 1.  My food still had not arrived and 2. She couldn't finish it and she had me try it.  I almost wish I didn't.  
     My Classic Lasagna arrived.  Well, to describe my lasagna I have to make a comparison.  Just about everyone here knows the size of the SMALLEST frozen lasagna you can buy from Stouffer's in the frozen food section of any store.  It's approx. 4 inches x 4 inches in the plastic and costs around $3, give or take where you shop.  What I received from Olive Garden was even smaller than this and cost three times what Stouffer's is.  I had to move my fork over to take a picture of the \"whole\" lasagna because the fork covered it almost completely!  Before this, I can honestly say that upon receiving this bowl of the world's smallest lasagna that I have never had a true moment in my life where I had to blink a few times to believe what was in front of me.  Well, I had that moment here. This particular Olive Garden actually has a special sized dish/bowl for this \"piece of ravioli\" they call lasagna in a bowl for a lunch special. Well, there was nothing special about this lasagna or meal at all. The sauce was bland and I actually wished it was Stouffer's lasagna.  We just wanted to leave.  Well, the price for this catastrophe? $37 total!! Keep in mind, we only had water and this does not include tip!  We should have gone to Bob Evan's half a mile down the road from this disaster and that's where we will go next time.
     Overall, I don't recommend this Olive Garden to anyone and I will NEVER return here!  Beware of the ridiculously small portions that are overpriced combined along with very poor quality for Olive Garden that is either bland or salty.  I hope all Olive Garden's have not turned into this but this is one I will avoid.  Plenty of other choices in the area."}
{"text":"Another date night! This one wasn't my choice though, and knowing how I feel about chains as well as my high standards for Italian cuisine, I bit my tongue and hoped for the best.

We had to wait about 10 minutes on a Tuesday night to be seated. Apparently Olive Garden is a hot commodity in Champaign....

We were seated and I was quite indecisive about what to get. I settled on a build-your-own-pasta with alfredo/cream sauce and added Italian sausage. For my choice of soup, I got the Tuscan bean, and of course the notorious breadsticks. The soup was pretty tasty, it had like beans and zucchini and onions and a bunch of other things in a tasty tomato-y broth. Not bad! The pasta I got wasn't too bad either, the noodles may have been a little overcooked but the sauce was pretty creamy. I did not like the sausage. I'm no tubular meat expert but this tasted really institutional and for the upcharge it cost to add it to my pasta, I probably should have just went meatless or ordered the chicken, like my smarter date did....

The thing that really upset me about the experience though was the service. I don't remember the server's name, he was actually quite personable, but our meal felt very very rushed. Our soups came out quick which was good, but I was not even halfway done with mine before our dinners had arrived and we had to move our soups out of the way to eat our dinner. I'd consider myself a fast eater, too so this was frustrating, especially since I wanted to actually talk to my date, you know, the reason why I'm here in the first place!! This wasn't the last straw though, I was probably 75% done with my entrée when the server comes up and asks if we are interested in desert. Ugh! We looked at each other and both agreed this meal was unnecessarily rushed. At that point I just asked for the bill which he pulled up on those tacky tablet things a lot of chain restaurants have now.

The food wasn't even as bad as I thought it was going to be, but the hurriedness of the service really put me off. 2/5"}
{"text":"It started out really well. Was seated in less than 10 minutes and our server started out great, but it went downhill from there. 
The food was great but they forgot our appetizer. Trying to find our server was impossible. Had to keep asking for refills n they forgot to bring out the dessert for my friends bday. When it came to paying the check....once again had to find the server. Keep in mind it wasn't that busy.  Got the busboy to finally take our check. Maybe ill just try another location."}
{"text":"So we just got out of a movie and wanted something to eat for lunch but since it was Father's Day we didn't know what to do. So we called Olive Garden and they had the least wait time so we headed over there. Now to be honest I like Olive Garden for what it is, a decent chain. I know what will be on the menu and I know what I like and I know how it will taste. There is no difference between one Olive Garden and the other except for service and that is what I got here in droves. Our waiter was very attentive, very courteous and efficient. The food was what I expected and was very tasty and flavourful. I had the shrimp with pasta and it was good. I am a fan of the bread-sticks and soup. My desert was good. Nothing out of the ordinary food-wise but that is why I chose OG. I was pleasantly surprised with the good service and will be back again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they think they are the only game in town. Charging an incrementally increasing delivery fee the more you order. For \"their time\". Crazy policy. Makes you NOT want to order more or in my case, cancel my order. 
Too bad for them. I order a lot. They could have made a lot of money. Short sighted. 
News flash people: you serve PASTA. Lol"}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and came here to eat dinner with our family from Arizona and had a really good experience. Our server was very attentive and everything was served hot and delicious (sometimes our food has been cold/luke warm). Overall, we had a great experience and we will be back to this location when visiting family."}
{"text":"Sometimes I really love this place. I love the soup especially. I could probably eat it every day if such things were possible. But sometimes I really hate this place. Sometimes the service leaves something to be desired. Went out for a lunch a few days ago and ended up walking out because the server failed to greet us when we sat down. No drinks. No hello. No I'll be right with you. Nothing. The table next to us got served right away so we left. It's just very touch and go here. You never know what you may get service wise. Food is always good though so that's where the three stars comes in."}
{"text":"Recently took my mother there for her birthday. We both ordered the unlimited soup, salad, and bread sticks. Every time I visit an Olive Garden, I always get the same thing and have never had a problem. I guess this would teach me to never take anything for granted because I ended up getting this hard piece of something plastic in my soup. Didn't notice it at first because I had dropped a piece of light lettuce in my soup so I figured it was just that until I put it in my mouth! I promptly told the waiter who took it away and then came back asking if the manager came over yet. He didn't. About 5 minutes later, the manager came over and apologized and walked away. I then heard him offer a free meal to a customer behind me who received red peppers on their meal when they ordered it red pepper free.

Red peppers....when I got plastic! 

Horrible service! I do love the Olive Garden, though.... but I won't be back at this one anytime soon."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've had many good meals at Olive Garden...just not recently. It may be a case of one location having issues. The prior meal that I had at Olive Garden was at the Pineville NC location and the service was not good. In my most recent visit to the Pineville NC location the service was much better. However the food was not,...much better. The predominance of salt in the pasta was just too much. In addition it would be a nice plus if the dish served even faintly resembled...food.  All in all not a good outing. I ll have to say that I'm done with OG or at least done with the Pineville NC location ."}
{"text":"Excellent service. I couldn't believe how crowded it was at 4:45pm. My Wife's Grandma loves this place and since she is 97 she can choose any place she wants. Our waitress was a pleasure. She offered some sample wines for everyone at the table (7 of us). Everything was great. Only one issue at the table was not enough sauté spinach (very small amount) eventually they got it right. I was very pleased with my chicken it was cooked just right. The only problem we had was finding the place do to the construction of a new road right in front of it. So if your visiting don't trust your GPS. Turn into the big shopping center with Loews in it and it's in there next to Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Worst service  EVER waited over 10 minutes to get drink or drinks, 45 minutes and our appetizer still had NOT arrived. Asked to speak with he manger he too do not arrive. 1 hour and 5 Minutes our meals finally arrived the noodles on one plate were COLD like taken out of the refrigerator. 

I would NEVER go back..."}
{"text":"I feel a little bad giving Olive Garden 4 stars because I've given non-chain fancy Italian restaurants 4 stars before. Just a disclaimer im not comparing Olive Garden to all Italian restaurants. If I was this would get 2 stars. I'm comparing this particular Olive Garden restaurant to other Olive Garden restaurants and other casual chain Italian restaurants. 

What I like the most about this place was the customer service. Everyone was really nice and we got our orders in quick, our waters and drinks refilled, all with a great friendly attitude. It was buy one get one time which is awesome!  You pay the same price but get an extra order of pasta to go for free!  I got the spaghetti with meat sauce, and the rest of our table got cheese ravioli, and mozzeralla chicken. 

The endless soups were delicious. I had two. I got the zuppa Tuscano and the chicken gnocchi. Both were cream based soups with good flavor. I really enjoyed my pasta. I love bolognese and this sauce was not bad. I just wish there was more of it. I thought it was too much pasta for the amount of sauce they gave. 

I ate my take home pasta the next day. I heated it up and it was tasty. Some people don't like eating leftovers when the sauce is already on the pasta. However I didnt think the sauce made the pasta mushy or soft."}
{"text":"I was kind of disappointed in this visit to Olive Garden.

A group of eight of us went to dinner on a Thursday evening.  We were seated quickly and since someone in our party could not walk very far they offered to sit us in the very front in the room somewhat sectioned off.  Our service was AMAZING! since we were a larger party they had two waiters helping us.  They were very attentive, constantly refilled our drinks, brought our food out quickly and had the unlimited salad/breadsticks constantly at our table.
You can't go wrong with the salad and breadsticks!! 
As for some of the issues we had, I ordered the rosemary and garlic chicken and the chicken was lukewarm.  The potatoes and spinach were pretty good.
My grandma is not able to eat anything spicy whatsoever and can not eat any black pepper.  We figured she could eat some grilled chicken with vegetables. However this was not an option.   The waitress claimed everything is already pre marinated and the only sauces that didnt have pepper was a garlic, butter sauce. I was completely shocked that they couldnt even make some grilled chicken that wasnt seasoned.  It was pretty evident that all their food must come pre packaged and not made in house.  My grandparents had to stick to the salad and breadsticks and were not able to eat anyting else. (partly because at this point they were kind of frustrated)  
I recommend picking somewhere else if someone in your group has any issues related to this."}
{"text":"They kept people moving while waiting for a table which was great. Server was very nice. Food was a little slow getting out but the salad held us over. Overall this is a great location and runs smoothly"}
{"text":"My family and I live eating at Olive Garden. We love their food. This review is specifically for the location next to the superstition springs mall. The staff at this place is some of the rudest and impolite people in the business. Smiling and happy servers, waiters make for a happy eating out experience. And if a happy eating out experience is what you are looking for then do yourself a favor and go some place else. The peopl here don't care about the customer. They just to you eat , leave them a tip and get the hell out there to make room for the next set of fools."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is one of my favorite Italian restaurants and I end up coming here if one is in the neighborhood. I've tried them in a couple of cities and they are consistent in terms of taste and quality. It is almost like the same person cooks the food everywhere."}
{"text":"We are from Honolulu and don't have an Olive Garden, so we stopped by this one on Decatur. Our waiter, Terry P. was very friendly, informative and attentive. My husband and I had the minestrone and yummy breadsticks to start.Then I had the chicken and shrimp carbonara (yum) and my husband had spaghetti and meatballs. We were too full for dessert but I still took an order of tiramisu to go to eat at our hotel. The only thing wrong was no fork with my take out dessert other than that a yummy and enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went in late to the restaurant and were the last ones to be seated. We got to sit on the left side of the bar, we didn't care just because we really wanted to eat there. Our waiter/bartender Robert was one of the best servers we have ever had in vegas so far! He was so funny and helpful. We had the sampler and shared a tour of Italy! When you are in the neighborhood, go to olive garden ask for Robert! He's the man!!"}
{"text":"Cant usually go wrong with olive garden had Leanna as my waitress, great service and great food she was on top of everything"}
{"text":"Had to give a star. Otherwise ZERO.  Horrible service.  We sat and waited 10 minutes for service.  Even after asking for a waiter no one came. We left.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Food was terrible.  Worst service ever.  Because of these reasons, everything is over-priced.  The \"waitress\" twice interrupted me while taking my order to talk to customers behind her.  This place needs to be closed.  The only reason I give this place a 1-star rating is because there is no zero-star or negative-star rating!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with my wife and daughters. We all agree the food was great and the service was awesome!  The hostess, I wish I remembered her name, was great and made our youngest daughter feel special. Henry, our server, was awesome.  He treated us like we were at his own home! Great dining experience all around.  This will be our Olive Garden for now on."}
{"text":"Not impressed,  food was dry and just not up to par.  Had a lot better at other Olive Gardens."}
{"text":"Our server was Donna she made our experience fantastic! We ordered soup salad and bread sticks and she truly went above and beyond and I would return again just to sit in her Section!"}
{"text":"Worst experience at Olive Garden in over 15 years of patronage. Reception was rude when our party of nine came in at 5 pm on thursday without a reservation. Though we were seated quickly, waiters took over 15 mins to being water and 20 mins for the drinks, which were incorrect for almost half the party. Was over a 90 minite wait for food. Even after expressing our dissatisfaction, management made no effort to improve our experience or compensate for our horrible experience. I am probably never going to Olive Garden again and will tell anyone I can that this place is a complete waste of money, time and frustration. Get your stuff together OG"}
{"text":"love this place! always fast and good service and great food"}
{"text":"Ordered the soup and salad.  Not enough dressing on the salad.  Had to ask for more dressing on it.  The first soup I got was cold.  Could tell that it was sitting out a while.  We had a party of 7 and they brought out the 2 salad bowls that could barely feed 4 people total.  Not sure if I would recommend this location...."}
{"text":"If you know me, you would know that I'm not a real big fan of Italian food, let alone an Italian chain restaurant.  Pasta to me is just not ranked up as one top food choices.  Being an avid Yelper, I'm always willing to try new things and spend money to get the opportunity to continue one of my favorite hobbies.  With that being said, I decided to meet a few great friends for dinner one night at the big OG. Apparently they LOVE OG, but I didn't see eye to eye with that view, however, I was willing to go and keep an open mind.

What I do appreciate about all OGs is the home feel you get when you walk in the restaurant.  It's super cozy and is filled with warm colors.  What I don't like are the wheels on the chairs.  What is up with that?!  Omg, that NEEDS to go.  It's convenient, true, but so cheap to me (sorry OG).  Our server was nice and entertaining, talking to us in an Italian accent at times, but took a long time to get his attention when we wanted to order our meals and also when we needed a refill on our drinks.  

For dinner, I got that stuffed chicken Marsala for $17.50, obviously because there wasn't any pasta.  This dish contains oven-roasted chicken breasts stuffed with Italian cheeses and sun-dried tomatoes, topped with mushrooms and a creamy marsala sauce. Served with garlic parmesan mashed potatoes.  The great thing about the OG is that they shave extra cheese on your command.  The meal also includes unlimited soup or salad.  I chose the seasonal soup, but couldn't tell you what it was.  It was alright, definitely better with the cheese they shave.  The chicken breast was nicely cooked but the stuffing wasn't really a knockout for me.  The cheeses were lukewarm so it was more of a chunky than oozing and I didn't taste the tomatoes as much.  Although I'm not a big fan of mashed potatoes, I did like these ones.  Lastly, the Marsala sauce wasn't prominent so some bites seemed dryer than others (if that makes sense).  

All in all, I thought it was just ok.  Seems to be consistent with every visit I have at the OG.  I think it's a good venue for great company (like the ones I had that night).  I wouldn't necessarily bring a date here but I would revisit the OG if my friends were up for it.  Definitely should try it for yourself, maybe the experience might be better!"}
{"text":"The OG has quickly become one of my favorite chain restaurants.  Ask my friends, I wasn't in love with this chain restaurant until very recently.  Having been a fan of pasta since my younger days.  Nowadays, I'm more open to visiting this place and I've been taking full advantage of what they have to offer.  I LOVE THE OG!!!

My bestie and I decided last minute to come here so we could try something new.  It's all about trying everything on the menu.  Let's start with the soup of my choice, the Zuppa Toscana!!  This soup is on point!!  Spicy sausage, russet potatoes and cavolo greens in a creamy broth.  Usually for $6, but comes with your meal if you choose the soup option.  Lots of sausage in the soup, the potatoes are cut thin and the greens are crunchy and offers a great texture.  I love it.  

For dinner, I decided to try pasta for the first time in a long time and get the Seafood Alfredo for $16.95.  Sautéed shrimp and scallops tossed with creamy fettuccine Alfredo. I was surprised at how good this was!  The Alfredo, I know is not that good for you.  Probably heavy whipping cream, butter and all that is unhealthy, however it tastes so delicious.  The scallops were smaller but perfectly cooked and so was the shrimp.  I had to take home  half of the plate because I had to many bread sticks and soup, but even the next day, the fettuccine and shrimp were still good.  I was satisfied :)

The only reason for my deduction in rating is because of our server.  I can't remember her name but she was very sloppy.  Her uniform was super dirty and so was her service.  Whenever she asked for cheese, she didn't give us the option to say stop. She turned the grinder upside down and cranked.  Problem was, she did it over the table so cheese went all over the table.  When she was finished cranking, she just poured the cheese on top.  Not the experience I was looking for.  Whenever we got our soup, the rim of the bowl was covered with food because she held her tray sloppily.  My last observation was that she set down our check and then threw down the mint chocolates on the table.  So sloppy!  As a former server, I wanted to say, \"get it together.\"

All in all, If you're like me and haven't enjoyed pasta or the OG in the past, try it now!  I did and I'm so glad that I was able to change my mind.  The OG will have a special place in my heart from now on.  Come down and visit them!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was pathetic!the server was busy counting her tips instead of serving and also made errors in the bills for almost all the tables she was serving including ours so watch out! To add to it she filled in her own review in the feedback form instead of allowing us to fill it...."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for their buy one take one. The  food was amazing and the service was great and to top it all off we were able to get a complimentary glass of wine that was being offered."}
{"text":"I've never been too impressed with any Olive Garden, they serve Italian food that is one step above an Italian fast good place and five steps below a real Italian family restaurant. The fried calamari I had was rubbery and bland, the seafood pasta dish was more pasta less seafood. The waiter was nice, you can't blame her for the wrongs of her restaurant."}
{"text":"Brought family from europe to try italian food in olive garden and they wete impressed with the food and atmosphere of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Great soup and Shrimp caprice. The only reason why I go there."}
{"text":"I don't ever go to Olive Garden but this location was awesome!!!!! The food was amazing and the service was phenomenal, one of the best olive gardens I've ever been to :) we got the soup salad and breadsticks and split a ziti. Everything came out fast and our server was soooo nice. I didn't get her name but she has glasses and brown hair, she was absolutely perfect and super attentive :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Olive Garden for about 3 years and I could not believe the down grade of this place! What used to be my beloved pasta cheat spot eatery.... Our server was TERRIBLE. He was so high that he reeked and his eyes were so red. We thought it was hilarious but his service was terrible! I was carded 3 times by 3 different people just for a sample of wine. Our server kept forgetting things and we literally had to ask 4 times for a box and for the check! After 30 minutes of waiting, he split the checks completely wrong, but we were so frustrated that we didn't even care. The food was great, I had the Portobello Di Ravioli which was perfect as always. The stuffed mushrooms and calamari were a fail so I will probably stray away from those. I'm going to go over to my usual OG spot in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the ultimate repair for all the mishaps is a gift card for a  $5 appetizer which means I would have to come back.   I can buy my own appetizer.  The manager was less than helpful as well.     Bad thing is they weren't busy  it was 6 pm. On a Thursday.  A family night out turns into discussing where's our food?  asking for managers? Vs enjoying family."}
{"text":"Your typical Olive Garden. I ordered to go on this occasion. The to go packing was superb. The salad separated and nicely packed and plenty to eat! They didn't forget anything and it was ready when I got there. Take out staff were attentive and friendly. The bread sticks were not as good on a to go order but other wise a good meal."}
{"text":"So we got a Olive Garden giftcard...from my mom to my in laws *sigh* I told her to pick Famous Daves, but Olive Garden was on her way home and the post office to mail it. *deeper sigh*

The BF, Mom and grandma in law and a friend of mine headed to dinner.

I had the steak gorgonzola which is alright and my go-to when I've been made to go here. BF got the pork milanese, lasagna for mom, spaghetti and meatballs for grandma and pomodoro for my friend. We got zepolis to finish up here and they were just alright...can get them better elsewhere.

Service is always decent here and I can appreciate that (though a few are upsellers).

Here's the deal- I will not say yes if the in laws suggest to come here in the future.  I got a massive migraine,  the food wasn't sitting well and I was hella thirsty. I know their food isn't healthy, but I think they've upped the sodium levels because I never felt this crappy before with that dish. 

Something I should have said a long time ago-

No, no, no!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but sometimes when I miss my grandparents I want to go to Olive Garden because we used to as a kid. 

The fiance and I decided to go with the 2 for $20.

So soup or salad and breadsticks to start. He got the chicken gnocchi soup which was kinda like chicken and dumplings. It was alright, but wouldn't get that again. Salad is always just as you expect as well as the breadsticks.

Each person gets a entree. Spaghetti with Italian Sausage. They give you 4 full sausages so they werent skimpy with that. The sauce was just meh but what bothers me is when you give someone noodles that had some pieces dried out from sitting. Shrimp mezzaluna - this was just alright. I didn't like the pre cooked shrimp but the ravioli was fine. 

We get a dessert to share and got a black tie chocolate cake which was decent enough, like buying cheesecake from Costco. 

Generally speaking I feel their staff tends to be friendly, sometimes overly. They hire the \"jazz hands\" types, but I far rather have someone really zippy than being served by someone who looks so disinterested. Our gal was that Glee club upbeat, but was also on point with taking care of our needs. 

Best part of the meal? Salad, breadsticks and peach ice tea. I think maybe I should really just come for that if I'm feeling a bit nostalgic. 

Olive Garden isn't horrible unedible food, but it isn't by any stretch great. I feel like it was definitely better years ago, and better at locations that's been operating for a long time like the one my gramps went to.  I noticed the prices without the meal deal and they are higher now. $15 for pasta gets you handmade pasta, handmade sauce at a local place vs something a bit more generic. It's the age old question of what you value in food- quality or quantity? You'll have plenty of left overs here. Stick to the special 2fers, bottomless pasta, lunch time specials to at least get it at a price closer to what it's worth."}
{"text":"I had the moscato peach chicken and it was pretty excellent! I always come in the early afternoon on Sundays, when it's not too busy! I love the service here though, the people are always so nice to me even when the wait is too long. 

Try their signature wines if you're old enough--they are crisp, fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 2 - Now a ton of the families/middle school/high school crowd eat here. It's crazy noisy and a huge racket. It's ideal to sit in the 21+ section! 

Service: 1 - Girls at the front can be just not attentive. They don't even pay attention to who comes in and even skip over people in line. Sometimes your buzzer doesn't even go off when it's supposed to, and they alternate between using buzzers and calling names at the same time. It gets confusing and infuriating. Just pick one way to let people in. 

As for table server, it really depends on the person that you receive because I've had really bad service from older servers and good service from a younger, Asian guy which I can't remember his name! He was really great and even gave my friend a different thing to try when she was unsatisfied with her food. 

Food: 3 - Food comes out hot and good. Cheese Ravioli and white wines are still some of my favorite things to eat and drink, even though it's just average. I would say these dishes at OG are some of my guilty pleasures really!"}
{"text":"My friends and I frequent this location for lunch, but the last 3 times we have visited the experience has been less than pleasant. The service has been awful. The waitresses we have been helped by have appeared annoyed at our requests, and as if we are bothering them. The food has been ok, except when my friend ordered chicken and shrimp due to her special diet. She was told that it would be an extra 5.00 for any portion of the salad, and the food she received was cold and late with no apology. Although we have been coming to this location a lot, based on the last 3 experiences we are unsure if we will return."}
{"text":"This place has truly gone down the drain. This used to be my favorite OG, because I could always count on exceptional service and great food. I went last friday and it was just horrible. It was around 2pm. One the host tried to sit us in the very back where only a very large group of girls were. I understand you'd like to fill up your spaces but he seated us in a little tiny corner out of all the booths, and etc. Then when I asked to move he kept reassuring me that he completely understood?? Just move me, apologize and move on. My waiter was very mute, didnt ask if everything was okay, didnt introduce himself, horrible!!! The salad was drenched in their dressing, so much that it was very soggy, as were the breasdsticks. Everything was very mediocre and not very good. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I usually don't write bad reviews I just don't go back to places I don't like. but this was so ridiculous... I keep giving this place a chance and every time is disappointing, we got there and they had a 35 minute wait which I was ok with (busy weekend) gave my name and they didn't hand me a buzzer so my husband and I decide to wait at the bar but there was no open spots so we go outside and after a 15 minute wait with nowhere to sit and being cold we decided to go to the car, after the exact 30 minute timeframe we came back and they said...we already called your name 20 minutes ago so you have to wait in line from the beginning again!! Seriously this is poor management and this is the last time I will bring my business to this place."}
{"text":"Hang out in the bar! Alisha and CJ are pretty great! The service is amazing and the food is quite delicious!!! Love this place! They always make some great vegetarian options and are always friendly!!!"}
{"text":"1-13-18
Stopped in for lunch. Mauricio was our waiter. Very nice man. He really new his menu inside and out. I got a lunch special~Build your own pasta dish. It was divine. My boyfriend got salad and bread sticks. Yum those breadsticks! Will always come back to Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"11-11-17
When we got to Olive Garden at 4:30ish it was already packed. Veterans everywhere for the free Veteran meal Olive Garden so generously gave to each Military person that came in. T.J. the hostess was awesome. She was running nonstop. Very hard worker! After being seated we were promptly greeted by our waitress Nicole. She was very attentive. She gave us wine samples. Sold! She then brought out our salad and bread sticks. Our meal came fairly quickly and was hot and tasty. There was allot of people working on this evening. They ran it like a well oiled machine. Very friendly and hard working staff. Everything was well organized. Very clean. Only thing I was sad about was the bread sticks were over cooked. Everything else more than made up for it. Will I be back? Well of course its Olive Garden. :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this Olive Garden more times than I actually want to admit or my check ins show...    My husband has given me a pasta pass for my birthday for the last two years.  It's such a cool thing to have, but you really have to love pasta to get your money's worth.  This Olive Garden has a huge staff so your service experience can very greatly from visit to visit.  I don't remember ever having the same waiter more than once since I moved to the Charlotte area five years ago.  That's pretty rare.  The worst service I ever got was probably a three, but it was a one off here or there.  I have had five star service several times.  The main thing to remember about this place is location, location, location.  Concord Mills Mall is right across the street and the Speedway is just down the boulevard so PLAN ACCORDINGLY to avoid absolute wait time misery!  You can add yourself to the wait list online and that helps, but you are going to wait and wait and wait on the weekends, during the holiday and race weeks.  I highly recommend going during the week, early lunch or early dinner for the best experience.  They do accept huge parties routinely and that can back the kitchen way up.  The servers are all honest if you ask how the kitchen is running.  It's very helpful during never ending pasta so you know when to order your pasta so it comes out timely.  I would like to see another Olive Garden in Huntersville so there would be another option besides this one and Northlake.  Northlake is a hike and it's somewhat sketchy anymore.  Just my two cents."}
{"text":"I have not been to Olive Garden in years and with the news of issues with the one in West Edmonton, I would not eat there.  But I was in Calgary on business and it was close to the training location, and my colleagues recommended we go there.  We arrived before noon which I suggest if you want a table as it seemed busy in there.  We were seated in a semi private area as we had a table for 8.  The server came to take our drink order promptly.  Some of us order a pasta dish and other enjoyed the salad, breadsticks, and soup meal.

I ordered the spaghetti and meat sauce for a reasonable price of $13.25.  The server brought out 2 large bowls of salad and 2 baskets of breadsticks.  The salad was ok, but it was made with iceberg lettuce which is inexpensive and doesn't have much nutrient.  I remember they have yummy breadsticks and they didn't disappoint.  Our dishes came out about 15 minutes after and I enjoyed my spaghetti.  It was cooked to the consistency which I liked; not under or overcooked.  The sauce was delicious and had lots of meat.

I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed my meal as much as I did.  The price was decent, and atmosphere nice.  Likely I won't be eating at Olive Garden in Edmonton but if I am in Calgary, I would return."}
{"text":"Always a great spot for some Italian or close to it ..great service and happy hour has always been good to me.  I hardly ever eat in the dining area, so the bar has always been a perfect spot for me and the TV is close enough to see all the action.  I would suggest maybe one more TV in the bar area though, but that's just me"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price with nice server and the 9.99 all u can eat pasta is such a great deal.  I was pleasantly surprised with the gluten free pasta."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at an Olive Garden restaurant before. I was not expecting the food to be very good. I was pleasantly surprised. I had lasagna salad breadsticks and some wine. We were seated right away. Our server was very nice. All of our pasta dishes were prepared correctly. The food was hot. Their prices are pretty good. It's a good place to go and not break the bank."}
{"text":"First and last time I come to this location. Ive received better service at the 75th ave location."}
{"text":"Our server was George, and he provided absolutely outstanding service. I must say, both of our meals were quite good. I have the stuffed chicken scallopini and it was extremely delicious. The room was a little bit noisy with children, but that is what you get when you're at a family style restaurant. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch today and Chris was our server. He was fun, quirky, and attentive. He never let our drinks or breadsticks run out. Our food was delicious and the manager was quick to fix a little snafu with my boyfriends meal. I am very pleased with our service and how friendly the entire staff was. It's our go-to date night and will be back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you want to go somewhere that is familiar.  I know it's not \"authentic\", I have been to Italy had amazing meals there.  Certain restaurants mean certain things to different people.  Olive Garden has a special meaning for me as it was a place my Mom enjoyed and I had many meals there with her.  

I had been trying to meet up with Rand H. for ages and we finally got the chance!  Rand brought Mike C. along and we had a nice meal and chatted about all things Yelp and many other topics.  Plus it's not everyday I get to have lunch with two gentleman so this was my lucky day!  I had the endless pasta bowl that came with soup or salad.  I had salad.  I have never had a bad salad from Olive Garden.  It's always fresh and crisp.  The breadsticks were hot and fresh too.  I had rigatoni with meat sauce and it was good.  The pasta was cooked al dente and the meat sauce was flavorful.  But my second bowl of pasta was even better.  Mushrooms and alfredo sauce!  YUM!
It was excellent.  Next time I'll get that first.  The endless pasta bowl is really a good value.  I had that and an ice tea for just $10.  Needless to say I did NOT eat dinner that night.  Thanks to Rand H. and Mike C. for meeting up with me and brightening my day!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. We were seated at a table that was way too small for our family (it was not busy, lots of other places they could have put us). My husband had to step out with one of our children and wasn't able to come back to finish, so I asked if they could put his meal to go, so he could eat. They did but didn't give him any plastic silverware to go, knowing he didn't get to eat. Worthless. They also charged us for \"table games\", which we did not play (new electronics on the table so you can swipe your card to pay there.) When I pointed it out, they did not offer to remove it because we had paid before I noticed the extra $1.99 charge."}
{"text":"I love there salad, that's all I was really going for, but did the meatballs and pasta, it was ok.  Service was good.  No complaints."}
{"text":"It's been about 8 yrs since I've been here.  I decided to give it another try!  I'm glad I did!  The waiter was very patient with me.  I just didn't know where to began.  So many things looked so good.  While we were checking out the menu he gave us a sample of some wine ( ugggg) it was sweet! Wow!  So anyway, I just decided to keep it simple, to see if I would even like it.  So I did the fetticini pasta with the Italian sausage and the garlic sauce.  Ohhh yea, I'm a salad lover, and I was loving this salad.  My husband got a pototoe and sausage soup (yes I was all in his too!)  It was really good.  I think I can come back here and just get the soup and salad.  But back to my meal.  I really liked my pasta choice!  But I did fill up on the salad.  I took a few bites of my meal but brought 75% of  it home.  I will be back to an olive garden near you soon!

Ohhh that watermelon margarita, was sooooooooooooo sweet, I had to let the ice melt before I could drink it.  It was ok though!"}
{"text":"Love Olive Garden.  Had soup and salad for dinner. Can't forget those bread sticks. It was great and our server (Michael G) was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing and so are the prices as the plates are pretty big. i love the never ending salad and breadsticks that's always a plus. make sure to get the strawberry limonata!"}
{"text":"It's an Olive Garden. It has the same food you'd get at any Olive Garden, delicious and expected. Refills of soups and salads and breadsticks are plentiful. There is often (always?) a wait for dinner so expect it, and enjoy a discounted glass of wine at the bar while you wait. Staff is impeccable. Friendly and very understanding if you stupidly bring an alcoholic \"friend\" who drinks to much and proceeds to hit on the MUCH younger staff. But as long as she's not there this is a very family friendly place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I split the Tour of Italy - and I'm so glad we split it! There was so much we were both stuffed on our halves! It was a nice mix of different tastes and hit the spot. 
But the real reason for the five star rating was our server, Joy. She was so sweet and attentive. Our drinks were always full and she made sure we wanted for nothing. What a wonderful personality! Her service is the reason we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"20 minutes late on my to-go order= cold pasta and breadsticks. Thanks for a less than mediocre Friday night meal, and also for wasting my time and money."}
{"text":"Well, my wife has been getting me to try OG for a while now. I was always told it was garbage and preferred locally owned Italian places. I have to say I had a good meal and the value was there for sure. The bread sticks were okay, the salad was mostly iceberg, and my minestrone was a little bland. But it wasn't bad, and they just keep bringing it. My pasta wasn't homemade or anything but the cream sauce was good. I had the seafood lasagna with shrimp and bay scallops. For an additional dollar they threw in a prepackaged portion of fettuccine alfredo from their fridge. My wife is vegan and finding places she can eat can be hard in the suburbs, That's why she wanted to come here, she got rigatoni and red sauce. Tasted to me like something from a wedding reception but she liked it. And the bill wasn't through the roof. Still wondering if the hostess and waitresses's Italian accents were real, but in the end who cares. Decent meal, lots of food for okay price."}
{"text":"It seems silly to review an Olive Garden, I mean come on I shouldn't expect much, just unlimited soup salad and breadsticks. I was surprised that despite the heyday of \"The OG\" seeming to be in the past we still had to wait 10 minutes for a table. I think my main complaint for this location is their attempt at alleviating the wait. They have approximately ten thousand air conditioning vents and try to freeze you out of your seats so that you leave quicker and they can get more people in for service. 

Our waitress was impatient and kept ignoring my personal space by leaning in to me and over me to set stuff down. She rolled her eyes when my niece took a second to decide between broccoli and grapes. If you don't want to wait for kids to decide on a side you shouldn't give them choices. You shouldn't get annoyed with kids ordering if your restaurant has a kids menu, it's not like we took them to Lola.

They still get two stars instead of one because their salad is like crack, not sure what they put in that dressing. It's probably just the insanely high salt content but it's amazing how iceberg salad can be comfort food."}
{"text":"I had to say something to stand up for OG with all the bashing going on.  While it's not a fab Italian restaurant, there's still nothin' wrong with a little soup, salad and breadsticks every now and then.  It makes for a tasty, fast lunch and it's perfect for those looking for a good spot to come on their lunch hour.

They have pretty good desserts too. But as for their pasta, you can get much better stuff- that doesn't taste like you just pulled it out of your freezer and microwaved it on high- pretty much anywhere else for the same price or less."}
{"text":"If you get the soup and salad, the Olive Garden is a good place for a cheap lunch.  If you come for dinner, I'm not so sure.  I'd say it's mediocre Italian food. Nothing special. Nothing fantastic. Just your run of the mill ravioli or lasagna.
The breadsticks are really good though, but their minestrone soup is either hit or miss.  Sometimes it has a really good flavor and other times there's no flavor at all. 
Is that really a chance you're willing to take?
But if it makes you feel any better, when you're here, you're family."}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly and attentive without being over bearing.  Great new appetizers.  Black Tie Mousse dessert...delish!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but generally salty. (The breadsticks especially were extremely salty.) The service was also quite slow, especially considering it was a Monday evening."}
{"text":"By far this is the best Olive Garden I've been to in years. My family and I just had dinner tonight and everything was amazing.
Our server Arianna was amazing. She asked us if we were celebrating anything and I said joking \"I got my first solo win on Fortnite.\" 
So, at the end of our meal she brought out a tiny scope of ice cream with Rasberry drizzle and whip cream.  This is what set thisbOlive Garden apart. 
My family and Will always come to this one."}
{"text":"Yeah yeah we all know Olive Garden is a chain restaurant, mediocre in the eyes of many. Mostly Americanized Italian fare but you know what, I've never had a bad experience here and in reality, several of their dishes tastes better than some of the places that claim they offer \"authentic\" Italian cuisine. It's cheaper and definitely blows Buca de beppo out of the water.

Their menu is extensive and they have a lot to offer from appetizers to desserts. For starters we always like to order their Sampler Italiano ($10.79) you pick 3 from a medley of apps. Calamari, stuffed mushrooms, mozzarella sticks are among our favorites. Then they offer you either soup or salad and of course their famous breadsticks. I always get the Zuppa Toscana, it's nothing special but it's not horrible either.

Not really a big fan of their pastas but I do like their chicken dishes. Among the ones I favor are the Garlic Rosemary chicken ($12.49) and most recently the Chicken Piccata ($16.99). It's very well balanced and all the flavors blend harmoniously. The main reason I like coming here though is their dessert, particularly Zeppoli (Italian donuts) $6.99 they are soooo addicting! I especially like to get it with both the raspberry and chocolate dipping sauces. Ugh so bad yet so good!

This is the closest one to us therefore our go to place when the mood strikes. Service is always pleasant, though sometimes untimely and the wait can be a bit of a hassle at times. Even though it's nothing fancy or even close to being authentic, this place always satiates. Overall, a favorable experience."}
{"text":"I go here every year for my birthday dinner with my family. I love the service, the ambience, the food. Everything about this place is amazing."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great overall experience! We visited on Wednesday, July 12, 2017. I was searching the menu for a low carb option for chicken parm, which I couldn't find on the menu. The Asst. Mgr. Sean checked in with us and I asked him if there was a way to get a low carb version of chicken parm and he didn't hesitate to suggest a specialized entre including just the chicken, cheese and sauce with a side of zucchini. It was exactly what I was hoping for! The chicken parm was perfect! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I always enjoy our date nights when we stop here. The staff is always friendly and the food is always hot and delicious. We prefer to go to this Olive Garden over others in the area."}
{"text":"Come here with coworkers all the time for lunch since we work down the street and the service here is awful! There hasn't been one time we've gone and not had an issue. We go at least once a week. We do on a hour lunch and order all you can eat soup and salad that takes forever to
Come out the waitress never refills our drinks there is just no proper customer service here !!"}
{"text":"You know, people are funny...
It's almost as if when they go to an expensive restaurant, they seem to like the food, just to rationalize the fact that they spent so much money.
Conversely, when they go to a place like the Olive Garden, they don't factor in the relatively inexpensive price, and they give a bad review because they're comparing the food to a 5-star restaurant.
I'll never understand it.
Anyway, I have no complaints about this place.
The food is fine, the service is fine, the atmosphere is fine, and the prices are right in line with the quality of food that they serve.
If I liked Italian food more, and I was on a budget, I would eat there every day."}
{"text":"Great service! A third of our party decided to not show up and we were able to keep our table. We arrived at 6:45pm and were seated right away for a party of 8. 

I used a coupon and was also able to use my free dessert coupon from an email I received. The waiter was kind. And attentive. every time I looked at my cup it was refilled to the top. Our salads were brought in exactly As my kooky-picky family had ordered them. 

Great service. Food ok this time. I shouldn't have ordered the Trout special from a pasta place but what the heck. It has far less calories than my usual chicken fettuccine Alfredo. At least I had options."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here. It was busy for a Friday night but we still go a table for two within five minutes. Our server Ryan was super nice and took amazing care of us! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Yes. It's a chain restaurant and yes, it's pretty average. The entrees are bit prciey; this is due to the fact that each entree comes with unlimited breadsticks, soup, and/or salad. With tip, a meal costs around $20 so it would behoove you to take advantage of the unlimited side items. I gotta say that the breadsticks were the best part of my meal even though it was a bit too salty."}
{"text":"Alicia was our server and even if the food wasn't good, which it was ... She made the dinner all that much better. She said she's normally in the bar, so I'm glad she was a server tonight! My daughter had shrimp fettuccine Alfredo and I had the classic lasagna.... Both were amazing."}
{"text":"Priscilla our server was excellent! She was always checking on us to make sure we were ok and she had the best attitude. You could tell she enjoyed her job. Which you don't see much of theses days in this industry. I hope that the management team will reward her for being such a great example of hospitality and representing the Olive Garden brand. The Tour of Italy didn't disappoint taste great and the portion size was hefty, just as I like!"}
{"text":"I am pretty predictable when it comes to visiting any city in the States. I need to visit an Olive Garden restaurant. Ontario and Quebec did away with this franchise probably pushing two decades ago. I either have to drive to Buffalo or go to Winnipeg (it's the closest Canadian city that has a couple of Olive Garden restaurants).

I was in Las Vegas in July 2015. I did a search and found that this Olive Garden. I drove over there.

I recall the pink paint in the parking lot, which was a fun contrast to the palm trees swaying in the wind. I parked my rental car and walked into the restaurant.

I tend to eat lunch late. It wasn't busy. I was seated at a table and was handed a menu.

My predicable order at an Olive Garden is the following:
- Raspberry lemonade
- Zuppa Toscana
- Chicken scampi
- Tiramisu

I loved it all. The raspberry lemonade is especially refreshing on a hot day. Zuppa toscana is a combination of sliced potatoes, spicy sausage, and kale (I enjoy kale either in soups or as chips) in a wonderful soup base.

I love the chicken scampi. I get the lunch size for lunch. It allows me to find enough room to devour my favourite dessert, tiramisu.

My server was friendly and responsive. This restaurant was roomy.

I'd come back here again when I am back in Vegas.

{"text":"Food is always being great, we come at least once every two weeks, however this time we opted to sit down at the bar counter, which lead to a big mistake.  When you go out for dinner the last thing you want to hear is your server tell you about their life and how great her daughter does in school, when you go out all you want to do is sit down have great food, great cocktails and enjoy yourself or the company that you are with.  Please advice the lady at the bar to not talk about personal life, it's very annoying! We will probably keep coming back, however will not be at the bar or have her as server."}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner here and the food was delicious. They have a special menu you can choose from when you have large parties and allowed us to bring wine. The ambiance was perfect for this kind of event. I had a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Took a while for rhe table fo get clean so we can sit. Waited a while after asking for a high chair. Did give us refills dodnt give us bread sticks. But everyone even the manager stoped to tslk n see if everything was ok st s workers table. Not a good restaurant"}
{"text":"Every. Single. Time. I come here thinking it will be different, I am reminded that it isn't. The food is horrid and the hostesses and servers are worse than horrid. 

Today's experience began with the opening line from the hostess that I simply hate: \"Is there JUST two of you?\" (Woefully implying that a 2-top isn't worth much.) Next she took us to a table that was blocked by a tray piled up with dirty dishes and acting like she expected us to slide passed the tray. When we didn't budge, she scooted the tray over. 

Servers (not just ours) were very lackluster. No menu descriptions and it felt like we were interrupting their smoke breaks. 

Food was dried out and obviously prepared in advance and microwaved. The gravy on the garlic chicken breasts tasted like the canned type from the grocery store. The \"breasts\" BTW were not really 2 breasts, but 1 sliced in half horizontally to have the appearance of being 2. Cheap. Real cheap. 

The afredo sauce on the pepperoni fettuccine alfredo also tasted like the bottled type from the store. The pepperoni was very skimpy. 

For the prices they charge (not that it is expensive...just the price point) food should not look, feel, and taste like fast food. There are a number of Italian restaurants (Such as Brio Tuscan Grille, Buca di Peppo and Capo's) where the same amount of money will get you pleasant service and freshly made food that doesn't taste like it came out of a bottle. 

This was my final attempt for Olive Garden redemption. If I could give 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Im not gonna get into it because theres too much thats gone wrong on all of my visits here. But every time we give this olive garden another chance its a little more disappointing. And theres never any Gnocci in my Gnocci soup. The breadsticks are always cold and seems like theyre only seasoned with salt. The service is bad and they should be paying me to eat here. The manager was nice the first time we complained, she gave us a gift card to come back and give it another chance, which we did. This time around the service was still bad and the soup didnt have any of the stuff in it (gnocci). Never got offered water refills, and didnt get the veggie piadinas we ordered. Why do bad things happen to good people?
  How many times do we have to complain? Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"When I are here for my birthday back in April, I had a server who was nice but assumed I wanted something I didn't and tried to charge me for it. My dad and I were reluctant to come back. But we did yesterday and were pleasantly surprised. Our server Crystal was so nice and helped me order the right dish for me, she gave me all the cheese I asked for (which was A LOT), and even sent me home with some tips on making my own Italian dishes. The kitchen was a little show getting out all the food and the bruschetta bread was crazy hard, hence the 4 of 5 stars. But Crystal was AMAZING, we hope we sit in her section next time!"}
{"text":"Great experience, the kids love the food and soda die. We actually sat in the bar area and the service was exceptional. You should ask for Brittney!!"}
{"text":"Muito bom restaurante. Distante da Strip. Ótimo atendimento é um cardápio com seleção de massas pra o bom gosto italiano."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an OG (Olive Garden) in about a few months - however, stopped by this Glendale location in which I have been to a few times with the family.  Olive Garden, is far from authentic Italian food - but since the removal of fast Italian food around such as Fazzolis, and not wanting to go fancy schmancy - I opted for the OG on this specific date.  Now, I see they have these fancy computer tablet thingies that sits on the table(s).  That's fine and dandy and all - however, at no point was I informed that THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR PLAYING TABLE GAMES TO PASS TIME SUCH AS TRIVIA - 
Oh yeah, could have it been the fact that I was using silly screen names vs. all others in which I absolutely destroyed in trivia such as the movie section - or the fact that OG is starting to lose it in stocks and are forcing to go below the belt tactics in order to garner a few bucks.

$1.99 charged on my e-receipt for table games?  Are you $hi**ing me???  Don't play these games folks especially when you could do it on your phone?  WTH?  I don't get charged at other locations such as TGI Fridays or Chilis for the table games - absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden so, I pretty much know what to expect in terms of food. I expect decent, consistent food at a reasonable price and this location delivers. 

The shining star(s) of this location are the two servers who we dealt with last night. Sandra and Andi...they were just awesome! Very friendly, not pushy, quick to refill drinks without being asked and just generally nice. 

I will be requesting thier section next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service. I'm not expecting authentic Italian but it should be good. It was OK. I had the appetizer shrimp scampi - spicy. Fried shrimp drowned in a sauce that made the shrimp soggy. Similar to Longhorns wild west shrimp but not nearly as good. We had to ask for drinks refills and more bread sticks.

Disappointing."}
{"text":"Nearly every time I visit Olive Garden's Harvard Park location, the bartender allows dirty dishes to accumulate, and linger on the bar for long periods of time. I sat at the bar for almost an hour, and saw no effort being made to clean off the bar.  The restaurant wasn't even busy. Apparently, keeping a clean bar is not a priority to any of the bartenders at this location, as I've witnessed this problem for years."}
{"text":"I got my order to go, even though they was slow about taking my order the food was great, I got the salad , bread sticks and the Pasta e Fagivil Soup it was soooooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this location and it will most likely be the last. Our server was very nice and on top of things. She made sure we got refills on our drinks and was attentive.  We went there tonight to celebrate our daughters birthday. She just loves Olive Garden and the never ending pasta bowl. Bread sticks were soft and warm, a plus. The salad, it tasted like the dressing was watered down. It's unfortunate because I'm a sucker for their salad even though it just plain out of the bag. We didn't even finish It. We got chicken scampi..tasted good, just seemed like it was plated for a while because the sauce looked like it was crystallized to the plate, if that make sense. I got the fettuccine Alfredo with the NEPB. It was horrible. It didn't taste creamy like it usually does, it tasted like butter. No good. Now, since we came for a birthday I told our server and asked if she could sing happy birthday. She then asked what dessert did we want to purchase so they could sing. I was speechless...it's her birthday so we let her pick. At the Cheyenne location they NEVER charged us for a birthday dessert. This one did. It's unfortunate since this is closer to us. We would rather drive a little farther to get better service and better tasting food. Thanks Olive Garden, thanks."}
{"text":"Had to wait to be seated on a Thurs nite (as usual their is always a wait) only to get a host with an attitude like he hated his job and hated people, both my wife and I agree he needs to find a different line of work that may he be more happy in. 

Then we got a server who didn't seem to pay attention to our table. We had to send another server to find her every time for drink refills Etc a real pita!

We go to the Mentor Olive Garden three or four times a year and it seems like nearly every time there is at least one issue. The food generally good but the service runs hot and cold. It's the luck of the draw.

The attitude of this host was just so  outrageous we complained to management and send an email to corporate headquarters but they have chosen to do nothing in response."}
{"text":"We got a gift card for Olive Garden and decided to give it a try after YEARS of NOT.  We actually waited for almost 20 minutes to be seated.  Our service was okay.  Greeted by the server offering us a taste of chardonnay that we passed on.  We ordered stuffed mushrooms.  I think they were alright.  They came out hot and although they were salty and nothing special, they were not bad.  All you can eat salad came with mine and the bread sticks of course.  Salad was hideous and full of vinegar.  Just a bunch of light green lettuce with just alright stuff thrown in.  Bread sticks were warm and alright.  Jerome ordered a Caesar salad and the guy said it'd be \"like a dollar more\" for substitution.  It was the same as the all you can eat salad but with mayo instead of the vinegar.  YUCK again.  Boxed croutons and fake cheese.  

I ordered shrimp Caresse.  Jerome ordered braised ribs.  ILK!  Both of them were so yuck.  The ribs were fatty and not flavorful.  They were tasteless and awful.  The sauce was not reduced and it tasted like beef bouillon and cheap red wine.  The rice was alright but again, that beef bouillon salty flavor.  There were some green beans on top that I ate.  They were fine.

The shrimp on my plate were undercooked.  The angel hair pasta was fine.  But as I ate, I was reminded of Ra men Noodles.  Instead of beef bouillon they gave me chicken.  The tomatoes in mine were fine.

We got our check and it was $49.something!  I can't believe it!  We eat out a lot and usually, it comes to 50 or 60 bucks at places like that.  What a rip.  I kept thinking that it was alright that the food sucked because it is cheap.  It wasn't even cheap.  

For Italian food that tastes good for about the same price, Oregano's is wonderful!

We will NEVER go there again.  Don't know why people ever go there."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service depending on the restaurant. Variety is basically Italian food."}
{"text":"Upset. 
The server shorted me money when giving back my change... didn't notice till I got home & called the store. After being \"disconnected\" I was told sorry once on the phone & told I would receive a giftcard. 
After my fiancé drove to the store... they gave me back the cash that the server kept from me. 

Disappointed in whole service from when the manager stopped by my table while we were eating till now."}
{"text":"This is a good location considering it's a chain restaurant. I have and always well get the chicken Alfredo pizza so I definitely recommend that. They also have great raspberry lemonade and it's free refills. Ask for extra chocolate Andy's mints or tell them it's your birthday and they'll give you a cup full of them."}
{"text":"Four stars today - twenty minute wait to get seated which is reasonable at this location after church on Sunday - great server named Amy - food came quick - very tasty - good experience"}
{"text":"We had a dimwitted slow dull waitress that just ruined our evening she was boring and uninterested in her customers and was not paying any attention to her customers. We could tell she didn't  want to help us  so she won't. Nor will them."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this location tonight. The hostesses were not to friendly or attentive and alert when you first walk in. Which adds to first impressions. Our server however his name was Chico was very very good. He met all of our needs and had a smile on his face throughout our time dining. We had some individuals with allergies and he showed us the allergy menu and took our complicated orders in perfect stirde. The food was decent. The Alfredo was a little on the dry side and we did have to pile plates  to the side a few times because they weren't cleared often."}
{"text":"What else do you need to know its freaking olive garden! Breadsticks are soo good, it is the best bread you can get. If i could make a house out of theyre breadsticks and salad id be homeless because i would have eaten it. The fettuchini alfredo with chicken is the bomb.com. Its creamy, salty and just the perfect consistency to dip that breadstick in and do work. The chicken parm is good and the chicken amd shrimp carbonara is fantastic as well. Decent prixes for all ya get and your provably gunna have left overs."}
{"text":"Be vary aware of their so called gaming devices that they have on their tables. They never inform you but you are paying to use these devises. They say it's in the small print but you will never see it! It's not legal and I'm looking into it. What kid is not going to play a gaming device that is left right in front of them. It's not the fee that bothers me. It's the fact that I never agreed to pay for it and I was never informed of it. It just showed up on my bill. That's so sneaky and dishonest. I hate dishonest business!!!!"}
{"text":"Good 'ol Olive Garden

My wife was looking for a good carb fix and we realized we had not visited OG in more than a year. Unlimited salad and breadsticks are still there, but the menu is very different from what we recalled. They also have this Ziosk console tablet at every table to order things and pay the bill, in addition to the wait staff who are very attentive.

Food was good, though nothing special. The Capellini Pomodoro I used to love is gone. Had the noodles with gorgonzola, balsamic vinegar, and steak. It was tasty but super heavy and oily. My wife had a pasta and shrimp combo that she enjoyed and made the same heavy/oily comment. The kids loved their mac and cheese, of course.

I'm torn on the three-star rating. Service was quite good. It's just that the food is so heavy and unremarkable... Slightly better food and I would give Olive Garden an easy four-star."}
{"text":"I honestly do not understand the popularity of this place. It's a chain, nothing is cooked up by someones Great Grandma with a secret recipe.
 The Salad and breadsticks are fine. The food seems to be mostly heated up frozen chicken patties etc. Can't I just go to Costco and get the same stuff???
 The pasta is a joke ( seriously how cheap can you get? Pasta is what 99 cents a pound!?) . We ordered Chicken Parm and thought the pasta portion was hysterical for the price. Mainly because a real old school Italian place will give you enough to share with family or just take home. So to us it was pricey for 12.00 or whatever it cost.
 The waiter was fabulous, he was really on top of things. The atmosphere was great, the seats are uncomfortable.
 What Olive Garden has is an A+ in marketing. They stuff you full of a simple salad, and bread so you won't notice dinner is kind of a rip off. The salad bowl is shaped a certain way to make it look huge, all kinds of stuff like that. I have to hand it to them though they are a total genius at making people thrilled over very little. For the Olive Garden fans glad you enjoy it, but it just does nothing for me. Admittedly I was spoiled by old school Italian cooking from my Grandfather."}
{"text":"We had a last minute celebration, with about 24hrs notice and about 25 people to feed. The management went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of, offering suggestions and confidence that the food would be taken care of and ready to go even on short notice. 
When we picked up the meal, it was hot, fresh and ready to go! The staff who helped us when we picked it up were so friendly and genuinely kind, making sure we had everything we needed, and offered kind words. 
When we got the food home, it was hot and delicious, included all condiments  and sides that I had not even thought to ask about. Everyone really enjoyed the dinner, and that let us enjoy the celebration, too! The quality of the food and the kindness and flexibility really just were excellent and appreciated."}
{"text":"Saturday is always a busy night to go out, so we knew there would be a wait, and 20 minutes isn't bad. So after about 20 minutes I witnessed a couple get seated that came in after us....huh?! Then another, and another....what?! So my husband went up to talk to them (I think to shut me up) and oh the little hand held buzzer thing they gave us wasn't working. I was so angry (and hungry) I could have screamed. Although the evening started out crummy, the manager was really great and brought us out an appetizer platter on the house.  The food was good and the bread sticks hit the spot."}
{"text":"Our evening started poorly with the server forgetting the salad and breadsticks, having no knowledge of the menu and being absent. After speaking with the manager on duty, Lisa, the experience greatly improved. She took the time to listen to our concerns (including the fact that my soup was old and spilled over and being given another's food) and found solutions. Our table was taken over by Maurice, an incredible waiter. We could not have asked for a better individual. He was attentive, kind and resourceful. 
What began as a terrible experience was turned around by the wonderful service of Lisa and Maurice. Our faith in the Olive Garden has been restored because of these two. Thank you Lisa and Maurice for all of your help. Anyone looking for a great meal with excellent service ask for Maurice!"}
{"text":"I'd hate to give one star but this location deserves it (sorry but true). We came in at 9pm, got our drinks 7 mins after ordering, after ordering our food, new server forgot about our appetizer (that part we understand, people make mistakes) we had two servers, the new girl was alright, but the other one needed to lighten up! I get that they had to be so excited about the weekend but at least be more accomodating. Server then again forgot about our soup and one entree. Understoon people make mistakes. But still needed to kighten up!!! My mom did not like the chicken apricot AT ALL!!! told the server and she agreed to take a diff order (chicken marsala)..the server told my mom it would take about 15 mins....but the heck? She got it 2 mins later with the main manager apologizing....that was unbelievably fast considering we all waited almost 30 MINS for our order!!!! I knew we should have gone to cheesecake factory!!! We didnt comment or complain because we ddnt want anyone to lose their job...just heads up guys! Im not sure about the reviews saying how\"GREAT\" their food is because my WHOLE family ended up taking home all of own ordered food becausw it was just not good!"}
{"text":"food is awful, cold and the sausage was hard, they cooked in microwave, will not eat there again.  

service was not there.  they allow smokers to smoke outside, will not go there.  it is against arizona law to have smokers outside of the restaurant near doors and everything."}
{"text":"--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! 

This is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. 

Management provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!"}
{"text":"The food was great just like every other Olive Garden I've been to. My only concern was that the server kept insisting that we try their champagne even though I told him that we don't drink. Besides that it was a very pleasurable experience and I will be definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Waiter almost burned my kid with a hot plate, forgot his chocolate milk twice, forgot my daughters mash potatoes, gave us the wrong check, and spent most of his time flirting with the table next to us."}
{"text":"I don't like chains a lot, but some I tolerate.  OG is one of them, because I grew up with it.   This is my favorite location, but food and service is always just hit or miss.  I think that is to be expected with a chain.  Sometimes I have a good experience and sometimes not so much.  I think that it is a little overpriced, and seems that the pricing is always going up while the quality of food is always going down.  Sometimes I think that it was better several years ago.  The breadsticks seem to never change, always good-and I always eat too much of them!!"}
{"text":"Zero stars.  It's incredibly sad that a chain that I once loved as a child & growing up with my family has turned out to be so awful.  The food, service, atmosphere...yuck.

I came here on a Monday night and had to wait 20 min to be seated.  You would think we were all waiting in line for something great, right?  Wrong.  My server was horrible.  No customer service skills at all.  Rude, short, uninviting.  I asked what salad dressings were available, because I no longer like the overly salty house concoction, and she replied telling me that there were NO other choices.  Lies.  Plenty of times I have had ranch.  They even offer ranch as one of the dipping sauces for an appetizer.  What kind of server lies about that??  I chose soup.  She brought it out WITH my entree. What is the point??? I want to enjoy my meal...soup..breadsticks...THEN entree.  

The fettuccine alfredo was watered down & horrible.  The waitress never bothered to check.  She forgot my friend's cream for coffee and tea for take out, which we finally got after sitting FOREVER. She didn't ask or offer dessert-was quick to pull the check out & try to rush us out...much to her dismay, I ordered tiramisu, which was average, slightly below.  

I disliked my experience so much and was so frustrated with the lack of competency from our server that I don't think I will ever be back.  Never to this location."}
{"text":"Low quality, the waiters didn't asked me what type of salad  I wanted  instead of this he brought me whatever he want. Was very unpleasant."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad & bread sticks to go, literally waited waited 20 minutes on top of the already 15. How is it a 35 minute wait for salad & breadsticks????? HOW SWAY ?????"}
{"text":"On the evening of March 8, 2018, I purchased a to go order from the Olive Garden in Centennial Hills.  My order was simple.  Chicken Alfredo, Pasta Fagioli, and an order of the Alfredo dipping sauce. My total ended up being $21.95. 

In the notes; I asked that the restaurant please provide extra packets of parmesan cheese, and plenty of breadsticks.  

When I got the order, I only got one packet of parmesan cheese.  Okay, not a big deal.  That, I can live with. To my surprise however, the nearly $4.00 dipping sauce I ordered was, literally, about a spoonful.  Probably enough to dip a breadstick in twice.  At first, I thought maybe some spilled in the bottom of the bag.  But no... this wasn't an accident. 

When I called to speak to the manager, \"Michael Jefferson,\" I simply asked, \"What is the typical amount of dipping sauce a customer receives per order?\"  He laughed, as if my situation was amusing to him, and said \"we don't fill up the cups\".  Again, I asked for the precise measurement or protocol for the dipping sauce, and again, he laughed.

Finally, after much back and forth, he shared with me that the typical amount is actually 4 ounces.   So, I measured what I was given, and to my surprise, it was only 2 ounces.  Hardly 1/3 of a cup.  

So, call me petty for being upset; however, what is so displeasing about this situation was the managers attitude.  He did not care, and in fact, found it amusing that I was complaining about being shorted.  I eat at Olive Garden often.  Sometimes, once a week, and I always order the same thing.  I am very familiar with the typical proportion, and this was far off. 

No remedy was offered, no concern was given, and instead of just offering to fix the issue, Michael chose to argue with me; literally, raising his voice over the phone.  

Shame on you for treating your customers like that, Mr. Jefferson!

As promised, I will continue to share this experience with the community, as well as Olive Garden's corporate offices and the BBB."}
{"text":"I ate at an olive garden before but first time eating at this one, food was good service was fine. I luv the salad and breadsticks always delicious!"}
{"text":"Sometimes big brand companies start to lose their favor and prices get crazy. 
However, that has never been with Olive Garden! I don't visit much, but when I do, I always try something new and never have a frown on my face. It's so hard selecting only one meal on the menu since I always see many I like and haven't tried. 

They had this new drink, Strawberry-Mango Limonata, and it had real strawberries floating in it. It tasted soo good. I was eager to order another one! The beverage was only 3.50, and you got a lot of it. 

After goggling at the menu for what seemed like forever, I chose the Lasagna Rollata al Forno. I ate some salad and ate all my breadsticks while waiting. I had to request more with my meal seeing that they always have the best breadsticks and you can't get enough!

When the plate came out, my first thought was \"That's it?\" It looked so small and not filling at all. Once I started eating though, that thought changed. It filled you up just right and the food was astonishing.

I can't wait to go back! I love Italian food!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's Olive Garden, I guess the breadsticks were OK, warm and garlicky. And the service was decent. But the salad was all iceberg lettuce. And the chicken and shrimp carbonara? I didn't really notice much chicken in there at all, and the shrimp were pretty small. I don't know that I would come here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hot mess. The wait is always ridiculous both to be seated and to be greeted by your server. No one ever apologizes or takes responsibility for these issues. They ran out of their famous gnocchi soup and zupa Toscana on a Tuesday Night but didn't tell anyone until after we had been waiting over an hour. You need a blow horn and a giant flag to attract your waiter's attention - I swear they all hide in the kitchen the entire time. I LOVE Olive Garden, so I've given this location multiple chances to redeem themselves but each time they have failed miserably. Don't waste your time here. Drive the extra distance to literally ANY. OTHER. LOCATION. This one deserves to be shut down. Stay away. Far far away."}
{"text":"I was greeted warmly at the front door and was told that we would be seated soon and I could go to the bar to wait. Um...Yes! I met up with some people at the bar and we ordered some drinks and started talking while we waited. 

Drink:
Long Island Limoncello: Caravella Limoncello adds an Italian twist to a classic - with New Amsterdam Vodka, rum and triple sec.
Um..This was great. It was not too sweet and had a nice punch of lemon that really made it something unique. I did not find it to be that usual, \"omg this is a long island I am going to be drunk\" type of drink. It was refreshing and not overbearing. 

Italian Margarita: Jimador Silver 100% blue agave tequila, triple sec and imported Italian amaretto. (ordered during dinner)
YUM! I liked this one better than the first! I do not even like tequila but this was superb. The little sidecar of amaretto also made the drink. I even went out and bought some amaretto to try to make this at home!

Appetizers:
Fried Mozzarella: 
While fried mozzarella is not a new thing the alfredo drizzle on the top was. I thought it was a nice touch. The mozzarella sticks had a light breading on them. I liked that but when you lifted them up to eat they sometimes fell apart. While gooey cheese dripping from your fork is never a bad thing, I wished that they held their shape a bit more to make it easier to eat. I also think that they always need to bring out more marinara sauce. Or make the sauce cup a different shape so it is easier to dip, dunk, and re-dip. 

Shrimp Fresco: 
This dish had a spicy kick at the end for sure! I was not really feeling it because of the coldness of the shrimp. I like shrimp cocktail but this shrimp was just not doing it for me. The rest of my table loved it so that was good! And the sauce that was on the side was really good too!

Mediterranean Flatbread: Basil pesto and olive oil, topped with a blend of four Italian cheeses, artichoke hearts, olives, capers, roasted red peppers and garlic.
I thought that this was really good. If you do not like olives do not order this dish!!! The bread was nice and crusty so it did not droop and with the amount of toppings it should have! This dish was loaded with goodness. I enjoyed it. 

Grilled Chicken and Cheese Piadina: 
Eh. Not that much of a fan.

Grilled Vegetable and Cheese Piadina: Tangy roasted red peppers, mushrooms, fresh spinach and a savory Italian cheese sauce seasoned with garlic, basil and sun-dried tomatoes. Served with a side of marinara.
This was a lot better than the chicken version. The vegetables were crisp and the basil and sun-dried tomatoes were great. Very yummy for sure. Again just a quesadilla and not that amazing but a lot better than the chicken.

Dinner Dishes:
Pot Pie Italiano Nonna's Kitchen Sink: 
Nope. 

Pot Pie Italiano Chicken and Broccoli: Comforting layers of baked cavatappi(corkscrew pasta), made-from-scratch Alfredo sauce, grilled chicken, broccoli and a blend of Italian cheeses baked inside a golden flaky pie crust.
This is the good stuff for sure. I liked this one 100 times better than the other pot pie. Yum. Yum. Yum. I called this as mine for the leftover since I enjoyed it so much! I think it was the alfredo sauce instead of the red that made it better. 

Chicken Parmigiana Breadstick Sandwich: Parmesan-breaded chicken breast, fried and topped with Italian cheeses and marinara. 
I love chicken parm so this was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The chicken was fried to perfection and the breadstick as the sandwich!!!! PERFECTION. The only suggestion I had was having a side dipper of sauce so you could dip the sandwich in it. I like to dip so that the bread doesn't get really soggy from the sauce sitting on the bread. But that is just me. I made that suggestion for sure that night. More sauce please! 

Shrimp Scampi: Shrimp sautéed in a garlic sauce, tossed with asparagus, tomatoes, and angel hair pasta.
I also called this for left overs. The asparagus and tomatoes with the light sauce, perfection. Just enough shrimp to make the dish feel full but not overwhelming. I would get this again, and again, and again......

Chicken Piccata: Grilled chicken topped with a lemon garlic butter sauce, sundried tomatoes and capers. Served with parmesan-crusted zucchini.

I would also get this again! I also took it for leftovers and ate it the next day and enjoyed it just as much. The sauce! Dang, that lemon garlic butter sauce was good! I don't even like capers and thought I would hate this dish, boy was I wrong!

Northern Tour of Italy: 
Did not like this. 

Dessert:
Sicilian Cheesecake: Our ricotta cheesecake features a shortbread cookie crust and is topped with seasonal strawberry sauce.
GET THIS AGAIN! I took it home with me and ate it the next day. OMG. Ricotta cheesecake for the win. It was great. I wished there were more berry sauce on it, but it was still good. 

Coffee:
Almond Cappuccino
Drank this the next day cold, damn, it was good!

Awesome night!"}
{"text":"It's Sunday night and I forget that it's family night for most folks in Las Vegas.  Joe and I had no choice but to go to Olive Garden for dinner last night.  I'm not complaining since the food is always quick and good.  This one is a little different to all the other Olive Garden's I've been to - the atmosphere is a little bit more posh and high class than the other restaurants.  When you walk in, like every Olive Gardens, there people who open the door for you and greet you hello and bid you goodbye.

You have a choice of being seated or going to the bar.  That's what we decide to do, have the bartender wait on us.  Besides, it's easier to just holler at him than wait for a server to come back to you.  It was a nice looking bar, granite, and comfortable high chairs.  It was just hard to  move the chairs out to sit on them and move them close to the bar.  Our bartender gave us decent service.  As soon as we sat down, he offered us something to drink.  I think he was disappointed that we just wanted water at first.  But, he delivered.  Our menus were placed in front of us gently after we had requested for them.  

After skimming through the appetizers, we decided to get the Bruschetta.  A traditional topping of roma tomatoes, fresh basil and extra-virgin olive oil. Served with toasted ciabatta bread - $6.35.  It was just okay for me.  I love tomatoes but this really didn't impress me all that much.  After a while, our bartender came over and asked us if we were ready for our alcoholic beverage.  I knew I wanted to drink some wine but didn't know what.  So, he was kind enough to give us some samples.  Samples = free = awesome!!!  So, I got curious about Principato, the red one.  We tried it, and it was pretty good.  Not too strong and simple in the taste buds.  But, for some reason I just wanted something more bold and rustic.  So we had a 2003 Super Tuscan Villa Antinori imported from Italy - $9.95 per glass.  That was so good.  It was really strong tho.  But, I couldn't put it down.  So, that's what we stuck with.  

Finally, we had ordered our entree's.  I decided to get the Braised Beef & Tortelloni - Tender sliced short ribs and portobello mushrooms tossed with asiago-filled tortelloni in a basil-marsala sauce $13.75.  This was just okay.  I should've gotten the Ravioli di Portobello - Portobello mushroom-filled ravioli in a creamy smoked cheese and sun-dried tomato sauce $11.95.  This is my most favorite through out the entire restaurant.  But, I wanted to venture out.  Joe decided to get the Steak Gorgonzola-Alfredo - Grilled beef medallions drizzled with balsamic glaze, served over fettuccine tossed with spinach and gorgonzola-alfredo sauce.  Steak prepared medium unless otherwise requestedm $15.50.  This is pretty good and filling.  We couldn't finish it so we boxed it and took it home.

Pros:  
*  Great service.
*  Awesome food.
*  free samplers on wine.
*  very clean.
*  servers and employees are always smiling.
*  high class feeling but laid back at the same time.
*  large portions.  Enough to bring home for lunch the next day.

Cons:
*  chairs are hard to maneuver.
*  wine glass is small.  I was expecting a bigger glass for red wine.

I'd go back to this one again.  I like the food a lot.  I would choose this Olive Garden over the one on E. Flamingo and North Las Vegas any day."}
{"text":"This is the worst O Garden I've ever been to. We've had awful experiences with waiting over an hour for food and then it's still not there. After that we just ask for it to be boxed up instead and then we wait 20 minutes for that so they obviously never made our food. The manager then says she'll take care of the check and give us a gift cert. she gives us the gift cert and a Bill for $50. She ended up taking care of it after I said something again. I will never done there again. We will take our business to the one in Canton. We always have great service there."}
{"text":"I visited this location to take advantage of the delicious lunch menu, my 1st time at this location & my last. I was treated unfairly, and utterly ignored by staff as I sat in the middle of the self seating area/bar.... waitresses walked by me numerous times without any warm greetings or acknowledgement at all. Two tables directly on the right & left side of me were offered complimentary wine samples and asked if they needed anything & if they were ready to order, when I wasn't even given a menu or a second look. I seated myself prior to the arrival of these guests being waited on. Somehow the only brown woman seated in the middle of the dining area went unnoticed, long story short I didn't eat there, I walked out shortly after requesting to speak to a manager who apologized for it all. I went to my car with tears in my eyes as I cried in my car and drove off.....still hungry."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend today and had outstanding service by our server Ashlyn. She went above and beyond to take care of us (and my boyfriend had a TON of requests) all while being the biggest sweetheart. We will definitely be back and request her :)"}
{"text":"Me, my cousin, and friend were at this Olive Garden for lunch. It was a pretty good, not excellent, experience.  It's not necessarily what I remember Olive Garden being the last time I was there a few years ago. The main course was delicious and the 0.25 cent wine tastings were awesome! Our server was fantastic, she was very attentive and nice! The rest was not excellent. 

The place appears to be clean when you come in and when you sit down but there's some sort of strange odor in the dining room. This was a bit off putting to me, but I seemed to be the only one to notice. Only other negative comment is the breadsticks were cold and had hardly any flavor. If these two things were fixed it would really improve the experience since the breadsticks are one of the main attractions at Olive Garden and having a good smelling environment is important! 

Overall we'd come back for lunch definitely. Thanks for a good experience, Olive Garden."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Had a long wait time but they gave us a wine menu and told us it would be half off for the wait which was awesome . It was super busy but the waiter was very efficient with everything he had to get us and was always checking up on us to make sure we where happy . My food was delicious and came out fast have no complaints here"}
{"text":"food was good but the two for one advertisement the second order only gave us plain  pasta and no flavor, i hope they hear from more people for lying and giving false advertisement. dont delete this review as you deleted the prior review, this is an insult for your customers."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have experienced better. 

I ordered the Lobster Ravioli and at $17 bucks for the plate I was expecting something a little more satisfying. For some reason I thought the dish was around $10 bucks, but was shocked to find out it was $17. It did come with soup, which was good, the chicken gnocchi something or other.

My friend's meal was also just okay AND she found a hair in her salad. We weren't going to say anything until I realized that the fork I had been eating with had a hair stuck onto it the entire time. I'm not sure what it was that it was stuck on with, but I was pretty disgusted. We told the waitress finally and the manager came over and asked if we wanted any meals to take home or dessert. I declined and when he came back he had deducted $9 off of our bill. He also gave me another chicken soup to take home. Not sure how I feel about the whole thing really. Bleh.

A random side note is that they have little kiosk stands at each table, those are cool for ordering/paying for your meal, but personally I don't think they should have games and/or whatever entertaining things on them. I saw kids with them right in front of their face when, in my opinion, they should be eating and spending time with who they're with. Not playing video games at the table."}
{"text":"Went for a nice Sunday afternoon Lunch. As always the food was fantastic, the wait staff above par, my problem is with the parents that bring the kids along who don't keep them acting respectful of all the patrons who are paying good money for the dining experience, we thought we had stepped into a kindercare during playtime, the noise of screaming kids was simply outrageous, with parents doing little or nothing to quiet the unruly kids up. My suggestion to those parents who lack number one, parenting skills, and number two, and regard for the respect others around you deserve when dining at a restaurant, you can let your kids do that at home, that is your choice, but bring them to dine with others who just want a good meal with a peaceful quiet environment they better have their best behaviour pants on. It's plain RUDE not to demand that of YOUR kids! You know they also have take out, how about using that next time...."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again , potions were terrible   Charged me for my salad!!! really!!!!"}
{"text":"When oh when was my last Olive Garden experience? It may have been a birthday take-out meal for a family member at the Green Tree location or an eat-in at the one in West Mifflin. If I had written Yelp reviews for those encounters(these were pre-Yelp adventures and are sadly out-of-print. check Ebay), I'd give them a 3; terrif salads, apps, and service, not-so-terrif entrees and desserts. *sniff, sniff* 

Sorry, I feel guilty slagging them now, even though their commercials are still the most cloyingly contrived ads you'll ever see on television and must have been dreamed up by an ex-\"Charles In Charge\" writer. 

No, no, no, I am finding myself (under protest since they're the chain we all love to despise) giving Olive Garden 5 stars. What happened? Has Darren W. been bought off? Has he sold out?

What happened was that the meal started off  fine and just got better and better as we dined. 

We began with those soft, warm, already-buttered, utterly hearts-a-flutter breadsticks. What else would you put on them? You don't even need marinara sauce!

You don't even need it for their brilliantly battered and fried calamari. The breading stays on the squid like clothes stay on a prude on a first date. Plump, firm-to-the-bite, exploding with flavor upon hitting the incisors, these may be the best calamari ever to be coated and plunged into hot oil. This is why I have to fight the urge to order calamari as an appetizer every time I see it on a menu. Blame Olive Garden. Blame a chain. 

Oh, back to dipping sauces, they give you two; the aforementioned marinara, and my favorite of the two, the parmesan-peppercorn which is like ranch dressing but better. 

Let's not forget that salad, that simple, simple Garden Salad they offer with free refills (!) dressed with that amazing and mysterious House concoction of theirs. Emphasis on DRESSED. Yes, they do it for ya, the way I think all salad should be served. It's all too rare not to find your salad dressing in a plastic cup off to the side.

You mean you'd rather have The Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad? They have it too. But why? 

Entrees...you say? 

I had the Shrimp & Crab Tortelli Romana, which is new to their menu, and is a rather worthy addition. Read this caption from the website and weep...

\"Shrimp, crab and smoked mozzarella-filled ravioli, topped with sautéed shrimp in a three cheese and sun-dried tomato sauce.\"

The ravioli are slightly understuffed, but they make up for it by being generous with the amount of ravioli they give you and by positively, lavishly applying that oily, cheesier-than-a-B-movie, sauce to it all. Then there's that fat little shrimp that burst in your mouth like the calamari which must be prepared by a chef with a supernatural knack for knowing when seafood is cooked to that elusive \"just right\" stage. 

The juicy and thick beef-medals that were included in the Steak Gorgonzola-Alfredo that Kay ordered were ever-so-slightly gummy with grill marks making them more than presentable and noodles and sauce that won me over as much as my ravioli did.

Someone in Corporate must have found out somehow (spies?) that my father got me an Olive Garden gift card for Christmas as our dinner had been eerily perfect thus far. Dinner would have been enough, really, nut noooo...we had to go and order dessert.

As I said early on, their desserts never impressed me much, not that I can even remember what I ever ordered for dessert.

Well, I got something that suspiciously doesn't sound all that Italian; Warm Apple Crostata. 

It's an apple crisp/cobbler thingamajig that you have to wait about 5-10 minutes for. While I waited, Kay and I teamed up on her Black Tie Mousse Cake, a Devil's Food/cheesecake/custard chimera that is worthy of its cred as OG's (Ice-T would like it here I think) top dessert. It's cold, it's fudgy, the chocolate chips on the back are kinky and dangerous like a dominatrix. It adheres to the palate, it ties you up, it makes you like it.

Just as we put the kibosh on that elegant freak of a post-meal treat, out came the Crostata. 

There are certain things that take a foodie to Nirvana; the perfect union of warm and cold being one of them, and the crostata achieved this in spades. It's a necessity, really; the ice cream cuts the sweetness of the dessert and cools the hot dessert down enough for you to eat it painlessly, blissfully. It's burnt where it should be, crunchy where it needs to be, soft and sweet where it's got to be...

If it were a woman walking down the street, traffic accidents due to distracted motorists and neck sprains from turning heads would occur. As a friend of mine would say, \"Dahyum!\" 

Ok, so The Crostata is Betty, and The Black Tie Mousse Cake's Veronica. Or...ok, The Crostata is Angela Gossow, and the BTM is Christina Scabbia. And yes you can go troika, ya perv. 

OG=way above OK. Ask for waiter Eric V. if you can."}
{"text":"I don't know what's wrong with me, but I'm still an Olive Garden sympathizer, resisting foodie peer pressure to bash them gleefully. A forgotten $25 gift card prompted Kay and I to journey to the OG that started the love affair over a decade ago when my sister and her then beau wanted to reward my unemployed ass for helping them move. 

How they actually prepare their food, I couldn't tell you. I am not privy to what goes on in their kitchens, but one taste of their tender, cornmeal-coated calamari (their best appetizer) dipped in that ranchy parmesan-peppercorn sauce, and I no longer care. When they bring out the chilled salad chock-full of tomatoes, greens, onions, and croutons that is skillfully tossed with that exceedingly delicious vinaigrette vs. Caesar dressing, my bias against chains is diffused, and I come to realize that Marilyn Hagerty's humble, Plain-English words are truth --that she is not to be ridiculed. 

Braised Beef & Tortelloni was something I had yet to try, and when it came to our table, my gastronomic heart beat loudly for the short ribs fell apart with minimal chewing as did the portobello mushrooms, the very fungi that rival sirloin in sheer heartiness. The al dente pasta, filled with asiago, wallowed euphorically in a severely savory basil-marsala sauce. Some sour cream could have turned this into a dandy Beef Stroganoff. 

A slightly freezer-burnt (or not entirely thawed?) Tiramisu let me down a little, but its creaminess and coffee-laden flavors couldn't be quelled by some ice-flakes. 

If those preparing OG's dishes are not really cooking, then they are brilliant illusionists, fooling the public (or at least me) into thinking they truly wield culinary magic...or microwaves? Again, I don't know and don't give a bean. The food was tasty on my end. 

P.S. The service here was spot-on. 

P.P.S. That inaugural visit I mentioned was made memorable by a Drew Carey lookalike with a terrific personality and sense of humor.

P.P.P.S. Spare me the snarky, \"A-ha! You don't know food\" messages in which yinz pitifully attempt to \"debunk\" me. It's not as if I value your opinions, do I? 

P.P.P.P.S. I still dig those breadsticks."}
{"text":"Adjust my vibrational frequency for I must live in an alternate universe where Olive Garden's food is quite good. 

We came to this OG franchise last weekend (Kay had a gift card and her parents were willing to take care of the difference), and aside from some faux pas from our server, whom I suspect was just new on the job (we were given a discount because of his mistakes), all of us rather enjoyed our respective meals.

Their salad dressing is magic. Is it a Caesar dressing combined with an Italian vinaigrette? I did take home a bottle of it and read the fine-print. Whatever it is, each helping of greens is always impeccably coated with it sans any excess. 

And it there better calamari out there? Honestly, it is doubtful. Each morsel coated in cornmeal (?) rivals the best tempura seafood in the foodie sphere. Nothing rubbery or less-than-good could be found inside each golden jacket, the creamy peppercorn sauce merely making the fried squid all the more lavish. 

The deep-fried ravioli is somewhat forgettable, admittedly. 

Skipping that, if the Seafood Brodetta is merely shipped in frozen and nuked thereafter, Olive Garden is pulling off the scam of the century. The broth was savory, oceanic, inebriant. Within the dish's lake of ambrosia swam fall-apart tilapia, baby scallops, shrimp, spinach, and mushrooms all of breakable in texture. unbreakable in sapidity. 

Call me Marilyn Hagerty 'cause I kinda feel inclined to agree with her assessment. It may be sad that Olive Garden defeats a shocking amount of mom-n-pop eateries, but my affinity for the bottom dogs will not cause me to lie; I liked my dinners at both this Olive Garden and its sister over in Robinson. 

I may not feel like \"family\" at Olive Garden, but I have yet to leave unsatisfied. Jeer me if you must. 

P.S. How could I forget the tiramisu? Again, if it's already prepared and thawed, I want to be able to buy it at the supermarket.

P.P.S. There is no corporate bribery afoot here. I genuinely think Olive Garden is pretty competent at what they do. If that's a problem for you, seek counseling instead of sending me snarky messages."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Olive Garden in over a month. Very disappointed. When seated, the table was dirty and sticky. Had to ask the server for a wet towel to clean it. He seemed put out. Just a quick wipe. Had to ask for the towel so that we could clean the table ourselves. The menu has gotten very limited.  After ordering, waited 10 minutes for salad and bread sticks. The pasta dishes had very little marinara sauce. We had to ask for more. Food was just ok. When we got the check, we were charged for the extra marinara sauce. $70 for 3 adults without alcohol or desert. Olive Garden has always just had ok food,  but this meal was not worth the price. Service is very poor. If you asked the server for drink refills he seemed as if we were bothing him. That won't be an issue as we won't be back. There are better Italian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night only because it was chosen by others in party. Overpriced for the quality. Had to asked for more salad as we were a large party. Server kept pushing dipping sauces on us - at $4.00 each. My food was overcooked and had to be sent back. Wouldn't be my choice."}
{"text":"Much like the other Olive Garden's this place doesn't vary much from one location to the next... which is good. It is more of your fast food of the italian world but good nonetheless. I went with the soup/salad/breadstick option on this occasion and was not sad. We were seated in seconds, the service was great, and the food was hot. Good quick meal!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Olive garden for years. Tonight has by far been the WORST visit we have had. Took about 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge our presence. Parties that were seated well after us had already ordered and had drinks and salad before we talked to a server. Granted our table was dead center of the dining room so being non visible was definitely not the case. I could go on and on but if I were the manager I would drug test our waitress because something is definitely wrong with her. The food was ok. We received our soup and it was warm at best but this isn't kitchens fault I think our waitress forgot about it and it got cold sitting on the shelf. Overall a very disappointing end to a great evening spent with my parents visiting from Texas.  We will return to this Olive Garden but will ensure we never have this particular server again."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Don't go to this location.  After waiting patiently for about 20 mins for water, we kindly left."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Salad and minestrone soup were good. Ordered \"build your own pasta\" wwith whole wheat linguine and parmesan pesto sause and veggies.
Sorry to say but Pasta had way toooooooooooo much oil in that. The taste wasn't great either. I couldnt eat the whole portion, so boxed it and later when I opened the box, the oil was literally dripping. Good food is about balancing tasty and healthy, but this was neither.
Hopefully this is taken care of in the future.
Cheers"}
{"text":"Awesome service DeAnna should be requested! Manger was also great! Good time great service for my wife's birthday!!!"}
{"text":"The food is the same it doesn't change.  3 stars sound about right not good but not to bad either.

Where they lose all credibility is in the service.  I'm just going to give you the highlights.

* 15 minutes before we gave our drink order
* 15 more before we gave our food order
* 30 before our salad came and when it came it was spilled all over me
* 2 minutes later they were bringing our entrees
* 5 minutes after that we brought out our replacement salad
* no bread sticks
* and finally my glass of water was never refilled.

Before we received the check a manager came over and asked if everything was okay.  The waiter and I both told her a salad was spilled on me.  Her response was good I'm glad you enjoyed it.  What!?!"}
{"text":"Decided to eat an early dinner. The Eggplant was fantastic. He had spaghetti and meatballs. Both of us were very pleased. The only down side was that we did not have room for that Tiramisu! The service is always phenomenal."}
{"text":"Though there are several here in Vegas, this one seems to me, to be the best of them (and not just because its closest to my house). Dine in or take away, this Olive Garden always gets it right. They are accommodating to special / extra requests, and if it's not something outlandish you are asking for, they typically don't tack it on to the bill (I often as for extra sauce for the pasta dishes on the side). The staff that work here are very friendly, and to date, we haven't had a waiter / waitress who was lacking in their service abilities. Their menu has gone through some changes, but many of the classic dishes I've had throughout the years are still there, which I'm happy for, since those are the ones I really enjoy. I know many people don't think of it as \"authentic\", but my kids like it, and so do I! I enjoy ordering curbside pickup for those days when you want to watch that Redbox rental as you chow down, and they are pretty darn close on those pickup times, so you can grab it and go."}
{"text":"I don't enjoy this location as much as I do the one on Cheyenne and Rainbow.
What I did enjoy was the service. I had gotten off a later flight back into Vegas a few days back and really didn't have a taste for fast food. We got to the restaurant at 9:10pm and they close at 10:00pm. We were ushered in like the place just opened. Once we got seated, were were almost immediately greeted by our server, Cisco (don't know if I'm spelling this right, so sorry buddy). Cisco was full of energy, even though they were closing in less than an hour. The other thing I liked about Cisco was the fact that he was engaging with my kids. A lot of servers don't do that and it irritates me to no end. He even laughed at some of their cheesy jokes!! 
We skipped appetizers this go round and ordered our meals. I ordered the Chicken Scampi and Zuppa Tuscana. The soup was on point. We got our meals and I noticed that my Scampi was very dry. A quick mention to Cisco, and I had a large side of sauce. It was awesome. Let me also mention that Cisco must've filled our drinks five times in the hour we were there. 
Based on the service alone, I'd return to this location."}
{"text":"I took my mom there for a nice birthday lunch the food and service was awful. I ordered the baked Tilliapia and shrimp the shrimp were small and rubbery and the tiliapia tasted old my mom ordered some kind of pot pie with Alfredo sauce it was so dry she asked the waiter several times for more sauce but he never brought it thank god we got the salad and bread sticks which were never filled 50$ for a bowl of lettuce and 4 bread sticks never again it was Sunday afternoon the restaurant was empty come on I would have complained at the restaurant bought my mom wouldn't let me she left to go back To New York so I'm writing this now I gave it 1 Star because w like the bread sticks"}
{"text":"Olive Garden now tastes like preprocessed frozen food. Not worth the money wasted here. My wife ordered the Northern tour of Italy. I ordered the normal tour of italy. Both chicken parms were identical shap, size, and breading. They also taste like the cheap Costco patties. Rubbery and hard to chew. The tortellini was over cooked, mushy, and had what looked to be freezer burn on them. The Alfredo sauce was a mess.  It had started to separate and tasted grainy. My lasagna was horriable. the noodle portion was water soaked mush and the bottem over cooked and hard. Just like a frozen one from walmart is after cooking it. Actually the walmart version would have tasted much much better. 

Service also was horrendous.  I had to go get our tea refills twice since no one bothered to check on us. Asked for the manager and 20 mins later got my bill and so I gave up on Olive Garden forever. 

In the end frozen dollar store food cost  us $65. No manager support. Disgusting food. Only good news is my hounds enjoyed the leftovers. But the will eat anything."}
{"text":"Yeah this was not a good Olive Garden. 1. The food was just super average  2. Service was really really bad. They didn't get my order right, and didn't do anything to fix it or make it better. I have been to some Olive Gardens that were much better."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is actually a decent chain place for a good filling meal and tasty inexpensive wine, IMHO. It's not fine dining, but yummy! Our service and food here was good and our server, Henry, was phenomenal. He could work in any high-end restaurant in Charlotte. Stuffed, sleepy. Leftovers to take home... hey, I'm down with that!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Waited 10 minutes and no one acknowledged we were even sitting there. No drinks, nothing. And they sat us at a dirty table. We just walked out. Hostess didn't even care. Will never return to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I am composing a review that has been repressed for quite some time. I had told myself I was not going to review Olive Garden. After all, I have better things to share with Yelp, but... the evil marinara trick still haunts me! Read on...

I too fell victim to the lure of the all you can eat soup and salad and bread sticks. We were leaving our Red Rock staycation, and we were in a hurry, so it seemed like the perfect plan. We sat at the bar because that seemed the speedy thing to do. I ordered, went to the restroom, and when I returned there was a saucer of marinara for dipping our bread sticks.

\"That's cool,\" I proclaimed to my hub and started dipping. It wasn't too delicious, so I didn't dip that much. I then proceeded to eat sub par iceberg lettuce salad with a bland dressing and equally bland soup. The whole time I was thinking I could have just gone to Smith's and bought a bag of iceberg and a can of any soup on the shelf, saved money and had a more enjoyable lunch. 

Then, the bill arrived, and our shallow dish of wannabe Prego marinara was $4. I think an artery busted in my head I was so upset. We had been had. Apparently, while I was in the bathroom, our server had asked if we would like some marinara with our bread, and based on her delivery, my husband assumed it was complimentary. Wrong!

Bland food, tricky servers and overpriced marinara means I will not return."}
{"text":"I love the OG!! The food has always been good here no problems, the service we received was good as usual. The wait wasn't bad and the restaurant was good and clean. If you haven't had the toscana soup it's a must have def give it a shot!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Olive Garden for some time now. I'm sorry but the salad used to be great and the last two times we tried it, I get wilted lettuce that tastes old. Never ending pasta? My plate comes out full of noodles with very little sauce. They seem more interested in pushing more drinks than serving good food."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is Olive Garden, they are so well known for the all you can eat soup and  salad and breadsticks which if you ask me is incredible! I love it. It is a light salad ( just do not splurge on that bread if you know what I mean ) and am awesome selection of soup. But  I think, now why it could possibly be an all you can eat because once the first serving of the soup and salad as well as the breadstick. The second serving takes awhile. But if you have a great person serving you they should be all about going to your table and ask you if you would like to have some more. But believe me it does take a bit of time so you might have to say something. The waiter is so good and soft spoken. I just wish he was there more often to check on us. Its all good. Have happy souper Salad Day :0"}
{"text":"This place has the shortest menu ever, the salad has a lot of dressing and they bring three pieces of bread at a time. I wanted to walk out as soon as I saw the menu. My son who eats everything said this was our worst discussion we ever had. Our best discussion place was Apple bees. But the service was great, the lady was very very nice and attentive. On the upside the food is delicious  I don't eat Alfredo anything but I had the Seafood Alfredo and my compliments to the ? I was in food heaven. The place was not crowded so we got seated quickly."}
{"text":"We waited maybe 20 minutes to be seated on New Years Eve. The front desk staff was efficient and friendly. Our waitress(I'm usually pretty good about remembering names but I failed this time) was super friendly and attentive. She spoke to my kids like what they had to say mattered (and I love that). We waited a bit for our food, but we figured we would because it was busy. The food was okay (reason for four stars and not five). It tasted like food I could've made at home.  But we had gift cards from Christmas and free food is free food. I like that we get breadsticks and soup/salads with our Meals for free. Oh! Also she asked us if we wanted to do a wine tasting at the beginning of our meal, which I think added an extra pizazz to our dinner."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at Olive Garden. Waited 20 minutes for salad. They burned my daughter's meal. We sent it back and everyone was finished eating when they finally brought it out the second time. So she didn't get to eat. The server was terrible. We had to beg three times for soup and salad. Just a terrible experience. Will probably go to Milano's or a different Olive Garden in the future. Just getting hard to get a good meal in Gastonia. If I'm gonna pay $60+ for a meal I expect to get my monies worth. If not I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Walking in we were welcomed, not quickly but greeted. Once sat out server fumbled over a wine bottle , broke off the cork and the speel was clumsy to say the least. I ordered a water with lemon and much later I received a plain water.Our main entries arrive and 2 side items that I had requested while ordering were forgotten. The food was bland forgettable & service atrocious. I would have more fun watching my $45.00 spiraling down a toilet. I'm tired of working so hard and getting less than mediocre food & service!!!

I never received a word from this establishment I'm not surprised!!"}
{"text":"My family and I visited the Summerlin, Las Vegas location for dinner and my party had 8 people. Our server Rosilyn was amazing and truly exemplified the definition of family through her customer service skills and professionalism. I wasn't able to complete my survey review for her because the little table electronic device timed out on me while completing my survey review. I really recommend Rosilyn for future positions in your corporation because she shows commitment and passion for her profession. The best part of our evening with Rosilyn as our server was hat she was extremely patient with grandma and the kids and they were very indecisive being their first time to Olive Garden. Thank you for empowering such a great Individual like Her!"}
{"text":"Best Italian chain in the area. Breadsticks and salad are delicious. I highly recommend ordering a dipping sauce for the read sticks- the marina and Alfredo are both good. In the colder months, their soup is also a good substitution for the salad if you want something tasty and warm. My hubby orders the chicken Alfredo every time and thinks it's the best ever. I change up my order, but have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Worst Olive Garden ever! We got the buy one take one and they always give us the angel hair w meatballs for our buy one take one and the guy said he couldn't ..He couldn't?But everyone else does,but ok.. So whatever then our food showed up with spegetti not angel hair so they took it back and returned it w angel hair and marinara,but we ordered meatsauce. .For anyone who hates tomatoes knows that marinara is full of them and the meat sauce isnt..They took it back and just poured the meat sauce over the marinara U could see all the marinara under the meatsauce ! Omg who does that! We got tired of sending our food back and finally just had to eat it GROSS!"}
{"text":"This was not my best experience at an Olive Garden. The service wasn't bad, but the food was very lackluster. Lackluster to the point where my date and I agreed upon the fact that we could've bought some corkscrew noodles and some garlic shrimp and made the exact meal at home. There was what seemed to be splattered tomato sauce on the wall and it was forgotten about at that. 3/5 stars. Would recommend ONLY if you are absolutely craving Italian food and all of your other options are exhausted."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch for the never ending pasta bowl our server Bonnie M. was incredible made me love the OG again. Love the new asiago sauce and the chicken fritta ."}
{"text":"I came in on a Friday night and the wait to get a table was not long at all, we walked in and got seated within 5 minutes. Our server was Kim, she was amazing! My boyfriend and I are very patient customers so when she forgot to bring out my peach mango smoothie and his lime drink halfway into us eating our appetizers we were fine with it. She always kept posted on us and communicated with our needs very well. 

I ordered a Chicken Scampi and I added Shrimp and my boyfriend ordered a Rosemary Chicken. It was so good! The Rosemary chicken plate was pretty small portion wise but my scampi bowl was big. I ate a fourth of it and got very full. They have their buy one and take one home deal again for certain types of pasta's - starting at $12.99! Wish they had this deal with more options from their regular menu though. 

At the end Kim packed our food and we paid on their convenient tech device that is at the table. Also, this device pad lets you call your server, order things, let's you explore the menu, and take surveys! 

As someone who likes to dine in, eat, and check out quickly, this restaurant helped me do so. I will be back soon (thanks Kim)!!!"}
{"text":"just got told the wait would be 30 minutes. even though more than half the tables are empty nearby. the food has always been pretty good but the hostesses and staff continue to be terrible here. 30 minutes to be seated in an area that is currently empty? ok."}
{"text":"We've been dipping into the Olive Garden well for many years now.  They are reliably consistent with their experience - food, service and atmosphere.  It's our go-to italian place.  Are they the most authentic Italian food in town.  No.  Is it the \"best ever\"?  Nah.  But it's tasty and consistent without fail.  I keep their number in my phone so I can order carry-out when the need arises.

I do enjoy the appetizers - Rizotto Bites, Lasagna Fritta and Fried Ravioli (not sure they have that anymore) are among my favorites.

For dinners, the family likes the old standby of Fettuccine Alfredo.  I like to try various things and, so far, nothing has disappointed.  If I've done something special that deserves rewarding, I'll get the Tour of Italy. :)

Of course, it wouldn't be the same without the breadsticks (we get Alfredo to dip them in).  The soups are great, but I do enjoy the salad as well.

When you're ready for a dinner out, and you need to ensure it will be a great experience without taking a big risk, Olive Garden is a great choice.  They're a safe bet, and never disappoint."}
{"text":"Is is a four just because of the server Abreonna (Ab) bringing the average up.   AB was a solid 5! A real winner!!  

Food was a 2-3. iPhone like device for pay to play games a 0 and Noise level high.  But that is Olive Garden with its full of life swagger.  That said this is the first time I have been in over 15 years.   It was on route from airport to Sedona and a quick stop.  Was just right for our circumstances...and they Even Had a gluten free pasta option.  Seems a lot of food for the dollar.  Many thanks to AB and her manager for hiring and finding and training such a star!"}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden.! I took my boyfriend here for his first time the other week. He enjoyed it very much! This restaurant is pretty busy, probably because of location. We lucked out, a huge party left as we say down. Our waitress was amazing.! She definitely more than made up for the crowdedness. Food was quick and delicious."}
{"text":"It's been about 25 years I think.

For 25 years I've looked at Olive Garden the way that I look at white Chevrolets and JC Penney. An almost generic experience. 

But you know, over a business lunch today I reflected how flawless the experience of Olive Garden really is. It's like what a Chevrolet or JC Penney should be, but neither is.

25 years ago I would have been marveling at America's new dedication to industrial rebirth and automation. GM was building cars with robots back then, you know. How beautiful the future looked. Automation! Computers! It was a second industrial revolution for America! Manufacturing was what America did well, by gum!

Well, nowadays most stuff is built in China. America's industrial base has shrunk. We still make planes and guns. And porn. But not a whole lot else.

And now, we have the clean and modern Olive Garden on Happy Valley Road, where I and my partner were greeted, seated, and beveraged within less than a minute, and attended to by a very pleasant  young server (and his pleasant trainee) who was fully versed in the menu and capable in  various varieties of small-talk. Within a reasonable time we were presented with our soup and salad, which was consistently prepared and reliably tasty.

For a main plate I ordered the Shrimp Primavera, which was delivered a perfect interval after the salad and soup course was finished. My friend had the Ravioli Alfredo, which looked delicious and got his thumbs-up. My dish was tasty enough, and the pasta was al dente. The shrimp were cooked just right--not overcooked and dried out as they usually are in other places. The breadsticks were well-presented--tightly wrapped and perfectly heated--and delicious.

During the course of the lunch our iced teas were refilled regularly, even by servers who weren't assigned to our table. There were regular checks on our welfare and our enjoyment of the meal.

Finally the check came, and given what we had consumed it was a very reasonable price. The waiter included a handwritten card thanking us, as well as a couple of Andes mints. I tipped him well.

There was nothing--NOTHING--to complain about. It was a wonderful lunch. It was full of positive feelings. 

Except for this sobering realization, which probably only affects weird-asses like myself who just can't relax and enjoy:

Working in a place like Olive Garden is all that most of the new generation (like our waiter and his trainee and younger) will have to look forward to. It's what we as a nation still do well. 

We serve precision-prepared breadsticks with a passion. And dammit, we do it well. 

Try doing that over the Internet from India, you heartless capitalist assholes."}
{"text":"Been to this location like 20 times within 4 years.  Coworkers and I usually come here to celebrate something...anything really.....whether it be a birthday, a farewell lunch, someone getting promoted or terminated, whatever it maybe this is usually a top place to go for us.  

This location is pretty clean, and the servers always super attentive and friendly.  However they take forever to order and bring out the food.  

The food is the same as any ole Olive Gardens I been too, and the quality.... mediocre at best.  I do love the bread sticks that they keep bringing out to me.  And those mints you get in the end, absolutely amazing!!  Comes out cold and refreshing!!  Probably the best part of the whole experience.

Overall a decent experience, and I'm pretty sure... 100% sure we'll be back to celebrate something, probably someone's long lost cousins birthday, or someone's funeral... just kidding.........."}
{"text":"A bunch of us came here for lunch to celebrate a coworker's birthday.  This was one of the coworker most favourite place.  So we decided to come here. 

The experience here was pretty awesome for an Olive Garden.  The restaurant was clean, and look like most other Olive Gardens I been too.  The server Joanne was super friendly, efficient and attentive.  Some of my coworkers worked her to death but she took it like a trooper.  She was definitely brilliant.  The food was okay, exactly like the other Olive Gardens I been too.  I always order the same thing a bowl of spaghetti w/ meat sauce.  Can't possibly go wrong with the basic.  

Overall a good experience and we had a blast.  This maybe my last time to this location since I'll be moving to a different work office."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden and everything has always been great. However my Togo experience at this location was not the best. I ordered a little late and made sure I made it there on time to make sure I didn't make things difficult for them. Guys please make sure you check your Togo order before you leave! I found a very long hair in my chicken alfredo! They tape the orders shut so there's no way it was mine! I can't believe it. Im so digested. Probably will not be returning to Olive Garden for a long long time. Most definitely was a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Met up with BFF tonight for dinner and the food and service was mediocre.   It was over priced too.   The waiter was not as attentive this time and left dirty plates in front of me the entire time.   Plenty of parking and the restaurant and bathroom was clean.  Like I've said before I don't care for chain restaurants but get sucked in sometimes. I will probably not go again as their are much better choices out there."}
{"text":"I think this place may be overlooked at times due to it being a chain Italian restaurant. But honestly they do it right each and every time I go, always consistent. The service is fantastic every time, and a manager always touches our table to see how things are going. The salad dressing and breadsticks can't be beat! My personal favorite is the Alfredo sauce; not greasy or thick as mud, just perfect! 

My only con is that its always busy, like even on a Monday lol. But we have learned to make a reservation"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night.  The wait was about 20 minutes to be seated.  The server was very busy but she did take care of us.  Food was ok.  What we like most about OG is that you fill up with soup, salad and breadsticks so you end up taking the entree home.  Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE coming to eat at this restaurant, but tonight I saw a child sitting at the bar with who appeared to be with her parents (or with her mom who was possibly on a date with a man. That looks sooooo bad to me! I'm was wondering the whole time what would've happened if an off-duty cop would've came in there and saw that. That was not a good appearance at all! The owners should be more careful!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm on the mainland (coming from Hawaii) I always go to an Olive Garden.  We arrived, sat, and then a REALLY LOUD annoying couple with a SCREAMING child was seated behind us.  We mentioned it to the waitress, and were immediately reseated in the \"outside\" area by ourselves, and the food was amazing, as usual.  Best customer service ever.  Manager came and talked to us as well as the waitress checking on us to make sure all was well.  

Food was good, as always.  Would definitely return to this location over all the others in Vegas."}
{"text":"The soup / salad / breadstick lunch is what keeps me coming back to this otherwise bland and overdone chain. There are much better Arizona-owned Italian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"old faithful.  had a craving for the soup and salad for dinner.  it wasn't busy but i sat myself in the bar area since i wanted to watch tv.  the bartender was friendly and attentive.  i had 2 different types of soup and i'm a fav of the pasta one.  the bill came out to $11 without any drink."}
{"text":"Scary doors are filthy told the people that escort you to the tables that they were dirty and they told me they just cleaned them the black dirt on the door  has been there for a long time it's  thick just look at him when you enter the restaurant both doors and the second set of doors if the doors in the front look like that imagine what it looks like in the kitchen BEWARE !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well OG, unlimited soup, salad & bread sticks you say. I'll take that challenge. Rolled in to this location on a hungry Thursday afternoon excited about some soup & salad. The service was friendly and quick. The problem was the soup choices weren't very good. Out of 4 only one hit the spot. The salad was good. The bread sticks are always good. The price is reasonable but I'm weary on the soup selections moving forward. Maybe it should just be unlimited salad and bread!"}
{"text":"Got takeout of Fettuccine Alfredo, stuffed mushrooms and their Five Cheese Ziti Al Forno. My God was it a nightmare.
Neither of the pasta dishes tasted like they had any salt in them. The Alfredo was borderline edible, so props for that, as well as the mushrooms. But the Ziti was by far the most unsalted, inedible dish I have ever had from this restaurant. 
Not to mention my wife ended up having stomach problems.
Never coming back here, encouraging people to go to ANY other Italian restaurant in Champaign over this."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a gift certificate for $25, so we had the 2 for $25.  The place was packed out, but we ate at the bar, it was open, and it was great.  The gal there was very friendly, I had a lovely Moscato sangria.  We had totally enjoyed out meal, had the brushetta and calamari, yummy, and then I had Eggplant Parmagino and my husband like a seafood stew.  So much food, we had to take it home.  Well worth a trip for a taste of Italy."}
{"text":"I have NEVER written a review before after hundreds, no THOUSANDS of restaurant experiences. But after my experience today I feel this is a must! I made a reservation for 11 people for 1:00p. We arrived 15 minutes early to check in and VERY politely asked a favor. In the past but not here at the Olive Garden) I have experienced having a party of uneven number eventually seated at at a table where the 5th person is squeezed into a 4 top, 7th into a 6, etc. in our case today I asked for our number 11 to NOT be squeezed in and could we get a table for 12 for our 11 people. 2 very nice hostesses understood and said no problem. We were led to our table approx 1:10 ( no problem at all) only to be seated at a table for 10 which I had to pull over a chair from another table and sit on the end!! For the same reason this is my first review ever, I said NOTHING, bit my lip, and anticipated a nice lunch. Little did I know that my experience would only get worse. 

We had 2 wait people, 1 must have been in training. We proceeded to experience:
1) drinks brought to our table we didn't order
2) being asked if we wanted separate checks (we didn't) THREE times
3) suggesting to a minor an alcoholic beverage, which she gladly accepted
4)having to ask to have our 4 piles of appetizer plates cleared as they were squeezing our entrees on the table. 
5) my soup was spilled in my lap as it was placed in front of me. The waiter made a joke of it, I personally failed to view my damp lap as funny. 
6) in general, the WORST and most UNPROFESSIONAL service I've ever experienced. 

Of course the closer it came to tip time, the damage control came out. We were celebrating a 90th birthday, and our \"90 years young\" celebrant was offered a dish of ice cream with a birthday candle. TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. The food was quite good as it always seems to be at Olive Garden. But because of the bad, no eventually laughably bad service, it will be a very long time, if ever, I step foot in another Olive Garden. There are far too many other good restaurants who will love to get my money!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bouchra was our server today and honestly I'll ask to be seated in her area whenever we go back. She is an excellent server. She needs to hold a training seminar and teach others! I'm not a big Olive Garden fan but I will say the food was pretty good today. Our salad was a bit dry, I told our server & she brought us a very generous amount of dressing on the side. She continued to refill our salad bowl, breadsticks & drinks. When ordering our entrees, I had a few questions about the food & she definitely knew the menu well & answered my question with great detail. My husband usually gets the unlimited soup & salad and usually he has to ask for more soup. But our server Bouchra, was on it! She was right there checking on us and asking him if he wanted more soup! There was also a younger guy who was the host up front, I didn't catch his name but he kind of had the man bun thing going on... all I can say is such a nice young man. Friendly people definitely make you feel welcome & want to go back."}
{"text":"OG has been going steadily downhill for the last few years. Tonight was the end of the line as far as I'm concerned. Server was nice, but not very attentive. We had to ask for drink, breakstick and soup refills. Fettuccini Alfredo didn't have enough sauce, Chicken Marsala was almost $20 and it was terrible. Two of us ordered chicken gnocchi soup and we had two gnocchis between both bowls. $3 for soda? Ridiculous. $4 for one ladleful of Alfredo sauce? Insane. The bill was $71 for three people (no alcohol) before tip and not one of us enjoyed our meal. We won't be going back. Oh, and the floor in the ladies room was nasty."}
{"text":"Brittany is the bomb when it comes to customer service! Despite the packed Veterans Day Dinner crowd that we were part of she was calm, cheerful, bubbly, brought everything efficiently & perfectly timed. Of course the food was good, but overall a great experience and thanks to the whole sweet team!"}
{"text":"Went for pick up ..it is our first time trying this resto since we have a gift card we gave it a shot...and I am very impressed with the service on their to go section.. Preston will really make u feel welcome and give all ur needs which is important.. Its very rare to find a person who loves their job that gives a customer satisfaction. I hope he get acknowledge with his work performance because of him we as a customer would love to go back again"}
{"text":"I have been to this olive garden many times and have never had a meal I didnt like. All of the waiters and waitresses have been wonderful. The only complaint is that the wait time tends to be pretty long during weekend dibember rushes (which is to be expected) but there is barely any seating available for those who are waiting."}
{"text":"Best salad ever! The unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks combination is a steal. Very decently priced for great food. Great service too."}
{"text":"I don't know Vegas very well, but I wouldn't recommend this Olive Garden. The service was slow and food was alright, but I feel like I way overpaid for the quality. Haven't been to an Olive Garden in awhile, but the one back home tastes better."}
{"text":"Talk about FAKE! My husband, my brother & I went fo the OG for dinner - anticipating the usual quality: Family Restaurant AVERAGE. All 3 meals came and were sizzling hot - as in microwave burn your mouth hot. That was the highlight of the meal.

All 3 meals lacked the usual salt. They had no flavor what so ever. Even my usually tasty Chicken Parm was bland. The spaghetti & meatballs my husband ordered had no flavor and the meatballs had a greyish color to them even in the sauce. My brother's food had no taste at all. We asked for the Manager and the \"Chef\" came out in all her glory - fully outfiitted to be the scapegoat. 
I told her our issues and the response was:
\"We get all of our food in - pre-cooked - from a corporate kitchen. All we do is reheat it. It comes in vacuum sealed packages, premeasured & ready to heat & eat. There is very little we at the restaurant level are doing to actually cook/prepare your meals\".
WTH is that about???  She went on to tell us how it was not her fault, and all she could do for us was take the grey meatballs off the bill for -$3.50. 
I understand the place is a zoo with all of the screaming kids & young twenty-something waitresses running between their cell phones & the kitchen... I know it should be considered a gift that we got food at all that day. However - their food is not fresh; their food is not cooked on site; therefore it is not TASTED by a Chef to see if it is OK for service!! 

I have one thing to say - Gordon Ramsay would have SHUT IT DOWN for bad food. We will NEVER eat at the OG again. Neither will any of our friends since they heard this. Call it fast food - not a restaurant!"}
{"text":"The waitress taking our order was great other than that the staff was very unprofessional. We were sitting by the entrance of the kitchen and the servers were going in and out. They started to bring our order out as two of the servers bumped into each other and a hot plate of food was dropped right behind me. The hot food went everywhere burning a patch on my back and arm. No one apologized right away as a matter of fact no one even offered to clean the mess on my chair, table or purse that was hanging on the chair. They didn't even ask if I was o.k. about 10 mins later the manager comes to our table apologizes and he asks if we were o.k and I mentioned the food burned my arm and my back and that there was food everywhere. Needless to say he offered free desert, to which I said no to, and then gave us napkins to clean up the mess our selves. My 6 year old daughter was sitting next me but luckily she was o.k. We didn't want to make a scene so we ate rapidly and went home to put some cold water on my arm. I will never come here again!"}
{"text":"Typical Olive Garden in that the food is tasty. My favorite dishes here are the stuffed sausage, lasagna and fettuccine Alfredo. Food comes out quite quickly and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Seating today was quick as was the service. Our waiter, Andrew, was attentive, offered great suggestions and was quick! The lasagna stuffed Rigatony was delicious!"}
{"text":"Placed a phone order and spoke to 4 different people. Seems like they don't have a solid process in place for taking phone orders. I arrived at the time the food was supposed to be ready and it wasn't. I waited for someone to assist me at the takeout counter for a few minutes. Cashier was nice and food was ok but experience to order and pick it up was bad."}
{"text":"Decent service, food is good and location is convenient. Fettuccine Alfredo is my favorite item. Lasagna is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Came with my girl and her family on an extremely busy night so I was surprised to be seated so quickly. The staff here does a great job with clearing tables ASAP. Stuffed meatballs were dry but everything else was great. I recommend the stuffed shells. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is good but these 5 stars go to our server Hayley N. She took really good care of us. She always kept coming to check on us to make sure everything was ok. She always topped off our drinks."}
{"text":"This place has always been Hawaii's hype and even if I don't agree 100%, I agree in the sense where the bread, salad, and eggplant parmigiana have always sufficed my carby, pasta craving. The service hasn't always been great here, hence the three stars. Normally, there's a little bit of a wait and I don't see why when the place is never nearly full. I figured it out and it could be the lack of servers or just the way the restaurant flows. The drinks are super delicious and I love how they have offers like buy one, take one! I'm sure I'll be back when I have another visitor/visitors from Hawaii."}
{"text":"My friends and I (party of 11) had a wonderful lunch here today. We enjoyed our lunch very much. Tim was our waiter and he did excellent service for us and we all are appreciate it. He is very professional, courteous and hard working waiter, he deserves a pay raise, please tip him good when you visit this Olive Garden next time."}
{"text":"Yummy Olive Garden! I always enjoy their soup, breadsticks, and pasta dishes. Tonight I got the chicken parmigiana and pasta e fagioli. Everything was great. Our server was very soft spoken so it was hard to hear him, but he was still a good server so it was ok. He brought us Andes mints with my to go box, as well as with the check! Love those things! We also got a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to go. We have yet to eat it, but I'm sure it will be tasty. The biggest downfall of Olive Garden is it can be kind of noisy since there's usually a lot of people there with their families. Tonight there was a child screeching at the top of his/her lungs that we could hear from across the restaurant. But did the parents ever take him/her outside? No, of course not! Some people just don't give any thought to anyone else and it's unfortunate. I was told that the location on Bell Rd has little tablets at the tables that you can order/pay on now. Wish this one had those! I think that's totally awesome.
***
UPDATE: I have to revise my review after heating up my leftovers. Something was wrong with the chicken parm... The meat was tough to cut and when I took a bite, I spit it out. It was inedible. I don't know what it was but it was nothing like the piece of chicken I ate for dinner. It was absolute junk... like processed tendons. I wish I had tried that piece when we were at the restaurant so I could have asked for a new one. So disappointing. Because of this, I have to drop the rating from 4 stars to 2."}
{"text":"Just wanted some soup & breadsticks. Got pasta e fagioli for my first bowl. It wasn't as hearty as it normally is, but still tasted good. For my second bowl I got minestrone. There was literally one pasta shell in the entire bowl and about 5 beans. The rest was zucchini and other stuff. Very sad. Everything tasted good and service was about as quick as I've seen, but the soup was a little weak that day."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at this restaurant. My food came out so slowly. The server apologized but I expected a manager to come do something, maybe talk to us? Our food took over an hour to come out. We asked for more breadsticks and never got them. Salad is supposed to be endless too, but when we asked for more of that (it was pretty small for 2 people to begin with) we didn't even get it until our extremely late food arrived. And the food was mediocre once we got it. It seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long long time. You could tell by the way that the cheese was melted on top of the pasta, oily and crunchy at the same time. Definitely not worth the visit, I will never return.

*On top of that, a former employee told me that the general manager was fired for \"re-dating\" old food, to save from wasting it... so we could have been eating old salad or pasta. Nasty!*"}
{"text":"Staff is great friendly, very caring brought my mom and dad for their birthday andbour server William and staff sang happy birthday and made us feel at home. We will return for sure! 

Thank you"}
{"text":"Felt rushed. Pasta came out at the exact time we got our salad. Salad was skimpy with no croutons. Was never offered cheese. No mints either"}
{"text":"Beware of \"Table Game fees\". Those little tablets on the table with the menu have video games on them. They cost money to play and can be accessed by your child without your consent. We had $1.99 charged to our bill without us even knowing. Not a big deal, but beware!"}
{"text":"Back in 2004 when I became a vegetarian, Olive Garden was my favorite restaurant. Why? Those $6.99 AYCE soup, salad, and bread sticks were perfect for a high school kid's budget! More importantly, Olive Garden's vegetarian minestrone soup fit my newbie diet. To this day, I'll still go back to OG for the lunch special, especially when I get emailed a coupon to enjoy it for only $5 (fan club perks)! Bread sticks and even the soup can be hit or miss, but for a $5 AYCE, I'll take it.

The location in Centennial is my go-to OG. Service is usually above average. Food wise, OG is on par with any other major American restaurant chain. Entrees are pretty mediocre, so I stick with my usual.     
 
PRO TIP: Olive Garden gives Veterans a free entree from a selected menu and dependents get 10% of their meals too on Veterans Day. 

Worth a Return Visit?
Only for lunch! Unless I'm dragged here on a couple date. Which happens more than you'd think. Hmph.

{"text":"Kudos to the bartender last night who delivered superior customer service! I forgot her name, but she went above and beyond, and she deserves lots of praise. (If it helps you identify her, she had brown hair in a ponytail and wore glasses.) The little things she did for me made an overall outstanding impression. She was fast and paid attention to detail."}
{"text":"Great night last night. Our server was wry prompt and Nice. The Food was really good."}
{"text":"Today was extremely disappointing.
Came in for lunch and was seated promptly.
Our server Simone greeted us and we could 
already tell that he didn't want to serve us.
Our food was served and he gave us VERY little
of everything. Including 3 bread sticks and a very
small salad. He did not check up on us once during our
entire visit. Another server had to come by and give me
another soup. When a manager came around he asked if we
wanted more bread sticks, of course we said yes
but 20 mins later, the bread sticks never made it back
to our table. Finally our server came back and we asked
for the check. We placed the cash inside and continued
our conversation. He came back once more to collect the bill
asking if we had finished. we told him yes, and that he could take it.
I was extremely shocked when he opened it and flipped thru it
 making sure that it was all there!! (WHO DOES THAT?)
I was highly offended! I can understand that we look like
teenagers and that you don't want to serve us because of
that. But we are of the ages of 28 and 23 and work in
a hospital. We can afford to eat out in a restaurant.
If you see this message just know that we didnt give you a lousy
tip because of our \"age\", we gave you a lousy tip because of
your lack of service.
I will come back, but I will not ask for Simone as a server."}
{"text":"We dine out at this location often. We like our food supper hot and the food here stays hot until it is gone. Even the bread sticks are hot and very fresh and the salad is always top notch. Laura was our server tonight and she was so much fun and took  care of all of our requests. She made the night special. Thank you Laura."}
{"text":"Sunday provides great service! Food is always good but eat here never do curb side pick up because you'll have to go inside every time. They're horrible at bringing the food outside. I prefer the Cheyenne location. Over this one.... Seems like they still haven't worked out all the kinks yet hopefully they figure it out."}
{"text":"My fiance and I love to come to Olive Garden and this location is our favorite! They never charge for extra bread sticks and salad. Staff is always very friendly and do there best to meet all of your dining needs including fast seating, attentive staff and polite atmosphere. Only negative is as usual I always have to ask staff to rewipe table and booth."}
{"text":"I really don't care for this location very much. Its not the lines or anything like that, I fully expect it to be busy. Its actually how customers are treated that makes me mad. It starts with the hosts who almost always quote your wait time wrong and then when they do seat you they act confused when trying to find your table. Once seated, you get slow service from the server who is usually working with 2 or 3 other tables. I don't fault the servers necessarily but it can become annoying. The food is very good, so I do enjoy that part. The one thing that really makes me mad at this location is how all the employees think no one can hear them talking amongst each other. Usually, while waiting you can expect to hear a server and host argue over where or when a party was seated at least once. However the worst offenders seem to be in management. I overheard a manager telling servers, \"customers are nothing more than paychecks, so to speak, nothing more or less. That's how we treat them\". I get they are a businesses but to say that within earshot of said paychecks, I mean customers, seems like bad business to me. So I guess their logo should read \"When your here your family.... the awkward cousin that you really don't like but you have to deal with anyway\"."}
{"text":"Typical chain style restaurant. Ok service. Always busy. Has the computer interactive gizmo on every table so you can feel like you're working there. You can put in your own order, print out and pay without having to bother the wait staff. For some reason my girls love coming to Olive Garden that only reason I come here. LOL"}
{"text":"I don't know what it was, but today was a really bad service day. Especially the hostess. It's a Wednesday at 2pm, it's not busy. And we usually get seated pretty fast with no issue even if we need a high chair. But today, the hostess said they can't seat us because they are waiting on a table where they can put a high chair. They take everyone who came after us. We Are still waiting after 20 minutes. We have sat at a booth almost every time we've been here, with a high chair, but today, it's not allowed. Cool."}
{"text":"Our noodles were not al dente and there was too much sauce. The appetizer was good. I wouldn't order any of the cream sauces if this is per usual. Very disappointing that our main meal was not that great. Good thing we had appetizers to tide us over."}
{"text":"Had togo with a five star this time are waitress was the best they were pretty busy but she was on point also she was very funny lots of laugh food was nice&hot very good got the buy one take one 12.99$ thanks OG"}
{"text":"Its your typical olive garden with the same face as the rest of them. Entrees are usually good but seem to get more bland every year. There wine selection is amazing and I think is the only reason this place is still running. Service is decent but all the service seem to hate there job and just want to move on to the next table. Everyone always talks about how good there breadsticks are but I think there over salted and taste more like cloves of garlic then bread. Its a great place for lunch but definetly not for dinner."}
{"text":"Normally I eat in Summerlin so my expectations may be a bit high. The food is great. The service is great..but boy does this place need a remodel. The chairs have brass wheels and the carpet looks antique. I'm glad the food is fresh. Stop by if you are in the neighbourhood but if you can..eat in Summerlin."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to Olive Garden on Tuesday, May 10, 2016.  My daughter's food was great, she had the cheese ravioli.  I wished I had gotten that dish as I got the meatball sub.  I was not able to eat the bread as it was very well done.  Our first  bread sticks were okay, but the second we had to send back as they also were very, very, well done.  I would not get this sandwich again.  My daughter's leftovers were better than my food fresh at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been going to Garden for years. I've narrowed their menu down to the only dishes actually made in-store. Their pasta fagioli and salad, which are very good. The rest is pretty-much crap. They don't even make their meat balls in store. I only go there because my wife doesn't m ind eating frozen food."}
{"text":"I came here for their Veterans Day meal. I tried the sausage and peppers, which were good, but the waitress kept messing up. First, she tried serving the entre with the soup and salad. When that wasn't well-received, she attempted to put the entres under a heat lamp to wait for us to finish the soup and salad. That was mistake number 2. Mistake number 3 was when the manager came over to give a 5.00 off certificate on two meals. Sorry...lost my vote."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great customer service! My server was very aware of us and what not!"}
{"text":"This visit was the best restaurant service I've had in months! Our server was named Philemon and he was phenomenal! He was so funny the entire time and made the visit so fun! Thank-you for helping us enjoy a wonderful Sunday lunch! The food was also very tasty! I love the stuffed chicken Marsala!"}
{"text":"I called today to try to make reservations.  Their policy is hard to work with and whoever answered the phone was rude. I had a party of six and we went to another restaurant that appreciated our business."}
{"text":"Have been to this location a few times due to a gift card and close proximity.  Had the alfredo.  Was gross, not much Parmesan cheese flavor, just butter and flour....kinda clumpy.  The \"all you can eat breadsticks\" are such a scam.  If you want anything to dip the breadsticks into (dish of marinara or alfredo sauce, etc) its a $3.00 upcharge.  What a scam, Olive Garden should be ashamed of themselves.  My GF had some sort of spaghetti dinner.  The sauce was meaty and watery, not a good combination.  It also tasted like nothing.  We tried the lasagna, it tasted like Stouffers but even more bland.  How's that possible?  I guess all the flavor must have evaporated in the freezer.  Best option is to eat the salad or soup unlimited, skip the frozen entrees."}
{"text":"Gross.  Yes I know what to expect with OG, not authentic, chain, etc.  However, it still used to be a reliable place to get a satisfying meal, and my kids like it.  I went last night and ordered the spaghetti and meatballs (I stick to the basics here; not ordering seafood or anything fancier).  The meatballs honestly had a chemical taste to them.  The marinara sauce was also not good.  The waitress brought us dipping sauce for the breadsticks at my daughter's request (and I don't think she charged us for it), and it was a different sauce than was on my spaghetti, but was also very odd-tasting.  
The waitress was fine, but had a phony, sickly-sweet demeanor that was off-putting.  
I overheard her return to a nearby table THREE times to tell them that what they ordered for dessert wasn't available (like, 3 different choices were unavailable).  I mean, they don't have a huge dessert menu; shouldn't they at least have everything?  It was a Wednesday evening, not a super-busy weekend.
The salad is still good, as are the breadsticks, but they get dry and you really need something to dip them in.
They were having the \"Buy One, Take One\" promotion last night. I asked the waitress about it, since I was ordering one of the \"eligible\" meals for it, and she said it was \"pretty much 70 cents more\" to get the BOTO.  Well, no, the spaghetti was $9.99, and the BOTO was $12.99.  Nevertheless, I ordered it, figuring I'd have lunch and dinner the following day for only $3.  The whole promotion sort of feels like one of those products that are advertised on TV (think Sham-wow), that they can't sell and start giving you one free each time you order one.  Like they're just shoveling bad food at you to get rid of it and at least get some revenue.
The total cost for my daughter and me (two BOTO entrees, two sodas) was over $50, with tip.  Too pricey for this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Olive Garden. However, for the amount of food and the price it really doesn't add up. Not a place I can take my family to without breaking the bank. Also their breadsticks just aren't what they used to be. So unfortunately I won't be going to Olive Garden as much as I'd probably like to."}
{"text":"Last night, we stopped in to Olive Garden for dinner.  I haven't been to an Olive Garden in years.  We were promptly served bread sticks and our drink orders were taken.  It turns out a close friend of ours works here, so we got to chat with her for a bit, which was nice.

I ordered the Chicken Piadina, my son ordered a cheese pizza with grapes, and my parents both ordered chicken Parmesan.  My chicken Piadina was very much like a chicken quesadilla, but with an Italian twist.  My son loved the tablet games ($1.99)!

I had a glass of their red house wine and it was just right.  The food was really tasty and the server was great.  I would visit again."}
{"text":"This location is amazing. Customer Service is great and everyone has a good attitude. The food is also prepared amazing and delicious. The reason i gave 4 stars is because since this location opened, the quantity amount of the food has gone down. The tour of italy is my favorite yet from the day it opened the quantity of food on the plate has shrunk at least 20%. Other than that AMAZING!"}
{"text":"So, tonight the wife and I just wanted soup and breadsticks. Normally, this means a small ticket amount, and in our experience, usually the servers are not happy about us taking up a table during dinner for a small check. Tonight, our server, Brian G was great, and treated us as well as the tables around us. He did great, and we tipped him appropriately. Great job, Brian!"}
{"text":"Went back to this OG tonight. Interesting show.

As I was walking up to the table, I saw server Crag (mentioned in my first review) was waiting on the tables around us. So before he could greet us, I said to the others in my party \"we need to get moved to a different section\". Apparently, the hostess had told someone else in my party that we had a different server, so we settled in and watched to see how things went.

Our excellent server tonight was Kayla. She did a great job. We gave her a diverse set of requests with our order, and she met all of them perfectly. She was attentive, friendly, suggested several upgrades, and generally continued to restore my faith in this location (like Adam and Joey had done before her). Her tip reflected it.

Meanwhile, I watched the tables around us get ignored by Crag again. I thought it was sad that he was still working there, and still meeting his especially low level of expectations that he set for us when we were unfortunately sat in his section. Except this time, there was a manager going around asking the tables if they were happy with their service and food. The tables on both sides of us said the service was really slow and had some other complaints about wrong orders, unfilled glasses, and missing utensils. One of the tables was seated at the same time as us, and in the entire time they were there, Crag showed up exactly twice. The manager had to comp their meal. Not sure how Crag is still working there, especially since there are so many good servers working there, and especially since Crag is costing them money now with his consistently bad performance.

Anyway, the food was good as usual.

I do recommend this location now, and if you ask for Adam's, Joey's, or Kayla's sections, you'll be very happy with the service.

One last point: kudos to the manager (I didn't get his name, but he had short blonde hair and was a consummate professional); he did a really good job of making the customers happy (especially Crag's victims), and he kept the dining room flowing. Nice work!"}
{"text":"Always a great opting for quick Italian food.  I love the soup, salad and breadsticks for a lunch option."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I know it is a \"chain\" but these servers rock,  and the kitchen produces great food. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with the food at Olive Garden. Affordable. Tasty and the friendly staff made our visit enjoyable"}
{"text":"Soup salad and breadsticks.....love love love.  And they have the best coffee.  Service with Austin was great!  Only thing they were missing were the little Andes treats with the bill....it helps take the sting away from how much I just paid for coffee.  Ha"}
{"text":"Had a great time with my girlfriends.  Rakeem was amazing.  He put up with us for hours!  Highly recommend him and the wine list and the Stuffed Chicken Marsala."}
{"text":"Olive Gardens are usually pretty nice across the board and this one was no exception.  The inside layout isn't quite as cozy and quaint as the one we've enjoyed in Flagstaff, with it's nooks and crannies (this place had more of an open floor plan, detracting a bit from the cozy feeling) but still made for an enjoyable evening out.  

The food was delicious (I had no idea lasagna could be eaten fried!  Had to try that one!!) and our waitress was delightful.  I only left off the last star because we had to wait a good 15 minutes for our check and I'm pretty particular that when I'm ready to leave, I want to leave.  Having to sit around waiting detracts a bit for me."}
{"text":"Had a good experience here last night. The waitress was very prompt and attentive. The food came out hot and tasted good."}
{"text":"Visited a few weeks ago. I have to say I was impressed by my waitress and for it being super packed my girlfriend and I only waited about 15-20 minutes! The food was delicious, the service was great, and I could say this is one of my favorite Italian restaurants to go to! You have to try it at least once, especially if you love good Italian food and good alcohol! Lol"}
{"text":"This place is awful! When my boyfriend and I  sat down it took our server 15 mins just to greet us(meanwhile we were sitting right in front of the kitchen and could see that she was just taking her sweet time) then took another 15 mins just to get salad and breadsticks on our table. Our server never came and checked on us to see how we were doing once we got our food (our food wasn't very good) or if we needed anything! I had to be the one to flag her down and get something. I also heard her talking to her manager and she only had 2 tables!!! Us and the table next to us and basically ignored us the whole time. I don't know if she was busy or stressed but if that was the case she shouldn't be working there! I will never be back to this location! So sad!"}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan, but lately this restaurant went down hill food, service, but prices are up. we waited for about 45 min before being seated. while waiting a bartender came out to the crowd and offered wine samples, which was helpful in passing the time. As we set down, the waiter was there immediately and barely let us take our jackets off as she was pressing us to order something.... we asked for an appetizer, but as we are trying to eat healthier, less then 2 min later we asked her to cancel the appetizer. her answer was - I already put it in. My husband said that since the place was so full, i doubt that the kitchen already started on it. so she went back and canceled it. 
Normally it seems that we have to wait to put our order in, but the waitress was next to our table barely letting us view the menu. It felt like we were extremely rushed to eat and get out as they had other people waiting in the lobby. Our salad and soup came in and less then 5 min later entrees arrived. We had no time to enjoy our salad.  
The highlight of the visit was when a waiter came to the table next to ours and put his behind almost on our table and into my husband's face. Then some big lady did the same.  

Olive Garden now seems like a money hungry factory with the goal of taking your money after stuffing your face with cheap pasta. 

One positive - zuppa Toscana is still the best soup around. I have learned to make it at home, so wont be coming back to Olive Garden anytime soon."}
{"text":"Olive garden it just bunch of cheese, pasta and sauce, yet they charge an arm and a leg for it. Another problem - appetizers came out pretty fast, we were still eating salad as our entre came out. It's probably the way that they try and save on salad and bread sticks refills. It felt like they wanted us out of there fast. What happened to enjoying the food and the atmosphere? (we actually do eat fast and even for us food was way too fast). 
Servers were great, friendly, however, as a chain restaurant they are turning into fast food place - get you in, fed and out out asap so they can make more money on the next order of 2 dollar pasta and sauce.  
I would only return there for soup, but I know how to make it at home now."}
{"text":"It was solid food for a good price. Nothing fancy, but tasted good. I really enjoyed the unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks."}
{"text":"Olive Garden(s) is such crap anymore, half the side dishes they offer I could make at home & they taste exactly the same. The servers are always awesome but I can do without the click of high school supermodel wannabe hostesses and over priced flavorless pasta. ...just like being at work, you don't want to go but you have bills to pay, yet every time you walk through the door you think \" Why the hell do I keep doing this to myself\"?
  I got the Tortellini al Forno- boring! There was barley any cheese sauce at all and the bacon pieces were really greasy! Then I tried the Crispy Risotto Bites, not awful but not worth $5.00, the ones @ Bricco taste ten times better. Idk, I'm so bored with the same 'ol menu @ every single restaurant... where else can you get pizza stuffed with pizza on top of pizza, America! A place like Olive Garden used to be classy...like special celebration/date classy not Spaghetti Warehouse meets hospital cafeteria food junk..."}
{"text":"It's no wonder why olive garden and company are declining.   We sat at the bar and didn't get any service for over 10 minutes.   Open boxes, dirty dishes, empty cups lined the bar like a college kitchen.   Not a good experience we ended up walking out and ate at Abuelos next door."}
{"text":"Not much to say other than it is your standard chain Olive Garden. We have had good service at this one each time. We tend to go before it gets too busy so that may be why. My son and I always split the Chicken Parmesian and they always split it up for us on two plates without having to ask, which is nice. Go early and everything should be fine."}
{"text":"My son and I recently had lunch here and we were amazed with the great service provided by our server Kyle. Kyle was very friendly and attentive. On top of that the food was great. The prices are very reasonable especially the lunch deals. I highly suggest coming to this location for a great meal and ask for Kyle to be your server."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped late one Saturday for a few appetizers and a nite cap. Very friendly staff and really enjoyed the food. It will not be the last time we stop by!!!"}
{"text":"Started slow with brand new server Nathan.  He upped his game and we were more than satisfied. James, the GM took the time to get to know us and listen to my Navy Chef days. A highlight of the week."}
{"text":"I went to the Olive Garden in Greentree Pa. Ive never had a bad meal or a bad experience there ever. Today when I went there the waitress made so many mistakes that the one manager there gave me and my wife our dinners for free.I considered that a class move on his part.He new I was right on my complaints.His name is Bill R.He really was upset that my experience there was not as good as usual.We all make mistakes but it how we handle and accept criticism is what turns something from bad to good.I want to personally thank Bill R for understanding of my problems...Thank you Bill R"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times, and I've always had Diane (from Long Island) as a lunch server. She is AWESOME. She's sweet and she has a sense of humor, and she's not the type of server that's only nice when the check comes. So: ask for Diane if you're there doing lunch. She'll be attentive, and she's funny. 

All of the servers seem to be friendly, and the hostess is very nice (I've seen the same one every time I've been there, but I forgot to make note of her name). On my latest trip there was a problem in the women's restroom. I told her about it, and she went to fix it as soom as I mentioned it.

As for food... Olive Garden, in my experience, is pretty consistantly good. This place is no different. Good, hot food, tasty drinks.

In short:
This location never fails to impress me with their service."}
{"text":"New spaghetti pies are ok. Not too big on adding bacon to everything. So Nothing to get too excited about. And I didn't appreciate them taking a very nice quiet evening of couples in the back room and turning it into a circus with small crying children."}
{"text":"We had a gift card and we were crusing through on a road trip. Why not. Alexis was great. She was new. Thought she did well."}
{"text":"I love Italian food. Yes it's americanized and fast food type, but that's what makes this place fun! The service is slow, but the waitress we had was friendly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went there with my daughter and granddaughter .Had to ask for everything drink refills,bread sticks and the server seemed very annoyed by it.So the dinner arrives and was brought the wrong plate I had never ordered this particular dish before so I wasn't quite sure so when server came around I asked if this is what I had ordered she looked at it and realized it wasn't.At this point I hadn't ate from it but had already stirred it up .She takes the plate and takes it to a nearby table .Gross .That shouldn't have been served to anyone after it left our table.Service was horrible .And server needs education in food safety"}
{"text":"If it weren't for a gift card we probably would not eat at Olive Garden.  Our last experience in Flagstaff, AZ was not good.  The food was awful!  BUT, we have a gift card, so we give Olive Garden one more try.  This particular restaurant has only been open a short time.  The building looks very nice on the outside.  Well, the inside is different than other Olive Garden spots.  Very nice!!!  The greeters were right there and eating at 4:30 meant no wait.  Ken took us to our seat and told us about the never-ending pasta ......and he made a personal recommendation...said he's had it many times in a row...it's that good.  (pomodoro sausage)

We were then greeted by Luanna who offered us wine and then took our drink orders.  When she came back we placed our order.  I had the salad, which is always good.  My husband had the Pasta Fagioli soup.  He said it was really good, especially compared to the last time he had it (in AZ). The breadsticks were served HOT.  We were offered refills, which we took.  Luanna came back to see if we wanted more and we said no thanks...need to save room for dinner.  We had spaghetti with meat sauce, which was very tasty and Penne Sausage Pomodoro which also was really good.   It was served, steaming hot and in a timely manner.  When we were finished, she asked if we were ready for more but the portion was generous and there was no way we could eat another bite..She asked if we had room for desert but there was no way.  IT was a great meal for $9.99 each!!!!!!!!

So yes, we will be back to THIS Olive Garden!!!"}
{"text":"So Olive Garden makes promises to replace a meal then decides to rescind on their said offer. Mgr Laure should not make promises that she will not honor. Furthermore Mgr Mckennise does not need to take a negative piss poor attitude towards local patrons. Because of their failure to fulfill the promises we vow to never dine at the Olive Garden again. Please do your self a favor eat at some other iItalian restaurant as the Olive Garden Italian Restaurant does not care about their patrons!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this location. My waiter was really friendly and prompt. Food and drinks were served pretty quickly. I really enjoyed there salad and soups. If anyone hasn't tried their soups yet.. I would suggest getting Zuppa Toscana. It's really delicious and I can seriously eat whole pot of it! haha. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the SSB (soup salad breadsticks). You can for sure share the dinners it is enough for 2. Sometimes the lobby smells a little odd, but other than that, the service is great as well as the food!"}
{"text":"BRRR...THIS A COLD ONE! WHERE IS OUR FOOD?

This is a rough review being that OG's (Olive Garden) is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas. 

Now, first things first our server, Chevon, did a great job!
The A/C must have been on 65-70 degrees not such a bad thing If the food is coming on time, with that being said we're a big family of 6 so I understand why the food could have taken a while and it was a Saturday busy nite.

Our waitress Chevon, was very patient with us we could tell she was very busy so after we placed our first order of lasagna fritta and calamari about 10 min passed still no food.

Side note! We notified her we wanted to take a time gap to ensure our apps wouldn't arrive with our meal!! Making the 10 mins fine... but with no food! No bueno! 

Our server returned to take our dinner order (still no food), we ordered chicken and shrimp carbonara, wife got the same but with grilled chicken, the kids got pizza and fries, kids ravioli, spaghetti with meat sauce and soup and salad for appetizers.

Sadly, still no food! 15 min more or less we finally received the soup and salad still waiting on the 1st order of fritta and calamari. 

Starting to feel the chill about 20+ minutes in, the fritta and calamari shows up, sadly the fritta had to go back it was a lil over cooked but the calamari was good! 

We're now approaching FREEZING LEVELS and are about to cancel our orders! The watered down peach tea( so disappointing ... usually a family favorite!) was not helping and finally 40+ min after placing our first order our food finally shows up.

The food was good but the wait sucked by far one of my worst experiences in OG's I'm sure it was because of the weekend rush but unfortunately it's why I gave 3 stars and that's all thanks to our server, Chevon!"}
{"text":"Went to Olive Garden today for lunch and when we were seated there was this little console sitting on our table where you can place your order, call your server, and play trivia games. No where does it say if you touch this machine you will be charged $1.99. So imagine our shock when we received our ticket. Not that $1.99 is going to break us but still it is the principle of the matter. I wonder how much money they have made off of unknowing customers who do not go over their bill.

Regarding the food.  The pasta was sticky.  They skimped on the sauces and the services was very slow.  The salad looked and tasted like it came out of a bag.  Worst meal I have EVER had at Olive Garden and I go to this location quite frequently.  Overall HORRIBLE experience today."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on Valentines Day and the experience was not very good. We were told their was a wait time of an hour and five minutes which was expected on Valentines Day, however after that time had passed we were still waiting and began to see couples who had checked in after us going in. I went and asked one of the ladies working at the front and had told her my complaint. She ignored what I said and just told me that they are waiting to seat a group of 16 and then we will go. After about 15 minutes we were finally seated. Once we began to order we were still let down when our server seemed like she didn't want to be there. My husband and I joked that she must be at the end of her shift. We were waiting for her to take our order and overheard her talking to a wealthy looking older couple and she was being very nice and sweet going out of her way to do things for them. Once again she would return to us and be very rude and hardly helpful at all. My husband and I being a young couple I guess didn't look like very good tippers so she didn't give us the time of day. Little did she know the tip we had planned to leave, have we had a good experience. Once we were finished we were leaving and we heard other people complaining to get seated and the same hostess told them they were waiting for a group of 16 to be seated. That sounded a little strange since she had told us the same thing about an hour ago. Definitely won't return to this Olive Garden! On the plus side they do have those new computers at the tables so we were able to leave a review there as well."}
{"text":"Request a lady name Danielle! She's awesome! I usually like coming here during my lunch hour and usually at a restaurant like this, you would like to get in and out. Danielle first asked me \"are you on your lunch break?\" I placed my order and within the next couple minutes, here she comes with my soup!  She was on top of everything! I was in and out within 20mins! Nicely done Danielle!"}
{"text":"Hostess was flaky.. asked weird questions on the way to the table. Sat there for 10 minutes. No server. Other people came in.. got their drinks and orders in. Finally left.. location has gone downhill. Went to Oregano's.. sat immediately and taken care of properly.. worth going there instead."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We took are 8 and 3 year old and very accommodating even when my little changed her mind on what to eat! Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Beyond bad service! Soup tasted like dish soap. Calamari was breaded styrofoam. Farmed raised salmon minus flavor. 
NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This isn't a conventional review. I'll keep it brief and say the service and food were great. No complaints at all, and it was a busy Sunday lunch rush. 
I want to just leave a note about the unique experience I had while dining there on 12/3. I went for lunch with my one year old, alone (which can be a challenge in and of itself as any parent knows). My husband works long days so it is my son and I a lot of the times during the normal human hours. I had just wrapped up two long days of work and wanted to spend just us two and not worry about cooking. When the server came to bring us the check we were told it had been taken care of by the table next to us. 
I don't know if that couple will ever truly know what it meant to have that kind gesture. I am sure I didn't say or do enough to show my gratitude. It was extremely touching and humbling as we've been going through a tough time and eating out is a major luxury (one that I probably shouldn't have been partaking in at the time). 
So if those kind folk ever read this: thank you! You are a blessing. You have showed me that God is listening. We all deserve a little kindness and your kindness to us meant more than you may ever understand."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure we all know what to expect from Olive Garden... but what can I say?  I actually like the food.  I know the dishes are prepared and reheated in the microwave but I still enjoy them.  I love the salad dressing (which I buy at Sam's Club to have the same delicious salad at home sans the peppers), and the breadsticks are so addicting!  The service is never outstanding but it's never been flat out bad here either.  I think the prices are fairly reasonable.  My husband and I came here often when they were running their \"Dinner Today & Dinner Tomorrow\" deal.  And the meals actually heated up really well!  Hopefully they will offer this again soon.

I recommend OG for a decent meal when you're just not in the mood to cook or spend a fortune going out."}
{"text":"The togo lady (aimee) was rude. Went in to pick up my to go order... when I placed the order I set the time for 11:50... told her that and she was like oh my  system says noon. I was like I'm sorry I put 11:50 it didn't make a huge difference. But she didn't have to argue with me over time. After that she had a bad attitude and her \"customer service\" was horrible."}
{"text":"Went last night and it was a madhouse! Sat at the bar and Miss Keira took care of my husband and myself. She asked me what i wanted to drink and i replied something sweet and alcoholic! She came back with a mango strawberry margarita. It was fabulous! 
The food was good too.  We shared the salad and breadsticks. Which were soft and perfect. We also shared an app. of calamari, stuffed mushrooms and  mozzarella sticks. We both had shrimp alfredo. It was pretty good.  No complaints about the food. 
But the timing of the food was a little off. Our apps and main course came out basically together. At least we got them in a timely manner. Thats why the 4 stars instead of 5. 
We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We have been long-time customers at Olive Garden. We were there on Tuesday, 3/7/18. The restaurant looked like it is undergoing some sort of remodel. Although not full - we were shown to a table right by the kitchen.
When our waitress asked for our drink order, we both requested water. She obviously was not  pleased. Some time later she asked if we got our water, and we said no. So she got one of the young men to bring it to us.  She came back to take our order, and was not impressed that we did not order high priced items. My husband wanted the soup and salad, and I asked for soup and fettucine  alfredo.  She asked if she should bring his salad with my soup, and his soup with my entree. We said yes. 
My soup came and it was barely lukewarm. My husband got his salad. I sent my soup back to heat up. As soon as it came back and I took 3 sips - my entree arrived! By the time I finished my soup and started on my entree it was no longer hot, but I kept eating. My husband didn't get his soup until I was half done.  All this time the waitress was chatting with the people at a table behind us.  She was also helping train a new person. We were overlooked.  The food was okay, not as good as usually. Service was not good. Just thought you'd like to know."}
{"text":"My family love coming here every weekend.  We got the same waitress one time, and she remembered everything about us and lots of things that we had ordered before.  That was amazing.  The food was great.  The kids love the atmostphere here.  I tried to be on my diet, so I always order the soup and salad.  I splurged my calories on salmon once, and it was delicious.
My friend said that different locations tasted differently.
I want to try another location next time."}
{"text":"We had the loveliest service here yesterday at lunch. Olive Garden has been somewhere we usually go to for the kids when we end up in Calgary for a few days. Consistent and a hearty meal. We now have two family members that are Vegan and often this can be difficult to work around. Our server was amazing! We were able to work a dairy free pasta sauté, bread sticks and tasty salad without any issue. The non Veg eaters were also thrilled with what they received."}
{"text":"This location is so horrible. GHETTO!!! Not only that but the serves have no clue whats going on , they tried to sit me at a dirty table . Then told me to wait as they readied another, i just left 

Horrible"}
{"text":"This yelp will be for their take-out.

1.  Are use the app to order online. The app was OK and my biggest complaint would be that there was no place to put special requests, extra sauce, no dressing on the salad....  Other than that OK apps not that bad

2. I ordered an appetizer.  The meatball stuffed pizza fritta.  OK first thing they did wrong was put fried food under seal in plastic. It was wet and mushy. Now let's talk about the actual food. I'm not sure why they use the word stuffed because there was not even the equivalent of one whole meatball in the entire appetizer. If I didn't live a distance away, I would've brought it back.

3.  I ordered the lasagna. How hard can it be to make lasagna for people that are allegedly trained in the Tuscany area of Italy. Let's start with the temperature. Cold. For 1499 the portion size was ridiculous. I ask for extra sauce and did not get it.  It tasted OK once it was heated but I would never order it again."}
{"text":"Well seems last nite everyone came out of hibernation. This place was packed. Largest crowd I've ever seen. They have made steady improvement over the last year or so. Tonite was a really great experience. They said wait time was 45-50min, actually got seated in 35 min! Our waiter OUTSTANDING!!! Great personality didn't try to sell me. Simple order salad and calamari (eating light). Beverage, bread sticks arrived in 3 min, Salad thereafter. Standard salad bowl. Everything was fresh. Server brought some olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the break stick's first!! Calamari arrived, hot and crispy. It was perfect!! 
Watching table service at other tables, tonite this restaurant on its game on I was actually impressed, as opposed to other times we've been there....going out on a limb here...Given what I saw tonite I'd definitely come back. Hopefully this was not a one nite stand so to speak. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my aunt, and she had a steak, and I had the Chicken Scampi. Lets just say, it was not worth the wait. Her steak was dry, salty, & well-done. The wait was at least 15-20 minutes for two people. We were the only table that was not asked if we wanted water. Other tables around us had water. The only good part about this experience is the drinks. The drinks we had to wait 10-15 minutes for it, but it was good. Everything else was bad."}
{"text":"We had a server named Patrick today and all I can say is that we could not appreciate him more. From working in the industry we know that we should not have walked in so late, but we did as we were all starving for some pasta because of a long day out. We figured we would get closing time service but we did not. I think every server should model their service after this man and the fact that he was so gracious is an inspiration to what humans should act towards each other like. 

There is not a kind enough thing to say in the world about Patrick and I just hope that I get to be served by him again. And of course, the food was consistently good as always, as it had been for the past 10 years we have been going here, no doubt because Patrick was paying close attention to everything that was coming out of the kitchen. 

Thanks again Patrick if you're reading this, what a inspiration you have been. This is somewhat a review of the location he works at, but honestly a review of the server you should ask for."}
{"text":"I must say that I was very happy that they brought back my favorite menu item braised beef and cheese tortellini! Ordered an appetizer Lasagna Fritta which was delicious! Ordered some white moscato wine which was very good and the hostess was kind enough to give me a free glass of red moscato just to try :)"}
{"text":"The server was very much in our face the whole night. Eavesdroppping on our conversations. Being annoying. Also stood there and waited for us to tip when we handed him the bill. Luckily my husbands a sweetheart because I would've dropped down a dime and left. I just find it very rude! The food took forever and it was cold when it got to us... Not worth a 90.00 tab to me!"}
{"text":"so I picked Olive Garden for my birthday lunch/dinner.  it was awesome.  I got a special with Rigatoni and sausage and my salad tasted extra good.  My friend really did not want to go seeing he does not like pasta, but he ordered a chicken dish with mashed potatoes and said he would definitely come back.  we topped it off sharing a tarimisu and had an excellent lunch. had an excellent waiter who was totally on top of service.  I will be back."}
{"text":"After Restaurant Week, my stomach was craving something simple. No more three to four course meals. No more fine dining atmosphere. No more elaborate restaurant hoping. All I wanted was the neverending soup, salad, and breadsticks. 

When my friend and I got off of work, we booked it to the OG to get our fix. For less than $8, we could have ate til our hearts content. Our server, Ray, was attentive with drink refills, soup swaps, and salad changes. After two soups and a salad each, we called it quits. Even if we had not, Ray would have kept it coming."}
{"text":"Best food ever! End of discussion. I love coming here! Friendly waiters and delicious breadsticks!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's Olive Garden, so most of us know what to expect but.... For the last year or 2, have been going to this location. Almost always go on weekdays for lunch. We dine in the Bar area, and always always ask for the same young waitress (Tamara I think but I'm so sorry if I got that wrong).  She is fantastic. And its so funny. The Bar if full up, with people like us, that love her so much, they are her regulars. For a waitress at an Olive Garden to do that is pretty impressive. She also works on the new store set up team, so it's fun to hear hear little stories about the good time they have setting them up.

Food is always good, but the service is FANTASTIC!!! This girl deserves a raise! ;-)"}
{"text":"Holy cow. I've never had worse service in my life. My wife, mom and I get asked table or booth and I say booth. They bring us to a table. Ok whatever honest mistake. We get sat down. 20 minutes pass and no one sees us so we have to get up and get someone. Okay. It happens fine. We order drinks. They come back and tell my mom they don't have it, I guess they don't inform their waitresses of out of stock items? They bring her the right drink and I ask for the digital screen tablet thing because ours wasn't working. After some time, they brought us our food and brought my wife the wrong dish. Then we had to wait for the right dish. We get the bill as a single bill when we asked for two separate. Mom looks at her bill and the pricing was more than they said (she got a special) the other drink they offered her to replace the wine they didn't have, was more expensive and they didn't tell her. Holy crap. I think McDonald's employees care more about their customers. Olive garden had really declined in their service since I was last here with my family. Don't waste your time here people. The food wasn't that great and I came here to have a nice dinner with family. What a waste of time. They knew they screwed up and even a manager came by and didn't offer any kind of recompense or curtosey. 
You're better off looking for a different Italian restaurant nearby.

EDIT: MY MEDOUM RARE STEAK WAS MEDIUM WELL."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have soup salad and breadsticks with my new gift card for dinner. We sat down and waited to be greeted and the first thing our waiter told us is that they're out of salad. How is this possible when their salad is what they're known for?? Poor planning on their gms part and a loyal Olive Garden patron lost."}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain. And who hasn't eaten here? The food is decent, the atmosphere is not annoying, staff is usually good. So why not eat here every once in a while when you don't want to cook and want something familiar. I still love their all you can eat salad and breadsticks. They seem to take some of my favorites off the menu, but I have my stand by Chicken Parm."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden, what can I say?
Staff was pleasant and helpful. Place was clean. Food is okay, it's not authentic Italian by any means. You can probably make better Italian at home even if your Irish but it's quick and familiar, it's just easy. I love the salad and the bread sticks. 
Skip the Rice Balls on the 4$ menu, it's pretty much white rice mixed with cheese, breaded and fried with marinara...totally tasteless.
We don't go here often, maybe once a year if we're lucky. I'll probably keep it that way."}
{"text":"I'm little disappointed on my food, normally its been great with other locations but this location isn't great, I've been here twice now and every time I'm here I feel like they don't take good care of my meals, my stuffed mushrooms were extremely dry and normally have some sauce under them but this is disappointing, I don't think I'll come back to this one :/"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here. Really love the breadsticks and salad, as well as the lasagna and chicken parm. No matter which location I am at, they have great customer service, food and quality."}
{"text":"Its a chain restaurant, nothing to write home to mom about!  I would recommend if you like eating at  Olive Garden then go and enjoy.  this site the food was bland and the food server didn't offer more salad and was very disengaged.     We will not be back...."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is their consistency. The food is great. However, I especially like that they offer low-calorie meals and put it on the menu. The service is always been very nice and relatively quick. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I always enjoy their salad.  We ordered Tilapia and Asparagus dish but it came with green bean no asparagus.  Taste was good though."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick place to have a dinner before a movie with a friend.  It was between this and the other restaurants in the West Towne Mall area.  My main motivation was dessert so that is why we picked the Olive Garden.  

The server gives you a taste of wine as you seat down...to tempt you into buying a full or fuller glass of it.  Okay Olive Garden, you sold me on the sweet red wine.
Ordered the calamari, it's serviceable.  Ordered the Pasta e Fagioli.  It's a good soup.  Breadsticks, you bet I will have one or two.

For the entrée, I had the Tuscan steak with the lobster ravioli.  The steak was cooked and seasoned well.  I was not a fan of the Lobster ravioli.  It really had the taste of imitation seafood.  I would not order that again but my friend enjoyed it.  So you can skip it or try it as two people had two different experiences with it.

Ordered the Tiramisu, just plain delicious!  The real reason to come to the Olive Garden.  

Our server was good and attentive.  The food came fast so we were to the movie theater with lots of time.  Left with a doggie bag of steak and calamari so I had lunch for the next day.  It was a nice stop for dinner."}
{"text":"Rediculously slow and bad service. Everytime waitress had to go do something she disappeared for 10 mins. Forgot our drinks. 15 mins to pay and get change."}
{"text":"We come here a few times a month. Service is always good and food is what you would expect. Tonite we placed our order and waited 63 minutes for our food. Absolutely rediculous."}
{"text":"I been here before several times actually but my experience today makes me not want to support their business anymore. I came in 15 minutes before they closed because I was craving it and nobody was up front, 5 minutes pass and then somebody decides to finally come up and talk to us but not to sit us down, after of still standing there waiting for a table we decided to leave. My question is why say you close at 10pm if you guys are really going to stop serving and people and start ignoring them at 9:45pm instead?"}
{"text":"Great service! Clean! Food was great!! Our waiter was outstanding and always making sure we were taken care of! I highly recommend this Olive Garden to anyone that appreciates great service!!"}
{"text":"I hate chains so a stop @ The OG is out of the ordinary. Our server was a bit out of it.. When taking our order and trying to gracefully open our wine. I always go w the chix parm which was lacking sauce and appeared dry. The salad seemed a bit mushy but she gave us breadsticks to go. Didnt expect anything more, or less."}
{"text":"Commercial Italian - had a gift card so needed to use it.  Moderately priced value for what is presented and always something to bring home"}
{"text":"Daniel was an excellent waiter. The food was good also and we didn't have to wait long for service. Happy overall."}
{"text":"Breadsticks aren't Fazolis but I'm deeply in love with their chicken parmasean  and the chicken dumpling soup.. OMG I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"I was forced to dine here since my in-laws were in town and chose this lovely *eyes rolling* establishment for dinner. How does this place stay in business?? Seriously? The average patron in the waiting area reminded me of those 'People of Walmart' emails I get occasionally. The staff wasn't much better, walking around without a smile to be seen. I could not find one staff member that didn't have a frown on their face. We were told a 20 minute wait for a party of 6 and must have sat there for 30 minutes until being called. Our waiter, when he decided to grace us with his presence, tried to take our drink order by memory until he realized it was too much to remember and went scurrying for a pen and paper. I didn't catch his name, but he was short, bald and had a blond goatee. The whole meal was a complete catastrophe. Where do I begin? The $24 \"pitcher\" of sangria that was the size of a big gulp and so filled with ice it could barely fill 3 glasses? The 30 minute wait for effin bread sticks and salad? The hour long wait for our entrees when 4 of us ordered the fettuccine Alfredo? The hour long wait to get our check? Our waiter should have been named Houdini because he pulled off quite the disappearing act. In the end we had been there for 3 hours on a Thursday night, and let's face it, the food is below par at best. This experience just reaffirmed my belief that some chain restaurants are busy for reasons beyond my belief. This one might have been less busy if it didn't take 3 hours to turn over one table."}
{"text":"Came in to dine in and had the pleasure of being served by Justin ! He was very attentive through our visit! We received outstanding service ! You can tell he goes out of his way to serve every customer thanks Justin !"}
{"text":"I only really go to Olive Garden when someone else suggests it. Other than that, I don't really crave it. 

The service at this Olive Garden isn't as good as before. It took a while for our waitress to come get our drink order so we ordered our entrees at the same time, might as well save her one trip. She wasn't very attentive... our table kept accumulating plates and she kept putting more without taking the empty ones.

I don't usually complain about food taking forever to come out, but it took unusually long for our pastas. It was literally two of the same pastas (two kid's chicken Alfredo) and an order of mushroom ravioli. The ravioli was okay, maybe I'll stick to their lasagna. 

For dessert, we got this dessert shooter things. Forewarning, they are REALLY sweet. I can barely finish one without regretting each spoonful. 

Eh, I don't think I'll come back unless someone REAAALLY wants to go."}
{"text":"Nick was a great server and very attentive. Food is good. You can get full on the bread and salad before your course arrives ! Haha. Theyre also offering samples of wine ."}
{"text":"Apparently two of us were given the kids portion while one of us got the portion the really resembled the menu.  When asked why the difference?  The waiter claimed he did not see any difference and acted as though nothing was wrong.  Maybe I'm wrong here are two pictures comparing two of the same order (shrimp scampi with asparagus).  At no time was a manager offered and a manager never even touched our table.  We had a 12 person table and for a manager to never even come by.  I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Levi S. Was an amazing server and made the whole experience amazing. The chicken Marsala was amazing and his recommendation. We will definitely be back and asking for him!"}
{"text":"We came here because we had a gift card to use and we don't have an Olive Garden where we live, so we thought, \"why not?\" 

It was packed, but we still got in within 10 minutes or so. Our waitress was nice, a little frazzled with the crowds, but still nice. I needed a gluten-free meal, and they were out of the gluten free penne noodles, which was a bummer. Instead, I got the steak and chicken skewers with veggies, and the meat was ok, but the veggies were soggy. My husband got the portabello mushroom ravioli and liked it. Our drinks were kept filled, and our check came out on time too, but with no andes mints :( We were bummed about that. 

Overall, its a typical Olive Garden! They are pretty consistant throughout the country."}
{"text":"I don't care for the darn screens on the table. I go to a restaurant to have service not to be told to use a computer to order food. Additionally why tell us to use the computer to pay but then the computer is so good that the server has to stay and help us with the computer, only to get frustrated and do it them selves. The bread sticks and salad are still very good. I wish there menu was better when it came to gluten free items. Only some of the items are labeled and the rest you have to use those darn computers to find out. Yet even those computer GFree menu is not clear. At least our water glasses were always filled."}
{"text":"Server did not seem to be paying attention to what we were ordering. Food came, no flavor to it. Margarita seemed watered down. Fried mozzarella app was probably the best part of our meal. We didnt have a device on our table to pay, so the server had to ring it up in the back. When he returned, we noticed that the \"tabletop games\" that you can play on the device was added on there for an additional $1.99! After knowing that we didn't have the device, it just showed that he was NOT paying attention. Manager took off, had to re-ring in the bill and re-scan my card. Very disappointing, especially since it was my wife's birthday, which I mentioned to the person seating us, however nothing was acknowledged on that side either..."}
{"text":"You know I'm not a chain restaurant kind of guy, but Olive Garden stands above most.  This location actually tries.  The staff is always pleasant and helpful.  The bartenders are friendly and know their drinks.  I've had a lot of good experiences at this location.  It's across the street from Firestone, Goodyear, and Midas, so I find myself here for lunch while I get an oil change or inspection a lot.

The lunch specials are pretty good.  All you can eat soup and salad is fast and a good price.  All you can eat pasta isn't bad either if your appetite is a little stronger.  Dinner entrees rotate with the season, but the staples are always there as well.  I personally like it this way.  Keep what sells but allow one to branch out once in a while if so desired.  For me, I like the tour of Italy and it's usually my go to when I'm here.  Chicken Parm, Lasagna, and Linguine in Alfredo.   Deserts are also good.  Sign up for the email club to get one free on your birthday."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is Olive Garden. We go to chain restaurants because we know what we will expect from them. Will it be the best Italian meal we have ever had? Probably not. But it's solid, reasonable and reliable, through and through. 

I will say today we stopped in for lunch and had amazing service. Our waitress was super sweet and attentive, not to mention she made sure we could use our free appetizer coupon and made the overall dining experience very pleasant. 

Service was quick, food was hot and tasty, and there was no wait (again, lunch time but still). 

I think they have a decent lunch menu with a great value. You have a variety of options that can come with either soup or salad, or of course you can just do unlimited salad and soup with breadsticks. We all left stuffed and didn't spent much. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Olive Garden because we happened to be in the neighbourhood and were hungry (the Mexican restaurant across the street wasn't open yet, or we would have gone there).  So we settled for something that was open and easy.  Horrible mistake!  I honestly would have been more satisfied with McDonalds (yuck!).

First of all the server had no idea about the wine...fine, it's a chain restaurant, nothing fancy...but still, a basic knowledge about beverages should be a training requirement.  Plus when you try a wine to see if you like and then decide to order it upon tasting, in most places they provide you with a new wine glass.  Not come back and then fill your testing glass.  Picky?  Maybe...but I'm pretty sure that's standard service etiquette.

Onto the salad...the Caesar salad included had to be the most embarrassing plate of food I've ever had in front of me.  Both of our bowls had the whole large stem of a lettuce head in the bowl and 3/4 contained rotting leaves.  And I mean rotten!  Not being picky, like there were a few brown leaves, but black and practically compost!  The croutons were stale and the whole salad was swimming in dressing.  Completely inedible.  I wouldn't have fed it to a farm animal.  

My partner had some pork entree, not memorable, but as he was starving he didn't really complain.  I had an angel hair pasta with a garlic tomato sauce, which was more like diced tomatoes with garlic and parsley.  I'm pretty sure they tossed together the bruschetta with some severely overcooked pasta.  The noodles were a quarter size of what angel pasta should be when served (because they were overcooked, tossed and basically fell apart).  I tried a few bites and couldn't do it.  It was like eating broke college food...the kind of meal you throw together with the remainders of your fridge and cupboard.

We ended up complaining to the waiter, who was dumbfounded - so we ended up asking for the manager - and got our meals fully comped and a free dessert.  All we ended up paying for were the drinks, so that was kind of nice.  The manager seemed kind of used to complaints, or had one look at my meal and had no problems agreeing.

I'm no food snob, and I'm not picky either and I knew going to a chain restaurant (which I usually shy from, but again it was there and I was hungry) was a bad idea...but this was epically disgusting!"}
{"text":":) What can I say? It's always yummy food. However, I am reviewing because of the service. Out server Lynwood, provided EXCEPTIONAL service. I was impressed by his professionalism and how attentive he was. Olive Garden, you owe this 5-star review to the amazing customer service of this particular server."}
{"text":"Last minute decision to head to Olive Garden for lunch. Didn't have to wait for a seat. Service was fast and the server was nice. 
We decided on the soup, salad and breadstick combo. The salad was good, we had the cheese added which was a nice touch. We both ordered the chicken gnocchi soup that was pretty good. We had the peach raspberry tea which had frozen peaches added. 
We don't usually order a dessert, but today we did and chose the wild berry layer cake from the dessert menu. Looks like it's a new item for them. It was light and tasty, perfect lunchtime dessert choice 
Since this is a chain restaurant, you know what you're are getting here, there are no surprises."}
{"text":"Three stars for the decent food however the fourth star topped for the awesome service. Overall my children enjoyed and I am still not a fan of chain restaurants like Olive Garden. Not because the food isn't good, its because my taste rather have authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"My kids love this place and just for fun and giggles we come and visit. 

The service is always fun and the food gets us full. 

We come for the memories more than anything else. 

Thank you Olive Garden for decades of good times."}
{"text":"Our waitor, a young man by the name of Aiden was outstanding. Our food was very delicious"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous like always and our waitress was the sweetest and super helpful! Will definitely go back to this location"}
{"text":"It's that time of year, all you can eat pasta bowl, $9.99. My husband loves this and we always try to make it in during this time. I think this is our first time at this location. 

We order an appetizer, stuff mushroom caps with crab meat and breading, spicy calamari, and toasted beef and pork ravioli. It was nice and crispy, not much spice? But a good combination. 

For my entree I got the braised beef tortelloni Tender sliced short ribs and portobello mushrooms tossed with asiago-filled tortelloni in a basil-marsala sauce. Very tender and juices were butter and rich, enjoyed it! I also got the standard all you can eat salad and bread sticks. 

My husband got soup, zuppa toscana, Spicy sausage, fresh kale and russet potatoes in a creamy broth. And then the spicy three meat sauce, with meatballs and spaghetti pasta. He could only eat one bowl today, it was a generous portion!

To wrap things up we shared a pumpkin cheese cake, a good ending to a gereat meal, good service, great food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Here with hubby fir Valentine's Day.  So delicious I can't believe I finished it! 5-cheese hot app with garlic crostini, salad (too much dressing though), and stuffed chicken marsala but all the cheese stuffing smooshed out, so be sure to get some cheese and sauce with each bite of chicken.  Wished the chicken had been more fork tender. Mashed potatoes were good but nothing special,  would probably sub veggies instead (I didn't pay attention what came with it).  All in all a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Sat down right away at the bar didn't have to wait 40 min on table, which is normal for Friday night. Always go for the never ending bowl even though they keep raising the prices but then again I have not been here since the fire."}
{"text":"We dined here on a busy Saturday night. The food was really good but the service was pretty slow. They had quite a few big parties, so slow service was understandable, but it seemed like they just didn't have enough servers helping each other out. Our server was very nice :) We will go again."}
{"text":"Saturday night I order the buy one get one for my daughter her friend myself and my brother 4 meals for 34.00 dollars is pretty good deal. I showed up 10 minutes early for my pick up. I waited patiently was helped right away too. The girl was nice. But she forgot my bread sticks. Of course they were old and hard. 
Everything else was okay."}
{"text":"It's love and hate with OG. It's not about the food, the food is always good it's the service. We seem to always get the crappiest server/waiter/waitress. Sigh.....today we got a grouchy women who took forever to come to our table then she has the nerve to say, \"we'll do you know what you want?\" Geez....no thanks for waiting or anything. We proceeded to order and them I asked if I could get the pasta with wheat instead of penne. She gave me a long blank stare......seriously?!? I guess that was too much to ask. Well anyway it gets worse...at the end of meal she just asks of we need anything else...lol! Well hello we still needed our desserts (that came with meal)....yup that's why we don't come to OG except for once in a great while. Service is just horrible. Our waitress name was Kimberly (with glasses) if management pays attention to these type of posts."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice and very friendly but they had to make my dinner 3 times before the got it right. 1st time they put on the wrong sauce. Second time they had no filling, just noodles and sauce. It was lasagna noodles only. The third time was good. I'm upset that by the time I got my food my party was already done eating. When we got the bill they not only charged me for the meal but they charged me twice. I should have been comped not double charged. Manager just shrugged and said \"oh sorry\". Not going back to this location."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this place, by far the worst service ever!! Took an hour to get our APPETIZER. Our waiter didn't touch our table to even tell us a ETA on anything received our app 2 minutes before our entrees. Manager took our order. When my fiancé asked to order limenade he ask for the blue berry one and she had to look at the menu because she had no idea what he was asking for??? We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Muy buena comida todo muy limpio me gusta mucho comer en este lugar gracias a las personas tan amables"}
{"text":"We ended up going here for date night because of their new 2 for 25.00 special. I was pleasantly surprised with the entire meal, we got a double order of bruschetta, all u can eat breadsticks and salad and I was full before we got the entrees! 
He got the eggplant parm and I got the five cheese ziti. Both meals were absolutely delish and we could barely walk out of there we were so stuffed. They were super busy so the overall service wasn't that great but the food made up for it. I would definitely go here again to take advantage of that special. Its a LOT of food for only 25.00, you just cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure eating here ....yummy food never disappoints. Soups are amazing delicious well everything is delicious here"}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped by Olive Garden for dinner and it was super crowded on a Thursday night!  We waited about 20 minutes for our buzzer to light up to tell us our table was ready! 

We were taken to a booth and the fun began! 
We Perused the menu only to find the wonderful selections to create your own never ending pasta bowl! Never ending and boy did it keep coming! 
I had to tap out after one bowl and two two fork fulls of the second (I know, I'm a lightweight)...

Our servers name was Esrin and she was great! Very knowledgeable of the menu and the preparation of each dish!  She checked on us numerous times, the beverages restocked, the pasta coming and he bread plenty! 

Oh yes, Esrin offered us a sample of a Moscato wine and it was very good! I suggest ordering a glass if you order chicken, fish or something with a white sauce! 

Now I see why there was such a crowd on a Thursday night!"}
{"text":"Love this olive garden. Great food, great service! Always gets to the table on time, we get sat promptly, and service with a smile! Thanks!"}
{"text":"We set at the bar didn't have to wait... We just wanted a quick bite before going to the galaxy theater on a Friday night. I think it's cool now that you can order from the touch screen at the table. We make our own pasta dish which turned out to cost too much for the flavors...
Everything else is not bad."}
{"text":"Everything was great except our first impression, Maryann the host, took a long time to seat a family of 4 when it was not even busy, and her attitude was disgusting. i took my family for the first time because i had gone for a business meeting at another olive garden and i thought it was great. little did i know that her vibe was going to kill our appetite. my wife doesn't want to go to this olive garden anymore. Kelsy was an amazing server though."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer so I could visit the Olive Garden more often. The unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks deal is my go-to every single time I am here. The Zuppa Toscana and Chicken Gnocchi soup are most amazing in my opinion. Compliment that with a peach Bellini Tea... just wonderful! Also, if you are not a fan of Italian dressing and would prefer Ranch, they have that as well for your salad. Not to mention their Ranch is delicious and homemade."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. But nick was the best part. He had great recommendations and took care of us all night. Nick needs a raise... No he didn't pay me to say this. You need to hire three more Nicks. Great work. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm as afraid to write this review as I was to admit:
...My love for Anne Murray songs...\"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry...\"
...How sometimes I chew my toenails off...(and save them for salad toppings.)
...That yes, once, once for a year or so, I smoked Capris Ultra Lights. Menthol. 120s. 
But I went to Olive Garden. And I enjoyed it. Stuffed mushrooms. Better than Oregano's. Fettuccini Alfredo...sauce clinging to noodles like The Hills girls to their careers....just barely and not smothering. The infamous salad...you know what?...quite good and with those galdarn breadsticks, almost orgasmic. Rickie's Marsala chicken...perfect...really! 
I had generic wine with great service and left very happy. Shout out to Stephanie especially who served and put up with a gaggle of urbanites in tacky paper tiaras. And a mini shout out to Susan who assisted for putting up with the gang but not having quite the mojo as Stephanie. Olive Garden. Ugh. Don't make fun of me for eating here. Don't reprimand me for clogging yelp with a tacky chain review. Just don't! I had fun. We ate. Even took home leftovers. I'm from Minnesota and have no idea what authentic Italian food is. I'm SURE this isnt' it. And those who complain that it's not are clearly delusional. IT'S NOT. But tonight was a blast and worthy of a solid 3.5 star review. Thank you for dining with us this evening and have a good night."}
{"text":"Erick the manager checked in on us to see how our dining experience was, and we had only amazing things to say about the food, the stellar server John, and the amazing atmosphere this Olive Garden location has. Truly, a cut above the rest. Hands down my all time favorite place to go for any occasion here in fabulous Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for at least 20 years and have never had a problem, if I try another location it's some kind of problem. The staff are excellent, they get you seated and your drinks and food in a timely fashion never a lag in service. The inside of this restaurant gets pretty crowded holds a lot of people. I have used their to go service just as good . Kudos Bagley Olive Garden always a great experience!"}
{"text":"I would recommend staying away from this place!!! The food wasn't bad, even though the pasta sauce tasted like tomato paste (no flavor at all). What really makes me not like this one was their horrible customer service. Upon walking in the place I went up to the hostess desk and told her had 4 in my party. She proceeded to throw 4 menus at me and said \"Have a seat and we'll get to you whenever we can.\" About 15 minutes went by and we were shown to our table. We waited another 15 minutes before our waiter came over to take our drink order. He then disappeared for a while. Another waiter brought our drinks several minutes later, and while setting my water on the table knocked it over spilling it everywhere! He then just said \"sorry\" and ran off. Never offered to clean it up or anything. So we used the napkins on the table to clean it up. 

We all then waited about 10 more minutes before the waiter came back to take our order. I asked for the Grilled Sausage and Peppers Rustica. He had no idea what I was talking about!! He didn't even know that was on the menu! As a waiter you should know everything on your menu. He then left to go put our order in. 20 minutes goes by and our food finally arrives. While eating, our drinks empty the whole time, he never comes back to see how we're doing. He finally returns at the end with our check. I then ask him for a to go box. He returns and offers to put the food in the box for me. While putting the food in the box he dumps half of it on the table. 

I will never eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"On the way home from a trip out of town, I ordered to-go at this location.
 The lady at the to-go station was very friendly and the restaurant offered free peach tea while we waited for our order, so that was very nice. 
However, they messed up my food order, which we only discovered after leaving the restaurant and arriving home. :(  It was very disappointing. 
Next time, I will check my order before leaving."}
{"text":"So sad that the kitchen has gotten so bad. Three out of five meals were sub standard. Sent two back. Manager checked in for 2.3 seconds. Asked how everything was,  and  dissappeared before we could respond. We've  lived in this community since this restaurant opened. I miss the \"real\" Olive Garden!

All this said, our server was fantastic.

Postscript: We were celebrating our grandson's 3rd birthday. I checked the receipt when I got home...the cake they brought him was almost $8 and two individual scoops of vanilla ice cream were almost $2 a piece!  None of the crappy meals were removed from our check.

I agree with Billy H. Next time we'll go to Frankie ' s or Nino's. Stick to soup and salad lunches at this Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Came In with the family this evening for dinner. Food was good, but when it came time to pay the wrong items were on the ziosk so we clicked the call server and it took her almost 10 min to come by. All the other workers saw that we needed service and no one try to attend us or reach out to our server that we needed help. All over the service was slow and not as proper as I remembered it to be."}
{"text":"Ordered a to-go order that was spaghetti with meat sauce ordered another one that was spaghetti with meat sauce an additional Italian sausage and the spaghetti with meat sauce had absolutely no sauce but noodles which I had ordered for the next day for lunch due to not being able to get out of the office. When I called to complain to the manager and they knew I was holding for a manager I was left on hold for 9 minutes then the manager had a complete attitude when I wanted to go above him he told me that that was his store and basically he was it so there is always somebody above Dave I believe was his name could not deal with a customer you should want to fix their food and when people order takeout I'm just saying make sure you check it before you leave the store because in addition to that I had ordered some solids and also some soups and the soup wasn't maybe a fourth of the way full so very poor take out service from this location just check your food before you go."}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant and  Worst service ever. When our server came to the table she said anyone want a sample of wine. I asked if they thaVegan wine. Her response was \"What , what is that\" I said Vegan wine, no animal products. She say huh I don't even know what that is.\" I am thinking really. Ok so I order a Italian margarita and water the other 2 had lemonade and tea. When she brought the water, the and lemonade I asked for lemons. We order we get salad and when we were almost finish with the salad she brings my margarita. This is after sitting there for a while with servers reaching over it. We were in the bar area so I could see this happening. She walked by it several times obviously not busy. Worst of everything. Food was cold and no taste.  Place was dirty and dusty( I have pics)
I used to work at Olive Garden and Dardin who owns OG had a lot higher standers for their customers and restaurants."}
{"text":"I have never experienced such rude treatment before even being seated. My partner and I visited this Olive Garden briefly enough to be ignored by the hostess and cut in line by her family/friends while they held a 10min conversation whilst we stood patiently waiting just to be greeted. After being ignored and their conversation dwindled we were acknowledged with an over an hour wait, which was expected to which we then politely declined and left. This is what can only be described as a dodged bullet on the list of poor dining experiences. Solid 1 Star."}
{"text":"Went there with my mom on Feb 2, 2016 around 6pm. We sat in a booth in the bar area, hoping to have a quiet dinner. There was a child (about 10 years old) sitting AT the bar, which I thought was against the law, since liquor is served at the bar. This is the 2nd time in a year that I've seen a child under 21 years of age sitting AT the bar at this Olive Garden.  There was also a baby sitting directly behind me that evening (in a booth in the bar area), and the father was intent on letting everyone know it was ok for this baby to be in a bar because he held the child up over his head and proclaimed \"Baby in a bar!  Baby in a bar!\".  It would just be great if Olive Garden wouldn't seat small babies and children in the bar area of the restaurant (least of all AT the bar), so that adults can enjoy their meals without children around.  I realize it's a family restaurant, but there are other restaurants who don't allow kids in the bar area (such as Red Robin) and it would be nice if Olive Garden would do the same."}

Yes to vegetarian friendly here. Great customer service :)

My fave is the mushroom ravioli, to die for. Hmmm. And the eggplant parmigiano!! On point!"}
{"text":"Sharlee was a wonderful server and was spot on in her suggestions and service. The dishes were excellent and arrived to our table in record time. The salad is an Olive Gargen institution and is always fresh and very good. Overall our early dinner was awesome and service was second to none."}
{"text":"My girl friend and I came here to get lunch! This location is across the street from my nail salon! We were well taken care of.

I ordered the Chicken Alfredo and Ravioli, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I've never had such bad service in my life! It took about 45 minutes to get seated, which we didn't mind waiting. Then no one came to help us. 9 people at the table, only 5 glasses with no water. We were trying to figure out how to order from their tablet but they didn't have everything listed on there. We hit the call button and no one comes for 5 minutes. We can see the 3 waitresses standing in the hallway, eating and gossiping. We finally have another waitress bring appetizers that we weren't sure if the order went thru. She puts it on the table without saying a word, ignores the flashing light from the call button we hit. We are a group of Hawaiians looking for a good meal in Vegas. What a disappointment. It sure felt like they were RACIST as all the caucasian people who came in after us were half way through there meals before we sat down. 

I'VE NEVER WALKED OUT ON A RESTAURANT BEFORE!!!  

My recommendation, DON'T EAT AT OLIVE GARDEN IN VEGAS, there are so many places that treat the customers with respect. You can bet I will tell everyone I know from Hawaii about my experience here. 

Is it because we had a large party so they new they'd get 18% gratuity anyway?! Screw that, you should earn your tips.  

AGAIN, WORST SERVICE I EVER HAD."}
{"text":"The service from Diane was awesome. Food is always good, as well as the atmosphere.  Cannot beat the price for what you get.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Never a bad dinner no matter where you stop in for a tour of Italy or some lasagna rolls! Service is great and the water glasses were never empty!"}
{"text":"Food was hot and delicious but the service sucked. Ordered the soup & salad combo and was given 3 bowls of salad before any soup showed up. The Alfredo was good but the steak was overcooked. Chicken parmesagna was good but dry. Service was slow to nonexistent to forgetful. Manager was running around trying to fix everything."}
{"text":"Meh. I'll start by saying it's been a while since I've been to one of these and I will probably come back again just cause their lunch deals are so enticing, but make sure you pick a good one. Our server was outstanding and I didn't mind the new digital menus but the overall experience lacked the rustic charm. The breadstick sandwiches don't look anything like the picture and all the soups lacked the charm that I remembered. Salad was great but I could have sworn they had Caesar back in the day. Must be signs of aging.... We ordered the chicken picatta which was the star but doesn't come with pasta and was around $17. The bolognese was small but filling for a girl my size."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are having a nice dinner tonight we are having Seafood Alfredo and Chicken Scampi both are absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this Olive Garden a few weeks ago and they were SLAMMED. Our server Corey (sp?) was awesome! she was so personable and really seemed to not get too frazzled considering how busy she was. She always made sure our drinks were full and everything was alright! she even told us some different recipes her mom makes with the AMAZING olive garden dressing. i will definitely be back and requesting her!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and my server was outstanding!  Shout out to Omar.

However, there was a bad smell in the entire place.  Usually Olive Garden smells like rich sauces and fresh-baked bread and simmering goodness, but yesterday it smelled like vomit or a NYC Subway bathroom.

The lunch offerings are limited  and sub par. We got the chicken parmesan  sandwich and it was literally one of the complementary breadsticks cut in half with a piece of chicken, a little sauce and little bit of cheese on top of it. 

The soup was outstanding... 
Some of the best soup I've ever had.  I think it was called the Chicken Nocci.

We also ordered the sangria. I had the peach my sister had berry.  While they were both tasty, they turned out to be glorified  wine coolers with less than 1% alcohol in it.  Also not sure how it could be considered Sangria with no fruit in it, just a sort of fruit kebab sitting on top of the glass. I would suggest you save your six dollars a glass for something else. The sangria is a rip off.

There were so many conflicting points regarding this trip to Olive Garden.  Great fast service, but a smelly restaurant.  Food that was tasty but chintzy portions and shameful corner cutting.  

It is with a heavy heart that I am unable to give Olive Garden more than two stars.  I left a good tip because service was flawless."}
{"text":"If you love Italian, I'm sure you can find something you like from their menu. I didn't like it here when I got spaghetti as a kid or when I came back with my mom and got fettuccini Alfredo. But, as an appetizer, I got dumpling soup which was enough to get me to come back. I ended up going back with my boyfriend and getting lasagna and now we go there whenever we can afford it. (It is pretty pricey.) I can definitely say it's my favorite restaurant now. They're breadsticks are also to die for.(;"}
{"text":"My wife and I had someone to watch the kids last Sunday, so we decided to go out to lunch and do some shopping around town.  We had a gift card for Olive Garden and decided to use it up.  Discounted/free food is usually always better than paying for food!  

We got there pretty early and were seated at a booth.  We browsed the menu for a bit, ordered our drinks, and then placed our order.  My wife went with a spaghetti witch garlic cream sauce and chicken, and I went with the eggplant parmigana.  We both ordered the salad.  Here is how everything was.................

Salad and Breadsticks-  Probably the best part of Olive Garden, honestly.  I love all the croutons, red onions, and pepperoncinis in the salad.  Olive Gardens dressing is pretty damn tasty, plus you get unlimited refills (we went through 2 salads).  I'm not the biggest \"salad guy\", but I do enjoy theirs.  

Eggplant Parmigana-  My wife was talking about eggplant parmigana the other night, and it struck a nerve.  A. I hadn't had eggplant parmigana in YEARS  B.  It was reasonably priced (compared to their other entrees) and C. It sounded delicious!  I was pretty happy with the dish.  It came with 5 or so slices of eggplant which was battered and fried perfectly and it tasted pretty good.  It was served with a side of spaghetti which I hardly touched (too full from all the salad I ate).  Would I get it again?  Yeah.  It was tasty!

Service was just average.  Our waitress had a huge table next to us, so they occupied a lot of her time.  Understandable.  One semi-cool thing they have, are those tablet devices at your actual table.  You can pay for your meal right then and there and be on your way.  Or so we thought......  The machine wouldn't read our gift card so our waitress had to take it to manually enter it.  No big deal.  I paid for the balance with my card at the table and we were on our way.

Will I be back?  I'm sure someday, yes.  I've never been the hugest fan of Olive Garden's (Think its too expensive for plain Jane \"Italian Food\"), but my wife likes coming here sometimes.  Our meal was exactly what 3 stars means....A-OK."}
{"text":"This review is just about the people I interacted with in the to go area everyonw was very nice and friendly except for one guy who made it seem like he was trying to make me feel like an idiot when I corrected him for something that was screwed up on my order (I wasnt being bitchy or anything).  You might hate your job but at least pretend in front of customers dude. Not my most enjoyable visit to this one."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant but consistent-a guilty pleasure.  Good food at a good price. Love their salad-and usually go for their endless soup and salad-although they only give you three servings-so not really endless."}
{"text":"Lindsay was our server.  She was great.  Food was superb.  Didnt like the risotto bites. Too bland.  The salmon was great portion size and tasteful."}
{"text":"My Mom and I went to the location at I-17 and Happy Valley today for an early lunch, food was great but our service was horrible. Not only did our waiter not know anything on the menu but he clearly was new and not trained. Waited 15 minutes for him to show up so we could ask for our bill and then he told us we do it on the machine. Then once we figured it out and paid we had to wait to run him down for to go boxes. 10 minutes pass again as he brings 2 other guests their food before my to-go boxes. THEN HE FORGOT THE BAG....  went to go get a bag and decided to serve 2 separate guests their food before bringing me the bag. I am 8 months pregnant, had my 2 year old son with me as well as  my handicap mother. As we were walking out the door with my son in my one arm and my food in my other hand there were THREE hostess just sitting around talking and not one of them offered to open the door when we got there nor as we left with full hands!! I'm very disappointed in the customer service !"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Olive Garden in years........ First off I am not big on Italian and second I just can't seem to connect with Olive Garden. They seem to all be the same so nothing against this particular store. I mean I dislike the food, atmosphere, decore etc. It was a friend of mines birthday and she picked the spot. As to be expected I didn't really enjoy my food and surprisedly she didn't either. I will say or waiter (David) was amazing. The manager also came by our table to ask how everything was so that was pretty cool. Again nothing to do with this store I just don't vibe well with Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Uhh happened to be National Alfredo day and was delighted with wait staff and food. Can we talk about the Sangria? Peach not so much a fan, Berry is delicious. Kiosks are now a thing.Convenient and yet still enjoy human interactions."}
{"text":"Great food, service is always great here. Try the Apple Sangria, it is refreshingly fabulous. I am a fan of the salad. Red onions, peppercini, black olives, so ice berg lettuce. At least no worries of e-colli here with romaine lettuce a was discovered recently.  All in all, great experience."}
{"text":"Service really sucked! Waitress rarely came buy and we got the all you can eat. She left check when she dropped off the food and if we needed anything we had to flag down other workers. The worst part was when I got a beverage spilled on me. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went at 11:20 am Thursday and ended up leaving at 10 til noon because nobody took our orders not even drinks. I asked the waitresses in the area and all they would say is it wasn't their table. This place sucks..."}
{"text":"The soup salad and breadsticks were good and even though the refill was delayed it was during peek lunch crowd. What was shocking was that someone brought in their cat without asking those around her if anyone suffered from allergies? What was even more shocking was the lack of customer service we received when the server over charged our card by ringing up someone else's check. When we caught the error the manager came over and reversed the transaction and told us it should be back in your account by Thursday then charged us for the full meal again. Needless to say not the best experience."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. Eat in the bar if you need to get in and out a bit quicker."}
{"text":"It's fine.  Came here with folks from work.  It's close to work and people chose this as the place to eat.

I never understand why people rave about the breadsticks.  There are so many more amazing Italian places that serve fresh baked bread with fresh garlic, why settle for garlic salt on mass produced bread?  

If I am going to carb load, I want it to be outstanding!  

I do enjoy their salad.  It is a nostalgic taste of childhood and eating at Olive Garden when it first came to AZ with my Grandparents, but again there are better salads out there.

Service was good.  The restaurant was packed with older people on a Friday afternoon lunch.  

It is ok, I just know there are much more interesting options for Italian food, and when given the choice, I am going to try those instead!"}
{"text":"The staff really took care of us here.  The company had a Christmas party of 18 and our glasses were filled. The chicken and shrimp carbonara was great. I highly recommend it. Overall a great experience.great wait staff , you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"For 16 dollars you can get:
a) fat
b) seafood that appears to have been stolen from a chinese buffet
c) obnoxious and slow service
d) the joy of spending your money in a corporate shit hole that doesn't care about your food when you could be at a real restaurant
e) shame

I'm a big fan of going out to eat, and I usually tip well.. but I went because a friend had her birthday there and decided to pretend I was drunk the entire time and tip in seashells. Desperate times, man. Desperate times."}
{"text":"My server Marina was incredible! I have a gluten allergy and she accidentally brought out my plate that wasn't the gluten-free version. I mentioned it to her and she had it quickly sent back and remade. The manager, Sean, came by and apologized and was so nice. He comped my meal and explained their process for gluten-free menu items to ensure I got the correct meal this time to avoid my allergies. Thank you so much Marina and Sean!"}
{"text":"Really bad service / timeliness of getting food. I went in for a quick dinner / OG is a chain so food is good. Server was nice but her section was my table and some tables on the other side of the wall (doesn't seem logical) as I couldn't catch her very quickly or when needed. She was a good server, but we ended up waiting over 45 minutes for simple pasta dishes. It makes me think that the kitchen is not properly staffed. So much so that my 1 year old got antsy (of course). Not a place to go if you're expecting a relatively quick sit down dinner. You seriously can't get refills during dinner as mentioned in a previous review. My server tried to be attentive but just wasn't set up for success. Also, the kitchen took way too long.

Also, ordered take out. Place order at 7:15 pm - order pick up time 8:15 pm (an hour?!) ...got there at 8:15 - did not get food until 8:45. (why did it take an hour an a half to make some alfredo and spaghetti?) Also, it seemed like people coming in after were receiving their food while I had to wait as they come out \"as they're ready\". At least if you're giving a pick up time -- it should not take a half hour from that time. RIDICULOUS. I will think twice before coming back here because I can't stand how bad the service has gotten."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this locations for years, maybe even decades. Long before it burnt down and was rebuilt, to give you an idea. Of course the food is exactly what you'd expect but our last meal's bill was noticeable higher than I remember it ever being. Not sure if the prices have slowly risen without me noticing but it seemed higher. The food tastes great and with salad and breadsticks coming in continuous fashion we certainly got our fill and left more than satisfied. The decor and atmosphere is vibrant and welcoming, it's usually busy which means you'll enjoy a nice level of Hustle and bustle. This also means though you'll almost always have to wait some amount of time before your seated no matter when you visit for dinner. Of course we'll be back the next time we get that OG craving and if you've never order a side of Alfredo sauce to dunk your breadsticks in you're totally missing out."}
{"text":"Love Olive Garden. Visit the location in Flagstaff all the time. Stopped in at this location for dinner tonight. Clean and friendly, however the service wasn't great. Took almost 20 minutes to order once we sat down."}
{"text":"For years I have not liked Olive Garden. The last time I was here was 2009 and I never returned. The sauce and the food I had was bland and cheap tasting and I hated it. 

Fast forward to 2018 and let me say things have changed. My wife and I got a gift card and I decided to give them another try. I'm glad I did. The food and serve were excellent! The giant meatball was excellent! I was really impressed and I will for sure be back again because they really improved everything!"}
{"text":"So, my wife received a $50 gift card for Olive Garden from her work for christmas. We decided to finally use it. We never really go here, we feel there are plenty of other better options. The breadsticks were not good. I remembered liking them in the past but they just tasted bad. I had the chicken parm and same thing. Just not good. My wife had a pasta dish and was not thrilled either. We both ate maybe half our plate. The check came out to like $28. We decided to leave our waitress a $22 tip, not because the service was great because it wasn't, but because we plan to NEVER return there. Too many other places to go that are good!"}
{"text":"If I could not give any stars I would. I called today to try to book a birthday party for my mother's 60th. She loves Olive Garden. The first person who answered didn't know if I could book a room for 20-25 people on a Saturday afternoon. She only knew I COULDNT do a Saturday evening. She said I should talk to the host. I waited on hold for 7 minutes. This was 11:15am on a Saturday. Another girl answers the phone and ask if she can help me. I told her I needed to book a birthday party. She said yeh you need to talk to the host. I said \"ok am I talking to the host?\" She said I was. Ok so what do I need to do to book a room? Well we can reserve a room for you. I asked if there was a fee. She said \"what?\" I asked again if there was a room fee. No there's no room fee. Ok how does the menu work? It's just a regular menu. Or whatever you want. I asked if there was someone I could talk to to get this organized before I show up that day. I'm from Chicago. She said I could talk to her manager. I wait on hold another 5 minutes and Julia answers. Julia says their manager is on a conference call and I should call back later. I won't be calling back later. Thanks."}
{"text":"The food doesn't taste like normal food. They don't use salt in their pasta. Their drinks are over priced - their service is SUPER slow but again, it's mostly the 'families' that go there with the five kids who take up the server's time. 

They try but unfortunately most of this rating is just related to 'Olive Garden's' usual atmosphere, food and practices."}
{"text":"Took my sweety to Olive Garden because we enjoyed our previous experiences. Once again they didn't disappoint. It was 118 outside but once we entered the reception area all of that was forgotten. The staff took us to a more intimate room. The temperature was comfortable for myself and my better half - which is a miracle. The restrooms were clean and we'll decorated. Our server was attentive and offered us complimentary wine samples. We ordered water with lemon which she kept filled. The hardest decision to make was what to choose. So I went with what we had previously - unlimited soup and salad. Soup was hot. Breadsticks delicious. World class salad. An enjoyable experience with tax and 20% tip totaling around  $20."}
{"text":"Only came cause this is where my kid picked for her birthday. Salad was loaded with salad dressing one bite all you could taste was vinegar. First beer was cold second one not so much so couldn't even enjoy a few cold beers with this crappy chain. Meal whatever nothing special not that I was expecting much anyways. But the kicker they don't even give a kid on their birthday a scoop of ice cream or anything. First time I've ever been to a chain that didn't give something for a kids birthday."}
{"text":"We arrived, expected to wait 20 or so minutes. Which was fine. When we did get seated the waitress arrived, we ordered beverages and told the waitress we would order upon her return. We ordered our meals. It took 3 different employees to bring the correct soup over a period of 30 minutes. As we open the silverware it was filthy. We never received replacements. We were fed all kinds of excuses. I asked for the mgr after 1hr and 45 minutes. Still haven't received our order. By then we were no longer hungry. Aprx. 2 hours we received our order still no silverware. The mgr. offered us 2 gift cards, but I think the only way to use them would be to go to another location. Two hours of my life lost to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"If you want a great customer service then I suggest you request Rome. Very polite and attentive to his customers. Food was  and customer service was . I Have three kids and Rome definitely kept the drinks and breadsticks going."}
{"text":"If you are on a diet this is the place to go, we felt as if we were on a salad, soup and breadstick restriction.  By the time our second soup refill made it to our table, which would have been still the first on the GV OG location, we were looking to getting out of there. Avoid the place."}
{"text":"Yikes, like most restaurants owned by corporations their food has gone WAY downhill. After the visit to this place I researched on how often people cook at home, very few, less than 50%, well I cook at home 6 times a week and for the service, pricing, quality of ingredients and finished dish flavor I would not even go to this place for free. 
I suspected it to be so, but MIL likes to eat here for some unknown reason. The only good thing was the cake, which I bought from Patisserie Manon and the company."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Olive Gardens I have ever been to. I was expecting the typical chain experience, but this one was different from the atmosphere to the service. The inside was much more elaborate than your traditional Olive Garden, and the servers accommodated every request we had. They even brought free samples of white wine. The food was just like other restaurants but the atmosphere really made this one worth while."}
{"text":"Since multiple visits to this location I can say it's very good. The food has been spot on the past 3 times I have been here."}
{"text":"We got there at 4:00pm sat at the bar 
Waited till 5:30 still no food 
They said they put in the wrong chicken 
Finally manger comes out 
They got slammed with an order 
Gave us free dessert 
No one was honest 
Horrible service and still have a good tip
Expect long food ticket times"}
{"text":"I am officially disgusted by this Olive Garden and will never go back. I've been here many times and never had a bad experience till last month. We went and the waiter was great. They have gotten a lot slower at bringing out the breadsticks. This experience was particularly bad though. We enjoyed the salad but they messed up our appetizer. This wasn't a big deal and the waiter went and got it fixed for us. The big problem was when the food came out. They had put almost no sauce on it (we order fettuccine Alfredo and chicken Alfredo) the pasta was dry like it had been left out for days. I couldn't eat it. So we asked for more sauce but that didn't help. My husband said the chicken was also undercooked and unbelievably chewy. They did make things right by taking the food off the bill since we only had two bites and lost our appetite. This was enough for me not to go back. Then today my grandmother posted on Facebook about her experience. She even posted a picture of what was found in her food. They said it was the top of a pepper but it looks a lot like some kind of bone. They wouldn't do anything about it either cause she had already eaten half her meal before noticing it. I don't believe she's going back either."}
{"text":"It really takes a lot to not leave a tip... Our waiter was horrible! Seemed liked he hated life. He took a while to even come take our drink order which he had to write down! Brought one of our waters and took 15mins for our other water!!!! He kept saying too- oh yeah your water.. We never even got a check- he kept taking too long, we ended up just paying on that computer on the table which no one even told us about. He brought 3 breadsticks for two people- I'm not eating 1.5 breadsticks!! Also noticed that when large parties came through the door they were referred to as 'party of 6' instead of a name!"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 because the price is just way too high for the quality you get. Their portions have gotten smaller and the price keeps getting higher.

I know it's a corporation and nothing is freshly made but at least don't dry out the dishes. 

I've never worked for this corporation but I'd like to know the wait time each table should expect once sat down. This is the second time it took almost 10 mins till a server approached our table for a greeting. 

The biggest issue I have is when our server brought out our sangria, both glasses still had lip stick marks on the rim. 

It's nice to receive salad with every entree but our lettuce wasn't even green! Come on location. A little attention to your detail would be nice."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is Olive Garden, you get what you pay for. Its ok Italian if you just want a fast bite to eat but its not cheap by any means. I had the sample plate and it was tasty. I do like their salads. My meal seemed to have been sitting  around a bit as the top layer was all dried out."}
{"text":"i like this place bc it near my house , the food is good too. wishing i can come everday ."}
{"text":"We hit the O.G. almost every Saturday or Sunday night. Not always this location. Sometimes the location by Fiesta Mall, sometimes the one down Elliot by the I-10. Depends on our day but the O.G. is a constant. What isn't a constant is the food OR service. Tonight was a 4 Star however.
Our server was Kamren. He was awesome. He did everything right. And for our group, that can be hard. He brought drink refills before we had to ask. He spaced out our food perfectly so we were not rushed but everything still came out hot. He was attentive but not oppressive. As I said, awesome.
We started with the Calamari. ($9.99) Unfortunately, this time it was over breaded & over cooked. Not their best effort.
A couple of us got the all-you-can-eat salad which is what I always get. Other than wishing they put more tomatoes or other veggies like carrots in it, ultimately, it's an ok salad. Tip: If you want you very own huge bowl of salad, order it with the dressing on the side and you'll get your own bowl while the other salad eaters will get to share the salad with the dressing on it. Boooyaa.
The other two got the Minestrone soup. Lots of vegetables & a good broth. Decent soup.
C got the Cucina Mia ($9.99) which is basically choosing the type of pasta you want & what sauce you want added. C always gets the Tri-color vegetable Penne. It's one of the ways we get him to eat vegetables & he doesn't even know it. He also gets meat sauce on the side because he likes to dip his pasta in the sauce. And he gets a side of 3 meatballs ($2.79). The pasta was cooked right, the sauce was hot & tasty & the meatballs were moist & flavorful. Winner winner Tri-color Penne dinner.
K got the Cucina Mia ($9.99) with wheat Linguine & half meat sauce & half garlic asiago alfredo sauce on the side and added a couple of Chicken meatballs ($2.79). Topped with about a cup or so of the grated cheese & K was happy. Well, up to the point she bit into a huge clove of roasted garlic. Yuk. The pieces of garlic in the sauce need to be chopped down to size or minced but whole cloves don't work. Since the pasta was cooked right & the meat sauce was tasty the garlic was the only mis-step in this dish.
C's grandma C got the build your own Tour of Italy which lets you pick 3 different mini entrees. Grandma C got Eggplant Parmesan, Prosciutto Tortellini and Fettuccini Alfredo. ($12.99) Grandma C said it was all cooked fine and tasted great.
My Tour of Italy consisted of Chicken Lombardy (chicken breast covered in cheese and bacon bits), Five Cheese Ziti & Lasagna. ($15.29). The Ziti was alright, a bit on the dry side because there wasn't enough sauce on it. The Chicken Lombardy was tasty as was the Lasagna. My comment here is that the Lasagna is really a pathetic portion. I think they need to up the portion of the Lasagna to make it worth the $$.
A fantastic server, all you can eat Soup or salad and bread sticks, tasty entrees but over cooked Calamari and paltry portions on some of the items. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food, my favourite dish. Fresh well cooked, atmosphere is great and friendly. Servers is helpful and keeps checking to make sure we are doing ok. Will definitely come back! It is Wednesday night there was not a long wait."}
{"text":"Great experience here tonight! We came here the night after Valentines Day to avoid the crowds associated with actual Valentine's Day. We were immediately seated in the bar area and received our drinks and meals promptly. The bartender was very nice and attentive. I was especially pleased with their soup....some kind of dumpling soup. Excellent!"}
{"text":"I work very hard for my money and going out to dinner is a luxury. It's really bad when the restaurant doesn't care enough about you to get your orders right... first ordered salad No oniions no crutons because my daughter has a food allergy ok so they bring it out it has crutons, they exchange it for a salad with no crutons and no salad dressing. Ask the server please bring salad dressing, he passes us 4 times and forgets we have to ask a women walking by to get for us.  We ask for another bowl of salad what comes crutons and onions...really??? Food allergy remember...now at the end of the meal he wants to be nice thanks but strike 3 Olive Garden..."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is a chain so what you find in one you will find everywhere. I only stopped here for lunch since I had a coupon for unlimited soup and salad for $5.99 during daytime hours. Normally these coupons last about a week if you sign up on their website.

This particular Olive Garden is located in Village Square near Kohl's. Currently they have extensive road renovation around the parking lot. You even have to follow the orange ribbons to obtain access into the restaurant. Fortunately since I was just stopping by for a quick lunch it wasn't so bad. Please note this place does get crowded especially over the dinner hour so couple that with the parking renovation you will have a bit of a hike when you park your car.

The soup and salad bar includes soup of your choice, salad with their Italian dressing, and bread sticks. You can have as many refills as you wish. Both are very good.

Take is available. Staff is friendly and helpful. They have the ziosks at each table if you want to play games, summon your waitress, or pay your bill by credit card.

I noticed when I came in I saw a small set up of food. The hostess explained to me that was for a catering event they were having. Again, the menus are the same no matter which one you go to and the chain is located around the country."}
{"text":"Go during  week for specials. Place is normally crowded but takeout is available. Staff is friendly and will cater to your wishes. Food is usually good. Never had any problems.

Since this is a \"chain\" restaurant you will find one almost anywhere you go. It is great for groups as well as family. My favorite is the eggplant parmesan. They do give unlimited soup or salad with your meal. Be prepared to take food home with you.

Place is clean and kempt. It is one of my favorite places to eat when I get the opportunity."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time a couple weeks ago. 
 
Besides the mediocre service, the food was decent and plentiful. My boyfriend and I got the 3 course meal for $12.95. I got soup, a chicken mozzarella entree, and a chocolate dessert. 

The breadsticks were a bit salty, but I'd go there again. It's a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Met my friend for her birthday lunch.  I arrived before she and requested a table that would accommodate her wheelchair.  Busy as they were at the time, my request was granted quickly.  Our server seemed to have a lot on her mind.  Very serious and almost stern.  My friend ordered her favorite appetizer.  I got the salad and minestrone soup.  Both were as good as I remembered.  Our server offered Parmesan on the salad, but never offered any on the soup when it arrived.  My friend and I lingered at the table, and our server graciously informed us that she was going on break, but to stay as long as we liked.  She indicated that another server could assist us.  Nice, thoughtful touch."}
{"text":"Tam was our server. She was very helpful and accommodating to my special requests that I had for my meal. Tam was very bubbly, fun to talk with, and was all around a great server. She was on top of all of our refills and she came straight to our table when we sat down with a fresh batch of breadsticks. Definitely recommend this location and specifically Tam as a server."}
{"text":"Come here as often as we can! Decent price for being a higher end restaurant! Friendly service and quality food! Love taking my fiancé here out on dates! We would come a lot more often if we could!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly staff, food mediocre but soup and salad always a go to. Ordered soup n salad, chicken fettuccini Alfredo and shrimp fettuccini Alfredo. Plenty of food left over and nobody was interested in taking to go, if that says anything."}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here before heading to a show at the Smith Center.  We got seated right away and our waitress came over pretty quickly.  She actually gave us a sample of their house white wine which was nice.  She took our drink order and gave us some time to decide on our meals.

She checked back often and took our order once we were finally ready.  I had the lasagna and my mom had the baked shrimp parmesan.  I started with the salad which is always good.  Love the vinaigrette and goodies in the salad.  My mom had the minestrone soup.  

I really enjoyed by lasagna.   Nice tomato sauce, cheesy but not over cheesy.  My mom enjoyed her baked shrimp too.  It was actually pasta with shrimp and cheese on time that they back.  It was a big portion so she took it home and had leftovers the next day.  

Our waitress was very good and checked on us often throughout the meal.  This was definitely a good Olive Garden.  Food was tasty."}
{"text":"I had a great experience tonight dining with my bff and 2 year old daughter for dinner! I had pretty low expectations because it's Olive Garden, not exactly gourmet cuisine. But I was pleasantly surprised! The food was good and consistent, and just what we were wanting tonight. The steak was cooked nicely, and the price was very reasonable. 
The highlight of our visit though, was our server Cody. He was fantastic! He was on point with his timing all around, and he went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was complete and wonderful. We definitely left happy. Thanks Cody!"}
{"text":"Awful !  Spent $70 for two people for crap. The soup was thin, but the Classic Trio of lasagna, chicken parmesan and fettuccine alfredo was disgusting. I even had to ask which of the the two globs was lasagna.  The chicken parmesan was dry and crispy around the edges, the portions were minuscule, but they sure put a big glob of fettuccine in the middle to try and make it look filling (I never eat the fettuccine, as it's usually meh, preferring the lasagna and chicken, but this time the fettuccine looked the best. Still didn't eat it.  Not sure how the wife's food was, but for $70, it would have had to be gold."}
{"text":"The food is good - not bad for the price. However, our server Brenda was worthy of 20 stars!  She was attentive, on top of everything, and friendly as hell.  Some people you can see thru, but she seemed genuinely happy that we were there.  This is a plus and worth every penny. Would definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Well we finally got an olive garden in the North West but it's far from a nice restaurant. I ate here with 6 people for a meeting, we were told the wait would be 30-40 minutes on a Sunday night around 8:30 PM.  We ended up waiting more like 55 minutes to an hour. Not that big of a deal, we sat down and a couple people didn't end up eating because we had further plans not a big deal because four out of the six people ended up ordering entrees. Although if you asked our waitress, taya I believe her name was. This was a big deal, and enough to get an eye roll. Food came out fine, no complaints about that (although really, personally I can't eat over processed food advertised as Italian) The biggest complaint though was that EVERYONE at our table was charged not only gratuity, but we were also charged as if everyone had a portion of salad. This wasn't the case, we didn't have time to wait for our waitress to fix the mistake (she was missing every time something was needed.) we ended up coughing up the difference.  I definitely won't be back to this olive garden."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday and was told it would be a ten minute wait...  People kept getting sat at the bar by the woman at the front. The blonde man was no help we had to seat ourselves.  The bar tender was the one who served us..  A little overwhelming but he did a good job.  The food came out cold though.  And no one explained what the specials were out that the previous one was over."}
{"text":"Went to this Olive Garden location with my parents on a Sunday at around 4:30pm and there was no wait. Hostess was sociable and explained how to order/pay using the at table kiosk. As with most Olive Garden's, we all received wine samples and breadsticks almost immediately upon seating. Our waiter was pleasant and always quick to be at our table when needed. All together, we ordered 1 spaghetti with meat sauce and 2 rigatoni with 5 cheese marinara sauce. These were included in the endless pasta special. Neither I nor my parents even ordered another plate because we were already full. The plates are very large and after endless breadsticks and salad, just one plate of our pasta filled us up and we were satisfied. My parents had never been to Olive Garden before and they were both impressed and said they would come again. We had no complaints about the food, staff, or environment. Overall, we had a great meal at this Olive Garden location and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.

Sorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.

Okay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh, two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans)."}
{"text":"I am going with a not bad on this one. Definitely not great, but not bad. I'm in Phoenix for training and the rest of the class went to panda, I went to get real food. The server got my order completely wrong, but as time was an issue I didn't make a fuss. I ordered lasagna but ended up getting some sausage pasta concoction. Sweet. When I brought it up my server was even more awkward. 

The little machines on the table to pay sucked. Sometimes I just want a person to run my card. 

Everything else was normal. My salad and breadsticks tasted exactly the same as every other visit ever. I wanted dessert but didn't get any. It was all lackluster and to be expected."}
{"text":"This review is for their lunch menu and service.  I work down the street from this location and needed time away from the office so myself and a coworker came here for lunch.

My coworker and I decided to split an appetizer and then order separately off their lunch menu.  Their fried calamari was good, but the portion seemed small for the $10 price.  Our Waitress also brought the plate out and then left without bringing us appetizer plates.  Thankfully she returned, our app came out quickly and she didn't have time to grab plates but it was sad none of her fellow servers helped to run her food.    

My coworker ordered the endless soup with a bowl of pasta while I chose the endless salad and Italian Mac and Cheese.  We had bad timing with our order and they were making another batch of Minestrone soup but our waitress was kind enough to bring a salad plate to allow my coworker to share my salad while he waited.  Our pasta came out quickly and although it was described as a \"Mini bowl\", the portion was very small.  The Italian Mac and cheese came with bacon (which was never described on the menu) but all I could taste was fake Smokey flavor.  

My coworker finally got his bowl of soup but here is the problem with endless, someone has to bring you more for it to be endless and by now our server had disappeared.  When she did return, she never acknowledged his empty bowl or offered him a refill.  She was prompt to drop the check (incorrectly split, btw) halfway through our meal and mentioned it again while we were still eating.  I am sure she was trying to be prompt as we were on a lunch break, but it made us feel rushed.

My salad and very small pasta was $8 + tax and over all, wasn't worth it.  The portion size vs the quality of the food vs the cost just wasn't there.  Our server had some hits and many misses but the misses could have been resolved with help/team work from her fellow servers."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian, this is probably not the place to eat.  However, they make the best salad, have great breadsticks and the chicken gnocchi soup is so good my seven year old dips her breadsticks in it.  For under $10.00 you can get unlimited soup and salad.  They will usually bring the adults a free taste of the wine of the day which is a nice touch.  They keep adding menu items and seem to be hitting some good ones.  The kids menu is excellent and even has shrimp as a choice for the pasta usually resulting in my daughter ordering spaghetti with butter and garlic and shrimp.  Did I mention we really like the chicken gnocci soup?  The appetizers are good, we like the sampler.  The stuffed mushrooms aren't very good but the lasagna fritta, toasted ravioli and the flatbread pizzas are favorites.  Their latest Tuscan specials are excellent.

Prices are not too extravagant.  Some main dishes you might like are the steak gorgonzola alfredo, parmesan crusted tilapia, Apricot Chicken and on the low carb end of things, mixed grill (no pasta, just good old fashioned protein!).  You can also order gluten free and whole wheat pasta. (be careful, the gluten free pasta is cooked in the same kitchen as the regular food so they can't \"guarantee\" it is completely gluten free.

Sometimes they offer the never ending pasta bowl as well and you can get pasta with your choice of sauce until they have to wheel you out of there in a wheelbarrow.  

Needless to say, Olive Garden is good quality comfort food at reasonable prices and should be on every family's rotation.

Oh it does get crowded on Fridays and Saturdays where you can wait about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Family favorite. I love their salad and chicken Gnocchi Soup.  I am also reviewing this restaurant because they have recently added some low price options so you can get a full meal of their favorites like their Lasagna with unlimited soup or salad for 10.99.    This particular location is always clean, friendly, with great service!  Also, their Kids menu allows the kids to pick what they want on their pasta which usually ends with my daughter getting shrimp with angel hair.  Much better than the other kids menus at other places that don't offer anything creative for the kids and just give plain pasta or pasta with meatballs."}
{"text":"We chose this olive garden for our son's rehersal dinner. We were treated like royalty and it was a busy saturday night. The manger and staff were excellent. We couldnt have asked for a better venue for this celebration.They deserve five stars !!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Olive Garden!!! Always have the best food and wonderful service!!! At this location the server JEFF was the best I've ever had!! Jeff was kind, friendly, and very patient!!! Next time I hope we are in his section again."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love the Olive Garden for their endless breadsticks and salad.  They always have very consistent food in this location is very neat and clean. It was easy for me to get a table for myself and my family. The endless bowls of soup are very nice touch. My kids loved all of their meals and the fried risotto balls were absolutely delicious. This is not the place to go for a five star unique dining experience, however if you need to feed your family on the go and have everybody's bellies nice and full and this place is always consistent."}
{"text":"My dad and I come here for the salad. That salad is bomb diggity in our book and we can eat it til we hate ourselves. Thanks Louis CK for helping me let others understand my tendency to overstuff myself with Olive Garden salad LOL. I also really like how there is a discount on wine if you're waiting for a table (go to the bar and wait to be seated). Yes, please! And who doesn't like those mint chocolates to conclude your self loathing? When the server gives us extra, they are indeed the real MVP."}
{"text":"Even with the remodel it's disgusting inside. Went with my 3 kids and husband, we told the waiter we were ready as soon as we sat down, food still took 30 min to come out, they sat us in the worst place next to a computer where they kept leaving trays with dirty dishes for long periods of time. I got bumped on my chair 3 damn times and I wasn't even sitting wrong! I'm Pregnant and even turned my body (not the chair) to the side after the second bump. Got up to use the restroom 2/4 in the women's were disgusting with crap and the trash was over full, I couldn't stand the smell. Walked out let the hostess know she smiled and said ok. 22 min later I went back with my 5 year old daughter and bathrooms were the same! I ate one bowl of soup and order another and waiter seemed annoyed I even asked! I left it there on the table and sat outside with my girls to wait for my husband and son to finish their food to leave. $68 tab plus tip for that nastiness isn't worth it. It's your busiest times (graduations) don't expect ppl to use disgusting facilities and be hit while trying to eat and sat next to an area employee leave trays full of dirty dishes!! Never have I seen this take place at Summerlin location."}
{"text":"Took a friend for her birthday. First, the food.  Breadsticks were hard like they had been on the shelf for a few days. Ordered stuffed mushrooms. The caps were dry and glued to the bottom of the dish by hardened cheese. Asked the person who brought them out where our salad was. \"Um, who's your server?\" Now the main course. Two ordered the Eggplant Parm, one the chicken Parm. Eggplant was cold. Skin had not been removed. Chicken Parm tasted like it had been dredged in salt. (and I like salty food but this was over the top!) The ravioli and pasta that came as sides...the edges were dry and hard. All three dinners were luke warm.
The service. I have not tipped less than 25% in years. Tonight was 8%, more to send a message. The server (bus person?) that brought out the mushrooms was rude. The only thing the waitress did was take our order and bring drinks.
$66 for three people SHOULD have bought a decent meal.  We would have done better if we had gone to Cici's pizza and paid $5 each. 
We were in the restaurant at 4:45. It was not busy. 
The only reason I am giving one star is that that is the lowest I can go."}
{"text":"Got to the this location at  5:10 pm.  Was told that it was a 25 - 30 minute wait.  At 5:40, after watching several parties leave and no one being seated, we asked the hostess how much longer the wait would be. After being told we were not on the list, we had to point out that we had a restaurant pager.  I was then told they could not give an estimate as the manager had \"cut those off which is something they are allowed to do.\" (Yes, direct quote). Left and went down the street to Smashburger.  After reading the previous reviews, it appears that we made the correct choice.  Also, it is interesting that the customer feedback page on the OG site is not working."}
{"text":"Jacob is the best waiter at any restaurant. Overall over the past year I have been very impressed with the management and staff wanting me to enjoy my meal. What a great location! Superb!!"}
{"text":"I don't always go here but when I do I know I am going to be treated right and great food will happen. Definitely a go to date night place. Breadsticks!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the Summerlin Olive Garden on 12/27. Stale breadsticks, Tour of Italy with fettuccine and lasagna was bland without flavor. Salad very small with only two olives and wilted lettuce. This restaurant has been one of our favorites. It was crowded with a long wait so perhaps the kitchen was overwhelmed"}
{"text":"Food was not great, our daughter couldn't eat her Mac n Cheese, the waitress told us she has actually had complaints about it before, it was bitter (my husband didn't like it either) and the service was a bit slow (several tables in our area were empty, it was not very busy). For 70$ it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Service was okay at the beginning then the waiter came back for our second order of all you can eat dinner special. Then never came back with the food, we then decided to just pay for our ticket and go. Then we noticed our ticket was incorrect it was a totally different order. When he finally came back and again with no food asking if everything was okay. We mentioned to him the ticket is incorrect and he was shocked. He leaves then comes back with I'm guessing management stating there is nothing we can do to fix your ticket and you need to just pay this open ticket because it looks like someone already closed your ticket."}
{"text":"So last night it was my daughters birthday.  Me...\"Where do want to go for dinner?\" daughter...\"OLIVE GARDEN.\"   I smiled and said \"great.\"  OOOF - of all the places in Vegas.  I typically do not frequent corporate run restaurants -  but this was about the kid today.

So it is busy with people who have little appreciation for Italian food and lacking any sense of adventure.  We got a table after about a 5 minute wait.  The waiter was very friendly - but along with tips I think these people are paid on commission, too.

The suggestive selling and everything is understandable but at this place the upsells are obnoxious.  The waiter brings the bottle of wine and he must have asked us for dessert 10 times.  Do you want alfredo sauce with the bread sticks? Is it free?  No. Then No.  (it used to be).  

Then as he is taking our drink order he asks if we are ready to order.  C'mon guy let us sit down and relax a second ---- geeeez.   We are not cattle here.  

Then the salad.  They actually put one olive in the salad for each person at the table...oooo generous.  I can go to subway and get2 handfulls of olives if I want!  I think they are counting the croutons too!

So the Food - well it is the Olive Garden, so I ordered the lasagna.  This is not a meat lasagna BTW - it is a cheese lasagne with meat sauce on top and the meat in the sauce is scant.  It was perfectly flat - was this thing made at a factory somewhere else?  It was a birthday dinner so I smiled and ate half of the $14 pile of of of of of ....

The food is just so lackluster.  The corporate influence is just too much.  I avoid this place at all costs, I hope my daughter appreciates the sacrifice I made last night... greater than any gift!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, but this is the 1st time I have ever gotten mediocre service.  The waiter was clearly loaded, but the greeting was half-hearted, the service more than extremely slow and I really could have ditched on the check if I wanted to because it took 10 minutes to get it after my hubby took the kids out to the van just so they don't disturb the other diners.  The food on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful.  They changed their belini tea which made me mad.  It's super sweet and don't taste like peach anymore.

This location changed a lot of things since last I was here.  They changed those comfy, arm-rest on wheels chairs for a more regular, wooden back, sans wheel type of chair.  The kids' menu also got a face lift.  They offer sides now that are slightly more nutritious.  My kids loved the grapes but they come in a dinky cup.  About the size that you would get a side of ketchup in.

All in all, it's still an Olive Garden with the same 'ol menu and drink selection."}
{"text":"Since I was just a little boy munching on soup, salad, and breadsticks, I was never really a fan of Olive Garden... so my 4-star review should say a lot!  The menu is much improved over the last time I ventured here.  I was with a fairly large group and all seemed to enjoy their dishes very much!  The Zuppa Tuscana and Pasta Fagioli (sp?) were both big hits with the crowd.  The calzone was smaller than what we were expecting, but the chicken parm panini was plenty big and plenty delicious!  Even the salads are much better than what I remembered.

I still can't say that I will plan my next Olive Garden outing anytime soon... but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"Okay so let's start with I am not a big fan of chain Italian restaurants, but I went because it was a group thing. 
The food was average, Chick Parm. The quality was below their competitor, however, it was what I did except the place. 
The reason for the 2 stars has nothing to do with the food.  The service was terrible. Most of everything besides me got their famous soup, salad, and breadstick deal.  The server bearly came back to the table to check on us. Total time from first delivery of food to getting the check was 2 hours and 10 mins. We saw the server 2 times. 
For the price that they paid, they did not get what they deserved."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was cooked to perfection (steak was a spot on medium rare) and they have very punctual staff. No real qualms about this establishment."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is what it is.  Formula restaurant with not very authentic food but consistent.  

I am pretty much going to order Soup Salad Breadsticks when I come here.  The soups are pretty good.  The salad is fresh and tasty.  The breadsticks are addictive, hot, and plentiful.  

Not my favorite place to go but it is not usually met with opposition by anyone.  Not exciting at all."}
{"text":"For some reason we have not been to OG for a long time and recently we decided to stop in for dinner. Since then we have been back 3 times and each time the food and service has been excellent. The breadsticks at this location are awesome and I really enjoy the selections of appetizers available. If you haven't been in lately you should give it a try and enjoy some yummy treats."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden... So of course I'm not going to give 4-5 stars. Friendly service, prompt wait staff, drinks come fast and the $11.99 3-course meal going on now is a pretty darn good deal."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is the same everywhere...decent food...decent prices...decent service!  Not authentic Italian by any stretch but still very good!  Love their breadsticks and Pasta Fagioli soup!"}
{"text":"Carson is definitely one of the best servers! very kind and insightful when it comes to knowledge regarding the menu items.  the chicken was wonderful here I almost feel like I should be having dinner here once a week. my one problem with the dining experience here is the fact that the cups are really slippery. I almost spilled my caffeine free diet Pepsi all over my Chanel spring/summer 2014 white dress"}
{"text":"After a lengthy wait for a table in Scottsdale, the novelty is slowly wearing off, but the steady following attests the warm welcome.

My first visit to Olive Garden was during midafternoon, so I could be sure to get in. After a late breakfast, I figured a late lunch would be fashionable.

The place is impressive. It's fashioned in Tuscan farmhouse style with a welcoming entryway. There is seating for those who are waiting.

My booth was near the kitchen, and I watched the waiters in white shirts, ties, black trousers and aprons adorned with gold-colored towels. They were busy at midday, punching in orders and carrying out bread and pasta.

It had been a few years since I ate at the older Olive Garden in Mesa, so I studied the two manageable menus offering appetizers, soups and salads, grilled sandwiches, pizza, classic dishes, chicken and seafood and filled pastas.

At length, I asked my server what she would recommend. She suggested chicken Alfredo, and I went with that. Instead of the raspberry lemonade she suggested, I drank water.

She first brought me the familiar Olive Garden salad bowl with crisp greens, peppers, onion rings and yes -- several black olives. Along with it came a plate with two long, warm breadsticks.

The chicken Alfredo ($10.95) was warm and comforting on a cold day. The portion was generous. My server was ready with Parmesan cheese.

As I ate, I noticed the vases and planters with permanent flower displays on the ledges. There are several dining areas with arched doorways. And there is a fireplace that adds warmth to the decor.

Olive Garden has an attractive bar area to the right of the entryway. The restaurant has a full liquor license and a wine list offering a wide selection to complement Italian meals. Nonalcoholic beverages include coolers, specialty coffees and hot teas.

On a hot summer day, I will try the raspberry lemonade that was recommended.

There's a homemade soup, salad and breadstick lunch available until 4 p.m. daily for $6.95.

An olive branch on menu items signified low-fat entrees. There is a Garden Fare Nutrition Guide available for customers seeking gluten-free food. And for those with food allergies, Olive Garden has an Allergen Information Guide.

All in all, it is the largest and most beautiful restaurant now operating in Scottsdale. It attracts visitors from out of town as well as people who live here.

Olive Garden is part of the Darden chain of restaurants that also operates Red Lobster. There are about 700 restaurants, including four Olive Gardens in North Dakota's major cities.

Olive Garden has gained a following since 1982 with its ample portions and relaxed ambience. It's known for its classic lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken Parmigiana.

BOTTOM LINE: Winner winner chicken dinner!"}
{"text":"If you plan on ordering to go food via the phone or internet, Do not expect you will get what you are ordering or get anything at all. My family ordered here on more than 20 occasions. and 8 out of those times they have completely screwed up the order. First three times they was via the phone and the employee had to ask multiple times what we wanted and she managed to repeat it perfectly and then somehow we still get the wrong food. We stopped using the phone and switched to the internet service and hoping that will fix it. Needless to say they have still screwed up to the point that we had to start opening up the bags in their pickup area by the bar to actually verify we are getting what we wanted. It is extremely disappointing for us to do so. 

And today Dec 17, 2016. They managed to screw up the order by not giving us any of the appetizers we had order which we even printed out to show them how they messed it up. By the time they fixed it and we got home we found out that the soups were mixed. Literally had gnocchi and toscana in the same bowl. and this was all 3 bowls. Utterly pathetic. 

I will be wriiting to the news station to hopefully bring awareness to such a horrible restaurant. Horrible management, and untrained employees. Not to mention they wouldn't even refund our money on any of the occasions that we had these issues. Had to toss the soups."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Olive Gardens, but this one is definitely the best one I've eaten at. The inside of this particular Olive Garden is just so pretty and every time I've come here the servers are always very friendly. 

I came here with my mom and we both ordered the fettuccini alfredo and we both agree this restaurant made it better than all the others. The sauce was creamy and delicious and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The salad and peach tea were amazing too as usual. Will continue to come back to this location! Thank you for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Well I shouldn't have even gone here.  This is an old chain, near the end of its life anyway...but I used to eat here 20 years ago and thought what the hey.

I had a Heart Healthy shrimp and pasta thingy (why don't they offer whole wheat pasta if they care about your heart?) which was OK.  Date had breaded eggplant, which was crispy, but tasted like it was past time to change the grease it was fried in.

My big problem?  The breadsticks.  They used to be all soft and warm and buttery and you got them as soon as you sat down.  Now you order them or they come with salad (weak, iceberg lettuce) and they were hard, brushed maybe with some kind of oil?  Not the same, not great.

Look, chain restaurants limit choice.  We should know better than to go in one."}
{"text":"I have always been so-so with olive garden. Some stuff is great while other stuff is not. This time around I got Chicken Alfredo. The sauce seemed a bit bland..not super flavorful. Also, we went on a Friday night, so it was extremely busy. Service was lacking. Two people in my party ordered the endless bowls of pasta, they finished their first bowl and waited about 10 mins before our waiter even realized. They ordered another bowl and took about another 10 mins. Mind you the refill bowls come with only a few bites. They finished quickly after and waited another 15 mins before getting another bowl. Just very slow. Our waiter was great, just very busy with other tables. Overall...an okay experience but will stay away from this place during peak times."}
{"text":"Once had breadsticks with blue spots on them. Server rushed them away and told me that it was \"ink\". WTF? Plus I had to pay full price anyway."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a great time today at this location. We were greeted by multiple empoyees and our server, Sunday, was very fun, jovial, and upbeat. Two different managers introduced themselves at our table. It was amazing how quick and thoroughly they cleaned the tables when people finshed. The staff here is really on top of their game. 

I was worried that we would have to wait since it's brand new. We showed up at 4:45pm and were seated immediately. When we left an hour later, there were a few parties waiting. I doubt if the wait was long  because  the hostesses were seating people constantly. 

I look forward to visiting this Olive Garden regularly. I'm also excited that they have added some lighter fare options (575 calories or less) to the menu and offer veggies or whole wheat pasta upon request."}
{"text":"Had a very good experience. We (family/friends) went during off hours so it wasn't busy or crowded. The food was very good. We had Spaghetti & meat sauce, Lasagna, Salmon & an order of the cheese sticks. All delicious plates. After the meal the kitchen manager, McKenzie asked about our dinner. He was extremely kind, genuine. A people person for sure! The right person in the right role. As we were speaking, my daughter mentioned that she loves cheese cakes but was too full to eat dessert. He made sure that we had a complimentary cake to go! We were blown away by his thoughtfulness, generosity! Excellent customer experience. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I decided to take my niece out for lunch while home visiting family and she chose Olive Garden.. When we arrived we were quoted a 15 minute wait for a table so we got a little buzzer and had a seat.. Since it was freezing and starting to snow people were pulled in the doorway trying to stay warm. It would be nice if they had a larger wait area as it took awhile before we could sit to wait. Once seated at our table things were better. The waitress wasn't too bad nor was she really attentive she forgot multiple things we asked for and took her sweet time when it was time for us to pay. Food wise it's a chain so it's as good as I expected it to be..."}
{"text":"Alright, Olive Garden, you forced me to destroy you. I never bothered before, because you were such an easy target. But now you go and pull your tv spots for Letterman( whom i haven't watched since high school) in response to his HEINOUS and INAPPROPRIATE joke about you know who. I will not mention that opportunist moron or her daughter as they are truly yesterday's news. 

Your food is mediocre, but not terrible. Waiting an hour+ to be seated in that Italian Cracker Barrel is inexcusable for a chain restaurant. The servers are always friendly albeit uninformed. Then there's the fact that when my wife's lame last employer handed out xmas bonuses, they were gift cards for your pathetic port-o-potty of pasta. No thanks.

As for the tv spots...they sucked chef boyardee's ass anyway. I hope they pull them off of every network . The kind of people who get offended by a dumb joke made by a Jurassic late night host deserve to eat at a place like this. Have some stale comedy with your stale bread, and fade away into the void of the unremarkable( much like the flavor of any OG entree)."}
{"text":"Oh yes, the Olive Garden.  I think that place is fan-freakin-tastic!  And everyone I talk to about it seems to agree.

I used to go to the Olive Garden almost every year for my birthday, but haven't been back in a while.  When I found out I'd be having dinner there this evening, I was so unbelievably excited!  All day long all I could think about was going to this place.

Guess what?  I was not disappointed when I left!  It was exactly as I remembered it being, and I totally loved every minute of it.  My fettuccine alfredo was just perfect; not too much garlic, not too runny.  It took a little longer for the extra mushrooms I ordered to come, but it was definitely worth the wait.

And believe me, there was wait.  When we arrived at 5 PM we were told it was going to be an hour and a half wait.  I couldn't believe it, but there really was a lot of people in the place.  We decided to wait it out and have a couple of drinks at the bar before we ate.  We were all happy when, 50 minutes into the wait, we were seated.  It didn't even seem like we were waiting for that long because we were talking and laughing and having a good time still.  I stand firm on the fact that it's worth the wait.

Did you know that at the Olive Garden you get unlimited fresh bread sticks and soup or salad with EVERY meal?!  Yeah!  Isn't that awesome?  The only problem is that I usually fill up on the bread and salad before my meal even comes!  It's okay, I still manage to scarf down most of my pasta because it's so darn good!"}
{"text":"Had the soup, salad, & breadsticks combo because who needs more? It's simple and delicious. Our waitress was attentive, not super polite or personable, but she did check in a lot. Food came fast, as it should have... and everything was lovely. If she had been a bit more friendly, it would be a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is becoming a large disappointment. And here I am, writing another review of a chain restaurant that's part of a corporation that's part of a conglomerate. No review I write will change their recipes, or make them revamp their menus.

I know that Olive Garden isn't really an \"Italian\" restaurant, any more than Panda Express is a \"Chinese\" restaurant. But I expect a bit more, in taste, not proportions, from a restaurant that charges $20 for a simple chicken item. Olive Garden has become the McDonald's of Italian restaurants.

I ordered delivery (sorry Yelp, I used a competitor, but Olive Garden isn't on your list of restaurants) from this particular restaurant. I had the salmon piccata, and my husband had the chicken piccata. We also ordered a couple of those dessert mousses in a cup; lemon and amaretto tiramisu.

I'm used to getting a nice lemony sauce with a bit of wine with a piccata, whether it be chicken, salmon, or veal. Both of the entrees were virtually devoid of any sauce, and loaded with capers that had all the taste and salt rinsed out of them. The salmon was oh so dry and over cooked. And those little dessert cups are so sweet that they will induce diabetes in perfectly healthy people. And sweet was ALL they were. Flavor index of about 2.

We ordered salad as well. It came with bagged croutons (bagged!) and prepackaged dressing. I could get the same thing at my grocery store! And for less money. Olive Garden used to be famous for its salad dressing, but it's turned into a mass manufactured and vacuum sealed product that's WAAAAAY too vinegary. The greens were fresh and crisp, though. 

I'm afraid that the only good thing I can say about this dinner is that Olive Garden's breadsticks are still delicious. But you can find a recipe for them on the web, if you're inclined to bake. I did add a star for the breadsticks and the fresh greens in the salad.

I know, I know. It's a nice place to go for a casual meal, but you'd do better if you ordered delivery from a local, non-chain mom-and-pop Italian place. They care about the taste and quality of their food a lot more.

I won't be ordering from or visiting Olive Garden any time soon. Like I previously said, they've become the McDonald's of Italian restaurants. I get a craving for a Big Mac about every six months. I'm afraid Olive Garden has been downloaded into the same category.

This review is more of a review of Olive Garden restaurants everywhere, not this particular franchise, but I hope they'll read this!"}
{"text":"Love this Olive Garden! Totally different from other ones, the atmosphere screams Italy a lot more than other locations. The food was fast and good. The asiago garlic Alfredo sauce was okay, mainly almost burnt garlic cloves thrown into the regular Alfredo, but it was good. Great server and fast check out with the computer system."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times, but the last time I came here was a few nights ago. I just wanted soup because it was cold out and we were at Chandler Mall, so OG seemed like the appropriate choice. We got there and it wasn't too busy and were seated. Our waitress came by and asked us to sample some wine and when we declined she took on this huge attitude and said 'so what DO you want to drink?' with almost disdain in her voice. Whoa lady, sorry for not wanting your cheap wine sold for expensive prices... this was kind of the theme of the night. The waitress seemed to be in a very bad mood. The food was the standard mediocre fair that comes from all OGs. The salad had a giant uncut piece of lettuce in it, the soup was fine, the BF got an alfredo pizza that was dry, but fine. So this place gets a big meh."}
{"text":"I've been here previously and the food was awesome along with great service! Honestly if this was my first encounter i wouldn't be giving 3 stars.  My chicken came separate and wasn't fully cooked. My server literally couldn't remember that he has asked about appetizers 4 times as well as forgetting to put in our order. I'll probably be back on a less busy day just to give a solid try but today i was not pleased."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is a traditional Italian restaurant with a large menu of pastas, salads, and seafood. This isn't the most creative or trendy restaurant but it's a  solid restaurant choice every few months. Walking into the restaurant, the decor and decorations makes you feel like you're in Italy and all the workers are friendly and professional to greet you. This location is busy. I never had to wait to be seated but you can see the majority of seats are filled (there are a lot of children here, it's definitely a noisy environment). The service here is okay, but it's always on the slow end. I usually come here during my lunch break and I'm always wondering what's taking the food so long to come out. I normally go for the $7.99 lunch soup/salad/breadsticks deal. It's a cheap and delicious option and you never feel too bloated afterwards. My only issue with this location is that it ALWAYS TAKES FOREVER to be served. The servers are very polite and attentive when they are at your table, but then they disappear for 15-20 minutes until you see them again. Overall, you can never go wrong with coming to Olive Garden on occasion. The food here is good, just don't come here with a time limit."}
{"text":"The hostess was awesome. The facility itself is dirty, especially the bathrooms and floor.  Our salad wasn't the greatest, it had a ton of crushed croutons and the onions were weird and was missing dressing. Our bread sticks were fresh and garlicky!!
Our waitress Nicole tried to be nice but it was a fail. 
It took forever to get our water and it took until after we were done to get a water refill.  That sucks when you are thirsty and you have to finish eating without a drink. 
She did pay plenty attention to the table next to us.  
Guess we were insignificant to her today. 

Anyway which way, we received our food. My husbands  enjoyed his dish and had my lasagna not been burnt on half of it, it would have been very enjoyable. 
My sons pizza must of been good he ate the entire thing along with his grapes!!!

I'll find a different Olive Garden to go to! 


*****Update to the previous review. *****

We decided to try this facility again. Today was much better. 
Austin was our waiter today. Wow he was friendly, personable and on top of our drinks and getting our food out to us.  

Our food was hot and delicious!! 
I suppose they have changed some things because the place was much cleaner, the food was way better  and the staff much friendlier."}
{"text":"What a let down it started with a long wait and finished with a dispute over the bill. In the middle I had a sprite shower from our server. Now granted the server was not experienced enough and our party of eight was only one of his tables but I was disappointed. Our food order was not keyed in right and also not very tasty. We asked that our bill should be separated into couples but we were left with a touch screen to separate our own order. We patiently took all the hits from our evening celebration until we were told the order needed to be redone and our charges entered would be doubled until it got sorted out. The manager did assist us to get the bill separated by couple but we just wanted to leave by then. The focus of our evening went from celebration to survival."}
{"text":"This location is awesome there is never a wait ( well I always go around 3-4:30 pm). The staff are all super friendly. I hate when I'm eating to be asked a million times is everything alright, the waiters I've had would come and refill your drinks and bread without even bothering you and when they would see I'm sorta took break then they'll ask if I need something else (huge plus at least for me).

Definitely will continue to go to this restaurant since the food is always awesome and so is everyone that works there."}
{"text":"the olive garden was really good. it was slower than normal . Which, is good for our group. I had the shrimp and chicken carbonara last night. pasta was cooked correctly nice texture. also the cream sauce was really good. it was creamy. it was seasoned well. my minestrone was spot on but, that extra touch with the cheese oh my good. definetly will be back. Service was awesome, they were also able to accommodate 9  checks seperate!"}
{"text":"Our family was pleased to see Olive Garden offered an online Waitlist. Since every visit there's always been a long wait at this location. I got on the list it was easy enough 20-25min wait no problem. We were at Walmart in the same plaza. Taking our time we made it over to the restaurant with 5 minutes to spare. I go up to hostess stand with family in tow the rude Hostess says it will be a 30-35min wait. I explained I was on the online wait list. She said once we check into restaurant the time starts from then. This doesn't save anytime. With a hungry family we left I called Another Italian restaurant across the street to reserve a table in 7 minutes we were seating and placed order. Don't do online Wait list you'll be waiting while you've been waiting."}
{"text":"Olive garden is one of my favorite franchises. They bring a tasteful bit of Italy to America in a big way. The olive garden in monroe NC is terrible. The wait staff seem like their always too busy to deal with you and your needs, and when they finally do get to you they seem to always have an attitude like their is somewhere they would rather be. Then after you place your order and you have time to sit and wait you start to realize that the decor and fanciness of the restaurant is a facad. The lamps above your head are caked in dusk, the silverware always has spots, and the baseboards of your seats are covered in stains from things you'll never know. Finally your food comes out and it looks terrible. I ordered one of my favorites, braised beef bolognese and it truthfully looked like they threw everything in one pot and served me with a ladle. There was no distinction between the beef and the burnt tomatoes in the sauce, and the stringy lasagna noodles where not cooked thoroughly. I was honestly disappointed from the second I walked in the doors, and was greeted by a talkative staff huddling together behind the hostess counter. I will not be eating at this branch of olive garden again If I could help it. This experience almost turned me off the franchise all together."}
{"text":"Should have listened to the reviews!!
My husband ordered a margarita and it was just not right. They brought another one and thou it was somewhat better it still wasn't good. 
I ordered the never ending pasta bowl and at first I chose the whole wheat fettuccine Alfredo which was extremely dry. So for the next order I tried the regular fettuccine and this time it was creamy but flavorless. 
My husband's food wasn't the best either. So I guess we won't be coming back to this one!!"}
{"text":"Review: knocked 3 stars off from my original post. On my second visit, we were a party of 8, and the manager made a big deal of the 2 waiters we had to serve us. Since I am gluten free and cannot have croutons in my salad, and my salads were small, the other 7 people in my party were forced to share One salad at a time. Like one salad should feed 7 people? Not very happy about that, because we were being served 2 salads ( one for me), I felt guilty. Then, my daughters steak was so awful she asked for A-1 sauce and when the waitress was packing her mostly uneaten meal, the waitress dropped my daughters steak in the floor and simply said, oh I dropped your steak...and threw it away without offering to replace it. Food was great and plenty of smiles from staff. Friendly people but wow the service is not what I would expect.

Original post: 5 Stars. I like Olive Garden anyways, but I am posting this entirely because of the service which was above and beyond anything I've ever received.  Our waitress, Leticia went out of her way to help our table with allergy issues. She was very knowledgeable and helpful. She was also very pleasant and has a great attitude and smile! Olive Garden has a great emploAsk for her! Thanks again Leticia!"}
{"text":"Service started out of it slow and it took them about 15 minutes to get my soup and salad out to me at least The Soup part but after that things moved along at a normal pace and the waitress was pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Want a zero star option! I am a fan of olive garden but this one is horrible! Where do I start? Got soup without bread which came about 20 mins later as it was baking every time we would remind her although everyone around was getting baskets. Then Food ordered was new promos that had no details and had to rely on waitress which was clueless! She lied about the meal all together. Ended up with 2 meals un eaten. The bread finally arrived at end and lemon never came...she kept saying it was being cut! Ended with her dropping our plate on floor causing flying glass and never got a mint! Well at least she was smart enough to ask mgr to talk to us b4 us asking!"}
{"text":"I think recently they had definitely improved as a restaurant. I like the new 25 for 2 menu and every time my wife and I would enjoy bringing our little one there. 1 they are fast 2 the food is good (at least exceeding my expectation for a chain restaurant)."}
{"text":"I have to say this was the worst visit I have ever encountered at Olive Garden. Chicken was dry. Potatos were not cooked correctly. Food came late drinks not served correctly.  Come on we ordered tea nothing fancy and serve me flavored tea. I would rather drive to the Cheyenne and Rainbow. Figured this location being newer would have better service and the food prepared terrible."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden is usually the one we go to the most. Considering that it's the closest and we always get really good & friendly service here. We always start off with a salad. We always ask for extra cheese & they happily provide it! Also, we always get an Alfredo dipping sauce for the breadsticks! It's worth it! This time, I got the shrimp Alfredo. It was delicious. Although, they forgot to put my sun-dried tomatoes in the mix. The other people I was with got the shrimp scampi which was really delicious as well. For dessert, the waiter highly recommended the pumpkin cheesecake. We didn't particularly like it. We should have gotten our usual Tiramisu! That's the one you can never go wrong with! You live and you learn! We still love this location and we will probably come here the next time we crave olive garden!"}
{"text":"Not to put down a chain restaurant, but then it's a chain restaurant... you get what you get.  I was meeting someone at this exit for dinner and frankly Olive Garden seems to be the best option (Hooters... No Thanks!).  The place was pretty busy for 8pm on a Sunday; I guess decent dining options in this area is still that limited.  The service was ok, but our waitress wasn't the best at refilling drinks.  Menu hasn't changed much, but they now have a new soup (Chicken & Gnocchi) which I tried and thought was pretty good :)  I had Short Ribs w/ Risotto in a Chianti wine sauce.  The rib meat was tender.  The sauce was good, even the risotto was acceptable.  The baffling part is why the f they put plain ole green beans and julienne carrots all over the top of my risotto?!  I guess that may have to do with the fact that I was at a restaurant where white zin is considered a quality wine option (and obviously very popular among the ladies...)  Ok, that was my smarty pants self coming out.  

Besides the little oddity of my dish, the entire \"experience\" was a-ok."}
{"text":"Standard Italian food.  Stopped for the $9.99 cucina menu.  Can't go wrong with the all you can eat salad or soup."}
{"text":"Being our closet Olive Garden, we come here every so often. We have dined in as well as have taken advantage of the \"to go\" service. When dining in, especially on busy nights, we try to check in on line. It cuts down on the wait time in the restaurant, which is helpful when you have children. Right now they are renovating this location, so things are in a bit of disarray. Customer service is still ok though, nothing exceptional. Waited awhile to get drinks and refills a couple of times, but over all, nothing to discontinue coming here. Food is always good and cooked well. We will continue to dine in and take out!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a server and he never came up so we can order our drinks, even though he walked past us at least 8 times. Even clicked the call server button on their table tablets. RIDICULOUS."}
{"text":"I hadn't gone to Olive Garden in quite a while, preferring the local Italian scene over the corporate monster. So when we came here for a friend's birthday, I already had a bad bias coming into the experience.

I gotta say, this was actually a pretty good experience. The service dealt with our party of 10 and split checks quite well, and were very attentive. The place still had the cheesy OG look, but it worked for the occasion.

The food was also decent to awesome, of course with the huge quantities you'd expect from an olive garden. The calamari was good both spicy and original, and my Tour of Italy was reliably decent, though I wish I'd gone for a pasta dish. They had some great specials, too, and by the end of the evening the wife and I were planning a future date night here. 

Well played, Olive Garden."}
{"text":"After not coming here for over 3 years, we decided to try Olive Garden again for lunch.
We all had the soup and salad and left greatly disappointed, all were in agreement that the minestrone soup was so very bland, it made me think does ANYONE in management taste their food ?
On a positive note the lettuce was solid, congrats on serving a salad.
Olive Garden has made my never to attend list.

Oh if you can find some time pick up all the cigarette butts by the front door entrance."}
{"text":"I love coming here on my break from work and getting the soup and salad. Today I tried the Salmon and it was yummy :) My service here is normally pretty good but today I must say my waiter was fabulous! Cisco(hope I spelled that right) was so personable and got my food edits just how I like them! He was awesome! I hope he's here every time I come :)"}
{"text":"It's that time of year. Time for me to make my annual pilgrimage to Olive Garden for the never ending pasta bowl and slice of pumpkin cheesecake. I'm Italian and I know good Italian food when I see it. Olive Garden is your average run of the mill Italian restaurant. The selection is designed to please most palates. They have specials through out the year that are limited time only. They always offer you a free sample of the featured wine that day.

The never ending pasta bowl is what brings me in. It starts with an ample amount of pasta of your choice, there are several. You choose the sauce to top it with, there are about 5. I like the 5 cheese marinara sauce the best. If you want meat balls or sausage with it you will pay extra. Soup or salad and bread sticks come with this deal.The pasta is usually cooked perfectly. The sauces are hot. When you order seconds you get half the amount you did the first time. They used to have a bigger selection of pastas and sauces. 

The pumpkin cheesecake is the best cheesecake I've ever had. It is a limited time deal only offered in fall. Well worth waiting a year for. If you have too much pasta, ask for a piece to go. You'll be glad you did.

The cost of the meal is higher than you would expect for an average Italian meal. but this seasonal deal makes up for it."}
{"text":"Do not go here for lunch. Evidently the servers cannot be bothered to show up for work. Empty restaurant waited 10 minutes for a table. Had to leave because of lunch HOUR. Went to Applebee's around the corner. Got seated immediately. Great service."}
{"text":"I really like Olive Garden but when you are spending $50 dollars on a simple dinner for two.... I expect the service to match the price point.... How does the server not know the specials.... Try to refill a drink they never served... Check in only once... Hesitant in bringing more salad....  The food was acceptable but why did I get FAST FOOD SERVICE at a upscale price point restaurant!"}
{"text":"We come here often because we live close by. I think there might have been some confusion in the bar area because we weren't greeted, even after sitting there for some time. I mentioned something to the hostess and she immediately told the manager who was extremely friendly and offered to get us an appetizer. We're in the service industry and completely understand when things like that happen, but our treatment from the bartender after that point was outstanding. He made our experience extremely pleasurable and the food was outstanding as always. We appreciated being taken care of by everyone on the staff tonight, thank you!"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food and presentation always fresh waiting time is average like to come here then the other locations is clean and the service is the best \"cisco\" was our waiter and did everything to keep us happy"}
{"text":"Salad was as good as always and the bartenders who were taking care of us were very nice, but we had a few mishaps.  Our stuffed mushroom were undercooked, but they put them back in for a few more minutes so the cheese was nice and hot and toasted and then they were perfect!  I really enjoyed them!

Unfortunately, my chicken marsala tasted burnt (not the actual chicken, but the sauce) and I had to send it back.  At that time, it was getting late, so I didn't want anything else.  My husband had the unlimited pasta and chose the fettucini with meat sauce.  He said it was ok, but only had one plate.

We will come back for unlimited salad and breadsticks.  Never disappoints."}
{"text":"The food is very good but when I walked in I had to wait about half an hour just to get a seat. I then had to wait another half an hour for the food. It is a bit pricey considering it was only 2 of us and it was about 50 in total. servers are kind but I wish the service was faster.I would recommend ordering online and picking up, it's way faster."}
{"text":"Always a good experience at this Olive Garden. The service is typically good and the food is always amazing, especially considering the price."}
{"text":"Good family place for some good Italian food. Every time I've been here the service has alwasy been good."}
{"text":"I have dined at Olive Garden since I was a kid.  For the most part, I have always enjoyed dining here.  I stopped coming to Olive Garden as much when I became a Vegan.  We decided to give it a try tonight again.  The service was great but the food was gross.  Also, the dining room had 8 dirty tables the whole time we were dining.  There was no sense of urgency to get the tables cleaned.  There wasn't a waiting list but I still do not want to look at others left over food/dishes while I dine."}
{"text":"Hosted a Birthday Party at this location and everyone was amazing. They were fun and friendly and managed to keep track of all 22 orders and make sure that everyone always had warm breadsticks."}
{"text":"We had a large party of 11 tonight! We were tough group with lots of needs including 4 kids! It was crazy! Our waiter Drew handed everything seamlessly! He did not forget one thing or one request! He was constantly running for us! He did everything with a smile! Food was wonderful and service was wonderful! Definitely recommend Drew as a server especially for a large party!"}
{"text":"This Olive Garden just moved across the way to a brand new building located at 2710 W North Lane Phoenix AZ 85021. it's been open about a week.  At first we couldn't find it with our GPS since it is so new.   We went there Nov 27 (tues) 2012

We arrived around 1pm as a party of 4 adults for lunch.   They sat us on the left side near the entrance at the 1st booth.  Thought it would be noisy, but overall it was okay.

Our Servers were friendly, attentive and very conversational, one of our members is a talker and our server enjoyed chatting with him.

They had a special 2 for $25, but we weren't that impressed with the special.  We ordered off of the lunch menu.  we ordered the following

CYO appetizer sampler 3: Calamari, stuffed mushrooms & Fried Zucchini

Main lunch courses:
Lasagna Classico
Braised Beef Tortelloni
Linguine alla Marinara
Chicken Caprese Panini

Dessert:  Zeppolis

We also ordered two dishes to go, even though not on the lunch menu,  they were accommodating and prepped the to go items for us from the dinner menu.

Chicken Parmigiana with [Fettuccine Alfredo (substituted)]
Chicken Marsala

We first only ordered the sampler appetizer, and after it came out is when we ordered the rest of our meal.  That made the lunch more enjoyable, not rushed and our main meals were piping hot.

The Salad came out cold and crisp as usual.  Bread sticks were a little delayed about 5 minutes, they ran out, so we got them fresh out of the oven when they were ready.  Our servers were very good at refilling our drinks.

The whole lunch experience was very good, food tasty. First time I tried their braised beef tortelloni and was delicious.  Wasn't sure what to expect. The Beef about 4 or 5 slices is served with the tortelloni.  By the way, I always thought it was tortellini.  The server told me Tortelloni is bigger size wise.

We also had Zeppoli with chocolate sauce.  They sprinkled liberally the powder sugar on the Zeppoli.  These Zeppoli were rectangular and texture is more firm than doughnuts.  We enjoyed them immensely and will order them again in the future. 

As Olive Garden restaurant, it was a good experience. I think being a new building everyone was excited.  Go and enjoy yourselves, we did."}
{"text":"Sometimes you want a meal you don't have to think about. Nothing about Olive Garden is particularly exceptional. Food is good, drinks and alright, desserts are solid. It's just a good, casual place to carb up and hang out and grab a glass of wine. It's easy, fun and a no-brainer ... perfect when you want decent food and don't mind the noise from surrounding families.

Give these a try: Glass of Moscato, Gnocchi & Toscana Soup, and get the alfredo boat to give life to those breadsticks."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. Please go to a different Olive Garden then this location. We arrived to the restaurant and I didn't care for the location but no biggie. The wait time was only 15minutes, I felt like this location was the least attractive inside. The ladies up front were focused but not friendly and they seemed overwhelmed. Our waitress seemed very new. Every question we had (ie how much are the wings? How many do you get etc), she had to go to the kitchen to ask every time. We had to ask for waters about 4 times and once she remembered my husband and I ended up just sharing one since she only brought one with a lemon in the water (we both don't care for lemon water). Our 9 year old ordered a pepperoni pizza off the kids menu with grapes and a lemonade. All he liked was the lemonade. The grapes were old and shriveled and the pizza my husband and I tasted and it was gross, the sauce and pizza crust didn't even taste like $1 quality pizza. My husband got the braised beef with tortellini and it was so salty we couldn't eat it, I ordered the never ending pasta bowl and the three cheese sauce tasted like tomato soup. I then got spaghetti with spaghetti sauce and that was sick too. Overly cooked to soggy noodles and the sauce tasted like hunts canned sauce. The meatballs were tasteless and a light brown. Something was super off in the kitchen!! We spent $50 and only enjoyed the salad and breadsticks. Please don't go here, you'll leave upset like us. Oh yeah and the way the wine glasses were set up in the restaurant, several guests would knock them over and so you would constantly be hearing glass breaking throughout the dinner... Not pleasant."}
{"text":"So amazing! Their salad, breadsticks and their Asiago Garlic Alfredo with chicken meatballs! Mmmmmm not the healthiest but I ate every last bite. We had a large group with developmental disabled adults and they sat us right away. The staff was very patient and knowledgable of the menu. I'd like to return soon!"}
{"text":"This location usually has great service, and the food is your standard Olive Garden fare. I've eaten here hundreds of times, and whether it is for a birthday, weekend lunch with friends, or quick lunch in the bar area on a weekday, I usually come away satisfied. Today, as I sit here typing, is a different story. I have yet to be greeted at the table - wait just got noticed and placed an order at the 50 minute mark. I was just curious how long I could take up space and not turn a table over. They beat the worst example of that - 1:15 wait for a server at Pedro's East a few years ago with the entire section turned over at least once before I was greeted. Let's see if the rest of the service can partially redeem the visit.

Update:
The manager ran my credit card and then asked me how my visit was. I gave her an honest reply, and she offered me a $15 gift card, which was a few dollars more than my bill for the meal. So all in all, some of my time was wasted but I was fairly compensated for the disappointing service. The food was good as usual."}
{"text":"This is your average Olive Garden.  Our table split the bruschetta as an appetizer, and I had the chicken parmesan.  Both were delicious.  

Our server \"Jake\" was not very good.  First when asked if we wanted more salad he never came back with it.  With a table for 3 we were given no spoon to serve the bruschetta and just 2 plates.  Lastly he brought over the check as we were still in the middle of eating.

I will go back and hope I get a different server next time."}
{"text":"Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day, but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside, inside and in the bar area.

We were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place, not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.

The food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.

Two stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise, it would have been pretty good."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Food a little lite on flavor.  Bread stick almost had no flavor.  Meat lasagna had good flavor but could have used more noodles and sauce.  The salad was too wet from cleaning watery.   They did not for the birthday girl even after mentioned."}

{"text":"Olive Garden is and will be the best, at least for me, sopa tuscana and Alfredo chicken pasta mmmhhh the best, 
But yesterday, we where very disappointed, about the food quality, temperature and flavour, our server the best, check back several times, but we didn't say a word because of the time, almost closing time, soup was lacking in flavour, (never before) alfredo was dry and cold to touch, may be it was the time we arrive, or just a bad day idk.!
But we are die hard fan of olive, and will be for long.!
But, not yesterday 
Sorry"}
{"text":"Seafood alfredo and chicken scampi for us tonight we havnt had olive garden in almost 2 yrs...... this was a welcome meal being we haven't eaten there in a while.  Excellent."}
{"text":"Please listen to each and every review! They ruined my sons birthday! He loves Olive Garden and wanted to eat here so bad for his bday. We ignored the low reviews since it was Olive Garden. This location is packed out but the real issue is that the back of the house staff is not capable of keeping up with the demands of their customers. Our family was served half frozen food!! We was put at risk for food poisoning!! We complained and asked for our  bill and felt obligated to stay . The next round of food was even worst it was burnt . Our appetizer was supposed to be calamari but looked like fried pork skins! This place needs to be closed I will also be contacting the health department!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is very slow. It shouldn't have to taken 10 mins to get another soup and salad refill and drink refills."}
{"text":"I have found that this Olive Garden location has been getting increasingly better over the years, along with the prices and food they offer. My go-to is always the create your own pasta for $9.99 that includes a choice of soup or salad (chicken gnocchi is my favorite) I find this to be one of the more reasonably priced entrees and I always feel like I get a lot of bang for my buck. I can't say the same about some of the other dishes which I think could be a little less expensive. I come here frequently to pick up to-go orders- it's super easy to order online and pick up in store. Because of that, I have stopped coming in so frequently to dine in. It depends on the time of day and how busy they are with their service. Overall, it's a average Olive Garden location."}
{"text":"This continues to be one of my favorite Olive Garden locations, everyone is always sweet and kind from the moment you walk in until you leave. I always receive genuine and kind service. I would like to give a special shout out to Kathy. She was our server yesterday and she is just amazing to say the least. She was very attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed. She is just the best and a wonderful representative of the location. People like her are the ones who keep me coming back to this Olive Garden. Thanks to all the staff for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"Did online ordering and carside pick-up..WONDERFUL Service! My pick up was 2:40 and I arrived 2:30. She delivered my order at exactly 2:40, came to my truck, willing to place my order on my empty passenger seat. First time having Olive Garden and going to this location- won't be my last! :)"}
{"text":"I have to say The Greentree Olive Garden is one of the nicer versions of the chain in our area. Back in the day the one at Village Square was it for me.
Menu is the same as all locations but service is miles better here."}
{"text":"I was so happy the first time I ordered takeout here, I decided to go again yesterday 7-14-15 to pick up food at 5:50 PM.  
I ordered their famous salad, chicken gnocchi soup, and a slice of lemon cake.  After a tip it came out to $23 and some change. 
I ordered my food online and drove to the restaurant and parked in one of the designated to-go spots.  In a few seconds an Olive Garden employee came out to the car with just paper in her hand.  I thought \"Awweee crap there must be a problem\".  I roll down the window and she tells me that the credit card that I paid with online was expired.  I handed her the card that clearly expires in 2018.  She took it back in and swiped and and brought back the food.  
The food was amazing, as always.  My only complaint is that the chicken gnocchi soup WAS MISSING THE GNOCCHI.  How are you going to serve me soup missing one of the key ingredients??? I don't know how this happened.  The soup was delicious but I would have loved to have had at least one gnocchi.  :("}
{"text":"Went yesterday 9/5/14 and it was so great I felt compelled to write a review.  It was just such a perfect Olive Garden meal.  Everything was exactly how it should be. The salad was fresh and crunchy and the breadsticks were hot. I had the peccatore pasta and my husband had the vegetable lasagna.  Our waiter was always one step ahead of us in anticipating our needs.  A different waiter came by and congratulated my husband and I for our new baby.  And a manager came by to check on us.  I don't know what was going on over there last night but everything was on point! Way to go, Olive Garden."}
{"text":"It's almost amazing that you can expect so little from a restaurant and it can still disappoint you so effin much. The server I am pretty sure was high off his @ss, he would constantly forget things, then go to get them, come back ten minutes later and still not have them. Whoever is working in the kitchen burnt everything that was fried to the point of making it disgusting. To be fair it's really my fault for coming here, when my 9 year old niece said she wanted to come here for her birthday I should have yelled and refused to go."}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL!  We live down the street from Olive Garden and normally enjoy their food -- either eat in or take out weekly or more often.  Last evening, ordered Two (2) orders of SPINACH ravioli.  The \"Take Out Specialist\" brought the food and mentioned something about the description on the check.  In the dark light of the bar, gave a credit card, signed the check, eager to take the food home to my wife, believing that Olive Garden would deliver their usual value for price.  

This morning, in much better light, the check is for 2 LOBSTER ravioli for $41.  I called the store, explained the order and check to the manager, and asked if he thought the price was right.  He spoke with the person who took the order, and was told that \"additional raviolis were included\"."}
{"text":"We had a good server. He had a great attitude. The salad was good. They have a great house dressing. We ordered the endless pasta bowls. Not a bad deal. I ordered Fetturine Alfredo. It just didn't taste good at all. My husband makes way better Alfredo. Even the noodles didn't seem right. Anyway.....I don't think I will go back. There's a lot of choices out there."}
{"text":"I have to give THIS Olive Garden 5 stars. Other than having to wait an hour the excellent service & food made up for the wait time"}
{"text":"Great Olive Garden. The service was great and the atmosphere is perfect. The waiters and waitresses do a good job of taking care of the customers. My preferred Olive Garden in town."}
{"text":"This particular location has excellent customer service. I have been in twice, once at the bar and once for carry out. The bar staff is on top of their game and get you your food quickly, while the hostess is very charismatic and understanding as to why you may want a few extra breadsticks with your to go order. I definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Good services there with responsive waiters and waitresses. The food was fine. The choices on the menu were quite a lot. A good place to have lunch when looking around in Monroeville mall. I will come again!"}
{"text":"Always great food and never a complaint. I've had very very good service, but unfortunately I've had very very bad service also. The last two times I was in there, the service was deplorable and when I spoke to the manager he didn't seem to care whether we were pleased or not.

My solution was a simple one. I love the Olive Garden, so when I'm craving their food I simply go to Rock Hill and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"As always, the facilities were clean as well as the bathroom very very clean. I always check the bathrooms out before I sit down and look at their menu. My girlfriend and I both ordered the bottomless salad and she had the zuppa Tuscana and she really enjoyed it and said it tasted absolutely delicious.
I really wanted to order the cappellini Pomodoro, but I was informed that they had taken it off the menu. The waitress offered to try to put it together for me, but when it came to the table and I took my first bite, I ended up having to run to the bathroom to throw up. I don't know they put in that dish, but it was horrible. So I ordered a small bowl of the spaghetti and meat sauce which was almost equally is terrible and had to send it back.   When she finally brought me a bowl with some pasta and actually some sauce on it, it was just ok. We had to ask on numerous occasions for some Parmesan cheese and that's a first. They normally have it handy and ready to go until you tell him to stop.  

I have to say that in all the years and all the times that I've been to the Olive Garden, I've never received such poor service. This waitress was obviously asleep during training or was just not trained at all at least not up to Olive Garden standards. I actually wanted to leave a few pennies on the table and a note that says, \"The tip would be bigger if the service were better!\" I waitressed and I was a very good one. I did leave her a tip but not until after I had talked to The manager. 
The friend that was with me is a very large woman and that waitress was obviously very biased towards her and very unkind. We were actually eating out as a celebration for how well she's been doing, and it is no one's job but my friend and her doctor to control what she eats. That particular way overstepped her boundaries!"}
{"text":"Visited Olive Garden and was very happy with fast and friendly service, waitress was very good and fast , food was delicious . While was waiting to be sited we had a glass of wine with half price and bartender was very helpful with drinks list."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! We had a group of 9 on a Saturday night, there was not one person waiting and we waited for 20 minutes while being told they were \"short staffed\" by one of the waiters. But when we started to leave, the manager came running out to us and even told me they were not under staffed. Being lied to for no reason is ridiculous. As a server myself, I could see clearly they were not busy. Should have only taken 10 minutes at tops. Never again will we take our paintball team to this location when we are in town next time. Wish I could give no stars.. Oh and 5 minutes before we decided to leave, there was this 6 top that juts walked in and were sat INSTANLY! Really guys?"}
{"text":"I went there last night to celebrate my cousin's birthday. With a party of 4 plus 3 children. I came to this Olive Garden first time like 3 months ago, I come here like once a month. After tonight I might think twice before returning to that place. I am personally surprised that one dining trip would make me dislike a place so much.
First, one salad was brought out for 7 people, we asked for another, has that simply not enough. The second salad arrived with entries, the order of one of the party was pretty late. I ordered herbal chicken, it was not cooked right and did not taste good. 
We had 2 waitresses since it is a large party and still could not get a good service.
Then comes time to pay and everyone's ticket is messed up. People were paying for things they never ordered and our credit cards were late like 30 min. 
In summery it was a bad experience."}
{"text":"Being a chain, I actually still like Olive Garden. It's quick, easy, cheap and usually pretty good. You always know what your gonna get, and service Is usually very upbeat + friendly. I really like the chicken fettuchini alfredo, breadsticks, salad and most Of the soup. I've never had cold/ lukewarm food at this location and always leave smiling(and with the server smiling:). Lol. My one wish Is that they would please bring back the cheese manicotti!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"good service and good drinks. we sat by the bar and it was nice and quiet
salmon and appetizers were good. ill go back once in a while"}
{"text":"I ordered this 10 oz trout that comes with tomato sauce.  I have many requirements and stomach issues so tomato sauce will not work for me.  Server was very patient, offered a number of choices and alternatives.  I also do not prefer high carb dishes, so she worked with Chef John to get the trout to come with white sauce (Alfredo) with soft steamed broccoli, they tasted heavenly and will order again.  Manager also came visited me for comments.  I appreciate the good work this location has offered me, from the greeter, to my waitress to the food, to the chef and the manager.  I will also recommend this location to others since customer services combined with good food trumps other criteria in my book.  :)"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this chain. I know all the negative things people say about them but I'm just a sucker for their salad and breadsticks.
I was very happy to discover a nearby location when I moved to the area. Of course, as with most chains, the looks and taste barely differ between locations, which is great!
Aside from the salad, the minestrone soup, and the breadsticks (you can make a less than $10 unlimited combo with these; how can you beat that?!) I also love their Italian Sample appetizer. 
Their menu has a large selection, they have great lemonades and ice teas. Good desserts, and a very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Olive Graden is still one of my favorite restaurants, mostly cause of their salad and breadsticks.
The only comment I have is on our last visit service was pretty bad. We waited good 10 minutes after being seated before a server came to take our drinks order. During that time about 3 different servers who all had tables in our area (the area had about 6 tables, tops) kept walking by, smiling to us and walking on. And we sat there with menus and no drinks or food on the table; so clearly we haven't been talked to even.
That would have to be improved and I realize that service is different at different locations, so it may have been unique to this location."}
{"text":"Once in a while I get dragged into this fine establishment by the ear.  It was a major craving during my wife's pregnancy.  That and Taco Bell, if that tells you anything.  I'm not a fan.  I don't find their take on Italian to be very authentic and I think the ever changing menu is their sad scraping the barrel attempt at trying to captivate a new audience.  Claw harder my friends.  Sure, the classic lasagna will suffice.  The salad dressing is on point and the chicken gnocchi (their take on chicken and dumplings) is decent.  Other than that, it's the same cookie cutter OG as any other and equally lacking in substance.  Not to mention the service blows more often than not.  If this is your thing then chow down.  Don't let me stop you but I'd take Carrabba's over the OG any day of the week.  That or Maggiano's but I'd still opt for the more unique establishments if given the option."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, I ordered a off-menu item, pesto capellini with chicken and my friend had the menu item smoked mozzarella chicken. They were both very good.

Juan is an excellent server: he's professional, quick and personable."}
{"text":"Went yesterday afternoon with my husband. We love Olive Garden but did not enjoy this trip. Waited over 10 min for our drinks, every basket of breadsticks was hard, the check came out with our meal so we felt rushed and was not offered a refill on my tea"}
{"text":"The Olive Garden is does a good job at some things.  Just looking for pretty classic white and red sauce, salad, soup and bread sticks?  Then it's a pretty solid place to go, but the more I venture to other (less carb filled) dishes, the harder it is to eat here.  This trip I tried the Garlic Rosemary Chicken; the chicken was kind of rubbery (if you know what I mean) and the sauce was lackluster.  For $14+ you can do better.  I also skipped the potatoes and tried asparagus for a side instead, the ends were mushy and the stalks woody.

As always though, reasonable service, decent toscana soup and warm bread sticks save the day.  Oh, and the chocolate mint is nice.

If you are going to order off of the simple pasta with sauce menu, try RigaTony's on Warner or VinceTorio's on Elliot.  You won't really spend much more and you'll come away with a much better experience."}
{"text":"Worst Meal Ever!!  Worst experience at an Olive Garden EVER!!  I know I should not expect much but I have never had an experience this bad at this location!  Sat next to a table of kids with babies who yelled and screamed.  Then one of them shit their pants and it smelled like a dump for 20 minutes till we complained and asked to be moved.  Never got the soup I asked for.....  Never got a refill in the bread sticks.....  $17 for three tiny chicken strip pieces and some noodles.  They called it a meal?!?!?!   I do believe this is my last trip to this location!!!!!!"}
{"text":"we went as a large group, 12 of us. Our server (Lori) was great..easily handled all our requests for drinks and food, no mixups and all our orders were brought to the table around the same time. Everyone thought their food was tasty. I had spaghetti and meat sauce, it was very good...no extra charges for handling a large group (like so many other restaurants)...the food was reasonably priced and the warm breadsticks (all you can eat :) ) were delicious. I will definitely do there again."}
{"text":"I always enjoy dinner at Olive Garden and this location is one of the best I have been. I love the fact that they have changed the menu and offer small portions of food and deserts. Servers make sure you have the best experience and their mix drinks are the best! I deffinetly recomment!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. 

From the minute we walked in we were treated like royalty. Seriously, the customer service is 10 stars all the way. Martin and Miguel gave excellent service in the bar/bistro dining section, Our food came out fast and steaming hot, everything we ordered was tasty and delicious. But, I will say this, the customer service far out weighed the food. All the servers seemed to be working together with smiles and efficiency.

As we left we asked to speak to the manager Jenny, to let her know of our positive experience and how much we appreciated our dinner and service.
This restaurant has put together a very good group of workers, It shows in the way they all work together even through the busiest time of the night.

Thank you Olive Garden."}
{"text":"What a great time we had for an early dinner. Keely our waitresses was the best ever. She was very helpful and didn't mind getting us refills on Salad and drinks."}
{"text":"Really yummy food. I had the lunch lasagna and soup. It was a great deal at the $9 for both. The service was mediocre at best. We had at least 3-4 different servers that took care of us. The breadsticks were great as always, definitely ate too many. Will be back."}
{"text":"Best service ever at a Olive Garden. Marisa is absolutely the best server we have ever had. She is on top of everything and anticipates what we need before we do.   It was refreshing to be treated so well.  Food was terrific !  
A great experience"}
{"text":"Ate there with my family.  The serving staff was friendly but incredibly slow.  When we got out meals I had to send mine back.  I ordered the steak gorgonzola Alfredo.   My pasta came out with hardly any Alfredo sauce,  no Gorgonzola and my medium rare steak was well done.  It was almost like the chefs stop caring.  My girlfriend order ravioli and that was cold and the ends were hard as a rock.  My sister got the tour of Italy and the chicken parmesan tasted funny and her pasta was also dry with barley any sauce.  Then in the middle of the night all three of us got really sick to our stomachs and throwing up.  I think the chain needs to look at replacing staff that's for sure."}
{"text":"The food is a lot better than the other Olive Garden restaurants in Pittsburgh. I'm not much of a fan of Italian food, but this has got me addicted!"}
{"text":"It's hard when you love the food at a restaurant, but more times then not you find yourself with substandard service.  I love Olive Garden because of the food, but once again, I was extremely disappointed in the service.  They seemed to be seating everyone in once of their small sections.  The resaurant wasn't busy, so spreading out your diners to give more space would have been nice.  We sat for awhile waiting for the server to take our drink order.  I was already starving, so I ended up ordering an appetizer from their  ziosk (I believe that is what they call it).  She finally came to take our drink orders.  All we wanted was water.  We received our appetizer and almost finished it before the water even arrived.  During this visit, I felt like we sat at the forgotten table.  We had been sitting at the table for almost an hour by the time our entrees arrived.  I was so frustrated that I could even eat it. I ended up having to pack it to go.  I felt bad for the other members in my party because they became uncomfortable eating since I couldn't.  The waitress even brought a to go box for every member in the party when she delivered mine.  That was after I said my bx could come at the end.  This visit, no managers came around to the tables to check on the diners either.  I was so irritated that I didn't even feel like asking to speak with anyone on our way out.  
Please work on the service staff.  They need to listen and be a little more attentive."}
{"text":"Just a note, for those who have gone here many times and only had one bad experience, why so quick to leave a negative review but not so quick leave a positive? I must say I've always been happy here. This was my childhood restaurant to go to with family and just eat Alfredo and raspberry lemonade in that cute little kids cup. Now I'm 21 and a waiter myself and I know now, you won't always be greeted within 1 minute, food won't always come out the way you like it, and other factors but they've been good to me... (Maybe its the big tips lol) to you great waiters keep up the good work. To the ones that are lacking, try to get better because your tips won't come to you if you don't put in an effort"}
{"text":"Came in, was seated, ignored and finally approached server. Poor excuse for customer service and poor mannered staff. Never coming back to this location. Manager was not even notified. Train your staff."}
{"text":"I would like to qualify my review with the following:

-I take my mother out to lunch every Sunday.
-My mother is full-blooded Italian.
-Mamma enjoys going to Olive Garden.

Okay.  There you have it.  She's not looking for authentic Italian cuisine.  She's not looking for Polpette alla Napoletana.  She just wants lunch with tomato sauce, pasta, and salad with her famiglia.  And she wants a predictable, no-surprises lunch.  Period.

So.  Here's the deal.  If you want to explore the depths of authentic, rustic Italian cuisine down to the consumption of sauteed lamb brains, then Olive Garden is definitely not the place for you.  If, however, you wish to keep your Mamma Mia happy in her later years in an atmosphere that encourages conversation and reminiscing about good times, then I would highly recommend that you take your matriarch to Olive Garden.

Yes...we all know that it's not a four-star Batali joint.  People who eat at OG are not looking for that.  They want what they want.  And they get what they want.  And they are happy.  And that's why we have Olive Garden.

So I am giving this location 4 stars because my mother enjoys going there and the service is great."}
{"text":"Server was completely uninterested in us and took forever to bring us anything. When our server disappeared I asked the other server in the section to grab her because we wanted bread that wasn't stale and cold and she reluctantly said she'd get new bread. She brought it back to the table next to us and I didn't get my bread until after we finished soul ms salad. No cheese on the entrees and took FOREVER TO bring a to go cup."}
{"text":"I was turned off Olive Garden 15 years ago when they had all you can eat pasta bowl. Every time I would get a refill getting the server to return to the table would take an extra 10 minutes longer than last time. That was back in Perris CA. I tried this restaurant because my wife likes the Olive Garden restaurant chain. This one surprised me. The service is great the people are friendly and now they have a burger that kicks butt, but is usually not on the menu so you have to request it  and I suggest you try it."}
{"text":"If there was a 6 th stat Brittney would definitely get it with her great attitude and wonderful service she needs a raise!! We were celebrating my daughters kindergarten graduation and she made it special by bringing out a decorated desert she did her self. When you stop here ask for Brittney she is on top of her shit."}
{"text":"I saw the scathing reviews and I had to come to Olive Garden's aid.  It's really frustrating to hear and see so much hate towards a chain which I think actually \"gets it right\".

First off, I'm Sicilian, I'm proud of my heritage, and I've ate at a large number of traditional Italian / Sicilian restaurants, festivals, and homemade affairs.  I've had \"the real\" deal before, and like any yelper I'm usually one to value a unique establishment over a processed franchise.

That said, there is very little wrong with Olive Garden's approach and the Mineral Point Road location does a great job.  I want to steer the direction the other way from what I've been reading because I have gone to this Olive Garden probably over a hundred times in the last 15-20 years, and I have almost never had a bad incident or poor service.

Food:  They might include a heck of a lot of butter and might have a fairly strict formula that they follow, but it's still quite tasty in my opinion.  I can make pretty good pasta at home, but that doesn't mean the pasta isn't enjoyable at Olive Garden.  Their alfredo sauce is fantastic, and in my opinion easily rivals some of the traditional ones I've had.  The tour of italy is a scrumptious dish, their soups are great, and most people I know who are salad fans like the plentiful and tasty house salad that is provided.

Value:  I think this is really where Olive Garden shines.  Some people think it's expensive, others think it's dingy, but honestly they give you a very large amount of food for your money.  If you order a meal (usually in the $7-15 range), you get free unlimited soup or salad and unlimited breadsticks coupled with a large entree.  Seriously, what other restaurants give you that much for that price?  I've had some certainly, but it's not a common thing and I would never call it \"too little\" for what I'm paying.  How can you not like the breadsticks?  The Zuppa?  Commman!

Selection:  One of the onuses ignored by many restaurants is the ability to expand upon their existing success.  Take for example a restaurant chain like Chipotle.  They have a good burrito line, and a few different options, but since their opening they really haven't added much to the menu.  MAYBE a burrito or meat choice, but that's barely doing much.  Olive Garden on the other hand offered a good selection to begin with, and has a few new choices almost everytime I go.  That's smart business, they didn't dump their old classics (for the most part), they kept the part that got them success in the first place and they gave incentive to come back and try new things.  They frequently have deals (unlimited pasta bowl $7.95), wine tastings, etc, so I really see no way you can lose.

Service:  Yes, the point about most Olive Garden workers being high school students is pretty valid.  That said, in all the locations I've been at (Milwaukee, Chicago, Madison), I've only had a few occasions where ineptness or inexperience became an issue.  Usually the kids are polite, and you gotta start somewhere in the work world so I'd rather be treated nice than go to McDonalds where the high schoolers there don't give a **** about your order.  People on here said the wait was long?  Maybe when they've been super busy, but have you ever been to Fridays?  You order a burger there and 2 hours later you get a glass of water.  I tend to like when the waiter / waitress is younger too because they are usually more conversational then.  Sure, some of the kids are nervous and do the whole \"yes sir, no sir\" routine which is annoying, but I've had a lot of servers at Olive Garden who actually talk to you.  So while I agree some aspects of the service could be better, this isn't a crapshoot by any means.

Atmosphere:  How can you hate on Frank Sinatra music, reasonable lighting, and a comfortable table / decoration setup.  It could be more original, but it's still reasonably cosy.

For a chain, Olive Garden can have my business any day of the week.  To the person who had soggy pasta and said that salt and pepper were called secret ingredients give me a break.  My pasta's been fantastic everytime and you can always request olive oil / marinara for your breadsticks if the taste alone doesn't do it for you.  I personally have no problem with their breadsticks."}
{"text":"Thanks to this location, I will be going to Macaroni Grill from now on.  Waited for 45 minutes for my food car side pickup.  Their way of compensating me for my time was a piece of chocolate cake, extra breadsticks and warming up my food via microwave.  My dog wouldn't even touch it.  Nice $30 meal in the garbage.  NEVER again.  You have lost my business."}
{"text":"First of all I do want to say that I love this restaurant always great customer service. But today I ask for a salad and a order of Alfredo sauce with bread sticks. The person that was taking care of me said that the bread sticks were sold separately? I told him that I always buy the Alfredo sauce and it always comes with them. Well the guy told me he was going to ask his manager RON, iS THAT MANAGER FUCKEN STUPID?? He charged me 6.79 for the Alfredo sauce. So I called the Olive Garden that is located 1545 e flamingo rd 89119. In fact they told me that they charge 3.69 for the Alfredo sauce and it comes with 4 bread sticks. RON is the name of the stupid manager. The person who helped me out name is Zackary , check number . 10920. Pick up date - wed, 09-06-2017 . Once again the person that helped me was super nice and maybe he was new or didn't know everything. But a manager to be stupid enough to charge so much for alfresco sauce. It's not the first time that, that manager do something stupid."}
{"text":"I only ordered soup and salad, nothing special. The chicken and knochi was good as usual. My only issue with this olive garden was big enough to go from 3 stars to 1 star rating. 

We arrived at olive garden at 12 o'clock and did not get seated until 1 o'clock. It was really disappointing because the restaurant wasn't even full at all. The next downfall was that it took over an hour to get the food we ordered. Every table around us, including parties who had been seated after were getting their meals. The servers just kept coming to our table and apologizing, however they did nothing to accommodate us. Every time they came over it was to tell us out would be another 15 minutes, this happened 5 times. 

I expected with good customer service these people would offer us free wine or dessert to make up for the hassle, but no such thing. Not only that, after that long wait my husband's dish (northern tour)had the tiniest portion of food. It literally had 3 ravioli on it&the linguini was less than a handful of my one year old daughter. 

Overall you can rely on olive garden delivering a decent meal, but the service was really lacking at this location."}
{"text":"Tiffany was an AMAZING server! She knew my boyfriends grandparents by name and already had their drinks on the table by the time we sat down. 
I love going to places where I feel at home and where the whole party is treated like family! Thanks Tiffany!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain.  Is it top of the line?  No.  But the quality has greatly improved over the years and the service as well.  They handle groups well.  This place is always on the list for my office to have lunch.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"My very first olive garden experience.  Yea yea it's pretty lame but it's better late than never. 

We decided to have a late lunch.  First of all this restaurant is great!.  The environment has a nice atmosphere of that \"family\" togetherness.  Our waiter was great too.  He was very helpful and attentive to our needs.  

I'm gonna have to say...we ordered pupu style and shared amongst eachother.  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork chop and eggs.  It was wonderful.  I would have never though of the Olive Garden for this dish until I saw it on their TV commercial.  Ask for server Tom Vu, he's on top of his customers.  I gave him a very generous 25% tip."}
{"text":"Came in to eat with my lady friend a couple days ago, and wanted to give praise to our dinner here.  We've been to Olive Garden before so we pretty much knew what to expect.  The food is always good, so that's great, this time was no exception - thanks kitchen!  Fast and delicious!  Our server is the reason why I'm writing this though.  Nick was awesome!  Very polite and calm, very quick and always had our needs in mind and didn't bother us too many times either.  Thanks nick!  Hope they give you a raise!"}
{"text":"Here for my mother in laws birthday.

Our server was Alex and he did a great job! Very nice and attentive service. 

My wife and mother in law ordered the shrimp scampi. I tried my wife's and it was delicious. I had the cheese ravioli and it was also very good."}
{"text":"Tonight we had a great meal and got WONDERFUL service from Tania...she really knows her job...we'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Good, but not the best Olive Garden. I've been here probably about 5 times, and nothing bad has ever happened here, but also there's never been anything outstanding. The service is always pretty good, and the food is pretty consistently decent. The price is pretty good for the not-quite-authentic Italian food!"}
{"text":"Our First experience with utilizing the \"Carside To Go\" service. Initial telephone call was great, the young lady on the phone was clear and I didn't feel like I was having to yell into the phone to be heard. They must be using some background noise canceling headset or something, okay now onto the pick up and food quality.

The pick-up took much longer than expected I waited 8 minutes just to have someone walk out and greet me. If this portion was faster 5 stars would have been given.

The food was hot as to be expected and they provided plenty of utensils for us to enjoy our meal with.


Overall a good experience, I would recommend you trying this if your not wanting to venture inside on a particular evening."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner with friends.  This visit kind of reaffirmed my previous visit!  The prices are high and the quality of food is not very good...the best thing I find is the soup and salad combo with the bread sticks.  Hard to mess up soup or salad, especially if they have a special.  Our waiter talked so loud, I think everyone in the place knew what we had ordered.  I think he was a little hard of hearing!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 15 minutes  before I had to go to the host and tell them we need a server.  Then I waited another 15 for a cappuccino  that was cold when ordered hot. Waitress disappears again and does not check on us. Another 20 minutes go by and best believe I have talked to the manager and leaving because of their horrible service. Not to mention that is not even busy! I had to choose 1 star otherwise , I couldn't post this review! This location deserves zero stars!"}
{"text":"Apparently this restaurants policy is to seat larger parties before anyone no matter if you were there 30 minutes before them or not. Let's see how crappy the service is...."}
{"text":"Ordered to go carry out. Just call, place order and then about 20-30 minutes, drive to the parking space where it says for pick up. Packed everything perfectly! Ordered 3 dishes: chicken parmigiana w/fettuccine (all main dishes come with salad and breadsticks),  3 meal, chicken parmigiana, lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs(you can pick what you want on the 3 meal dish. Last order, chicken with pasta w/white cream sauce. Everything was delicious! Chicken parmigiana cooked perfectly, fettuccine cooked perfectly, al dente, lasagna very good, meat sauce very good. Chicken with pasta w/white cream sauce was very good also. Salads had a lot of fresh veggies and dressings were good also. Very impressed on how they packed our order where everything wasn't slapped around or messy. Definitely if you do not want to eat in, try the carry out way! American authentic and $'s were reasonable. Hope they have another Olive Garden where we live now and just as good!"}
{"text":"I've came here before and never had a problem and I come here and sit in the back and the waiter got all 4 of our orders wrong. Then she had attitude and claimed she didn't hear anything or that everything was rang up wrong. I've just never had a problem and this time was just bad because everything is wrong. She even got frustrated that I said wanted 2 salads. It was nice for them to take off and the things we didn't even want to eat because of how late it came"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted with a warm welcome. We then had Miguel take us to our table, introduced himself as our server, and got intimately personal by asking where we were from, with a response from where he was from. He walked us through the menu after taking our drink orders and bringing bread for our table. He consistantly checked on us and gave amazing customer service.. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK MIGUEL...THE FOOD EXCELLENT, SERVICE UNFORGETTABLE, DEFINATELY COMING BACK!!! FIVE STARS AND AN EXTRA STAR FOR MIGUEL FOR BEING OUT IF THIS WORLD!"}
{"text":"I used to really regard \"Olive Garden\" as a more \"upscale\" place to eat but with more and more places exceeding that \"fancy\" style, I believe they've become a little more of a regular night out or lunch spot. 
On this visit, I was very happy with food and the service. Ingred was an amazing server. She was very attentive and sweet. The food had lots of flavor and met all our expectations. 
The host stand and the bartender, however continue to be something less than desirable. They look like they hate their jobs, seem always confused, and just take forever. 
Other than that, this is still a great spot to dine!"}
{"text":"I loved Olive Garden but after today it's the worst restaurant ever! We have a 3 month old girl and a almost 3 year old is its a little hard to go out, we usually let out 3 year old watch a movie on his tablet when we eat so he can sit still and let us eat. A few hour after we left we had realized that we left it. When we went back to pick it up the said \"we are honest people\" I hate people that steal specially from a three-year-old!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review:
It was a stormy fall night and we had just finished shopping at the local Toy R Us. We decided to take a quick dinner here and was hoping for a solid Italian dinner. Alas not so good. I ordered the steak medallion Gorgonzola fettuccine alfredo. While waiting for dinner, we had the unlimited breadsticks which were good along with the soup. Somehow my two bowls of soup came out lukewarm which was quite disappointing. The dinner that I had ordered had overcooked fettuccine alfredo with 4 piece of \"steak medallion\". Unfortunately, not a good cut of beef as they were tough and chewy. Even though I had ordered it medium rare, the steak was close to medium to well. Even before we finished eating the waiter asked if we would like dessert and promptly threw down the check when we said no. Overall I will have to pass from eating here again.

Pro: unlimited soup/breadsticks or salad if you want

Cons: overcooked pasta, the quality of the meat for the dish was not good

Hidden gem:
Check sunday paper for coupons. Unlimited soup and breadstick. Sign up online for the e-club for a free appetizer with the purchase of 2 entrees."}
{"text":"The husband and I stopped in for an early dinner one day. We order some food, got some drinks... everything was fine at first. Then I decided to pay for our meal on the tablet before getting boxes and refills just to make our exit quicker as we had a movie to go to directly after dinner. HUGE MISTAKE. Our waiter literally refilled drinks, and answered menus questions to the 2 tables behind us, and the one in front of us... and wouldn't even acknowledge us once our food was at the table. Not once were we even asked \"How's the food?\" Mind you this is an early dinner... he had a total of 4 tables.. not during dinner rush. Yet at one point we didn't even see him for over 20 mins. We ended up having to walk out thirsty as hell, and leaving more than half our food to rot. No refills, no boxes. I was hoping to talk to a manager and there was absolutely no one at the front at all. So needing to catch the movie we left and I decided to call to get in touch with one.

I was put on the phone with the manager named Shawna. After describing my experience she told me she could see that our full plates and empty cups were still at the table with no waiter to be seen. She assured me this was not up to their standards, asked for my address so she could send me a gift card, and told me to personally ask for her next time I came in so she can make sure we get excellent service.

Well... that's NOT what happened at all. In fact we never received a gift card and it's been months. I went in randomly one night to talk to the manager about it and hope she was diligent enough to write down people who should be comped or sent gift cards. She claimed she could not remember me (so they must get a lot of complaints) and basically called me a liar. At this point i said it was absolute BS and she got even more snarky and told me to leave. She was so unbelievably rude and unprofessional. You're a chain restaurant manager, you should be making sure customers are satisfied with their service. You also shouldn't lie about sending gifts cards when you clearly had no intention of doing so. Instead of trying to remedy the situation she just told me to leave in a loud voice! Made it seem like I was somehow trying to scam a free meal out of Olive Garden lol!!!

Obviously we will never be back. I'm really not sad about it, but I did feel the need to make it known that SHAWNA is not manager material. Clearly after reading the other reviews.. she's been an issue for many guests of the restaurant. Hmm?!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend Patrick had a pretty good meal here. We started with the Calamari and they had this new new sauce along with marinara, and Patrick loved it. He was dipping his bread in it. We both ordered the all you can eat pasta and they let us take as many as we wanted home. 

The server was really good at this location. I am glad we got to enjoy a nice lunch and pack away some for the next day."}
{"text":"The service at this location is excellent. Our waiter was always around when we needed him. He also offered us endless soup and salad (and breadsticks) with our meal. Needless to say, we were full by the time our main entrees came. However, we still managed to finish everything because everything was tasty. 
They have healthier options for those watching their figure. The chicken scampi was really good and the sauce was amazing. The only way to make this dish better would be to cook the pasta al dente; it was slightly mushy. Also the salmon came out slightly fishier than I'd hoped. Other than that, it was really nice meal. 
I also noticed that they had these kiosks at each tables. They used it to mainly advertise and to offer games for a small fee. We also used the kiosk to pay our check. I really liked this option because our credit card never left our hands. I was a victim of credit card skimmers twice so this is a big plus for me."}
{"text":"I walk in, I was not greeted and the lady just stared at me until I said something. I asked \"Hello! How are you? How long is the wait for 2?\" She replied \"I don't know 15 minutes I guess.\" I said okay. Waited 20 minutes, not too bad.. I get to my table and my waitress was super nice, I wish I had her name because she was great. Fast forward to getting my pasta.. There was hair in it......... I asked for the manager and he talked super quietly, for obvious reasons. He asked \"would you like a fresh plate of pasta, without the addition?\" Very funny, not! He did take it off my bill. The drinks were watered down and no they were not alcoholic, but they were the black berry lemonade and the sweet tea. I prefer other olive gardens."}
{"text":"I ordered a catering order for 10 from this location tonight and was pretty disappointed overall.

I ordered chicken parmesan, angel hair pasta with meat sauce, and salad.  I picked up on time and my order was waiting for me when I got there.  I thought that was great.  I asked the person checking me out if there were plates, plastic ware, and serving utensils.  She told me yes to all 3.  She told me the serving utensils were in a bag. 

I took the order to a location less than 5 minutes drive from this Olive Garden location.  The food was lukewarm.  The chicken parmesan was not really hot and was hard.  The spaghetti that came with the chicken was all stuck together and I had a hard time pulling the spaghetti out of the pan.  They gave me 1 serving utensil for a catering order for 10.  This made me pretty mad.  Especially since I specifically asked about it.  I had to serve most of the dishes with a plastic fork.  I poured extra sauces out of the bowls.

The food seemed like it had been sitting at the restaurant for quite some time.  Which made for a lackluster meal.  The salad was fine.  The breadsticks were hard as a rock.

Overall a below average experience."}
{"text":"Consistency is key here... I know that every time I order a soup and salad (or anything for that matter), it will ALWAYS taste exactly like it did the time before. There's a lot to be said for that, especially when you have a hankering for a specific dish (i.e. pasta fagioli, I know you're out there). 

As for the sub-par wine selection, the just average servers, and the long wait time for picking up to-go orders, you just have to take it for what it is. If you go in there with super high expectations, you just might be disappointed. 

If you go in there with a casual, family friendly, eat it and beat it mind set, you will leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"A nice restaurant. Waitress was great. Food was good. A mistake was made on my mom's order but was fixed right away. A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars it wouldn't be enough!! I've been coming here for years but on tonight's visit I was blown away! My daughter and I had a hankering for OG and made it in about 915... we sat in the cafe area as there was no wait. The bartender was AMAZING! He greeted us room our orders and checked on us routinely! Food came out quickly and our drinks were never left empty!! I would highly recommend sitting in the cafe area as long as he's working!!!! Great food and awesome service all the way!!!"}
{"text":"$1.99 to play a game while you wait with no idea that you are paying $1.99 to play the game!!! It showed on our receipt!! Not good and kind of like back dooring you. Plus the waiter talked so much to another party we gave up on getting our second serving of soup!!!"}
{"text":"We love the salad and breadsticks of coarse , but what made this night even better was our amazing server Heimi . She rocks !!! So nice and on top of everything . If I owned a restaurant I would hire her for sure !"}
{"text":"Although we arrived after 9pm on a weeknight we had a great experience. We were seated in less than the 15 minutes stated.  Less than 10 minutes after placing our orders, our food was delivered. The staff even took time to sing happy birthday to celebrate my son, even though it was after closing time.  The food we great and so was the service."}
{"text":"Great place, clean restaurant, awesome service but the food is expensive and horrible. I ordered pasta with chicken and it was really greasy, they use really cheap part of the chicken. I am pretty sure it wasn't chicken breast. It has been more than 24 hours and I still feel the horrible taste in my mouth. My first and last time going to any olive gardens. I can't believe they still in business I guess some people don't have taste in great food."}
{"text":"One of the employees stole my sons wallet.  He left it at the table and with in a half hour is disappeared.  The management are not willing to do anything about this and say that it just disappeared and that their employees do not steal.  I have managed restaurants, and theft is quite common.  Ever watch restaurant undercover on Foodnetwork.  The management actually laughed at me that i would think the employees would steal."}
{"text":"Greeter at the door was pleasant.  I went to bar to eat and smelled like a run down bar from the alcohol.  Bartender ladies were nice but didn't offer and cheese in my products.  Customer came in to pickup takeout in the bar and she waited for about 5-7 minutes and wasn't offered anything to drink (soda product) while she waited.  Food was awesome as usual."}
{"text":"Restaurant was all right.  Soups and salads were very good.  We did need to ask the manager about using a gift card that the waitress said wasn't acceptable any longer.  The manager used it, thank you. And the suggested gratuity includes tax:  Tax should never be included in the gratuity.  This is a common error In restaurant calculations, we are finding. Use your own calculator when figuring gratuity."}
{"text":"Tiny black hair in the salad will never eat there again when told them about it they just looked at me like why would I want another one after find a hair and al most eaten it no thank you"}
{"text":"First time coming to this location & definitely won't be our last!!! Super awesome service. Kelsey was amazing! Very very attentive, fast & sweet! Food came quickly. Everything was hot and fresh. I wish every Olive Garden was like this. Definitely blows the one back at home in LA out of the water! Glad this one is so close to where we live now. See you guys again, soon!"}
{"text":"Oh the smell of Olive Garden.  Isn't that the most recognizable smell? I swear I think they pipe it into the vents.

When I worked at PV mall I felt positively fancy to eat salad and bread sticks for lunch here.  And at $3.95 it was quite the bargain when it wasn't an official lunch menu item.  Now they've made it $5.95 for soup and salad w/ breadsticks which still isn't a bad deal.  But now of course it doesn't taste quite as good as when I thought it was healthy.

As for the other food, I was turned off when I had 2 different friends work there who specifically told me not to go there.  Well, not that it was bad or I'd get sick, but that it was to Italian food what Taco Bell was to Mexican food.  When they said that if I could microwave, I could cook at Olive Garden, I decided to trust them.  I'll admit I've been a few times with them when I'm with other folks who really really wanted to go.  The last time I went was maybe 9 months ago and what really struck me were the prices.  I can get fresh ingredients and real cooking for that price - and generally better service.  

The best thing I can say about this place is how many jobs it's given my friends over the years because they have such an amazing turn over they will hire just about anyone.  This is a great place to get a job to get server experience.  And once you've learned the art of hospitaliano, you can go get a better job.  Just like everyone else.  But it will still take at least 3 months for the smell of Olive Garden to get out of your clothes and your car."}
{"text":"I do enjoy the atmosphere here. The food was great as always and the service was okay. Once everything was ordered then the amount of time to get our food was great. Everything was hot and the Duo Dip was delicious!"}
{"text":"There was a time that I swore I'd never go back to Olive Garden again. There are many great and local Italian places in the valley. Olive Garden's prices were going up, their portions were huge, and the quality was either dropping or my tastes were maturing.

And then recently we went with some friends. I have to say that there was a time that I loved Olive Garden before getting to the point I mentioned before. Our last trip reminded me of the good times here. The salad was great. The breadsticks had more flavor than just butter and salt. And a better texture than my last few trips. And the pasta dishes were great. Suddenly this place is higher on my list than 1 or 2 of the local favorites I would've recommended  a year ago."}
{"text":"My review is for 3.5 stars.  I only come to Olive Garden when they notify me in my email that they are having a special (which only runs 1 week) for AYCE Unlimited Soup and Salad, and Breadsticks.  Otherwise Italian food is not my favorite except one thing, osso bucco.  I am diabetic, don't wanna eat all that pasta.  But Olive Garden has one of the best salads, due to the dressing.  Fortunately I can buy their dressing in a grocery store.

My favorite soup is chicken gnocchi, a white cream soup, way better than the potato kale soup.  The other tomato-based soups, I found too tart and acidy, I never select them.  I have the servers grind the cheese into a separate plate, a big pile, so I don't have to bother them time after time for more cheese.  I put a lot in both my salad and soup.  

I ate at this Olive Garden twice this week, because they had the Unlimited Soup/Salad coupon.  Both times the server (different one each time) brought the food but did not notice that I had no silverware to eat it with.  When this happened a second time in a week (today), I told my server, and she explained that the servers who bring the food are not the ones whose role is to provide the silverware.  That is the job of the person at the front, who brings you to your table.  It was the older woman with short hair, who has been working there for several years.  

The first time this week, Steven, the black man, was my server.  He was excellent, even volunteered to remove the croutons from my salad, one-by-one, because I forgot to tell him I didn't want croutons.  And later, he remembered, of course, he was the one who removed them one-by-one, by bringing me a salad refill without croutons.  .  

Today, I had so many different servers, I had to ask each woman, \"Are YOU my server?\"  They all said yes.  And they packed my last bowl of chicken gnocchi to go."}
{"text":"My friend gave me an Olive Garden gift card and since I hadn't been to one in ages, I thought I'd have a free meal.  My server was Matt, and he was awesome.  Super friendly and very attentive the entire time.  My meal, however...I ordered the chicken alfredo.  The chicken was completely inedible. I realize we're not talking high culinary prowess at an Olive Garden but, the chicken made a very odd noise when being chewed. Almost like I was chewing on a rubber bottle stopper. I told Matt about it and said, \"You know, this chicken was frozen, then over-microwaved and then put on the flat top to brown. That is not acceptable.\"  He was very apologetic and brought a plate so I could remove it from my bowl. Then the manager came and asked what was wrong. I told her the same thing. She apologized as well and comp'd my entree, which was the appropriate thing to do, and also said I could choose a dessert for free.  Also very nice.  Other than the chicken, everything else was very good. I've never been to this particular Olive Garden, I've always gone to the one on Scottsdale Road, and never had an issue with chicken there. I may have to take my gift card to that one next time.  
Great service, appropriate action taken by management, but still two stars for ruining the chicken in an inexcusable way."}
{"text":"Our server Jamie provided pleasant, personable service. Of course, when we arrived there was a wait but it was shorter than they stated. The salad and breadsticks were delicious. The mozzarella sticks were very tasty. I tried a different dish from what I would normally get. The chicken scampi was a great choice. It was well seasoned, delish and too much for one sitting. I have a new favorite.

The rest of my family liked their dish as well."}
{"text":"Today my boyfriend took me to eat dinner at olive garden I was having a terrible day and the hostess asked how my day was going and I told her it was terrible. By the way the hostess is a manager her name is Megan she went beyond her basic duty and made sure that I had an enjoyable dinner and left in a better mood I want Olive Garden to k ow that they have a wonderful manager and a wonderful person working for them thank you again Megan you made me smile."}
{"text":"Arriving at 1pm on a sunday and having no wait to sit down you would think the service wouldnt have been an issue. Unfortunately after 20 minutes of having the waiter/waitress bring us the wrong food (yeah... before they took our drink order) and watching or server help older groups use the new checkout platform on the tables... we were pretty fed up.  We stuck it out just to see how bad it could get.  It didnt get better. 15 more minutes to bring a premade bowl of salad to the table. Not to mention, salad must have gone up in price because they only brought enough for 1 person. After 3 bowls of salad (5 to 10 minutes between each request) we left not full of food but of regret.  Its not Olive Garden's fault.  We will continue to frequent the one in greentree and south hills village."}
{"text":"I don't typically come to chain restaurants like this anymore, but I stopped in today for lunch. I would guess that most people coming here know what to expect - it is definitely not fine dining, but is a nice, cheap option where you can get decent food. The food is fine, and they have some great lunch specials, like all-you-can-eat soup and salad (and the soup is surprisingly tasty). I remember the breadsticks being amazing, but was not that impressed today, so I'm sure if they changed their supplier or if my taste preferences have just changed."}
{"text":"I have had great service and great food every time I have been at this Olive Garden.  I am not a fan of OG bread sticks or I would have given 5 stars.  The company needs to change those bland breadsticks to comets with other good Italian restaurants.

Favorite dishes include the all you can eat salad, chicken/eggplant Parmesan, and the sausage sandwich was a great lunch dish."}
{"text":"We are regulars here, our older kiddo loves Olive Garden.  We are often told there is a 15 minute wait when the entire dining room is empty.  However, the major issue is we have had repeated problems with servers putting food in front of our baby.  Our son burnt his hands badly once, when a server put a hot plate (one she had been holding with a hot pad!) right in front of him, he grabbed it before we could move it and while he was screaming she had the audacity to tell me, \"It's not THAT hot!\" We reported this to a manager but it happened again at subsequent visits.  I reported this to corporate and no response.  On one of our last visits, a server told us she couldn't be bothered to be careful of the baby and it was our \"liability\" if he got food on him.  I immediately talked to the manager and after he talked to her she proceeded to throw the salad bowl on the table and THEN serve the food right over the baby's head.  We grabbed it from her even though it was scalding hot - to avoid it falling on him - and again reported it to the (same) manager.  He apologized profusely but we went again tonight after days of begging from our other kiddo... and told the server up front not to serve anything near the baby and he did, glasses, food, everything served right in front of him - he even put the salad on TOP of the baby's food.  Just unbelievable.  We won't be eating there again and I'm filing a report with the BBB in hopes they change their training for staff to avoid someone else's child getting seriously hurt...... UPDATE.  STILL HAPPENING.  WE AREN'T GOING HERE MUCH ANYMORE..."}
{"text":"I've been to many Olive Gardens in my life time and this is by far the worst one. I'm giving it two stars due to the cook and the expeditor. The service is horrible they brought my salad with my entree and my drink after my food. I believe basic service training is in high needed in this location. I do not recommend and will not return."}
{"text":"I ordered the garden primavera solely based on the zucchini. Our server had two tables and still another server had to notice I was out of iced tea. I get my pasta and I'm looking for the zucchini and there was ONE ,  and a shit ton of onions. Should've called it onion primavera with hidden surprise piece of zucchini. Will not come here again. Maggianos I will make our new Italian spot even if it's further, I prefer quality and customer service over location."}
{"text":"I grew up going to this Olive Garden. It had always been a favorite of mine as a child, but I've noticed it definitely going downhill over the past few years. I had a huge craving (5 mon. pregnant) for their unlimited soup/salad and breadsticks. My hubby & I arrive for lunch, are seated within 10 min, our orders are taken and food comes out. The breadsticks were SO dry! I was very disappointed, they used to be so soft and used to have great seasoning on the top. They were also a stale when you bit into them and cool to the touch. Not just the first basket but even the 2 baskets after that. The soup (chicken gnocchi) was very bland, with minimal gnocchi in it (which is my favorite part). It was not creamy either, but more of a watery consistency/flavor. The only way I could really enjoy my meal at all was my dipping/soaking my breadstick in the bland soup so that I at least had some moisture on the bread. Switched to the minestrone next and it tasted so flavorless I didn't even bother taking another bite. The salad was the one good part of the meal that we both enjoyed and our server was sweet. Unfortunately, we will not be returning-not only because of this recent trip but other visits where we've ordered pasta dishes only to be disappointed with how lacking in flavor they were. It's too much $ to pay for food that is that low of quality."}
{"text":"My secret guilty pleasure as an Italian? I come purely for the breadsticks and alfredo dipping sauce. I could seriously be just fine eating that for dinner. Oh and that awesome little Andie's mint I get with the bill. Plus, I don't mind getting a free sample of wine here and there. That's where OG's have earned their two stars.

The reason it's lacking the other 3 stars is due to a couple of things. First, there's always a long wait on Friday and Saturday nights (which I understand) however they don't have very good turnover and they don't quote their wait times accurately. Second off, I have encountered some less than pleasant staff members that I could simply do without. And lastly, their prices keep creeping up and up. I could go get some bomb, scratch-made chicken fettuccini alfredo at Montesano's for the same exact price as Olive Garden's pre-packaged tasting dishes. Meh

{"text":"They took the Sausage and Peppers Rustica off the menu once again.... Lame! My friend and I were given 2 different menus, mine was old and many of the items were no longer available. Thanks for getting my hopes up Olive Garden..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a rating on the food, but we walked out before being served.  So, instead I'll comment on the lack of service.  We watched as other families sat down and were greeted and offered drinks.  Meanwhile, we did not get so much as a \"hello.\"  You should spend your money somewhere that wants your business like we did..."}
{"text":"My Mom and I had dinner tonight and shared that my Dad (her husband) had passed away yesterday with our server, Nichole.  The service, kind words and great food were more than we could have ever asked for.  Thank you to the General Manager, Lee.  Your kindness and thoughtful words when you sat down with us were so comforting.  We cannot say enough about our dinner - we truly felt like we were surrounded by family.  A happy memory to be shared during this sad time.  Thank you so very much.  Pam Gorman (Mom)  and Brenda Gott"}

{"text":"Adam was our server and was totally awesome. We did the mozzarella sticks and rice balls. Both great! Moms chicken was tough and my soup was cold, other than that. It was OG. What can I say?"}
{"text":"Ok...that was weird. A friend and I wanted to catch up and we went in yesterday and Katy was our server and she was very nice. Then...a different server came over and asked us a few questions about our food, what we ordered and if we were having dessert....we had no idea what was going on but politely answered his questions and went back to talking. He came back and took our little computer on the table and Katy comes by and asks us where it went. We told her what happened and she went to investigate. Meanwhile, he comes back with a receipt and says one of his guests paid for our bill! We were obviously pleasantly surprised and then....here's where things got weird. The other server came back over to let us know the \"proper\" response to the nice gesture was to do the same for someone else....um...duh...I think I understand the \"pay it forward\" movement but even if I didn't, I thought it strange that he was basically telling us to buy someone lunch. Then, Katy came back over to tell us that the people who paid our tab only left her a 5% tip! Of course, we left her a fantastic tip but they really took the joy out of someone doing something so nice for us."}
{"text":"Sadly this restaurant has lost a lot of its quality since my last visit. I purchased the
Make your own sampler. 2 choices $9.99
I ordered the mozzarella cheeze sticks and Parmesan crusted Zucchini. DON'T DO IT!
Zucchini  was limp and tasted awful. 3 small pieces of breaded  cheeze and 3 thin slices of Zichinni. Rediculous! We asked for some dipping sauce for the bread sticks. $3.49. For a small saucer!  We were both not impressed with our food. This place just isn't as good as it used to be. Higher prices and worse food,
Looks like another endangered species. Too bad."}
{"text":"I feel like the prices are quite high in Olive Garden for the quality of food you get.   The reason I eat there is because my best friend loves Italian food.  The only thing I do like alot is there lunch deal of unlimited soup and salads.  I love their Toscana soup ( potatoes and sausage) and their garden salads.   It's also fun to eat some of their other soups; however, the only ones I really like is the Toscana and Minestrone.  The bread id also delicious, especially for dipping into the soups.  All the other dishes to me are okay.  The dishes I have tried, but am not a big fan of is the tour of Itatly, tour of mare, eggplant pargiama, shrimp alfredo, and dessert shots.I just don't find them that impressive.  

The service is good though.  They always give me a sample of wine and sometimes when I share a dish, they let me and my friend both get a soup and salad."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to go to Olive Garden at the last minute. We were staying at a hotel nearby, and this Olive Garden was less than a mile away. We were surprised to be seated right away, no waiting at all, even though the place seemed very busy. Right away our waitress, Sarah C. came over to take our drink orders, and offered us a sample of Primo Amore Moscato (which was really good!). Sarah was cheerful, fun and very good at her job. It was pretty busy in the restaurant, yet she was able to give every table the attention needed. Our food came out very fast, faster than I could keep up with. Everything was hot and delicious! Sarah was generous enough to throw in some fresh bread sticks with our leftovers. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch, food was cold and way less quantity served than usual. I spoke with the Manager, Yolanda she did everything to make this experience much better. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love Italian food. This review is going to be from a vegetarian Italian food lover. Firstly, we went in there on a Sunday afternoon and had a tough time finding a parking slot (10 minutes). I went in there quick while my friend found a parking spot. The wait time was 20 minutes even with so much crowd. I really appreciate that.
Let's talk about the food. Firstly we had the unlimited complimentary breadsticks (it was so soft and perfectly salted) and veggie minestrone soup (perfection). We had the assorted appetizers where we choose fried mozzarella and lasagna fritta. The cheese was absolutely stunning.  The texture and crispness made them show stoppers of our lunch. I had Ravioli di Portobello for my entree. For an Indian, I would say that's a lot of cheese because it left my tummy filled up very soon after the cheesy appetizers. My friend had the spiralized veggie pasta. I had a tad bit of it and it tasted bland without the pepper and chilli flakes (again from an Indian point of view). 
I had Tiramisu for dessert coz there's always room for dessert from a foodie's standpoint . The lady fingers were perfectly soaked and it sparkled a beautiful coffee taste blended with the mascarpone. Yummy in the tummy! 

The waitress was absolutely great and she took care of our needs very well. I really had an awesome experience. Happy munching!"}
{"text":"I had my best Olive Garden meal here recently--really tasty food and stellar service!

Crab-stuffed Mushrooms were quite cheesy, just as I had hoped.  The best Pasta Fagioli is served here: hot assortment of beans with Ditalini Pasta swimming in a thick and robust tomato-based broth topped by grated cheese.  Endless Garden Salad with the OG's homemade light Green Goddess Dressing, lettuce, tomato slices, pepperoncini, and seasoned croutons sufficed as another great prelude to my entree of Spaghetti with Meatballs & Sausage in Bolognese Meat Sauce, also topped by grated Parmesan Cheese.  I opted for 2 meatballs and 1 sausage link, and had plenty of food, even though a normal add on is 2 lengths of the mild Italian Sausage.  Zeppoles were sugar-dusted and good as well, nicely dippable in a Chocolate Sauce.  Tiramisu and other desserts also looked fetching, but I left them to others.

Alas, the vaunted buttered Breadsticks were good but not great.  I prefer them to be lighter.
Still 4-1/2 stars overall in what seemed like a fine Italian meal one would be much likelier to be served in a non-chain restaurant.  Even though it may not be the closest to me geographically, this location will be my go-to Olive Garden in Las Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"We came back to fill our hunger pains. It was completely amazing. Unlimited soup salad and breadsticks always good. The tour of italy is a great deal. Amazing flavors. DeAnna is a wonderful and attentive server."}
{"text":"Yesterday's experience was not the greatest. I typically like going to this location, but yesterday, I saw a different side. 

I gave three stars because my experiences here are usually satisfying and the food itself was great. I brought my wife and child out for dinner. We ordered a calamari appetizer and three entrees. We all got salad, and after the first bowl, we asked for a second. The waiter said he'd get it but that our entrees should also be coming out. 

This is where it went wrong.  When he brought the salad bowl out, we asked him about the appetizer. He said that he was going to check on it. I asked what he meant by our entrees coming out and he told us that he meant the app. 30 seconds later, the entrees came out. We told the runner at that time, which actually looked to be the manager, that we hadn't even received our app yet. She still put our plates down, didn't offer to hold off, and proceeded to check on the app. The waiter came back with the calamari about four minutes later and placed it on the table, which left us feeling a bit awkward. We still picked at it, but we're already working on our entrees. 

When we decided to pay the bill, we noticed that the order had the words \"Do Not Make* and *no app plates\" next to our calamari order and they still charged us for it. Whatevs.. I'll pay for it since we technically did order it. 

We got up and proceeded to leave. We may have been pleased with the food, but the customer service just wasn't there yesterday. So, I decided to try and write a review about my experience directly with Olive Garden. Unfortunately, when I asked for my receipt, I was given the run around and waited 10 minutes to be handed someone else's receipt!!!  I was so frustrated, I just up and left. 


Oh yeah.. the waiters name was David.."}
{"text":"I live in Henderson and was going to the location on sunset. After two terrible visits there we came to this location. What a difference! The customer service here is 5 starts compared to the other ones. Always greeted and welcomed with the door held open on the way in and on the way out. Francisco the GM is such a good person and really knows how to WOW his guests. On both visits we have had a server named sky who is awesome and takes great care of us. I now drive past the closest location to my home just to come to this one."}
{"text":"I have been to this location pretty frequently over the last few years. Overall has been mostly positive. Most recent visit was excellent. Seated right away. Food was all very fresh and hot. Took advantage of the $9.99 all you can eat pasta taking place right now. Our waiter , Johnathan, was excellent. Took care of us very well and made us feel welcomed. Will continue to come back"}
{"text":"They updated the place so everything is new. The menu is up dated as well. The place is new so everything is clean and nice. The only negative is the pack of self absorbed hostesses I encountered on arrival and when I left. I understand they can only hire from given applicants but it's nice when you have someone says thanks when you leave."}
{"text":"My mother & I waited 10 minutes for a server, he checked on us once and waiting a long time for our check. Where other tables were being served fairly quickly, noted only one other table in the section we were sitting at. Nobody needs to wait 10 minutes for a server. I come here all the time and service is always great till now. He could be a new server I don't know, not the best service today."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to an Olive Garden in a couple years...now I remember why.  The food is mediocre at best...cheap ingredients, not fresh, and meals that require little if any culinary skill.  Definitely not authentic Italian food. Do I even need to mention that the famous salad bowl is nothing more than iceberg lettuce with a few garnishes... I do have to admit, the Italian dressing is pretty good though."}
{"text":"Good Italian food. If you've been to an Olive Garden before, this is just like the rest. Quality, and I always order the Lasagna Fritta."}
{"text":"Wow big improvement it the OG!!!!
for the servers no more white shirts n ties ..
More casual ...
Yeah is been a while lol
Last night was super busy for a Tuesday night we wait a bit but we got great deal 50% of drinks at the bar Megan the manager have to came to the rescue because the bar keep couldn't keep up with us and another couple at the bar plus whatever else she was doing.
We got our table and we got one of the best services ever at this Garden company 
They make lasagna to order choose the sauce 
White alfredo ir bolognese four cheese or a combination. 
All our little requests was acomodade promptly 
We be back soon now that is better service..
Gladys was our super star server... 
Thanks you all"}
{"text":"You get 3 stars bc our servers were good and nice. 
When I walked up to the hostess at the front and said \"hello, table for 7\" she just looked at me, didn't respond and her look was more of \"why are you talking to me\" with her chin down and eyes up at me. A young man walked up to the front counter and asked me the appropriate question to get a table. 
She didn't even say \"I'll have our hostess seat you or hang on just a second and I'll get someone take care of you\".  I didn't get her name because she wasn't wearing one. Ask me to point her out and I will but I don't plan on going back anytime soon. I'll drive to Bell Rd."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. Did the all you can eat soup and salad and my boyfriend did the never ending pasta cause Sunday's the last day. Our server was incredibly rude and ignored us more than half the time. We were there for two hours because she attended to everyone around us. My boyfriend ordered a side of chicken for $4 and she didn't even bring it out until he was done with his first bowl and too full by the time she finally brought out the second one. She was absolutely terrible. I will never waste my money here again. Her name was Mel or something like that. A fourty or fifth year old lady with no customer service and curly hair. Unwelcoming, made me feel extremely uncomfortable and just because we LOOK young and ordered bottomless she didn't take us seriously. Terrible way to spend the afternoon with my boyfriend. To top it all of when we left about five hostess were standing around staring at my boyfriend and as soon as they saw me they couldn't help but stare at me up and down. I was a hostess and always made sure to ask how things were and say thank you as well as goodbye. I had to do their job for them and thanked them for their service even though it was nonexistet. LEARN SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY ARENT PAYING YOU TO STAND THERE AND JUDGE!!!! This place has gone down hill!!!!! I highly recommend going to a different location if you want actual service from the servers! Won't ever be back."}
{"text":"service was kinda slow, they stuck us in the back seemed kinda weird because the place was empty, seemed a little rascist. they forgot our silverware and salad and breadsticks took 20 minutes to arrive."}
{"text":"Food is alway delicious and the service is great. I love  that you can bypass your waiter and put your own order in before they even great you. Very helpful when your dining with small children."}
{"text":"My hubby took me to Olive Garden for a nice dinner so that I did not have to cook. We decided to try the current two for $25 promotion since the options sounded great.

We each ordered the spicy shrimp vesuvio as our main course which was jam packed with flavor. The shrimp in this pasta dish was very generous as well which was a nice treat. Our meal also included unlimited bread sticks and choice of soup or salad.

Also included is your choice of a shared appetizer or dessert so we opted for a slice of triple chocolate mouse cake which was super moist!

My hubby had peach iced tea which was super tasty and refreshing, I opted for plain iced tea.

This meal was great and a lot of goodness for $25!

Our meal was generous and good and I also like the sample of wine they offer when seated.

This is decent and tasty \"Americanized\" Italian food so this review will only warrant a 3 star rating. I am a huge fan of authentic traditional cuisine and am aware that Olive Garden is a commercial concept lacking that flare.

I must mention that our server Maria was simply Amazing. The service she provided during our meal was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Say what you will about Olive Garden, but they serve THE BEST Alfredo sauce ever! That's why we came here after at least a decade of not stepping into one of this chain's locations. My kids love Alfredo and I wanted them to have a taste of their incredible sauce. They thought it was good but they were not as impressed as I (silly children!). I feel guilty ordering Alfredo (hence why haven't been here for 10+ years). But if you're going to splurge on calories, splurge at Olive Garden!

Obviously the bread sticks and salad are 'da bomb. Affordable prices. Mediocre service. I heard that all of their food and sauces are frozen and reheated. I have no idea if that's true. Here's the deal - it's not the Ritz but the food is pretty dang good if you don't mind a Denny's-like atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Love all of the new Mediterranean offerings. These meals are so tasty, with 600 or less calories each. The Herb-Grilled Salmon topped with garlic butter and served with broccoli was particularly yummy. Yes, I'm advising you to order salmon at Olive Garden! 

Here you can get any pasta dish with gluten-free rotini (yay!). The only sauces that are 100% gluten-free, though, are their marinara or meat sauce. If you can tolerate a bit of gluten (like I can), go for the Shrimp Scampi - so good.

Finish your meal with a cup of hot chocolate topped with whipped cream and an Andes mint. Mmmm!

Staff here from the hostess, to servers to manager were super friendly and accommodating. 

If you're looking for an affordable and tasty meal away from the strip, go here."}
{"text":"The service was good however the food came out cold (the food that was supposed to come out hot) The soup was lukewarm at best and the portabella ravioli was ice cold in the middle. The salad and breadsticks were good though."}
{"text":"Why would you open the restaurant if you don't have any servers on the clock? You open the doors but you can't seat anyone because you are not ready you are a joke!"}
{"text":"Waitress that we were dealing with is very untrained. As she was passing out drinks, she decides to pass a drink across the table and spills the drink over my pants and jacket. She decides to claim there is nothing that she can do to help us out, so I request the manager. He helps very little, and says there is no way to receive a discount, yet at the end for our birthday cake for my grandmother there was a \"discount\" applied. If I wasn't with my family I would have just walked out of this place, seemed like there was an attitude from the staff the moment we walked in. Good thing it's Vegas and it's just a vacation spot. I'll never be back to this Olive Garden along with my family. That's one way to lose some customers fast and easy.

\"Long\" was the manager on duty. The waitress mentioned had very short white hair that resembled uncooked Top-Ramen noodles."}
{"text":"Great deal buy one and enjoy and take one home.  Nice size portions and nothing beats their salad. The one big problem had was being sat all the way in the corner by the kitchen. .there were two of us and we were forgotten for at least 15 min   I could see if super busy but all it takes is a hello and order drinks and then take your 15 min to do what you need to do. I will say that was a turnoff."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever omg didnt have anything i ordered and for the 3rd time in a row . Guess what no management came to see us wow Olive garden will not be around much longer,  or at least i hope so they have gone so down hill ..... oh and get this they say they run out all the time no big deal . From the waiters mouth i swear.... :("}
{"text":"Every time I go to this Olive Garden it seems something always goes wrong. However, after my last visit I will not be back. I ordered the seafood fettuccine and when the waiter brought it out the smell was so over powering the couple next to our table even made a comment. The shrimp was definitely not stored properly and was completely spoiled. I told the waiter my issue and to please take the plate. I switched for the CHICKEN Alfredo, which took them 45 minutes to prepare... Long enough for my family to finish their entrees. 

Not only was I disappointed that my meal was rancid, I was disappointed that the waiter even brought it out with the horrible smell! He was nice and all but I would never bring something so potent out to my customer. Not only that but the fact that it took 45 minutes for my replacement meal was a little ridiculous! The manager served me that turn and when I told her my concerns about how they store the shrimp I was shrugged off it seemed. When our check came out they also did not give a discount or anything to try to reestablish  a good customer review!

I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Waiter was good but the steak gorgonzola was a small portion for the price and where me and my wife was there was several nat's flying and went into my food we had to move got the food there was comp or anything spent 50 dollars for bug food afterwards my wife went to talk to the manager saying we will not return he asked if we paid and we said yes and he sorry we can't do anything have a nice day stay away if you want bugs in your food unless you don't mind paying the money for bug food I will never return to this one I'll drive to go to my other one"}
{"text":"Ate here Monday night the first time in over four years...and I wish I had not made that choice....Everything has gone up in PRICE...It's like dining at our go to \"real\" Italian Restaurant....Vino's Ristorante at the Cannery Casino in North Las Vegas....But sadly the food and its presentation is NOT the real thing....
....All their real meat enriched entrees are as expensive as  eating in a real Italian Restaurant...my wife ordered Chicken Margherita....like a pizza Margherita! When it arrived it had two skinny pieces of over cooked chicken breast covered with some type of commissary red sauce with pieces of hard to identify over the hill green leaves that I believe was basil...tasted awful...my wife ate one piece of chicken and offered the rest to me....I tasted the saucy...and chose to decline eating her offering (sadly I was so put off by this place I forgot to photograph the \"chicken whatever\" dish.....even worse they only serve breadsticks...and I asked they not be coated with any butter sauce...it arrived and the breadsticks were tasteless....bread should taste good PLAIN! ..... what did I order?  
.......I ordered the dish that should tell how good an Italian kitchen it is.....Spaghetti with Meat Sauce....it arrived in a bowl unadorned with any garnish....probably a sign to other diners around me that I ordered the cheapest thing on the menu....I wouldn't call it meat sauce I would call it a bunch of ground up red stuff with tiny, tiny specks of gray colored stuff that represented the meat part of the dish......it had the taste of lots of ground up garlic mixed with perhaps Italian flavor enhancers...it was a bitter tasting garlic sauce with no redeeming value....what was source was the lukewarm spaghetti.....\"A good Italian Restaurant cooks their sauce in a sauté pan then adds the spaghetti to finish its cooking with the sauce--enhancing its overall flavor....the spaghetti arrived absolutely white with a big dollop of their meat sauce on top...Yuck....the whole meal cost $33 + my 15% tip....I would have eaten better at In-N-Out for $12.00...."}
{"text":"It was ok.
Not more then that.
But. I have to compare Olive Garden to Cheese Cake Factory. CCF was better taste, better quality and cheaper.
 In almost same price  I had two cocktails and two appetizers in CCF. While in OG for 10$ less I he'd no cocktails and only one appetizer.
In both I've bought two slices of cakes and no doubt CCF is winning big time.  There is no reason why to go to OG when CCF is across the street. 
The service was good though in both."}
{"text":"Call it a moment of weakness with a dash of convenience to taste...but, as far as chain restaurants go, you can't really complain for all you can eat salad + breadsticks to the tune of ~$4. Now, hate all you want, but their zuppa toscana soup is tasty and more notably Olive Garden was rockin' kale well before it was deemed a quintessential superfood. Just sayin'. As for the pasta, meh. It's big box (yet recently brand refreshed!) Italian that can't possibly be messed up. What do you expect? For the real thing, go elsewhere obviously. But for easy everyday Italian, OG all day with your chin up! No shame."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this location had quite a few things down.  Polite hostess, efficient & quick seating, good server, and a menu that changes a little every so often.  Soups & salad are dependable, though many of the entrees are heavily American skewed with all of the massive cheese & fried options.  This place has a niche in chain-dining that won't go away - the soup/salad lunch deal, those quirky breadsticks, the chocolate mints at the end, etc.   Lot of family dining here, and across a broad spectrum of demographics.  Never had bad meals at an OG, but nothing spectacular either.  This location though is among the better OG's I've found.  It sure as heck beats many \"local\" places with surly waiters and bad parking."}
{"text":"Always a fan of the breadsticks and salad. The Gluten free menu as far as my gluten free friend was concerned felt it only rated a 3 for choices.  There are @ least 6 dishes to choose from but they only came with penne pasta. She felt there needed to be more choices of gluten pasta to choose from."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my buddy, we aren't from the neighborhood, so somehow we just ended at olive garden. Food was pretty goood, drinks were also spot on. We had Katie as our server and she did a great job, service was good, she was very friendly & even helped us out with trying to find things to do in the area. Overall solid place to get out of the 105 degree weather."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there yesterday for lunch;  I will not be going back.  

Service was horrible.  Lunches came out in different order. (unlimited soup,salad and breadsticks and half panini with soup)  Not an overly complicated order, or so we thought.  We didn't get our breadsticks til the meal was practically done and we only got one refill on our drinks.  The manager picked up our bill which was just as good as I wouldn't have paid for it anyway."}
{"text":"Of all the Olive Garden's I've been to, this one if one of the best. 

It can get pretty busy in the normal eating hours, so be prepared for an average of 10-30m wait. 

But if you come before or after the rush, the service is always great, the food is always delicious, and the wait is always good. 

Some of our servers have been a little hasty, but the hostesses are always so sweet. 

The wines are retarded-ly overpriced ($6.50 for a glass of Chateau St. Michelle Chardonnay when the entire bottle itself is only $5.00 at the Grocery Store??!?, you kidding me?!)

The constant stream of bread sticks and salad makes up for some other prices though, so I guess it works out. 

When we go - we usually get water, split an entree, and either split an appetizer or desert, and the total bill usually comes to around $25.00 for two people. (Which isn't bad when you consider they give you slightly more portions per person when you do a split entree, and all the free yummy bread and salad)."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we were close.  So glad we did.  Excellent service, food was great as were the margaritas!  Won't wait so long before going back, next week sounds good!"}
{"text":"if you are looking for terrific food & great service, this is your stop! we were lucky enough to have KORY H as our waiter & he was the definition of excellent service! he was helpful with recommendations, always made sure our drinks were filled, & brought our food out so quickly! he was very professional, polite & overall had such a pleasant attitude that made our date night so much more enjoyable. he even offered a great moscato wine, which i very much enjoyed! the food was not only outstanding, but beautifully plated. this is my absolute favorite olive garden location!"}
{"text":"This place seriously bothers the hell out of me.  Why?  Well, the 1 hour+ wait times during dinner, is absolute BS.  Unless you are say 60 and prefer dining at 4:00pm- go somewhere else. 

I mean come on, the owner of this place is absolutely brilliant in that he only has one, just one restaurant in all of Calgary, all one million of us have to wait like cattle (fitting isn't it?) to get into this place, SERIOUSLY?  I prefer spending that time waxing my legs to be quite honest.

Then when you do finally manage to get in, you still have to wait a while to get your order taken, drinks take even longer to arrive.  Then to keep you from complaining about the mediocre food, they cram all the free salad and bread sticks down your throat so you end up taking your main home for left overs... I AM SORRY, WHY WOULD I PAY $20 FOR AN ENTRÉE IF I HAVE TO EAT IT THE NEXT DAY!!!!!  

For the love of god, please open another restaurant, you might be surprised that it also would be successful, if people from the far south are willing to drive their asses to the far north to \"dine\" in this establishment, don't you think it is worth the investment?  Just a thought.

PS drive around to the back one day after the dinner rush, you will notice that the majority of the kitchen staff are teenagers hanging out for a dope break.  Nice work kids, nice.

I won't be coming back anytime soon.  Invest in some real staff that probably won't spit in my food if I send it back."}
{"text":"Haven't been to an Olive Garden in quite some time and decided to stop by with my girlfriend. This was the closest location coming back down from up North, so decided to give it a shot. We were promptly seated, but it took about 10 minutes to get water and be seen by our waiter. He immediately seemed rushed and asked if we wanted anything else bedsides water. When we decided on just water, he seemed really put-off and upon returning with our water, asked again if we wanted wine, or another beverage. We both looked over the menu again and I ordered the beef and tortellini and specifically asked for the meat to be cooked medium-rare. When the plate was presented, the beef was cooked well and was not tender at all. The flavour of both our dishes were good, but it was really obvious that my girlfriend's pasta had been sitting under a heat-lamp for quite some time. When it was time for the check, the waiter said thank you and practically threw the check on the table before walking away. I usually tip around, 30%, but that was certainly not the case today. Blech!"}
{"text":"While soulless & culturally exploitative restaurant chains are not exactly my cup of tea, every now and then you gotta just bite the bullet, drop your morals and binge on some unlimited breadsticks and Alfredo.

My trip to this particular franchise in North Olmsted began as every great dinner night out does- hot-boxing the rental car. After sitting in the sweet fog of that devils lettuce for a few minutes, the girls and I headed in.

First course- appetizer sampler with calamari, mozzarella, and zucchini. I recommend all but the zucchini. Too hot and I burned the roof of my mouth, and also they kinda sucked.

But since you are all hard-working and conformist Americans, I'm sure that you have a classic Olive Garden order. This is not something that you need my advice on. However, what I can tell you about this particular franchise is that my waitress was the most caring, interesting, and lovely woman I have ever encountered at an Olive Garden. The restaurant had so many twists and turns I got lost on the way to the bathroom, yet I would do it again in a minute.

If you're ever in North Olmsted, I highly recommend this as your choice for an overpriced chain run by a huge, vile corporation."}
{"text":"Last week I ordered take out. While the Giant Seaford stuffed shells was a hit, I couldn't tell you how disappointed I was with their seafood Alfredo. It was dry with little alfredo sauce and it only had shrimp...for that, I could have just made my own shrimp Alfredo at home."}
{"text":"It's an Olive Garden, service has always been good, food is good but nothing you would write home about. The servers are like any other Olive Garden, either they seem like they've been there for 25 years or it's their first server job. We often get take out from this location and even on busy nights the food is always ready to be picked up in a timely manner. Overall good \"Italian\" restaurant, probably not the one Billy Joel sings about though."}
{"text":"Have to love the salad and breadsticks. Was told 15 min wait and was sat in less than 5. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite location in Vegas, but not the worst. It took us a long time to get our food. That includes our drinks, breadsticks, salad, and soup. Other than that, there's nothing really wrong with the place. It looks great, the food was good, the service was decent. Not a bad visit."}
{"text":"Nice Sunday afternoon meal with my Barbie Doll and Granddaughter.  Food was great and Judy, our server was even greater!  Thank you Judy."}
{"text":"I like eating here since its the nearest and most decent semi formal restaurant from our home. 
They have a new menu which seemed interesting although I ended up ordering 2 appetizers instead! The flatbread should've had more flavor, it didn't taste like much at all.
Besides that, service wasn't all that great either; she kept forgetting things and not checking up on us in a timely manner. 
Maybe out next visit will be better."}
{"text":"Normally love the Olive Garden. This time Friday 5/25 was a gross disaster. Although the food was decent it was way sub par to how I believe the Gardens food should be. First, the sat us (5) at a table small for 4 and we had to pull a chair up to the end of the table. After saying we will wait and hearing from the party before us was 30 minutes. They told us 2hr wait. 30-to 2 hours in 10 seconds. Ordered 5 appetizers, all came out one at a time 5-10 minutes apart. Unacceptable!! No plates for them even after asking for some. No silverware and took 3 minutes to get some while food just sat on the table. Then dinner came out while finishing appetizers with zero room on the table. So the transferred the leftover food to one plate just to have room for the entrees. No salad or breadsticks yet. Exactly 6 minutes into dinner the salad came, with more plates, no room. When the salad plates were delivered they were obviously right out  of the dishwasher, not warm hot! My plate had dried sauce and when asked for another plate the waiter tried to wipe it off and actually ASKED ME if it was ok? No, I don't want someone's leftovers on my hot plate for salad. So to top it off and after having to ask twice the breadsticks came as everyone was just about finished with dinner. It is obvious the branch is very poorly run by management and staff. Not only will I never return after 20 years we may never return to another Olive Garden again. Probably one of the worse dinners ever! If I could give zero stars for this engagement. SAD for a chain this size!"}
{"text":"I am tired of the whiners who give this place one star. It is like clowns  who  shop at WalMart to get the cheapest price, then bitch about the poor service.  It's a chain restaurant people!  For what you are paying the food is good enough.  I wouldn't take a date here, but I do eat there by myself. They  have some good  dishes you can't get at upscale Italian places--who charge $25-$40 for their meals by the way.  You can eat here for $10-$20 and be full. And they give veterans free dinner on veterans day."}
{"text":"My favorite chain Italian eatery never fails, especially when it was paid for after a hard day's work. 


Luckily we went when it was the Never Ending Pasta Bowl time, and ordered the usuals of Toscana soups, bread sticks, and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers. 

By the time my \"Never Ending\" pasta bowl came out, I was full and only managed a few fork-fuls of the alfredo goodness. But alas, coming to a pasta place is more about what I get to bring home and savor the next day !"}
{"text":"i love olive garden! but we don't have any in hawaii! :( i love the endless breadsticks and yummy salad! i just love this place! i come here everytime i'm in arizona!"}
{"text":"I have to be in the mood for Olive Garden-meaning afterwards I have to want to sit on my couch all night in a Olive Garden coma. My husband and I love their breadsticks.  They make the experience.  We always get the Alfredo dipping sauce-before I met him I ate them without any dipping sauce, but once you go Alfredo, you never go back. However, because we *shocking* don't like salads or the soup-we think the dipping sauce should be free! Some waiters have done that for us at the Robinson location, but not all. We stick with our usual meals of cheese ravioli for me and chicken Alfredo for him. Yum. The strawberry mango frozen margarita is also delicious."}
{"text":"I dined at the Olive Garden yesterday with my roommate and his gf.  For a Sunday night, the Olive Garden was quite packed around 6:45 with about a 35 minute wait.  While we were waiting outside, an old man suddenly fell to the ground going up the stairs.  He hit his head backwards towards the cement.  The Olive Garden staff seemed well trained and equipped for emergency.  They handled the situation in calm manner and got the paramedics right away.  I noticed their attention to care, which I knew would be similar once we went inside.

Indeed, the experience was a good one.  Our waiter tried to be a funny guy and crack some witty humor, which I appreciate.  We started off with a Grilled Chicken flatbread appetizer.  My only complain was that it was too cheesy, but I guess that is expected when you use an alfredo type suace.  I got the chicken scampi and my roommate and his got the Tour of Italy.  We all enjoyed our food very much, and it was one of my better Olive Garden experiences.  Its unfortunate of what happened to the man, who seemed to be okay, but I got to see the staff handle an emergency very well."}
{"text":"Went to Olive Garden today with my mom for lunch.  You can't beat the price on their all you can eat salad with bread sticks and soup meals.  Our waitress was top notch. She brought us items before we even asked.  Service was great.  Will definetly come back."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorites restaurants,not anymore, the last couple of times that I visit this place the eating experience has been terrible. From poor service to mediocre food. I will defenitely will remove this place from my reaturant list. is not worth the money."}
{"text":"We arrived and were seated at the same time as a big party, but our service never lacked.  The food is just what you expect from a chain Italian spot.  I tried the tortellini small plate and it was really good and super rich.  The small plate is just enough.  

No complaints here..."}
{"text":"I think Olive Garden is going downhill in general (too many heavy dishes/dishes with cheese in them) but the service was good.  I had the cucina mia white wine and garlic over angel hair.  The sauce was much thicker and cheesier than the other location I normally eat at - not to my taste.  Had the sicilian cheesecake with strawberry, good but still quite frozen.  Also appreciated the warning about paying for the games."}
{"text":"Horrible! We had reservations about 45 minutes before we walked in. On top of that we waited another 45 minutes. The breadsticks and dessert were the only positives. The main dish sucked. I ordered a steak medium and received it well done. With the steak was a side, a very small side of fettuccine Alfredo, that was dry and crusty hard. I've never truly had any good luck at the Olive Garden. So there won't be a next time."}
{"text":"We were seated in the middle of a private room where 7 out of the 8 tables were reserved for a birthday party. It made us so uncomfortable that we asked for boxes to take our food home to eat. I asked to speak with the manager and she told me that \"that's just how they do it\". Apparently to her since people don't reserve rooms it's appropriate to make other customers so uncomfortable they leave. I would recommend eating at any of the other 100 restaurants on McKnight road before going to this Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Excellent service from everyone all the time and food was fantastic. Their chocolate layered cake is to die for! I would order it as a wedding cake, it is that good! Their calamari was not as good as it used to be, it was more strips and not as crunchy but chewy. Their huge salads are great and their stuffed mushrooms were the best I have ever had. Their frozen margarita is very sweet. Their fried ravioli is ok and my hubby loves their salmon."}
{"text":"The best part about the visit was our server! He was absolutely amazing! We ordered the mozzarella sticks as a stater which were the best mozzarella sticks I have ever had! The complimentary sound and salad was delicious as usual! By the time our mains came around though we were stuffed! We all ordered various forms of pasta which was average. It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Of all the Olive Gardens I've been to in the past 12 years, this one is definitely the best. I'm giving it 5 stars not because it's a 5 star restaurant, of course, but because for what Olive Garden is, this one is excellent. My husband and I have been to this location 4-5 times, and every visit has been a good experience, but what prompted me to write a Yelp review this particular time was because of the great service from our server, Bouchra. 

Right from the beginning she was very friendly and polite. From the moment she arrived at our table she saw that we were already ready to order, (we get the same thing every time,) so she took our drink order and food order together. The reason I make note of this is because a lot of times servers will see that you're ready to order, but only take your drink order to buy themselves more time to catch up with something else. So I appreciate that she took the food order right away.

As we were waiting for our food she brought out our salad and breadsticks. We had the salad and breadsticks at our table for maybe 5-8 mins and she stopped by to bring us more breadsticks that were fresh out of the oven. This earned major points with us because who doesn't hate waiting and waiting for their server to come back, and then having to flag them down just to ask for more breadsticks. (Now I do want to mention that at our other visits to this location, the servers have all been very generous with the breadsticks. Everybody goes to Olive Garden for the salad and breadsticks, so I'm glad they acknowledge that and don't try to be stingy!) Anyway, after she dropped off the breadsticks she stopped by our table about 4-5 mins later and asked if we'd like more salad. We told her yes, and she was attentive enough to notice that we hadn't eaten the onions or olives and asked if we'd like her to leave them off. We said yes, and she told us to always ask if we want something left off the salad since they make them fresh for each table, and to let her know if we wanted something extra on the salad. I thought that was very nice of her. 

A few minutes later she brought out our food, and offered to refill our breadsticks again, which we said yes to. She popped by about 5-7 mins later to make sure everything tasted alright, and to make sure there wasn't anything else we wanted or needed. 

Bouchra was a super attentive server who definitely went above and beyond any service we've had at Olive Garden, or any other restaurant for that matter. She was very sweet and friendly and joked with us, but was still very professional. She was an excellent server and we will definitely return to this location specifically because of her wonderful service, making this an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Our server was awesome! Her name was Samantha, we loved her so much my family and I wanted her to work at every restaurant we go to! (I wish)!! Haha
She was very kind and very knowledgable, and if she didn't know something she was happy to ask the chefs about it.
Especially since I have Celiacs and needed a GF item. I had A LOT of questions. And she was happy to put up with them!
The manager even came out to tell me that since they heard it was a gluten \"allergy\" they didn't even cut my chicken on the same cutting machine they use for everything else. So I thought that was very kind of him to come let me know, on what was obviously an extremely busy Saturday night. So I could be assured that what I was eating was definitely gluten free.

Now the only thing that takes away a star, is honestly just for Olive Garden as a whole. Their GF menu is quite pathetic. The only items are either steak, salmon, or marinara sauce. None of which I like. So, not having any other options, is really disappointing. They should really fix that...it's so sad to see everyone else at the table getting what used to be my favorite items.
It did also kind of change the way I viewed Olive Gardens when I found out everything they make is pre-made..,"}
{"text":"Only one in Calgary.
Never visited an Olive garden before ... perhaps trying the one in Forest Lawn is where my problems stem.

I love italian food - but that i dont love is slow service. Thats what I got - even though it looked fully staffed.

Took 20minuntes for the girl to come and take our drink order. My husband was stoked for the \"unlimited bread and salad\" - however, it is only unlimited if the waitress actually brings out more .. which she failed to do.

With only a handful of people sitting down to eat, i would expect much more from the staff.

For the price, the food was ok - but when we go out to eat we want an expierence .. not just the food."}
{"text":"First and foremost, our server Lisa was amazing! We were on a time crunch because we were on our lunch break. She had everything out very quickly and was on top of everything. The food was delicious and the lunch special is cheap and filling! Definitely coming back and sitting in her section!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and terrible manager (Edith) but great server (Craig) 

I dined in a party of 4 on a Sunday afternoon place was not packed. 

Craig was our server, he was friendly and courteous. The food came fast and he did everything he could to accommodate our request.  

Our food was SALTY, over-cooked, or undercooked.  

Craig informed the manager, Edith.  She came to our table without a smile.  We explained the food quality in a very even handed manner.  Told her what was good and what wasn't very politely. She was very dry in her response and didn't offer even an apology.  

The table behind us told their server that the food was terrible but they were hungry so they ate it. Edith the manager was standing in ear shot and did not acknowledge them at all."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii and not having any Olive Gardens here, I always wanted to try one. (thanks to all the commericals) Well my first impression when I walked in was that the restaurant was alil dingy. The feeling and atmosphere wasnt what I expected. I thought it would have more of an upbeat feel to it, like Outback Steak House, Ruby Tuesday's, Apple Bees etc. but once I got pass the quiet, old atmosphere and ate the food, it was so worth it. I had the Capelini Pomodoro which was good, it was $11.75 which included soup or salad. I took the soup and it was great. My mom had the Venetian Apricot Chicken and she said it was excellent and my sister had the Stuffed Chicken Marsala which she loved. I also had a non alcoholic drink Pomegranate Limetta which was superb. The food taste, quality and price will have me going back whenever I'm in Vegas. I gave it a 4 star not a 5 only because our server NATALIA had alil attitude problem. My sister told me the last time they were there, they also had her and had issues. So aside from our server who needs to check her attiude, be more attentive, and learn her menu and act as if she likes her job, I LOVED OLIVE GARDEN!!

P.S. oh the bread sticks were great too! =)"}
{"text":"Food tasted great and was really hot for once but server never refilled soft drink or seconds on bread sticks.  :("}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat great atmosphere, awesome waitresses and waiters I just love eating at the O Garden come by and check them out you will be so glad you did ."}
{"text":"We are frequent customers to the Olive Garden chain. This particular location was on their toes. For a Saturday night dinner, party of 5 we expected to wait for at least 20 minutes. Instead we were walked straight back to our table and we were immediately greeted by our waitress. Sophia was her name. She was kind, friendly and just a downright great server. 

Sophia was right there with hot bread, drink refills as quick as my husband and kids finished their glasses, checked on us often and was sure to let us know if we needed anything she would take care of us.

The food came out and it looked incredible. Just one bite and we were all in heaven. It makes me so happy when food comes out the way you order it the first time. My family is quite picky. 

If you have not tried this OG location I think that you should because you will not be let down, from the front door to the table, to the check it was a very amazing visit and I am happy to share this with the world. 

Thank you Olive Garden for making our dinner experience priceless!!! You certainly out did yourselves. 

Thank you"}
{"text":"I grew up coming to this place. I have never been so disappointed in this place till now. Expensive for no reason. The meatballs tasted like the meatballs from the frozen section at Costco. The chicken scampi was not good. The Marsala was too salty. Salad sucked. Bread sticks will forever be the same. Overall crappy food for the price. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Olive Garden the other nite as we were in the area after some errands- I will say that the menu has improved greatly, although I think that the Olive Garden is a bit over priced for the quality of food. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was great- he was very friendly and attentive. My boyfriend and I shared the lasagna, always a good classic choice, we of course had the ever popular salad and bread sticks to start. Overall our experience was good!"}
{"text":"We had a great time celebrating my dads birthday dinner tonight. The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. Our waitress was great and helpful the entire evening. I ordered the chicken Alfredo since that is always my go to, haha. My dad ordered the cheese stuffed shells and my mom ordered the tortellini with beef. Both enjoyed their dinners and we all had plenty of leftovers for the next day. We also all went with the soup instead of salad. I had the chicken gnocci soup-always fantastic and dipping the breadsticks in kicks it up a notch. I also tried their new blackberry iced tea and it was okay, but not something I'd probably get again. We also didn't get the Andies chocolate mints they always give you before leaving, which I was a little bummed about. But overall everything was great tonight. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Our server was Jennifer C. She was amazing from start to finish. She made sure that my group was happy. She explained the different menu options and suggested favorites to us. She smile and seem like she was happy to be there. I would definitely recommend coming back and asking specifically for Jennifer C. ! MANAGEMENT: Give her a raise (or more hours)!!!!!"}
{"text":"Recently visited Olive Garden with a birthday and was rudely disrespected by our server Amber P... The only reason this review is getting 2 stars is because my water was full and cold .. Other than so, our experience was terrible ... Oreganos would of been worth it"}
{"text":"This Olive Garden has earned my respect and my business for life! Beth the AGM will stop at nothing to make sure you are satisfied with their food and service. She must have checked in on us at least 3 times. Beth is an asset to Olive Garden. All I can say is thank you and I will definitely be back with my family!"}
{"text":"I would definitely suggest you to try out this restaurant. It has good ambience with great food. I usually try the tricolor pasta penne with Asiago garlic sauce (I'm a vegetarian). They don't serve the tricolor pasta now but the other pastas are good as well. Along with the pasta they serve soup and breadsticks. I just love them."}
{"text":"I love Olive Garden. Y'all's commercials and breadsticks are  I dream about ur salad dressing I've never tried ur pasta but it looks like a good time"}
{"text":"Our server was not very friendly and when we did not want a wine taste, left abruptly.  

We did not understand the Friday is a holiday schedule but Veterans Day was Saturday, and she added to the mess. She did not want to wait on us and we would enjoyed another server at this point.

When served the the peach tea, ask about where is the peach\"we have not done that for 5 years\" not in a hospitable tone.  When the antipasti came she dropped it off with out a word.  

I understand your a long time sever, but I have been eating out 40 years and know good service.  

To bad we did not have the host serve us, they were very nice at front desk.

When you set at the table of 6 across from entrance to kitchen you hear corner many many times as the server go in and out, your safety is important but do you have yell it it?

Managers walked by our table many times, but not to talk to us and I would be not writing so much.  It was not that busy.

We have had many better experience at this location last year, they may not want the snow birds back this year."}
{"text":"The food is good and servers are friendly. The manager always remembers our family (we eat here regularly) and is always very nice. The free wine sample is larger then you expect and the food is quick. Love this place! Good for large groups too!"}
{"text":"Generally a good experience. Today the place was PACKED and there was a significant wait for lunch. The food was good and the waitress was very nice.  Prices seem a bit steep compared to comparable restaurants, but I would return none the less."}
{"text":"i came here during lunch time and sat in the bar.. i was greeted quickly and had a great server MIKE.. i ordered off of the pronto lunch menu and was pleasantly surprised how fast everything was out to my table.. great prices on this menu.. i'm a big fan of their alfredo sauce and salads.!! I'll return to this location based off of customer service alone."}
{"text":"I would normally give OG a 3-4.  They are consistently decent, rarely outstanding.  If I want outstanding, there are non-chain restaurants that can fill that need.

But today was different.  We went there for Sunday lunch, party of six, and although it overall went well, it was one of the very rare occasions where my meal was screwed up.  I had a steak off the menu, and since their web site sucks and I can't pull down a menu and find the actual name, I can't name it.  But it had a parm sauce with bread crumbs, came with balsamic drizzled asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes.  The waitress asked if I wanted it medium or medium well, I ordered medium well.  A straight-forward order, nothing custom.

Everyone's food came out, albeit slowly, and I started sawing through my meat.  And I mean saw.  It was tremendously over-done.  I sent it back.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Not only had everyone else finished their meals while I waited, but one couple had to leave.  My remake arrived, delivered by the manager, and I stuck my fork in to it and found it was not over-done.  First bite was great, then my wife commented that it was bleeding.  I know the juice is not blood, but it was very rare, well below medium-well.  I cut another piece and noticed something odd, so I scraped the toppings off and found that the cook (I will not use the term chef since they could not properly cook a small steak) had cut in to the meat to see how done it was, then covered it up with topping.  If they saw it was under-done, why didn't they just continue to cook it?

So I asked again for the manager and explained the situation.  She was very apologetic and It was taken off the bill, a substitution was offered but everyone else was done and I didn't want to detail the other three.  So aside from salad and two breadsticks, my lunch was balsamic-drizzled asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.

My wife theorized a possible explanation.  Since I did not actually send the original plate back, they couldn't see how over-done my original was, and they deliberately under-cooked the replacement.  Perhaps if I'd actually sent the plate back they would have seen it wasn't correct.

To be fair, everyone else's meal was fine.  But I would suggest that if you order steak at this Olive Garden, make sure it is done properly."}
{"text":"Mike our sever was amazing. Great food. Great wine. Will definitely be back. Very soon."}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious, but the staff and management delivers excellent service! My family and I went on a busy Friday night, and put our name on the waitlist. While we were waiting we went to the bar and although the bar was clearly packed, the bartender delivered fast, and friendly service by chatting with us and laughing at some jokes. 

I am very appreciate of the manager Shelly and the server Branden. They were very respectful and understanding of one of our party members severe nut allergy. It definitely eased his mind knowing that they were both sincere and thorough in making sure everything would be free of the allergy. Which is a huge deal because the list of restaurants to eat at just went from 2 to 3. :] 

Branden was a fun server and kept up on refills, was fun, and professional. Management, you have a great server on your hands and we will definitely ask for him when we come back! 

Thank you for making our experience an excellent one. :]"}
{"text":"I think that rating an Olive Garden restaurant is like rating a McDonalds... kind of pointless and at best a 2-star experience along with all fast-food. But I'm kind of blown away that it would have a 4 out of 5 star Yelp rating alongside the likes of Pizzaria Bianco, Postino's, & Cibo."}
{"text":"This location is consistently delicious, every time I've gone with family they were able to seat us quickly even during lunch I don't think we've ever had to wait. The environment is bright and lively, staff is friendly, they hustle and the food comes out quick, hot, and great tasting. It's Olive Garden through and through."}
{"text":"I  guess the one constant that I like to enjoy here for Lunch is the 

All you can eat Soup Salad and Bread Sticks ! I love the Zuppa Toscana. For me if your looking for a great deal on lunch this is It. Here are some of my other favorites. 

 Antipasti (Appetizers)

Create a Sampler Italiano
Choose from: calamari, stuffed mushrooms, fried zucchini, chicken fingers, fried mozzarella or toasted beef and pork ravioli. Stuffed mushrooms prepared with clams.

Shrimp Scampi Fritta (classic or spicy)
Lightly breaded and fried shrimp, tossed with a garlic and white wine butter sauce or spicy cherry pepper sauce.

Lasagna Fritta
Parmesan-breaded lasagna pieces, fried and served over alfredo sauce, topped with parmesan cheese and marinara sauce.

For Dinner its usually the
Tour of Italy
Homemade lasagna, lightly breaded chicken parmigiana and creamy fettuccine alfredo.**

Well anyway you slice it usually comes out good no-matter what you get here. For a chain restaurant its pretty good. Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Tried to get in last Friday but the line was way out the door, parking lot was overflowing and wait time was too long for our needs.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"This review is focusing primarily on the catering services provided by Olive Garden.

I have catered from OG numerous times 
to my work, and I have never been disappointed. For big group meals, OG is a great option. They have a huge selection of catering options so you are definitely always able to find something that will work for your group, whether 10 people or 100 people. 

We often order 1 or 2 pans of pasta, one of the big salads, and soup. They salad comes with their delicious bread sticks. Everyone can then choose what they want and have options. One thing I really like is that the pasta (most of them) comes with the sauce separately so people can decide for themselves how much they want. I personally don't like a lot of sauce when it's a red sauce, but do prefer it slathered on when it's a white sauce, so you can see how this is handy. 

Another huge benefit of OG is that I can place an order at 8:30AM and have it ready to be picked up by 11:15! That's awesome turn around and very uncommon in the catering world. I have had it delivered a few times (I usually just pick up as I am very close) and the delivery folks have always been on time, courteous and friendly. They set everything up very professionally and it looks great. 

And, they really are not very pricey when it comes to how much food you get! Overall, they are a great option and have helped me out many times when I was in a last minute pinch. 

Bonus - They allow you to order individual meals along with catering. A lot of places don't have this option. So if you have that ONE picky person who wants something different, they can choose a dinner meal and it will be no issue what so ever."}
{"text":"Service couldn't have been better! Our server was so friendly and helpful and pleasant. The food was typical of a chain restaurant but the sauce seemed a bit off on the pasta this time. I don't frequent Olive Garden that much but this location was convenient and really clean."}
{"text":"Had date night with the hubby last night. Choose Olive Garden, and oh my goodness was that a good choice. I had chicken parmigiana and my husband got chicken alfredo --- SO GOOD!! And of course the breadsticks and salad were to die for. A delicious meal was accompanied with an AWESOME waitress Laura. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to several Olive Garden locations throughout Cali and two different locations in Vegas. They don't differ much from each other in terms of menu just probably in service. There was a group of 6 of us who dined in during our Vegas vacation and wanted to have dinner prior to us going to the strip. 

The restaurant didn't seemed busy as we've seen empty tables and not much foot traffic while we waited up front. Took a while for us to get a table but when we did we were stuck all the way in the back of the restaurant in the outside extension of the restaurant. We would have preferred the inside dining area as the atmosphere is much more nicer.

What I love about Olive Garden is the unlimited bread sticks and soup they offer as part of every entree. They also offer a wine sample of your choice of white or red. I chose a Rosé ed wine that was really good, considering I'm not much of a red wine drinker. 

Seriously though by the time my entree came, I was already full off of indulging in the awesome bread sticks and 2 bowls of soups. I love that you can try different choices as well. I tried Chicken & Gnocchi and Minestrone, a thick soup vs a soupy soup. I like the Minestrone more than the Gnocchi. But both were tasty and flavorful in their own way.

For my main entree, I chose the Ravioli di Portobello. It was thick and creamy filled with mushrooms topped with cheese and sun dried tomato sauce. It's about $15 for dinner, one of the cheaper dinner menu items. It was so filling that I couldn't finish it as I was already full from the free appetizer items of bread and soup. Overall, I love Olive Garden. You get your money's worth it with decent quality portion meals."}
{"text":"We visited Olive Garden on Tuesday,  and I have to say, \"we thoroughly enjoyed Our meals.\" Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We ordered from the $6.99 lunch menu. My husband ordered the Egg Plant Parmigiana Breadstick Sandwich with Fries, and I ordered the Grilled Vegetable and Cheese Piadina, with ice tea for the both of us. We also had their famous Garden Salad. Olive Garden has been around for awhile, and I think that they will be around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"I always try it every time I'm let down it just sucks my girlfriend with no taste likes it ."}
{"text":"My trips to various Olive Gardens (most in MN) have varied in satisfaction, but my recent trip to this one was phenomenal. We really lucked out by snagging a cafe table in the bar area because it was the height of dinner service with a 45 minute wait for a table for 4 otherwise. The service was great from the beginning. We had waters on the table before we were even settled in, and our unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks came out promptly. The food was great...better than most OG locations. The server kept a close eye on us, and even though he was busy, he communicated very well so we knew we were never forgotten about. In the end, we were done with dinner and on our way out by the time we woud've been seated in the dining room. Can't complain about that! 

Recommendations: Make a reservation if you're going for dinner, or if you encounter a wait...scope out the bar. You just might find an open seat!"}
{"text":"Recently brought home a meal from this Olive Garden and as silly as it sounds the breadsticks were rock hard...which anyone that eats at Olive Garden knows how sad that is...lol and the lid was not placed all the way on one of the meals in the bag and it kind of made a big mess.   I called and spoke with the manager who was so nice,  He sent me a gift card for the meal!  We have eaten at this Olive Garden many times and always had a good experience.  The way the manager handled my \"complaint\" was so unexpected and it was so appreciated!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite on my lunch break. Sat at the bar and was served by a thin dark hair male... Awesome awesome awesome service.. In and out in no time! And everything tasted great!"}
{"text":"I met my niece here who graciously drove up from the University of Arizona to see me as I was in Phoenix for some training.   Since it was her birthday week and I was in her backyard (she grew up in Phoenix), I let her pick the spot.  

She picked Olive Garden.   

At least one knows the food and usually the service will be consistent.

Our waiter was pretty attentive but I chalk that up to my dining partner being a cute 20-year-old.   :)

I don't know that I've ever had horrible experiences at an Olive Garden....maybe I should give the entire chain at least one more star for that."}
{"text":"No no and no took my mother in today for her 81st birthday had a coupon for a free desert... Wouldn't honor it...waited 20. minutes before our server came, 30 minutes for butter then had to have someone find our server....horrible service horrible...keep your free desert"}
{"text":"Hade an amazing dinner with my family last night. Sarah our server was very nice and kept everything we needed refilled and didn't mind that we need lots of cheese."}
{"text":"Our server Trevor was amazing! He was on point on everything; he definitely made sure we were well taken care of! Food is always amazing! Breadsticks were so good with the chicken gnocchi, shrimp Alfredo, scampi Alfredo ... Love it!"}
{"text":"Standard Olive Garden which is nice because you know exactly what you're getting: A-OK food and service. Ordered ahead and still had to wait - but it was prime dinner/pickup rush hour so I guess that's to be expected. 

Wish they had curbside pickup or specific pickup parking like a lot of other chain restaurants provide to convenience customers."}
{"text":"$10 was the price on a double appetizer dish. It is laughable. Three cheese sticks and two mini Lasagna bites. I have a picture to prove it.   My grandfathers single shrimp appetizer was double this size. After sending it back because of its size the staff did comp the dish. At least the waiter was a hoot and I got a few extra mints to fill me up. I wound recommend waisting money on an appetizer here."}
{"text":"Since I can occasionally manage to ruin boiling pasta (hey, I'm not a chef and I multi-task) sometimes we go out to fill up the kids on breadsticks (always a favorite) and salad that I adore.  Some things are always good, (ahem soup salad and breadsticks).  Kids meals are only $6.00.  Although both my girls had chicken tenders with spaghetti somehow my one daughter had a few French fries stuck in her pasta, which she didn't seem to mind even though she generally hates her food to touch.

I had stuffed ravioli which was good and the dinner portions are huge.  I cannot imagine leaving here hungry or being able to eat dessert.  Our service was impeccable and our waitress earned a good tip for checking on us frequently and even refilling a kid's cup before it was empty.  The restrooms were clean, I appreciate the full rack of paper towels and garbage can near the door.  They are automatic flush toilets, so if you have kids afraid of being sucked down the toilet be sure to cover the motion sensor like I have done for the past 11 years:D"}
{"text":"It was busy, we were a large party, but they handled us well. Drinks were refilled promptly, the breadsticks were readily refilled, and all the food came out at the same time and was hot."}
{"text":"So, yah... I'm reviewing another Olive Garden. We came here not of our own volition but it was requested on a very busy day of the year, so we had quite a long wait. Considering how extremely busy they were, the wait wasn't all that bad, screaming babies in the waiting area aside. 

Once we sat down and got our server's attention he, the manager and even the busboy were all very attentive. I give the staff here props for checking up on us regularly and keeping the refills and breadsticks coming. 

The food is still eh. I would prefer soup, salad and breadsticks, but I decided on the peach chicken thing and it was just too sweet and weird. Even weirder that it was served with a pasta topped with alfredo sauce. Just a weird combination for me. 

Overall the meal was ok but the service is really what stood out to me."}
{"text":"I'm by no means a fan of Olive Garden, but I had a gift card burning a hole in my pocket and it happened to be endless pasta bowl time so there's no better time to visit.

We arrived at lunch time and were quickly seated and our waitress arrived to take our drink order. She was very pleasant and friendly. We ordered and our soup, salad and bread sticks arrived swiftly. Our pasta arrived with perfect timing as our salad and soup were being taken away. 

The food was decent. Not the best Italian, obviously. But it'll do in a pinch and you always know what you're going to get. Service was top-notch and we never had to flag down a waiter or waitress to refill a drink or replace a fork. Everyone, including the people who brought out our food and the hostess were warm and friendly. Service is what gets chain restaurants higher marks in my book."}
{"text":"Came here one night while working. The specials are amazing i don't usually get to eat at places like these so its a treat when i do. I get the endless pasta bowl. I get the fettuccini and chicken and switch with shrimp. 

The chicken is so good and chrisp with a breading also the sauce is rich and creamy between the salad and the dinner bread you fill up fast nothing like a full belly for a low cost.

I like sitting at the bar you always get served first and your constantly checked on which is good. But this is a great location and everyone seems to be friendly and it seems clean and I will defiantly be back"}
{"text":"I have been hanging on to my receipt since February because I wanted to make sure I sat down and wrote this interview when I had the time. I never have high expectations when eating at an Olive Garden, but this was one of the best customer service dining experiences I've EVER had.

A friend and I went here for dinner before going to see a movie. We had planned to go to a different restaurant, but it had an hour wait, so OG was our backup. They were crazy busy, but gave us a pager and seated us as soon as they could. We were pretty tight on time at this point, which we told our waitress, Cindy -- and she did absolutely everything she could to get us out of there on time. 

We started off ordering drinks, which the manager herself grabbed from the bar and brought to us (since they were so busy she was clearly jumping in to help and she was so nice). The drinks were AMAZING. The perfect level of sweetness!

Right after we got the drinks -- seriously, maybe 6 to 8 minutes after we ordered -- we both got our food AND it was great. So not only did it come out of the kitchen quickly, it tasted great. Cindy brought our check shortly afterward before we even thought to ask, and we were in and out of there and on time to the movie. 

Even though it was clearly a jam-packed, high-stress night, Cindy was polite and funny, made conversation with us, and provided excellent service. Seriously, we were absolutely blown away by this. Hats off to the management team here, you rock!"}
{"text":"I come back to this restaurant every year only for their endless pasta bowl. This year they got the price down to 11.99 Canadian dollars. Comes with soup or salad n bread sticks...endless of course.

Food is great. I came with my friends and they didn't have all we wanted which was chicken pomodoro. So the following week I came back. They have it!

So it came looks good....til I have to mix it...Uber lots of water so it's runny. 

Other than that it was good. 

Ordered raspberry iced too....yummy....I'm on my 3rd glass...I'm so full now.

Ordered another small bowl of spaghetti with meat sauce...my all time fave.

Anyways, that is that. I gave it a 4 star since the service was great. 1 star less since it was kinda runny sauce but the overall experience is great."}
{"text":"for a friday night not bad!!! service was good and i'm a believer again that good customer service keeps customers happy"}
{"text":"I have eaten at several Olive Gardens around Arizona and other parts of the country. This is one place that is consistent. Their food is always good, it is not great and you will always have to wait for 15 min or longer to be seated even if the place is empty. I am not sure why this is but it is. This time I had reservations and the wait was still about 15 min. We always get the special as it is a good value and it is what I like. It is a good place to take your family for a nice meal and not spend a bunch. A good place to meet a friend and talk. Yes I will return."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several different Olive Gardens in several different states. Most all have the same look and feel. One thing I have a hard time understanding is even when the place is almost empty of people and there are lots of tables you have to wait for at least 10 min to be seated? 
I usually go for their never ending pasta, and salad. Value priced and you can get several different pasta dishes. I have always received good service from very helpful waiters and waitresses. Their restaurants are always clean and well lighted. 
Why the 3? Well.....First their food is good. It is not great. Their choices are limited. Most choices are just a variation on another dish. 

Why should you go. Their food is good and you get great value for your dollar. Just what a lot of us are looking for."}
{"text":"Won't be back anytime soon, service was horrible, food tasted like it came straight out of the freezer, and just an overall poor meal. This location is not a good representation of Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Olive Garden. Or rather, any chain restaurants. My mother however, this is her favorite place to eat.

I can't rave about this restaurant for two reasons, one, I came here while I was coming down with the flu on our way back to Flagstaff. We both ordered the tri-pasta combo and for some reason I was not impressed. The angel hair pasta was short of meat sauce, the tortellini was stiff, and the shrimp stuffed ravioli had bacon inside and out. I'm not a pork eater so this came as a surprise.

Maybe next time. Maybe it was because I was under the weather."}
{"text":"A nice dinner stopover before heading back up the mountain.
I know I mentioned my mother a lot in my Yelp reviews simply because it's all about mom. If mom ain't happy, ain't nobody happy. I'll leave it there.

Olive Garden is my mother's favorite restaurant so this is where we eat more often than any other. Olive Garden should send my mother a gift card for as many times as she dines there or wants to dine at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"What a fantastic dining experience. We popped in on a very busy Saturday night but didn't have to wait too long. Our dinner at Olive Garden (not my choice, mom wanted her OG salad), was more than stellar.
We had the best waiter, Anthony. One of those guys you just want to gag, kidnap, and take home *sarcasm* just for the company. So, I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli and 1/3 of the way into my dish there was a hair eeewwwww. I alerted Anthony who took the matter to his manager, CJ, who makes his way to our table. The total Latin with a beard Jeremy Pivens version. I'm thinking \"Omg! Is this for real! Do we even have enough trunk space for both of them?\" CJ is just adorably charming and ask what I would like and since I was once told that \"people don't want a free meal, they just want a good meal\", I requested another plate. 
As they were preparing my plate, Anthony topped of my wine glass, compliments of the manager CJ. After dinner we left a 40% tip because you cannot put a price on charming gentlemen, at least I can't. As we were leaving we forgot the receipt so I approached Jeremy Pivens' Latin cousin and after printing it out he said, \"Oh, he didn't take off the ravioli? Here, let me give you a gift card you can use on your next visit to an Olive Garden.\" @@! What?!
I'm a stickler for customer service so this was a nice treat. And I wasn't even dressed for cute. I had my casual biker wearing a bandana chic look.
Thank you Anthony and CJ for a wonderful experience. Five stars all day every day."}
{"text":"Since moving to the valley I've had mediocre experiences at the Olive Gardens here. Food can never be complained about but service sometimes doesn't always hit the mark like the food. But last weekend I was completely blown away by our server Jesse and the manager on the floor, a slender young man with blonde hair. I'm sorry I missed his name but he was phenomenal. These two are great examples of \"on point\" customer service. It was a busy weekend with it being Veteran's Day weekend and it was the start of their dinner rush. We went in to celebrate my mom's birthday. Jesse took over as the first server Preston I believe was moved to another section. Jesse was there to make sure we had everything and when my parents, well my mom was being a bit much he was at her beck and call and with a smile. Our table was lacking bread when our soups and salads were brought out and he let us know up front they were bringing out fresh bread. As soon as he saw we were low on salad or bread, he replenished them. My daughter's pizza was missed in the kitchen, after all our food was dropped, he apologized and he let us know what had happened and gave us a time frame of when it was to come out. As soon as he was done talking with us, he stopped the manager on the floor and alerted him of the situation. The manager came right on over and apologized to my daughter and asked for her forgiveness. It was cute and sweet and we appreciated it. I respect a server and manager more when they are honest and apologetic of the situation.  Within a few minutes, her food arrived and we were all good. Thank you to Jesse and the MOD for a showing how customer service should be executed. You are great examples for your team members."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden nothing spectacular, but out of all the olive gardens I've been to the service is pretty good and fast. Usually come for the soup and salad combo or just some simple pasta and salad. Love the unlimited salad, but I'm usually full before I even start my meal."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just order the endless soup and get a couple bowls of Zuppa Toscana - Potatoe and Sausage Soup with Kale has a good combination where it has a little spice but not too much heat.

The endless Bread Sticks are generally warm and soft.

Classic Calamari is always nice and crisp along with a nice sauce.

My daughter loves the Five cheese Ziti which is good and I ordered the Sausage Stuffed Giant Rigatoni which was a nice dish. Service is generally good and food is good quality.

Look out for the specials when they have them like ordering a Classic Meal and taking one home.

Nice chain restaurant, consistent good food at a decent price, will not wow you but satisfy you"}
{"text":"Came to celebrate my boyfriend bday. The employees were hospitable. It was a bit busy but our server was very nice enough to let ask know. She was very helpful til we left. 


Food wise, my boyfriend loved the unlimited bread. Loved my salad. Loved the freshly cooked stuffed mushrooms .  The pasta awesome."}
{"text":"I am not much on rating chain restaurants, so why would I rate this one? Well the lot was FULL, I mean FULL. I think we go the last spot in the lot. Hmmm. I wonder what the wait will be? We got the pager and in a short time - less than one phone call, it went off. We were seated and greeted promptly. The salad and soup were verging on immediate. then the pasta followed without a hitch. That is impressive, especially because this place is big. The tables were jumping, people coming in and out, and it seemed like we had personal chef and waitress. Wow."}
{"text":"My food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time. The breadsticks reminded me of Fazoli's.  Anyone remember that place?  Remember the breadsticks?  Ya, they were stale, dry, and overly absorbent of the saliva inside my mouth.  They were not, however, rock hard, so I consider the breadsticks a wash.  
The salad was heavy on the onions, easy on the ANYTHING ELSE.  I've never seen an onion salad before but I would imagine that Olive Garden could make one without much extra effort.  I don't understand why they don't do dressing either.  Maybe they do and there was just too little on it, but the salad was dry.  So the salad was a fail.  
For the soup, I went with the Chicken & Gnocchi.  By chicken they mean \"chicken broth\" and by gnocchi they mean \"ball of flour dough\".  This was more like wanton soup than anything else.  It didn't taste horrible, just cheap...so only a minor fail.  
I'm still alive, so I did better than I expected.  I figured the worst thing that could happen would be if I got horribly sick and had to take paid time off for a week...that didn't happen either...so another fail.

The whole experience is what got me.  We show up to GhettroCentre with 6 people and there are at least 20 waiting around for tables.  That's fine, it is lunch time.  We got a table and our waitress was decent enough.  Group ordered some sort of appetizers (that I did not partake of).  They brought our drinks.  We ordered our meals.  They brought our salads and breadsticks.  Then they brought us one of the apps.  About 10 minutes later she comes by to check on us...and we tell her we still don't have the other app.  She disappears for a while and comes back and says \"we ran out of chicken so it's going to be a while\"... wait what?  You ran out...but you will...what?  Clone some more?  Sub something else?  What are you doing to make more chicken appear?  We decline the app since our meals are arriving any minute.  Food arrives, everything is normal, whatever.  I was only mildly distracted by the weird outdoor christmas light strings they have draped throughout the dining room.  I survived.

My question is, my soup/salad/breadstick combo was like $6.99.  Everyone else's meals come with salad and breadsticks, right?  So I could have just ordered the $5.34 soup (seriously, that is expensive soup) and noshed on salad and breadsticks without paying for them?  Right?  What is up with that?"}
{"text":"This Olive Garden is more crowded and a little dirtier than other Olive Garden's I've been to in the past.  

Last time I was there, our waiter dropped half of my friend's meal on the floor right in front of her, put some of it back on her plate, and then didn't replace the rest.  This time, we had a really nice friendly waitress.  So I guess it's about what you'd expect from a chain; sometimes the service is good, sometimes it's not."}
{"text":"Olive garden is great. But I definitely come here because Diane. Screw the fact that Olive Garden has good food. Diane makes good, great. 

Listen, listen. I got the beef tortalini with salad and my friend got the Northern tour of italy with salad. Diane lays on the cheese until we drown because we like it like that. :) And... 2 peach teas. But she just knows when we need something without us having to tell her! Bread sticks, more salad. Coma!!! To top it off, when she brings us our doggy bags, SHE BRINGS US TOGO SALAD! AND TOGO PEACH TEA!!!! I absolutely cant.. I'd jump up and hug her if I could. But I'm full. So instead we just leave her a large tip and waddle back to our lives. Thank you Diane!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located across the street from the Chandler mall with plenty of parking spot. It is absolutely clean, spacious and open. Staffs are super friendly and the service is great. We came here for their all you can eat soup and spaghetti and it was soooooooo delicious."}
{"text":"I like the Olive Garden as much as the next person.  This location is normally very good.  Today was a WREAK!!  From entering the doors to a frustrated hostess.  Waiting 10 minutes at 2pm (another customer said the same) and the hostess said it was due to customer service.
I sit, waitress is nice, food COLD and salad dry.  NO I don't have time for you to try again on an appetizer that had no sauce on it, as it should have, and for it to be HOT in temperature.  
This experience made my whole mood change for the bad.  I will think three times before returning to this location.
Still hungry...
Jan. 2017, 3 months later, they gain a star!!  Immediately seated, great waitress and hot food."}
{"text":"We got there around 3:15 Saturday told 15 min for a table, more like 35.  AFTER we ordered we were told there was at least a 45 min wait for food.  No apology, nothing.  I had soup & Salad the other person had alfredo.  Not complicated to pour some sauce on the noodles!  Had to ask for drink & salad/bread refils.  Over 2 hours for an average meal.  It's always slow when we go, but that was just insane."}
{"text":"This Olive Garden was the best Olive Garden I have ever been too ever. The server here was the nicest waiter I think I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was very friendly and prompt. He was alittle late on the drink refills, but thats ok. I wish I could remember his name, we ended up tipping well! If he ends up reading this.. Thank you! You were the only good thing of the whole experience in dining there. 
  My spouse had warned me and reminded me of our previous experience, which was God awful disappointment!! We had waited for an hour and 15 minutes for our food. Once we had recieved it, it seemed as if we were being served the day befores left overs! Which blew my mind because it happened again today, not to us this time but to the family next to us. I was curious and asked the lady, her story was word from word of what had happened to my spouse and myself the previous visit. 
  In the time they took last visit to bring us our food, it gave me a chance to look around and observe! The ceiling was black, I could literally write my name in the surrounding dust, and there are cob webs or \"dust webs\" coming down from ceiling into the artificial green plants on the ledge, which runs along all booths and through out the building. It made me wish I would have brought my cleaning supplies and helped the buisness out. How is this place not shut done by the health department in just that account? 
  Which leads me to today. Some may be wondering..\" Well, why is this person going back to dine if they had such a horrible experience. \" As did my spouse.. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. Its a new year, and as of Feb 17, 2017 would have been a year since we last visited. So.. I thought surely they would have at least dusted. I was wrong.
  My spouses chicken was burnt. The cook (kitchen staff) tried to cover it up by placing the black side bottom down then covered the rest in sauce. Unfortunately it couldnt hide the fact of the taste. 
  I believe they should state that the games are not free. Im glad I didnt play more than two. Or had children with me and my bill be ran up for trying to keep my kids quiet while waiting for over an hour like the last visit. I just recommend to make it clear to the guest what all is being charged to their bill so they wont have any surprises when it comes time to pay. Although I do agree the concept is brillant.
  Overall.. I do have to say Good-Bye to Olive Garden and hello to Minneci's!"}
{"text":"Ordered online takeout.  Pan of ravioli di portobello , tour of Italy , lasagna.  Was excellent food and excellent service. Will do this again.  Highly recommend. Price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Matthew W is FANTASTIC!! Great service, even on a crazy busy night, he was still very attentive."}
{"text":"We, as a family, come to Olive Garden a lot. This time around, my husband and I went for Tuesday dinner. We got the buy one get one meal, an appetizer (fried mozzarella flat cheese sticks) which was super cheesy and warm, soup/salad - I normally get wedding soup and my husband got the salad, and our meals that we chose were fettuccini alfredo and the five cheese ziti dish. For some reason that day, it was delicious! As our meals to take home, I took home the five cheese ziti meal and my husband took the spaghetti and meat balls home. We also tried a new dessert that the restaurant put on the menu called Cookie Butter Cake. Even though the cake was $6.49, It was SUPER delicious. It is has cookies crumbled into a creamy sweet butter that is layered on a vanilla cake with caramel drizzle. I hardly get dessert at Olive Garden, but I am glad that I did. I will get this cake again on another good day for me. 

Our waiter (I forgot his name) was the best waiter that I had at Olive Garden. Very polite, helpful, and anytime he came by our table he made sure that we were set. He offered us the free sample of wine, help with choosing our dessert, and had plenty of nice things to say. 
This restaurant is right up the street from us so we will be back again. This is our go to restaurant since it is close."}
{"text":"Christ Taft is one of the best servers I have ever gotten. I own a few businesses now and growing up I have seen a lot of shitty waiters. Most waiters get bad reviews when they do a bad job but this time Chris Taft is one of those waiters that must get recognition for his great service. I would offer him a job immediately if he ever wanted the chance. He was courteous, respectful, efficient and on point, bottom line he deserves a promotion."}
{"text":"My family and I had gone to this location for a nice Fathers Day lunch. Right away they were backed up, which was understanding. Our server sat us to our table, and right away it started to be bad service. It wasn't the fact that they were busy, it was just that the server was very forgetful. She had forgotten to bring out my cousins Alfredo. After the fact they had brought everyone else's food. Then we had to wait another 20 minutes for his food to arrive. During this moment we had to ask our server multiple times for our refills. She would
Come back with nothing and ask if we needed anything. Which we would say yes we asked for our refills 10 minutes ago. While they brought out our appetizers, 3 of our plates came out disgusting and dirty. We had to then wait for new plates for 10 another 10 minutes. Regardless if it was a holiday or not I would recommend everyone to go to a different location."}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon, fairly busy. After bringing out the wrong meal, we waited another 20 minutes for the correct order to be brought to us. In total I waited 45 minutes from when we sat down until I got my foos. Another oddity was that whenever the breadsticks were brought out there were three. Not a huge deal but strange, as if they wanted us to fight over the other breadstick. 

The food was good as always, but the service was disappointing."}
{"text":"They were 15 minutes shy of closing for the night, but were willing to take my mom and I in to sit down and have dinner, so props to them. My mom and I split the seafood giant manicotti since we weren't too hungry, and despite sharing, were still able to get our own soups. We ordered the potato soup which was a creamy soup with potatoes, kale, and imitation crab. Never thought of putting kale in my soup before, but this soup was a pleasant first. Going back to our order of the seafood giant manicotti, it was a not-bad meal. Be warned though, they will ask if you want cheese on top of your dish, and if you love cheese but don't love love it, put only a small layer since the pasta is stuffed with rich, creamy cheese. The sauce was also quite creamy so it was a little overwhelming. 

The waiter was really nice, though, and was quick to get our orders and constantly checked up on us. He convinced my mom to order their mango martini, which was so good, you couldn't taste any alcohol in it (how my mom and I like our drinks). Good Olive Garden location!"}
{"text":"This place is ....\"COZI DELIZIOSO!!!\" (Psssst....thats how you say so delicious in Italian-fyi!) I have always enjoyed pastas and a nice glass of wine. Olive Garden has a great ambiance that provides a nice little Italian feel. The moment we walked in, we were instantly greeted, despite the many people waiting to be seated. They put us on the list immediately & we were seating in less than fifteen minutes. As we waited, the hostess did ask if we'd like a beverage, but we politely declined. They also have a nice little policy regarding waiting, it says \"if you are waiting for a table & order a glass of wine, its half off.\" I thought that was cool!
Our waitress was very prompt once we got to our table & she provided great customer service. I love that they offer lots of cheese on whatever you order. I had the traditional spaghetti with meatballs along with a salad. My fiance ordered the lasagna with a soup. Both were delicious & their breadsticks are hard to beat. Love those things! I would recommend Olive Garden to anyone who wants a yummy Italian meal with great service!"}
{"text":"Watching my calories like crazy and I couldn't be happier to have the Olive Garden accommodate my low calorie lunch! Ordered the Chicken Piccato dinner for lunch. It's 530 calories and comes with two pieces of chicken as well as zucchini in a bread crumb and Parmesan crust. Oh. My. Goodness. 
It was delicious. I couldn't believe the size of this meal. I was legitimately full after only eating half of the meal and a serving of Minestrone (110 calories). 

I am very pleased with Olives Gardens calories for their light menu options. I look forward to returning. The service was excellent. It far exceeded what I previously expected from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Since high school have been going to Olive Garden specifically over the years just for the soup and salad the zappa tuscana is my fav still til this day, i came here today for the italian margarita i am a fan of them even tried making them at home but its just not the same, i ordered my favorite soup as mentioned along with the fried zucchini bites which are delicious!"}
{"text":"Trying to avoid rush hour traffic on 77 is what lead me to choose this restaurant. I wanted to wait a while before getting on the highway, so my friend and I chose this place. I've eaten here before, no complaints. It's definitely not my forte, but she was in the mood for breadsticks so the decision was made. 

My shrimp Alfredo, accompanying soup (the one with dumplings and chicken) tasted fine. My friend was very disappointed with her chicken Parmesan. It was tough and very crispy. She loves chicken parm, and is not a nit picky person, so if she complains there is a problem. The appetizer duo of calamari and fried mozzarella had only 3 small triangle slices of mozzarella.

To add insult to injury, the breadsticks she was dreaming about all week were hard on the ends and bottom. There was 1.5 breadsticks left on the table. That's a FIRST. She didn't even want to take any home.

The service was fine, everyone was friendly. I only wished I had chosen to deal with rush hour traffic and gone to eat at Cowfish like I had wanted. It won't happen again. Enjoy the $60, OG- it's the last you'll get from me."}
