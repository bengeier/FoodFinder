{"text":"COME FOR BROS, NOT TACOS. As soon as I stepped foot into this restaurant (albeit accidentally) I thought \"ok, not bad.\" I sit down at the less than half empty bar, expecting the dinner and post-happy hour crowd to stumble in. Oh and they did. Not just any crowd, but the pride and breed of the bartenders themselves. It was their kind, their people, their bros. The bartenders begin to have tunnel vision with their fellow brosevelts, ignoring me and the rest of the patrons. At Vida Vida, when not asking for your order, you can find the bartenders checking out their own biceps. 

Finally, I get my order in with my food. I'm hungry, so I order a lot...which apparently gave me bro-points. My order comes after 39 bro highfives with the bartender and his people. At this point, I'm surprised my dinner utensils weren't protein scoop spoons. The ground beef was as fake as the bartender's hookup stories. The soft tortilla shells were as dry as the bartenders spell. The queso made me miss my mom. The fish taco dissolved in my hands just like the hopes of me ever eating at this place again. You think that's the spicy salsa causing your ears to throb? No, it's the beat of the classic, authentic Mexican music from artists like Rick Ross and Drake molesting your eardrums. Internally fighting over how to proceed eating, I have to further battle \"CHICKS DIG THAT BRO\" statements being exchanged beyond the bar. This place is a gas station for douchebaggery. The only Mexican-like experience was hearing the hyena-like laugh from the bartenders and brobots I feel as though the bartenders and their species are one vodka Redbull away from a bench pressing contest. I'm never one to complain about profanity, but the bartenders shout obscenities as if they're Life of Pi trying to flag down a plane. I don't know whether to leave or to sit and observe, but I have to get my check...which is difficult under brocertain circumstances. I'm in a brohold. If you're in this situation, give your strongest flex to the bartender. That'll grab their attention. I finally leave, able to breath, and instead of smelling like a fajita, somehow I smell like the Polo Black cologne the bartenders bathed in.

Instead of stars, I give Vida Vida one flexing arm emoji.......or 5 JagerBomb stars, depending on if you're a bro."}
{"text":"My son and I went to Vida Vida Friday evening. It is a very laid-back restaurant. You seat yourself and you can even fill out your order using a notepad at the table. I don't know if people ever actually do that. We just utilized the services of our friendly server. We ordered nachos with beef as an appetizer and two tacos each. I chose the Red Chile Chicken Taco and the BLT Taco. My son chose the Red Chile Chicken Taco and the Taco of the Month, which was a Southwestern taco. Our server asked if we'd like the nachos first and I said we would. Oh well. Everything came at once. That's really not a big deal to me, especially since it was all ready so quickly, but I know that's an issue for some people. 
I was immediately disappointed with the nachos. It consisted of a large pile of chips with a small scoop each of beef, pico de gallo, and guacamole. The queso was not visible. There were several abnormally large slices of jalapeno which needed to be cut up to be reasonably edible. The taste was wonderful but it was ridiculous that my son and I got about 4 chips each that had any topping. I asked the server if she could bring some more of the toppings to go with the rest of the chips. She sent the manager. The level of customer service we received was exceptional. I tried to make it very clear that I was not upset at all. I simply wanted a bit more topping. I wasn't looking for anything to be discounted. The manager was extremely considerate and understanding. He offered to send an entirely new order of nachos. I assured him that was not necessary, but he insisted. He was bothered that our dinner at Vida Vida had been less than perfect and wanted to make up for it. Again, this was unnecessary, but he wanted us to leave having had a wonderful experience. He really cared about that and it was very nice. He sent new nachos, which were perfectly done and when we got the check, we saw he had discounted our bill. This manager went above and beyond and because of how well we were treated, we will definitely be back.
As for the tacos... the Red Chile Chicken Taco was wonderful. My son and I both enjoyed that one. He said the Southwestern taco was not very flavorful. The BLT taco was not great to me but simply because the bacon had a strong \"smoked\" flavor and I don't care for smoked foods. It probably described it on the menu, but I just saw \"BLT taco\" and went for it. I also ordered one of their specialty drinks; an Orgasm #8 or something like that. It was very fruity and quite tasty. They could be rather dangerous. lol
Overall, the food is pretty good, but being treated like your business is appreciated is something special. Based on our experience, I will be back to try the other tacos and drinks and get some more nachos."}
{"text":"The food was good but a little pricey.  Unfortunately I had the worst waitress  I've ever had in my life.  It was like I didn't exist and left me feeling pretty disappointed.  When I wait 15 mins and then flag down another waitress to ask her to find you so I can get a drink refill, you aren't doing your job."}
{"text":"Had the 6 taco platter Friday evening. Got 3 different tacos all so bland that we couldn't tell the chicken tacos from the fish. OK atmosphere - a band was getting read to play as we were leaving at 9:15 but can't comment on them. I don't like giving bad reviews but just had to warn others. Cannot recommend for the food, atmosphere, service or prices."}
{"text":"Hands down the absolute worst margarita I have ever had. There was so much sour mix it burned my throat and gave me heart burn which ruined the rest of my night. On top of that it was $11. Very limited drink menu and over priced."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite taco place.  They're not authentic, but the buffalo chicken tacos are my favorite!  We always start with the queso dip and then 2 tacos each.  The bill is always near $20 - not bad."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving Vida Vida 2 stars is because the food (if you ever manage to get it) is rather delicious and well priced.  The Fried Chicken Taco is one of the best tacos I've ever had, and better than any of the tacos on Vida's menu IMO.  

The service however, is atrocious.  The concept here is that you sit down, fill out a slip of paper with your order selections, the waitress takes your slip of paper, and then brings you what you ordered.  Seems pretty simple huh? Well apparently it is much harder to keep track of pieces of paper and enter orders correctly than one could ever imagine.  I've been here 4 times and during 3/4 of our visits, someone in our party either had their entire order lost, or the wrong items entered.  The waitress' have never been apologetic or attentive and all seem like they stepped out of la la land. As a former waitress (for 8 years) I know we all have our bad days, but these ladies have all had bad months, and their aloofness doesn't help.  

I want to be hopeful about the future of Vida Vida and attribute the terrible service to the fact that the restaurant is new, but there are only so many times you can go to a place and continue to be disappointed before you don't go back anymore."}
{"text":"Not anything special. Dont know if it was that certain day but it smelled really bad in the establishment. Hopefully they step it up, their food is very bland. Spice it up give it some taste!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and really cool scene! I travel to TX a lot, and thought these tacos were just as good (if not better) than what I seek out when I'm there."}
{"text":"Best Friend and I decided to attend the Craft Crawl last night, with Vida Vida being one of sponsors as well as she wanted to try it for the first time we decided to go. The waiter whom was really nice but unfortunately he had NO support. Her friend came out first and I waited anthoner 10 min for mine which OK we have worked in the restaurant field so we understand, until the party next to us received their food within 10 min of sitting and ordering as well as all together."}
{"text":"The $3.50 fried fish taco I got was, disappointing. The fried fish was more like a fish stick that had been microwaved. The taco was smaller then expected. Carnitas taco had no flavor. The queso we ordered was pretty much cold in the time it took to get from the kitchen to our table, which wasn't long, it was just low quality queso. If you're from the south where you can get quality tacos, don't go here. If you're from anywhere else, you've probably never have a good taco and won't know the difference, so this place will probably be ok to you. Lastly, the whole place smelled like the air freshener found in the bathroom. It was a nice smell, but very much overpowering and not what one typically wants to smell when eating."}
{"text":"Your mom would love this place. Stopped in for a snack. Chicken quesadilla, Mexican Tots, what-what! Cans of Stella Artois I was not disappointed. Def come back."}
{"text":"Awful Awful Awful. Service was just as bad as the food. Ordered a chicken burrito and had about four pieces of chicken.  Rice was very very dry. You can eat better at Taco Bell. So that should sum it up."}
{"text":"So I have been to Vida Vida three times now. Once just to drink and twice to eat. The atmosphere is super laid back and chill with some good outdoor seating. Everything is a la carte.

Drinks: They have decent drink specials. I had there margarita just once. Super crazy sweet....havent ordered it since and have just stuck with beer the rest of the time.

Food: For appetizers, I have had the queso and guac. The queso is actually really good, it's like a chipotle tasting queso. The guac was good as well, though the serving may have been a little small (though, it could be that Im just a guac freak and never can have enough guac!!!). For tacos, I have had (between various visits) the philly taco, the Carnitas taco, and a fried fish (or maybe it was chicken, who knows) taco. The philly is by far the best.....super yummy!

Overall, great place to eat at in a relaxed atmosphere with good prices. All of which is hard to come by in the Epicenter!"}
{"text":"Tried 4 different tacos. Shredded beef, Philly cheesesteak, fried chicken, buffalo chicken. The buffalo chicken was good... the shredded beef was okay. The churros were okay they didn't seem homemade and the chocolate sauce was terrible. Overall friendly service, cute atmosphere, and the food was okay."}
{"text":"I appreciate that their kitchen stays open so late! Fun chill vibe in the epicenter when you need some drunk Mexican food. Everything is decently priced with enough options available to please everyone. Ordered the totchos and my only complaint is that there was hardly any cheese on them. Believe me, I don't even like cheese that much so for me to say this, it definitely means something. Nice enough service for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Went here late night before a night out.  The music was great and the tacos weren't bad.  I had the two chicken tacos and both were pretty flavorful.   The service was was pretty good as we ordered and for our food pretty quickly.  Definitely love the fact that the street is very visible so it was fun to people watch.   My only complaint would be the margarita,  it was sort of expensive and not that strong.   But all in all I would probably stop by again one day."}
{"text":"A group of us came last night before the Hornets game. In One sentence, it is a good thing their food is decent.

The waiter did an okay job, except it was fairly busy for a Wednesday evening, and he was one of the two bartenders. It seemed like the restaurant had a business event going on, and the waiter had lots of drinks to make. He took our order, brought our food, and refilled our drinks once. Speaking of which, the water that he used to refill our original cups with was disgusting- it tasted like it ran through the Sprite line four weeks ago. He never came back around for us to tell him we needed more. In addition, we had to go to him at the bar to get our bill. Again, not necessarily his fault but if management knows they have an event to cater, they should probably get a few more people staffed. 

I used the bathroom, which was dirty with toilet paper everywhere. And there are only two bathrooms, a single women's and single men's. The weird part is that the room is big enough to have at least two stalls, which I found to be a weird decision to have singles in the epicenter. 

At least the food was decent. I had a carne asada quesadilla. Nobody else had complaints about food either. It sucks that the service and atmosphere wasn't great but... oh well. We'll find another place before the next game."}
{"text":"I feel like a rookie for not knowing that Vida Cantina & \"Vida Vida\" are two separate restaurants. Thankfully someone showed me the error of my ways because Vida Vida is a great place for a quick and cheap Mexican lunch!

Per my server's recommendations I tried a Fried Chicken Taco & a Philly Cheesesteak Taco. He wasn't wrong, they were both pretty darn good. I think The Fried Chicken was probably the better of the two though ... the jalapeno bacon set it off! If you're feeling extra hungry, go for three. Ordered with a side (pretty small) of rice for only $.50 made it a complete meal. 

$6.50 for two pretty good size tacos and a side of rice is a great lunch value in my book, especially in Uptown and especially in Epicenter. I'll definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Vida Vida several times...just never wrote a review. Friends & I usually go for the tacos...but the burritos are a good choice too. I usually order Philly cheese steak, fried chicken and veggie tacos. The guacamole is fantastic...I always ask for a small side.  The red chicken chile taco was blah...zero flavor. I think they should bring back the option to purchase two or three tacos, instead of the combinations they created. They have a wide selection of tequilas, yet the bartenders aren't very knowledgeable about them. On one particular visit, I asked for shots of Casa Noble. The bartender went to another area of the restaurant and came back with two shots of something that wasn't Casa Noble. Yeah, I'm a tequila snob...it's ALL I drink. So when I schooled him on the swill I drank, he looked surprised.  Since then, I only order the margarita & sangria swirl. Delicious, sweet and tart brain freeze in a cup! All in all, it's good food, just a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"TACOS!

Pop in here day or night for a great casual atmosphere, and some seriously good tacos.  Their kitchen is shared with Vida Cantina next door, so all the food is great quality, and it tends to come out pretty quickly.

There's occasionally live music or a DJ posted up at the front of the restaurant, and when the weather is nice, they'll open up the garage doors to the patio. 

Stop in with a friend or two and have a couple Tacos, a frozen margarita and a beer.  If you're really hungry, get the chips and guac, and split the taco platter with a friend.

I haven't had them all yet, but my favorites are the Fried Chicken and Carnitas tacos.  They're served on small tortillas with just the right amount of meat and vegetables, and go down easily.  The price is pretty fair, too.  Best taco spot uptown for sure!

TACOS!"}
{"text":"This is just not my week for tacos. The speed of getting food in a fast casual establishment brand like this was abysmal. Management seems to be absent.

Monday catch up lunch with 3 friends to meet at 11:30 am. Most of us are there by 11:40 am, we get a table, the waitress brings our drinks. Ordering is sushi style, that is a pad of paper and pencils, and one marks the number of each item you want, and order everything all at once.  I ordered a plethora: Chicken, Fried Chicken, Carnitas, and Veggie Tacos. Plus churros, I was hungry. At $3 each is what a taco should be. There is a platter special of 6 tacos for $17 but one is limited to 3 choices and I wanted to sample flavors.

Waitress comes by and collects our orders, my receipt says 11:57am. Our late friend arrives just after noon, he gets his order in about 12:10.

Around 12:20pm guess which item comes out first? Guess. The churros! One has to wonder how it takes 20 minutes to make fried dough rolled in sugar. It's worse the dessert came first. Food finally arrived around 12:30. We were all so hungry we tore into it, so I'm not going to have a lot of nuance to say. The carnitas were moist, and a stand out among what was ho-hum and coldish. All came on corn tortillas.

Waitress came by to ask how our order was and apologized for the churros coming out first when she brought the checks at 12:43pm. If someone had come out and said hey Vida Cantina's kitchen was slammed I would have understood but being left waiting on such a simple meal is terrible."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing... Quest was good but tacos were not... Meat was all dry and flavorless. Bar was dirty and bartenders were too busy on their phones to bother helping us clean the bar. Margaritas are nothing to talk about and served in a cheap plastic dollar store cup. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"It sucks I have to drop this review down to one star because of one person but that is how bad our server was. I love vida's food and am always excited to go there when I have the time but I am definitely second guessing that after this visit. We went in for a quick bite to eat because it was getting late and we needed something quick. It should've been a sign when we walked in and there was only one person serving people who was also the bartender. When we sat down it was only us and two other tables one of them which she was standing around flirting with. Initially I thought nothing of it because I have served before and know how people's styles are different depending on the guests you are catering too. However, we had already been sitting there for maybe 30 mins before she called an employee from the back to take our drink orders.

I started getting hangry and just went ahead and ordered the nachos to start, but as long as it took to get to our table I had already changed my mind on ordering anything else and made adjustments as to what I would eat after leaving here. Luckily, my boyfriend and I had the company of each other to keep us busy and distracted, but the chance to redeem herself came when it was time to get the check and she miserably failed. She came to the table to suggest other menu items, but keep in mind at this point we had already been there for an hour and it was obvious they were about to close because they locked the doors so no one else could come in. I politely denied the suggestion and asked for our checks.

Instead, of going to print out the piece of paper needed to review my bill and authorize my card she chose to go back to the table she was flirting with (the next table beside us btw) and continue to flirt asking about things they could all do after she got off and how her night was going. She complained about how she had been \"busting her a**\" for people all day but I promise you I could barely tell by the efforts she gave us. Our check didn't come until another 30 mins later and let's just say by the time everything was said and done I was so relieved that my part was over with and I could run out of there with a slight chance of still getting food somewhere else. So, dirty blonde chick that worked at Vida last Friday 4/27 they can thank you for assisting in them losing a loyal customer."}
{"text":"meh, exactly.  bar was gross and sticky.  waitstaff could not even care less that we were there.  magaritas were so-so and served in a plastic small cup.

burritos were just OK but nacho cheese on top of it wasnt exactly pleasant.   chips and guac were pretty good

i got two sets of silverware that had food crusted on it.  made me really wonder how clean the kitchen food prep was

my buddy wanted to go make himself sick afterwards to get rid of the burrito.

not being from Charlotte I have to think this is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Mexican food choices??"}
{"text":"A large group of friends and I ended up at Vida Vida after unsuccessfully finding a sports bar in the area to watch the big Panthers playoff game. The place had a large number of tv's and seemed to have a laid bad atmosphere. 

We were greeted promptly and the staff helped us put together a few tables to accommodate our party. We all ended up getting some drinks and food and were surprised when they handed out free mini footballs during the game!

The food was decent for fast casual tacos, though the taco salad was lacking in lettuce and the chip plates were way more chip pieces than full chips. The drinks were decent though there were no beers on tap, only in cans. Selection was ok though. 

The best part of the trip here was the service. Our waitress, Katherine, was probably the best server I've seen in a couple years. She was incredibly friendly and made sure our table was never low on food or beverages.

Would definitely go back here, especially if the service remains A+."}
{"text":"Wish I could have even tried their food. Went there for lunch and it took 7 minutes for someone to even notice us at the door. Then the waitress came and dropped off menus but never came back. After 15 minutes we left. They really need to improve on their service."}
{"text":"Cheap tacos, pretty quick service. Great dinner spot on a Saturday night before you go to EpiCenter to parlay. Jackson the bartender was very friendly, and attentive. No complaints at all, very chill vibes!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for an event called Bundts n Bites. I only had a strawberry margarita from Vida Vida - the rest involved samples from Nothing Bundt Cakes, however the service and atmosphere of Vida Vida was great. Erin was super sweet as well as the bartender (I didn't catch her name). The menu looked good and reasonably priced, especially considering it's uptown. Will definitely have to come back again to try some food."}
{"text":"The service was abysmal, the portions were very tiny considering the price.  I'd rather pay  a little more at the real Vida."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. Yes I do, from the beginning. Because that's when things went wrong. Our waitress (#1) took our order (2 drinks, chips and queso), no big deal. A few minutes later her shift ended so she brought another waitress (#2) over to us and introduced our new waitress. Great, no problem. Except less than 5 minutes after we get transferred, our new waitress gets her purse and walks out. I mean I'm not one to judge a smoke break. Whatever. Except this 'break' lasted 15 minutes and after realizing this chick was not coming back, I had to go to the bar to order another drink. The bartender seemed baffled, rightfully so. He was now having to do her job. 

The bartender brings me my drink, the waitress is still gone. I really thought she had completely peaced out! We ordered another drink, and eventually this girl strolls back in like its nothing. She comes up to us after walking around the room for awhile, completely oblivious to the fact that she was failing at her job. 

Fast forward, all of the girls working at the taco bar decide to put together a World Cup cutout. The kind of thing where you put your face in it and take a picture. There were FIVE of them working on it. Working so diligently that they were ignoring the customers. Including the 2 nice women who sat next to us and waited for at least 10 minutes, and eventually got up and left to get a waitress from Vida to try to help them. I even notified one of the waitresses that 2 customers had left because they were ignored. 

The real kicker comes when I decided that after all of that, I had to try some tacos to see 1) what they tasted like and 2) how much worse it could get. Disclaimer, I filled the order sheet our wrong. But after waiving down the waitress/female bartender, explaining that I did not in fact want a platter, just two tacos, she agreed and went on her way. This is also a different waitress (#3) than we originally had, that one (#2) was still working on the cardboard cut out. 

The food comes, guess who is served 6 tacos? What in the world am I going to do with those? So then waitress #2 (the one who left the restaurant, not the one who took the taco order) came over and asked how everything was. I said you know the tacos are great buttttt we didn't order 6 of them. I explained what happened, she says 'oh so you didn't want these?' We said no, we just can't eat that many. She picks up the tray with the remaining 4 and walks off. I know we didn't want to pay the $17 for 6 tacos, or even eat that many, but common restaurant courtesy is that if you bring out the wrong thing, you leave it. Considering the hassle of the entire situation, it seemed reasonable. I guess not?

Okay so the pluses? The fried chicken taco was good. The male bartender was SUPER nice and receptive when I asked him to go light on the agave in my marg. I am a Texas girl who just wanted some queso, margaritas and tacos. I think that male bartender was the only one competent enough to even be working there. Vida Vida, your potential is there but your staff lacks basic restaurant skills."}
{"text":"Seriously???? We ate there last night before the Jeff Dunham show, the service was quick, the place is very casual and the food was ok.  Tacos were actually very good, the burrito was decent, the nachos is where the problem comes in.  My 70 Yr old mother ordered them, they came out with a lot of toppings, which was good but once she ate the top then she was left with a lot of dry chips, no cheese.  I had already paid the check because we were in a hurry but she asked for some extra cheese and he said that'll be $1.50, she explained there wasn't enough on there in the beginning and he still said $1.50.  Well that lost them 4 customers, not worth going back for that kind of service."}
{"text":"Several co-workers and I ate here tonight as part of our business trip. The place was just a short walk from where we were staying and was busy when we got there. We didn't have to wait long for a table and the server was great. She paid attention to every little detail and kept our water glasses filled during the meal. The chips and salsa, guacamole, and queso dip were excellent and we all said we could have made a meal just from those and the margaritas. I ordered the garlic shrimp because I saw a favorable review on Yelp form someone else who liked it, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. The sides I chose were the fried plantain and it was good, but I only had two pieces on my plate and everyone else quite a bit more. The corn dish was great, too. But the star of the plate was the garlic shrimp. They were large and very flavorful. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good vibe, awesome outdoor terrace for people watching the funny stuff that rolls down Trade...myself included. 

Shrimp jalapeño taco is a must have, chips & salsa get the thumbs up b/c the chips are salty & salsa is spicy, carnitas taco was decent too. 

If you love tequila they have one of the best selections in the city."}
{"text":"I've had quite a few work lunches here and let me tell you it is a great value for the quality of food you can get from a quick service type restaurant.  I also feel like this place is on the rise given the head chef and management.  They are really revamping the menu and adding to the culinary creations here.  Make sure to try some of my favorites:

1.  The Sloppy Joe Taco
2.  Pork Belly
3.  Hawaiian
4.  Mole Taco
5.  Shrimp Gumbo

They are always changing and adding to the craft taco creations here but you will not be able to get a better selection of Margaritas and tacos in uptown.  Enjoy, I know I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice before games at Time Warner - while it's nice to have a sit-down fast casual place in EpiCentre besides Moes, I wish the experience and food was better. All the taco's tend to be bland, which is odd given that Vida makes some solid food. Worse, they aren't a good value - two people really can't get a meal and drinks under $30 there, which seems a bit much for mediocre taco's, canned guac, and average service."}
{"text":"We were in a hurry for lunch so stopped in for some tacos. We love Vida Mexican Kitchen and figured it's sibling nextxoor Vida Vida would be just as good. 

The vibe is very relaxed and a seat yourself situation. Some of the menus needed a wipe down. Service was okay. I missed the automatic serving of complimentary chips and salsa. The menu is simple and items you would expect to see like tacos and burritos. 

I ordered a surf and turf taco combo which is a shredded beef taco and Asian Shrimp taco with a side of rice and beans.  The beef was good but very greasy which I found surprising since I've had this next door and it was my favorite.  The Asian Shrimp had a good flavor with a little heat and fruit salsa. Rice and beans were okay. The rice seemed dry and both looked like they had been sitting out for a while. 

Our server only came around a couple of times and my drink was never refilled. They did however get us in and out quickly. 

Now I know if I have more time to go to Vida Mexican Kitchen instead."}
{"text":"I came here during lunch time for the first time where it's located at the epicenter. 

It has a nice atmosphere with the outside patio and TVs located everywhere throughout. The service started off good but went down here from there. I only ordered three tacos but it took nearly 20 min to receive my food. When I finally received my food, it wasn't as great as the pictures make them look. In my humble opinion, they were lacking in flavor. Overall, my experience here was just Ok."}
{"text":"Street tacos are amazing. Service is on point and if you catch live music you have hit the trifecta."}
{"text":"I stopped by Vida Vida during a short visit to NC this summer and I was impressed. Their frozen margaritas were pretty good, I also tried their frozen sangria which I did not like. It tasted like frozen red wine but the bartender was kind enough to comp the drink at the end of the night. Their tacos are out of this world delicious, the ingredients are fresh and tasty. I love how authentic the flavors were and I am definitely looking forward to my next NC trip to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a group on a Sunday evening and was pleasantly surprised. I only recognized one of the bartenders, so maybe they have cleared out some staff since my last visit. This time around our server was on her A-game and the food was what it always should have been. I'm happy to say Vida Vida has somewhat redeemed itself from a handful of poor experiences."}
{"text":"Just ate at this place for the first time and to say that it was awesome and I will be coming back would be an understatement! I loved it the tacos were original and with really fresh ingredients. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable I only wish I had gotten his name to ask for him next time. I will certainly be back sooner than later and am looking forward to trying new tacos and taking advantage of the great daily specials:)"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for lunch today. I frequently go to Vida next door and have always received great service and food. Unfortunately this is not the case for their sister restaurant Vida Vida. I waited for 10 minutes before I was greeted by my server. I gave her my food and drink order at the same time hoping this would expedite the process. After waiting for another 15 minutes, I still had yet to even receive the water or chips and salsa I ordered. I finally just walked up to the server and asked her to cancel my order, to which she responded \"ok that's fine\" and walked away from me. Needless to say, it will be a while before I'm willing to try this place again. If you want great Mexican food in uptown Charlotte, save yourself 25 minutes of being ignored and just go next door to Vida."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite restaurant uptown! The location is top notch but the service is the polar opposite. I had lunch with colleagues here today and we were hoping to have a good meal but we were met with fruit flies in our food. It took us 10 minutes to flag our waiter down to report this issue. The manager gave us all 15% off coupons for our trouble. I will never go back to this place!"}
{"text":"I went here while visiting charlotte.  The menu is not very big and the food doesn't have a lot of taste. Me and a friend both ordered a chicken burrito and they turned out completely different.  A can of blue moon was $5 for a can, which I thought was kinda high. I probably wouldn't visit here again,  would be a good place to go if youre drunk though."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. The wait staff was slow to notice me and my party were even there. They had one poor girl doing all of the order taking. They were pleasant people don't get me wrong just super slow. I took my own order. The food needs more seasoning. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I came here one night to eat with a friend of mine the guac was ok the tacos was average I enjoyed it"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Vida Vida a lot more than I actually did. I was excited for some great tacos and sadly didn't get great tacos. I got the Philly Cheesesteak and the Chicken tacos and found both to be vastly underseasoned. I gave up eating them before I was finished because I felt so bored with the flavor. 

All was not lost, though. The queso was wonderful and easily among the best I've had. I'll be back for the queso alone, and hopefully the tacos will have a bit more flavor on my next visit."}
{"text":"Decent food here and decent drinks. As far as Mexican food goes, it's not exceptional and it's not horrible.  After a couple visits, I've come to expect a nice experience.  Just want out for the people at Rooftop 210. Sometimes they like to throw drinks on people sitting outside at Vida Vida."}
{"text":"Had the 6 taco platter... waiter was friendly n helpful, didnt mind i had low carb tortillas to rewrap :) tacos and light beer was just the thing for me, my buddy had a fish tank...but it was way too sweet and couldnt taste or feel what alcohol was put in there ..the volume of koolaid vs alcohol for 20.00 is way off..reminded him of the tourist trap drinks served at the beach.  He endrd up tossing it after leaving."}
{"text":"Taco, Taco! Love the food and drinks here. Perfect place to visit before hitting the town."}
{"text":"I LOVE their nachos and their jalapeño margarita. Nothing beats either of them anywhere. I nice place to chill and chat. The bartender rocks...in fact, I was there around closing time on 6.1.16 and the entire staff was genuinely kind and hospitable. Always hit up this place for some late night feast! Taco.Nacho. Jalapeño Margarita...wow!"}
{"text":"A nice little spot at the Epi center. They have a smaller menu, but good tacos. I had the buffalo chicken and the Asian shrimp taco. The Asian shrimp taco was my favorite. This place definitely seems like a fun drinking place rather than food place. I will have to come back at night to check it out :)"}
{"text":"Great drinks and fun location! Salsa was very good, queso wasn't anything you couldn't get out of a jar at home though. Matt the bartender was super attentive and makes great margaritas! The jalapeño Marg was fantastic! Will most definitely be back! Probably just for the margarita luges!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my girlfriend. First time having lunch there. There was only 2 servers and they did a great job. The service was excellent. Got our food really fast. The food was delicious. I had the Vida Chicken. The atmosphere was nice with great music and TV was on for those wanting to catch up on a show/news."}
{"text":"Yummy! I've never sat in this area. We sat at the bar and got assisted by Mike. My friend thinks his name was Matt though. He gave excellent service. Our drinks were fantastic! He was busy off an on and still gave us great service. We ordered chips and salsa and queso. Salsa was great but the queso wasn't that yummy. It was super thick and lacked flavor. Overall, we had a good time!"}
{"text":"Came for a drink & stayed for tacos and a couple more drinks! First, love the casual feel of the place. Second, the server was knowledgeable and made great recommendations without being pushy. I had the carnitas taco & beef taco, my colleague had the Asian tacos, and we shared the chips & queso. The food was great & the chips were amazing! The red sangria was delish! The best part is both servers joked with our table, made great recommendations, and just enjoyed being at work on a Monday night! Fantastic food, service, & drinks!"}
{"text":"Think of it as Vida's more casual, laid back little sister. (I was going to say loose and realized wait that sounds completely inappropriate)

Vida is a restaurant that just happens to have a bar. Vida Vida is a bar that just happens to have food.

Tons of flat screen tvs, roll up garage doors, canned beers, frozen drinks, fish bowls, music... it's a super fun vibe. Burritos, tacos, salads, chips and the usual suspects. Tacos come individually or in platters. Bring some friends and go the platter route. It's a much better deal. My personal fav is the Philly Cheesesteak. Drink-wise, I go with the Spicy Jalapeno Margarita. A mix of spicy and sweet. 

Sundays usually feature a DJ. Monday is karaoke night. Tuesday is We Run Uptown... Charlotte's latest run club. I'll pass on the running. Just give me a taco. Although, I heard you get free chips and salsa afterwards. Still not enough to make me want to run.

My latest venture here was to kickoff birthday celebrations on Saturday night. The place was packed and we had a large crew. Two birthday girls.... two groups of friends... one table. I was a little worried, but the service was great. 

It's the EpiCentre, so pull up a table on the patio and enjoy the show. The only thing that makes people watching better: chips, salsa and tacos."}
{"text":"Going to vida in Epicentre is the equivalent of going to Guy Fieri's restaurant in Times Square, a waste of time and money...vida does have a great location and good drink specials at times and that's a stretch."}
{"text":"I have been to Vida a handful of times since I've lived in Charlotte, over the course of two years.  When Vida had a 60 minute wait, my boyfriend and I went to Vida Vida, right next door.  While at the restaurant service was great and food was delicious, I had the fajita and ground beef taco.  That night and the entire next day I was experienced the worst case of food poising, violently getting sick (coming out of both ends).  Unfortunately I will never return to either restaurant, after being scared with this experience. FYI.  Be cautious the food you get there."}
{"text":"Went to Vida Vida mistakenly last night when trying to meet some girlfriends for dinner. We ordered frozen drinks and chips before realizing we needed to be next door at Vida Cantina and Kitchen. Vida Vida is a smaller place with a smaller menu with food coming from the same kitchen. We loved their chips and salsa. Before we went next door we noticed they were setting up live music which is always fun! We would totally go back for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Just had a few beers with friends after work so I can't say much but the service was good."}
{"text":"Good music,good food, my first 3/4 visit were good. My 4th visit was not so good, no silverware, no drink refills we had to ask for those things like trying to get a taxi in NYC. The food came out cold twice by the 2ND time i just decided to eat it anyway. They were busy at lunch time. I figured this was just how it was gonna be this way this time. We'll try back again on a nonbusy time. We hope to get that experience we had the first few time. THAT'S WHY WE CAME BACK.
The view, the music, the tasty food. I'll keep my fingers crossed. I swear my first few visit were something to brag about!
Wait wait, the parking situation is terrible. I had to carry my baby stroller up 2 flights of stairs because there was no elevator. Sooo...nexttime, maybe I'll get a babysitter or prepare for a workout. Again, my first visits were good. My 4th visit was unfavorable. Especially because we knew what to expect."}
{"text":"Decent food but horrible service!  There are too many restaurants Uptown to choose from.  Don't waste your time here!"}
{"text":"Vida vida had the most sexual tacos I've ever seen with my young eyes. I ate them an hour ago and I'm still pulsating from it. It is absolutely appropriate to say that two tacos changed my life."}
{"text":"I got the chicken quesadillas which were good, not great. The queso was not impressive and was room temperature by the time it got to our table. The service was bad. It took 30 minutes to get our chips and salsa & even longer to get our actual meal. Our server was nearly impossible to find when we needed something. This being said, the drinks were really really good and I would suggest the blue fish bowl."}
{"text":"The gourmet tacos were absolutely amazing. The server was very knowledgeable  and patient explaining the menu to a group of 8 that had never ate there before. The margaritas were reasonable priced for down town Charlotte. Again amazing food. A must try. The server Michael was awesome. Super personable and made the experience fun. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Mexican food at the epicenter is like a McDonald's at the airport. Overpriced, good, but uneventful at the end. Great service. Drink specials were ok, nit great."}
{"text":"Out with friends enjoying the 90s bar crawl and the craving for tacos hit and Vida Vida to the rescue. We started with a few Strawberry/ Mango Margaritas which weren't as strong as I would have liked so we only had one but later found out the Strawberry were made stronger so we had a second round of Strawberry which were ok but hit the spot on such a nice day in Uptown. We eventually decided to order food and went with the 
Shredded Beef, Philly Cheesesteak Tacos which were so so so good! Wait! Did I mention how good they were. Another friend ordered the Surf & Turf which he says was just ok but ended up jumping on the Shredded Beef wagon and he enjoyed just as much as we did. 

Overall a great experience which we will definitely be coming back for the shredded beef tacos and the philly lol. The customer service was great as well, out server had a great personality. My only feedback for improvement is there is limited staff so once it got busy we didn't see our server as much so we couldn't do a 3rd round because he took so long to come back. Other than that, great experience."}
{"text":"The service left a lot to be desired. I sat at the bar for 10 minutes before I was even asked if I wanted a drink. There were about 10 other people in the place so I am not sure what the problem was. I ordered a to-go order and a beer while I waited. About 5 minutes after ordering, I still didn't have my beer, but the staff found plenty of time to chat it up with each other. Finally got my beer and my to-go order. I ordered the Asian Shrimp taco and the Mexican tots. The taco was the smallest taco I have ever seen and had very little shrimp but the flavor was good. The tots were good and the picked jalapeños were very spicy which was a great addition. I would not recommend this place as they have a lot of kinks to work out."}
{"text":"We stopped as part of a food de Tour. It was ok, I had the fish taco but it was hard to tell between the fish and chicken and maybe one of each per person woudl have been nice on two different trays. It was ok. I ordered a Margarita which was a little light and no salt. Everything seemed fresh. Loved the salsa and chips"}
{"text":"It's not even 8:30 in the evening  and the music is not what I would want my child to listen to (gangsta rap and drug related rap music) blaring outside so the people walking by get assaulted by it with there children , yeah crossing it off the list before I even try it"}
{"text":"Been here many times and unfortunately the service is always lacking. You seat yourself but it takes forever to be acknowledged and usually that person is just telling you that someone will be with you in a second, while they are hardly doing anything but checking their phone (just happen today) but also happened a few times before.
The only reason I come back is because of that Philly Cheesesteak taco so if I'm in the epicentre and I'm hungry that's usually my go to for something quick (since it comes out pretty fast after you actually get to order). 
My other fav from here is the Swirl which is half the frozen margarita and half the red sangria. It is so good and you will feel it after one plus it's reasonably priced and not too sweet! 
They also usually have good specials as well like on Taco Tuesday and holidays like Cinco de Mayo that make it a good stop on like a bar tour and they are usually better staffed then too."}
{"text":"The veggie tacos were phenomenal, and probably the best I've had in a while.  Minus one star for the Margarita, as I don't think they should be served without a salt rim.  

Service wasn't great, but I don't think that excellent service is what you should expect here.  Loud, busy, and at the Epicentre.  

This is a place I'll always go if I'm craving tacos, and queso and chips."}
{"text":"Ashlee H  gave best service anywhere in a long time.  Friendly, attentive, and articulate.  A true pro... Great Job. Food was awesome."}
{"text":"Based purely on simplicity, I'm a fan of this casual side of Vida.  You can come in for lunch, have tacos and be back at work (or wherever in no time).  Usually it isn't that busy, but if it is, the servers and the limited menu make it quick enough.  Mostly come in for tacos, but they have salads and I believe burritos available too.

The menu is one sided! the other side are all the fun drinks you can't have during a work day, but maybe one day.... ;)  The dining room is large with lots of tables.  Their tables and chairs remind me of a school classroom (heavy, colorful high-top seats) and almost retro style tables with metal accents on the side.

I've never been here in the evenings, but I'm sure it takes on a different atmosphere.  A decent stop for a night out... or afterwards to soak certain cocktails up from the other places at the EpiCenter.  They've got some outdoor seating and based on their location, a great way to stop and people watch."}
{"text":"Tacos were great!! Very delicious and distinct taste variations - I was impressed. Clean and the waitress was amazing. When you walk in, it's not clear that there are actually TWO diff restaurants. The right side is casual, the left is more expensive and larger portions. We sat in the left but wanted the smaller portions so the waitress brought us that menu, no problem. I would go back again."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb diggity! This is located in uptown Charlotte right in the Epicentre which is the heart and soul of the city. The restaurant has a great patio area overlooking some of the busiest streets of the city. Anything on this menu is golden. Food comes fresh, hot, and over flowing - most meals cannot be finished in one sitting. For the location the prices are great and the amount you get cannot be questioned. The drinks are a comparable price to an uptown establishment and the guac is to die for! The chips are made fresh which is a nice touch. Service is usually good nothing spectacular but the waitstaff does engage and will answer any questions you have. Where vida vida is more of a restaurant next door is the taco cantina which is best for a quick beer and taco and has bar stool, music, and lots of neon lights. Overall Vida Vida, is nice from Taco Tuesday to any other day if the week."}
{"text":"Well, I rarely post reviews of places I didn't care for, and usually post for great places. But Vida is the exception here. Disappointed is the best word I can find. The tacos were served room temp and tasted bland... not what I expected for a $5 taco. 

But hey, at least I had poor service!! The guy serves our food without silverware, then still forgets after 2 reminders. Finally I had to get up, find another waitress who promptly brought us something to eat with and lemon for our water. We wanted to tip her instead. 

Anyway, we won't be coming back to Vida anytime soon."}
