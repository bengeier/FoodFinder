{"text":"Dinner was good. I had veggie enchiladas. Guacamole which was delicious.  1st time here since it just opened recently.  Which I think explains some of the negative reviews. Atmosphere is fun. Similar to Mexican benihana but you don't have to socialize with strangers."}
{"text":"Would really like to review Fogon.  Unfortunately, we showed up at 7:45 on a Sunday night.  Seems like they close at 8, and will turn away people that show up before then.  I get it.  If you want to go home, that's fine. But set the closing time for when you want people to stop coming, not when you want to go home.

Can't comment on the food, atmosphere, or drinks. We couldn't get served."}
{"text":"Too bad the food is terrible because this could be a nice place to go. The chips were so salty I couldn't eat them. The shrimp tacos had what tasted like 1000 island dressing on them. Tried to scrape as much off as I could. The refried beans were bland. Chicken fajitas were so dry and over cooked. The meal was so bad that my husband said he would have had a better meal at Chilis! Yuck!"}
{"text":"I went with my friend and business associate who hails from Mexico City and he absolutely loved it.  So did I.  I thought the food was great and authentic.  The beef tacos were excellent.  The salsas was perfect.  My buddy had the enchiladas and he raved about them.  We both had the sopa con crema...dinero.  We also got a chance to meet the chef's mom...super nice lady that simply exuded her love for cooking good, traditional Mexican food.  Cons: new place so service is trying to figure things out.  Pros: Comida autentica estilo D.F."}
{"text":"I want to management here know that the food was just ok but what gave this experience one star was the waiter. All was fine till we received the check and the waiter abruptly and rudely gave us the ticket announcing \"I am a good waiter\" and turning on his heels. We were more than a little shocked, then he sent a waitress to retrieve our check when we weren't finished, pointed at us from inside the restaurant ranting to another employee, and ran to the table to pick up our bill as we left. Don't know what his problem was but we agreed we'll never go back. So maybe management needs to have a come to God talk with the waiter from Brooklyn about customer service and how that equates to return business and and tips."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service.  We ordered the food without cilantro and everything we ordered had extra cilantro.  The cook even made a remark that he saw the request for no cilantro and decided against it. The food was overpriced, the drinks were mediocre at best, and the service was some of the worst I've had.  The location is cursed and so is this restaurant, evidently."}
{"text":"Great food in a nice setting where Nimbus Brewery used to reside.

I had the carnitas and it was top notch and I liked the 4 sides with it.

Kid's food was really good - tried the steak taco - great portion size.

Excellent salsa and chips before ordering (free).  Margaritas were expensive at $10.50-$14.

Outdoor dining too."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!! Great concept, fresh food and the best guacamole in town! Love the sangria too! Every time we have friends in town we bring them here. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We are from the midwest visiting and this was a very disappointing experience.   The concept was interesting. ..8 stations where the chefs cook the food in front of you.  I ordered fajitas...they had no flavor and the chef put the chicken and veges on such a hot pan that they were charred.  Enchiladas were a tiny bit better.  Wait staff was adequate.   Think twice before eating there."}
{"text":"Have been here twice for lunch. Both times amazing. The food is so good! I will definitely keep coming back and will bring along family/friends to dine here. This place does not compare to Sumo Maya across the street, way better portions and much more delicious."}
{"text":"Adios!  Maybe dinner service has the true professionals at work versus the lunch service we received today.  It was a 2  hour ordeal that was painful...orders were wrong, empty glasses not cleared from the table (and there were quite a few over two hours...), clueless wait staff and  when we left, other tables of two that came in 45 minutes after we did still had not been served.  Fortunately the chips are good but if there are 5 special salsas, would have been nice to have them offered as the standard offering seemed a purée of Pace picante with the flavor drained. The \"customized grill stations\" were not used.  Had visions  of one guy irunning around the back of the kitchen microwaving things although if that were the case then the food would have at least been lukewarm...whe we finally got it. It's mediocre at best.  The rice has no flavor , the salsa no spice.  I didn't think there was such a thing as bad Mexican food but this is a definite Miss.  The only reason to go is to see if you can get a deal on one of the grills or the tile art when they close in 2 months."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, unique flavors reminiscent of Mexico City cuisine in a well done space that feels like a restaurant right out of Polanco.  Definitely try their roasted corn and one of their signature cocktails!"}
{"text":"OMG AMAZING MEAL  chile rellenos,ceviche, Mexican street corn were the best  joseph was awesome as our bartender. Order whatever he recommends!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised so many people like this place.  I went once at lunch on a weekend.  It was totally dead at noon.  There was no cooking going on out in the restaurant at all.  I wasn't even sure of the purpose of some of that equipment out there.  It appeared to be left over from a previous restaurant of which there have been several in this location.  We did get a lot of chips and those weren't bad.  I ordered an enchilada and it was served in a skillet with a hard crust of cheese on top.  Too much for my liking.  I only ate about half and left it behind.  

Overall, i wouldn't go back, other places to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food and concept!  Beef brisket enchilada and civiche were amazing!  Really attentive staff.  So glad we decided to try it! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"They called and canceled our Valentine's Day reservation at noon on Valentine's Day ruining our plans entirely. Not sure what kind of business they're trying to run but we're definitely never going to try going there again."}
{"text":"Fogon is a beautiful resturant in a great location. If you are wondering why it is almost always 75% empty is because the food does not measure up to the competition, Bario Queen & Sumo Maya.  We have been there 3 times."}
{"text":"Can I give it a zero?  Valentine's Day reservations in Scottsdale made a week ahead of time.  12:45 a phone call comes in on Valentine's Day. We regret to inform you we can not open due to severe understaffing.  

At this point do you think I can get another reservation anywhere?????   Thanks Fogon for ruining Valentine's Day!"}
{"text":"I came here two nights in a row! I was visiting from out of town and was staying right across the street so this was very convenient. Lucky for me it was also delicious. I sat outside both nights and it was warm under the lamps. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, which was delicious (both times). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the 2stars are strictly due to our service.  The food was good but not, \"OMG, I can't wait to come back!!!\"  but very good.  We aged while we waited for drinks and entrees, slow doesn't cover it!  When we asked, \"What is the soup?\" She responded......\"Noodle based with tomato soup\".   Ummmmm......... We didn't order.  
First rule in the industry, make sure everyone has a drink to keep them happy.  Not so much!  When someone in our party ordered an  enchilada with tomatillo sauce and received red sauce, the server told her, \"We're out of the green\".  WHAT?  The chef/mgr had just been to the table and recommended the ordered sauce.  Our friend was surprised but didn't get upset.......until another employee delivered her meal as ordered and was surprised to see she already had a plate.  When he saw her plate he said, \"that's someone else's!\"   He removed the untouched plate and gave her the meal she ordered.  Waitress oblivious.  
Finally we get the check and eventually walk it in so we can leave.  Expecting to see the interior restaurant hopping but no........the restaurant was EMPTY!!!!!!  Where was she?  We laughed and made up a wide variety of scenarios, none of which involved the restaurant.  I'm not saying that all servers at this restaurant are horrible, I know that is not fair.  I will go back but think that FOGON  mgmt needs to be aware.  Tons of restaurants and snowbirds about to arrive.  Lots of choices!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for lunch.  Had an overall very good experience.  Details:
Guacamole:  Super fresh and VERY good with just the right amount of \"kick.\"
Tortilla Soup:  Was amazing!  We're tortilla soup fans and this was one of the best We've ever had!
Shrimp Tacos:  A lighter option with great flavor and with the rice/beans made for a great lunch for my wife.
Beef Brisket Enchiladas: This was very good served in a small cast iron skillet.  My only complaint here was that they were a little too salty and since cooked in the skillet they ended up very greasy as the oils had nowhere to escape to.  Good but a very heavy option and not for the person wanting a low-fat option.
Service:  Was great.  Can't speak to their service on a busy day.  We were one of three tables seated for lunch."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The owner stopped by and talked to us about the place. We found it on a groupon deal and I can say for certain I will be back! I got the carnitas, and he got a chicken quesadilla. Both were so tasty."}
{"text":"I thought the multi kitchen concept was really cool! The margaritas were good and the chef preparing our food was helpful and informative. Good vibes all around!"}
{"text":"Visually appealing and nice idea, this was described in a local review and a Mexican food Benihana. Menus were bulky and difficult to read in such a close seating arrangement (go there, you'll see what I mean). Food was bland, though my wife described the green sauce on the enchiladas as very good. Rice was undercooked (it's not supposed to crunch like that), and the server looked at us like we were from another planet when we asked for a spoon for the charro beans. Service was clumsy at best as staff seemed unfamiliar with the tablets and card readers used for ordering and billing. While my server got it on the first try, I saw another server at an adjacent table scan a patron's card at least a half a dozen times. When presented with the check, I saw that my entrée was $2 less than the price on the menu, but I was charged $18 for a $10 quesadilla. I pointed those errors out to my server who corrected one and let me keep the $2 discount. I imagine these are issues that will resolve themselves as staff become more familiar with their equipment. If this restaurant can improve service and bring the food up a few notches, then I believe it will survive. If not, it'll be another empty retail space."}
{"text":"So if you just want good margs, chips and salsa, and queso -- and you want to hang out on the patio -- this would be fine. But the dining room schtick here is Benihana Goes to Mexico, and it doesn't really work. First, the entrees are meh...dry steak tacos, and soupy chicken enchiladas. Second, when we visited, the ventilation was all out of whack, and so much smoke was coming out of the wood-fired oven that we left smelling like BBQ pitmasters. Finally, Mexican food (at least the kind made here) just isn't theatrical enough that we care to see it being prepared. That's three strikes, and you know what that means."}
{"text":"What can I say? Nice atmosphere, friendly and courteous staff, tasty tacos, burritos, chips and salsa, short and sweet great food!"}
{"text":"This place is lacking in service. I've been here three times and each time it's the service I have issues with. The owner/manager/head chef (unsure if his exact title) talks to the staff so much that it slows them down, including the bartenders. It actually comes off a little flirtatious. Regardless though, the service is the problem. This place has lost my business."}
{"text":"Tried some \"modern\" Mexican on a New Year's Day lunch here and the place was not crowded and in fact had only one of their Behihana style cooking stations open, so there was no way we could see the chef cooking our food as they promise. The other complaint would be the vast difference of one dish at lunch compared to dinner and I'm not talking about the price. The famous Brisket enchilada's were good, but at lunch they don't put it in a skillet and cover it with cheese. I'm not sure whether that whole process is worth 8 bucks more at dinner either. The lunch serving just has a few lonely enchilada's on the plate looking quite in need of a cheese bath. Everything else was pleasant enough including good free chips and a nice server. The brisket is nice and crumbly, but show your food some respect at lunch also - too many places are nickle and diming customers. It is just cheese people!"}
{"text":"I had never gone to this place and thought it'd be a nice choice for Valentine's Day. I made my reservation a week before and asked if they would have a special menu for V-day and the guy said they weren't sure if they would (a week before, you would know I would think!). Come V-day and I get a call saying that they are understaffed and the restaurant will be closed. Really?! And they didn't even try to make up for it, offer a gift card, free drinks on next visit, nothing!! I guess I won't ever consider this place again."}
{"text":"A great new concept with a deliciously prepared menu, cool layout with a very attentive team of professional staff. Had fajitas and enchiladas both were awesome!  I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful bar, patio and tequila list."}
{"text":"A great experience at Fõgon. The food was delicious and merits both recommendations to friends and to my yelp family as well as a return visit to satisfy the desire to eat everything on the menu.  Your Bubbys brisket has been reinvented into a sensational enchilada with layers of savory bites topped with a tomatillo salsa cooked inside the adobe oven after it was heated table side.   These Adobe ovens are amazing. They cook fast and evenly, a Mexican microwave but all natural.  Abuelita's chocolate ice cream dessert is memorable and worthy of return.  The mango nopale salad was a refreshing start that invigorate the tastebuds   And the rice and bean sides are the best I have had in a long time.  Felicidades!  Please Support tjhis Restaurant.   The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Fogon is fo-real! Everything was on point, the ambiance, the drinks, appetizers, entrees and service. We started with the guacamole, it was by far the most flavorful restaurant guac we've ever had and for $10 you get a hearty portion. Drinks: we had the Patron Jalisco Mule and Spicy Watermelon Margarita, both were unique and tasty! Entrees: The stacked veggie quesadilla was extremely flavorful and there's a reason the chef won an award for the green chile pork!

We'll be back to Fogon as soon as possible!
Do yourself a favor and give Fogon a try!"}
{"text":"We were at the park across the street and felt like Mexican so we went in for a quick lunch with our 2 little kids. What a pleasant surprise. Salsa and guac were great, lunch specials were tasty and priced very well and the atmosphere was fun. Our food was fresh vs the often heavy-cheesy Mexican restaurants out there. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Shared three different plates, and they were all perfectly balanced, seasoned, and cooked."}
{"text":"My family goes out for family dinner every Sunday. Always looking for someplace new. So I thought we'd try FOGON. I had the raspberry ginger margarita. It was delicious. My husband got one after he tasted mine. I ordered the chile relleno. It was sooo good. My son and husband ordered the steak fajitas and shrimp fajitas. Very flavorful. The table side (made in the kitchen) was spicy and creamy.  My son ordered a chicken quesadilla as an appetizer and since it didn't come out till our entrees did our waitress took it off the bill. That was very kind. I only gave 4 stars because the service was pretty slow.  We will go back again and hopefully it will be better.   We enjoyed sitting on the patio...now that our weather is nice!"}
{"text":"This looks like a cool place but it appears they're trying too hard. There is a lot of space to fill but I think it needs to be smaller - fewer tables and a smaller patio. We tried the guac and thought it was bland but the portion size was generous. We paid 13.52 b/f tip for guac, chips, and two ice teas. If the guac had been better, we would have proceeded to dinner.  If they can't put a great app like that on the table, not going to throw more $$ at dinner. The bar tender was attentive and accommodating which was a plus."}
{"text":"I started writing this review about 20 minutes into my visit. Came here for happy hour and was pleased to find great value for the drinks. The service was friendly and knowledgable. I had a Jamaica Margarita, which was very tasty. Their salsa is fantastic. Would definitely go again! 

...Again, did I mention the salsa??

For food, I tried the chile relleno and chicken nachos off of the HH menu. Again, was very impressed. Really great, authentic Mexican food. Seriously,  I was super happy I stopped by."}
{"text":"I will start with the good.

The staff is friendly and attentive (but it was only 5:30 pm).

The table prepared guacamole was excellent and a large portion for $10.00.

The salsa was also different and tasty.

The seating arrangement is terrible.  We were seated in front of the cooking station with the heat from the steam table blowing on us.  Unless the a/c was on it was a miserable experience.  The seating arrangement also puts you too close to the sight, smell, and sound of smoking meat being cooked.

How do you mess up cheese enchiladas???  They have found a way.  My \"enchiladas\" were two small flour tortillas with melted cheese in them (like a folded over quesadilla) with some sauce slathered on them.  This would have been  $.99 meal at Taco Bell....only it would have been tasty there.

Our group was very disappointed, as were some friends that sat in a different area.  They had a better seat away from the hot oven.

With the group seating it makes conversation very hard...since you are seated shoulder to shoulder.

I would never go back and should have paid attention to the one star reviews on Yelp.  The good reviews are obviously written by employees and friends (Daniel C. - could that be Daniel Correa the owner?  That's my guess.  Look at the negative reviews...they speak the truth.

If you are still tempted, be sure and either sit outside or well away from the noise and heat of the cooking stations.

You will have a much better experience if you skip this place and head to Los Olivos in Old Town."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I'm giving two stars is because at least they had the courtesy of warning me the morning of, that our reservation was being cancelled. On Valentine's Day. I guess they could have let me show up to locked doors. The message got the point across but I had to call back to discover the reason for this clearly appalling and unacceptable news. 

Maria, the hostess, answered promptly. She must have been aware that people were angrily calling back, so kudos to her for taking the flack for the ill-conceived cancellation decision. She informed me that they were closed for the day due to a staffing issue. I asked if there was anything management planned to do to compensate those who had made reservations (weeks in advance) for Valentine's Day. She said no plans were being made. Incredulous, I demanded a better answer than that. Maria gave in and told me that that the restaurant will most likely shut its doors permanently in the following days. Her sincere apology and exasperated tone confirmed with me that this whole situation wasn't her fault. Shame on the managers/owners for making her sit and take these calls. Honestly. 

I called two days later (Monday). The phone rang and landed on an anonymous, unbranded, voicemail box. 

If, in fact, Fogon continues to operate without any consolation to the many people who made Valentine's Day reservations, I will adjust my review down to 1 star and let everyone I know to forgo Fogon for good."}
{"text":"An out-of-town friend from the resort across the street wanted some good Mexican food. We decided to try this place. Never been here before.

For starters, the service was terrible. We waited about 10 minutes for our simple ice tea and beer to arrive. Since there were no sweeteners at the table I asked the server if she could bring some. After 6 minutes, no sweeteners appeared, so I had to walk around and find some on my own. We only managed to get a refill of tea near the end of the meal. Apparently, this girl had better things to do with her time than to wait on our table.

Most of the food was some of most bland tasting Mexican food I've ever had. The cheese enchilada came in a cute little cast iron pan, but the flavor and texture didn't live up to the presentation. It was hard to tell what was in there buried under the puddle of sauce and cheese. Have had way better at much less expensive places. The rice had the strangest flavor of any I've had in any restaurant. It definitely wasn't a Mexican flavor. I really can't describe it and we didn't eat much of it. The black beans were bland. We didn't really like the odd salsa provided with the chips. Near the end of the meal we found out they have 5 different kinds. Would have been real nice if they had told us that when they brought the chips but you only learn this after asking. 

Up to this point, you can say I wasn't impressed but I've saved the best for last. We were sitting a few feet from one of the many open hearth ovens. Suddenly thick black smoke starting pouring out of it as around 3 of the cooks gathered in front of it. This black smoke instantly surrounded our table. If you've ever smelled burning plastic it will give you an idea what it smelled like. Was it toxic? Don't know, but it sure smelled like it was. That kind of capped the evening off.

I was embarrassed we had brought our out-of-town friend here (yes, apologies were offered) and although I can see from the reviews that some people like this place, it's not likely we'll ever return."}
{"text":"Weird concept that doesn't make any sense. They tell you it's like Benihana but it is nothing like it. There is no interaction with the Chef and the way the tables are situated, you can't really see the cooking anyway.
We went because the line to get into the taco fest was too long so most of us got tacos. The were cold and dry and came from another kitchen, not the one near where we were seated.
The \"table side\" guacamole was made by the chef near us but we didn't even know he was making it till he unceremoniously delivered it to our table (without chips)
Drinks were eh and expensive for what you got. One of the raspberries in my drink was moldy.
All in all, no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Solid menu and ambiance.  The execution is off.  The staff didn't know the menu well enough and I was charged for a higher priced item.  With Blanco and Sumo Maya across the street and Barrio down the road they better work out the kinks in order to win patronage. Would also love to see some more dishes native to DF like Sopes, Al Pastor, or Cichilo Negro."}
{"text":"Please open up again!!!!  I miss this place, the food was great, queso dip...wow!"}
{"text":"The portions were HUGE! Especially the complementary chips. They gave me enough chips to feed an entire family of 4. However, the food was average but the price was reasonable. I suggest the restaurant to serve less chips for smaller groups, this can probably save them some money because there was no way I could finish that whole bucket of chips.

I ordered the beef brisket enchiladas because it was suggested by other yelpers. This was served in a small iron skillet. The first few bites were decent, but then the grease came out, a lot of grease. It would be better if they served some fresh salad with this dish (instead of the beans) to balance out the grease. Also, this dish was over-seasoned, I could not eat it without the rice. The salsa for the chips was very bland."}
{"text":"This review needs few words.  Amazing food, great ambiance and CLEAN! Did I mention the place was clean?  Our server Kimberly was great and with the Hibachi style serving Francisco helped us seize our food.  Okay, started off with shrimp
Ceviche, very fresh, just right on the cilantro. I had the brisket enchiladas delicious and my wife had the chicken burrito which was excellent as well! Their habanero sauce is spicy and a good compliment to any dish.  Definitely will be coming back and telling our friends"}
{"text":"Decent food with a great location. The only complaint I have, is when you sit at the bar you can only choose from a Tapas menu. So if you want tacos on TT you have to sit in the dining area. Their chili rellano, street corn and quesadillas were tasty. Good speciality Margs and great HH prices. I saw many bad reviews in here for them but chose to make my own opinion. I would go bank but there is much better Mexican food places in the valley. The customer service was good, no issues with that."}
{"text":"I went there tonight and was worried about some of the reviews. However, I found the service to be excellent, and the food was good, not great, because i like things a little more spicy, but that maybe just me. They also have a good wine list, which is unusual for most of the Mexican restaurants here. All in all it was a good experience, and I really liked the atmosphere. Glad I went."}
{"text":"They are closed in less than 6 months!!  Really people? 3rd restaurant in the last couple of years to go out of business in that spot.  Sad but true."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while looking for a new place to try.  We lucked out because Fogon was raising money for the Pat Tillman charity.  The food was great, especially the Mahi Mahi.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been a big supporter of this restaurant and concept and recommended it to many people but after my experience today that is no longer the case.  

I typically come in for a drink and order food to go and the service and food has always been above average.  I always order the same thing with an extra side of Habanero Salsa and a Side of Fresh Habanero Peppers.  Today when I placed my order the bartender came back and told me the chef told her that I could not get the habaneros because they don't give sides of those.  He (Lorenzo) was behind the bar fixing the POS station and I assumed he was just out of the peppers but then what he said next was the last thing I would expect to hear.  He told me that they have plenty but that they have never given sides of the peppers.  When I told him that I have had the same order for the last 10 plus visits he proceeded to tell me that he didn't know where I got them and if someone gave them to me at the restaurant they must have gone to the grocery store and bought them because they did not come out of the kitchen.  If that is the new policy there is certainly a better way to handle it.  There was no need to insult my intelligence and imply that I was lying.  The bartender even came and apologized for him and suggested that he should not be out in the front of the house.

To make matters worse when I got home with my order I had one small plastic container with habanero salsa when there was actually a charge for the side on my bill even though I ordered my meal without guacamole and sour cream.  While I have no problem paying for the extra salsa (and peppers) I would expect a large side like I have received every other visit.

While I have enjoyed this restaurant in the past I am not sure I will be back and will certainly not recommend the restaurant to others going forward."}
{"text":"The food: AMAZING!
The layout/decor: Interesting and fun and fresh!
The service: Ehhhhh.

We came in for an early dinner on Saturday. The smoky scent of grilled food wafted around us and immediately made us STARVING. Perfect!

There are several cook stations set up throughout the restaurant, each with about 8 tables connected (ours had 4 two- and four-top sections and 4 tables for bigger parties). It's a neat concept to get to watch the cooks in action without having to deal with the nuisances of traditional \"hibachi\" dining--no talking and sitting with strangers!

It took a while for our server to greet us and to be honest, that basically set the tone for the evening: Lots of waiting. No plates being cleared. No menu recommendations or up-sells. (This place is new! Sell us on it!)

The food was absolutely the star, though. We started with the guacamole, which was probably one of the best restaurant-made batches I've ever had. Chunky avos, bright citrus notes, ample amounts of queso fresco. (And the house salsa they bring with chips also ain't too shabby either!) We inhaled it.

For entrees, I opted for the grilled zucchini and roasted corn enchiladas, while my boyfriend opted for the chicken fajitas. The enchiladas were OUTSTANDING: they are the stacked style; three delicious corn tortillas (you get your choice of corn or flour) layered with your filling and cheese in a dish is thrown into the oven to transform into bubbly perfection. I will say though, there was no roasted corn in the whole dish...just the grilled zucchini and some other fajita veggies. Didn't reflect the menu name. The sides of rice and beans (I opted for black beans, charro or pinto are also available) were perfectly seasoned and hot. Boyfriend loved his fajitas and was happy it came with an extra little ramekin of guac, as our order was long gone by the time our entrees came out.

Like I said, one thing that bugged me was NO plates being cleared. We had to find room on our table to push aside our empty guacamole molcajete, dirty appetizer plates, carafe my glass of wine came in and large menus. It all sat there during our meal. Our server came by to refill our water once and saw the scene, but didn't pick up anything. Once we boxed up our leftovers, the empty entree dishes sat there as well. To be honest, I felt like the guys in our kitchen area deserved a tip moreso than our server. They checked in several times asking how our food was, and delivered it all to us. I also appreciate how they use iPads for settling checks in an attempt to be green, but can also see how that might be a little awkward.

All in all, the food is definitely the star at Fogon, which I guess it should be. Come on service, kick it up a notch!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to Fogon a few nights ago. We sat out on the patio because the weather was great. The patio is beautiful with a fireplace and fountain. The drinks were all made with fresh ingredients and tasted amazing. We all had different entrees and they were all very good . The beef brisket enchiladas were my favorite. All in all good food, great atmosphere and perfect for date night. We will be back."}
{"text":"I choose to leave 0 stars! Canceling Valentine's Day reservations a few hours before reservation is despicable. The kicker... Not even an attempt to win back the customer. Restaurant suicide!"}
{"text":"Went here Friday (I think opening night) with a group of six. We did show up a little late at 9:30 but were surprised there was no one there but us. The guacamole was good, as we're the appetizers. We had the steak quesadilla and the chorizo cheese dip and we all really loved the flavor of the steak. Unfortunately overall taste of our entrees were charred and bitter. I will say the service was good but I don't think we will come back unless they make some changes to the food. It's a great concept and nice looking restaurant but the food needs an upgrade."}
{"text":"It was a good thing we had groupon cause the food was very bland, we added Tabasco that didn't work. Salads were swimming in dressing and more red onions than salad greens.  Ceviche was like shrimp in v 8 juice."}
{"text":"Actually zero stars.  Went last night.  They are closed down and there is no notice on their website,  had to get refund for our coupon."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. 
They had a good selections of salsas which my hubby and I live for. 
Over priced TINY margaritas. 
Service was HORRIBLE! 
I will never come back."}
{"text":"This was such a cute and fun place! Not kitchy cheesy normal mexican restaurant decor-good enough for a date night or couples to share some grub. I'm surprised it wasn't busier! You get to sit around stations where the chefs prepare your food next to the table.  Kind of reminds me of Mexican Benihana?!  But with out a flashy show.  Our server was very nice and attentive but not overly attentive. Perfect!! The chef that prepared our meal was super nice. 
Good salsa and chips.  Very fresh! Started out with the table side guac- they do make it very spicy- so make sure if you like mild to tell them. It was so good but the Serrano that they happened to have that day was particularly hot so we definitely were downing ice tea for awhile. But still really good!! Very fresh and very yummy-next time we will go mild I guess I'm a weenie! we also shared the beef fajitas which were very delicious. Lots of fresh red and yellow bell peppers and onions. Yummy. The only thing that I though was so so was the corn. I've had more tender corn that was a little more flavorful... But it also isn't corn season so maybe that's why. Plus there is groupons for this place??! Yes please!!!! And it's awesome!! Please try it! It fun and it is tasty!  Plus we saw someone order a burrito enchilada style and it looked delish- and enough to feed a 3rd world country! Bring friends to share some Large portioned burritos!!! :) definitely on our date night Mexican place! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Really cool Mexican Restaurant! They have multiple open kitchen's so where ever you are sitting in the place you are close to your cook preparing your meals! 
The place is pretty modern, and cool looking and we were seated right next to our cook which was cool, cause he came over to talk to us about how much he loved cooking vegan food! 
He then told us about a Vegan Mexican place we needed to check out, and he even wrote it down for us!
The food was great, I had a Veggie Burrito with green sauce and it was packed to the brim, with veggies!  It also came with black beans, and rice!  It was great! 
The chips and salsa were plentiful and I was actually pretty full before my meal got out to us! 
This place is cool, only thing keeping back from a 5 star, was the 10 dollar Margarita-- It was pretty gross. At first I just thought it was strong, then I discovered it was just way to sugary.. And I love sugar"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight, we were greeted warmly by the hostesses as if it was a red carpet. Seated promptly at Ricardo's teppanyaki style table were we were quickly met by server Samantha. Started with guac and shrimp ceviche both good sized portions and excellent. Followed with the chicken fajitas and the steamed fish in a banana leaf which was cooked in the table side wood fired oven. Both entrees were generous in size and very tasty.

BOTTOM LINE: Don't miss this place. Its firing on all cylinders now!"}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town and needed to kill time, I spent several hours here. By myself. No literally, almost no one came in. There were 6 servers to every one person I'd say. I had the chips and salsa which I thought were very good, and the chicken quesadilla. I'm from the east coast, and the quesadilla wasn't anything better than what I would have at home, but it was a lot of food. The rice had undercooked pieces in it that were very crunchy. The white peach margarita is killer! So good, however, the other drinks I tried were just so so, and anything with the real lime juice was just way too sour. 

The saving grace of this place was the bartender. Sweet as could be and very accommodating. 

Over all this is not a place I would rave about, but being that it's brand new, and this is the owners first restaurant...I'm hoping there will be a lot of learning and implementing to make this place phenomenal."}
{"text":"Received a phone call at noon that they were canceling our reservation because of staffing. On Valentines Day. No efforts to get me to come back, won't even answer the phone. Looks like they won't ever be getting our business. Happy Valentine's Day to us, looks like we're ordering pizza."}
{"text":"Fun new place!

We ate here thanks to a groupon, but will be back willingly. 

Brisket enchiladas are a must! Been craving them since our visit. Spicy watermelon margarita is unique and yummy too. 

Good chips, salsa and table side guacamole."}
{"text":"Wow where do I begin with this train wreck of a place...What ever you do STAY AWAY! Just returned from lunch and it was quite literally a joke..The single worst experience in recent memory...Taco Haus was the last place we hated this much and it closed in 6 months..We think Fogon will maybe make it a month...From service to the food it's as if the people there have no idea what is going on..bizarre! The investors should go in and fire everyone this afternoon and hire professionals. Suffice to say they aren't even trying and they have only been open a week...Adios Fogon you won't be missed!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick lunch break. Great service, very friendly. New lunch special for $6.99 includes two enchiladas and a side...not to mention the complimentary chips and salsa. A lot of food for lunch! Everything I has was good. I could eat the rice everyday."}
