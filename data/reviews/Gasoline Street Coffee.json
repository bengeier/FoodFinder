{"text":"Great place with excellent coffee. If you are looking for a good cafe latte you will find it here."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path amazing coffee shop. Tried their nitro brew and loved it. Aesthetic and atmosphere was super chill and inviting."}
{"text":"My mom and I were visiting Pittsburgh for two days. On our second day we went for a run and wanted to enjoy a cup of good coffee. Being from Seattle, we did not want Starbucks. I found this coffee shop and it was absolutely great. Our coffee was brewed very well and the latte art was great. We got a breakfast sandwich that tasted fresh and it was fulfilling. Not only was the coffee and sandwich great, but the decor and theme of the coffee shop was very cute. From the menu to the chairs and wall decor, we were thoroughly impressed. Great stop for a morning cup of joe."}
{"text":"Best $2.00 cup of coffee in the city! Been coming since the week this place opened. Nick the barista and Matt the owner are extremely warm people and overly passionate about coffee - it definitely shows.   The last 16 oz Starbucks drip I got was $2.46. Try their pour over on the Hario v60 for $2.50. For 4 cents more, the quality blows Starbucks out of the water."}
{"text":"Wrap yourself up in the aroma of local coffees brewing... where decadent pastries and scrumptious pretzels invite your tastebuds for a treat... while you're taking in the modern, industrial feel of the atmosphere. Catch some good vibes... from the owner who frequents the coffee shop... and the expert barista Nick... his qualifications can whip you up any delectable coffee drink that you desire. Tucked away on what was once known as gasoline Street, you'll find this coffee shop on first Avenue between the Allegheny County Jail and PNC Bank. It's worth the venture when you can get coffee for an absolutely reasonable price. Such a rare find--- I guarantee you'll keep going back again and again! Try the cherry frozen beverage that's mixed with milk, chocolate, espresso, and fresh cherry ...you won't be sorry. Make sure you hit that my review was useful, because once you stop in here you'll know that I know exactly what I'm talking about :) Starbucks is a long, lost memory ever since I tried gasoline Street coffee!"}
{"text":"Cool but little bit outta the way coffee shop.  Like the theme, especially since I like my coffee strong and dark.  Admittedly, I was half asleep when I walked in so I appreciate the friendly baristas being patient while I ordered. Got an espresso to stay and London Fog to go.  Everything was well done and I'd definitely come back to enjoy a cup of coffee if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great place to have a pretzel or bagel and an excellent cup of coffee. Visited from Chicago, and found myself finding any reason to go back. Picked up a shirt on the way out too.. Can't wait to find my way back"}
{"text":"We were in town on business and heard about the coffee shop from a colleague. Great atmosphere and really cool vibe. The coffee was amazing. Matt, the owner, took time to stop and talk about the shop and his vision for building the business through relationships in the community. Can't wait for my next trip so I can stop by again."}
{"text":"This place had an interesting feel. The vibe was a little too strange for my taste but it is definitely worth a stop in. My americano was ."}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere and interior design. Great drinks. Good WiFi. Great service. 10/10 one of my top top pgh coffee shops and I don't give that compliment lightly. Only negative-- closes too early :("}
{"text":"This coffee shop is top notch! Not only does it have a unique theme and excellent service, the coffee concoctions are interesting and very easy to get down. I had the chai drink, and my husband had the chocolate and orange frappuccino which was sinfully good. Skip Starbucks, and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is a really chill coffee shop! It is a great place to study or just meet up with friends. The coffee is good and best of all, not too expensive!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  Super cute, hipster vibe inside.  Interesting handmade syrups.  However, the latte that I got was burned.  I get that that happens sometimes, but it's rough when it's your first time in a place and it's burned.  It reminded me of Starbucks which is not a good comparison.    Sorry, Gasoline.  I might try you again."}
{"text":"Tucked away under the Liberty Bridge on First Avenue, this gem of a coffee shop was an answer to a work-from-home prayer! The staff are incredibly welcoming and hospitable and made me feel right at home. Sipping on a maple brown sugar seasonal latte - delicious! Great job, guys!!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly. I LOVE their nitro cold brew! I brought it back for some people in the office and now I have them going there! I also got a bagel that was delicious! Also great atmosphere and a really cool place."}
{"text":"Great large space with tons of cool details. Not easy to park the car. It could be more and better quality baked stuff like croissants etc. Good coffee not overpriced. Very original and memorable place. I'm glad I stoped here passing by Pittsburgh for the first time."}
{"text":"Great priced high quality coffee. Parking is a little tough although there is a parking garage right in front, this is expected as it's in the city. Very tastefully decorated, just enough accents which mean the inside is not overwhelming. Cool gas station/garage theme, even in the restroom! Very clean and pleasant. If only I lived or worked closer I'd come here all the time. Definitely a place to check out if you are in the city looking for a cup of coffee.  I grabbed a latte and it was really good, at the moment they are using Commonplace Coffee which is very very good."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I found this awesome coffee shop! Nice outdoor seating. Coffee was top notch. Try the cold brew!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute!!! I sat in one of their super comfy chairs and read a book. The iced latte that I ordered was delicious. The barista was super friendly. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Oh boy...I walked in and was oh wow how cute is this coffee spot Is a spot has a few cozy wingback chairs Comfy sofa and other assorted seats You want to sit because it's so cute I ordered the Midas touch golden tea with tumeric honey it's sweet and good  Paired it with a blueberry muffin the muffin was very moist and buttery blueberries were sort of tasteless but that happens sometimes I saw pretzels maybe I should have tried one ...next time Menu has some egg sammies and assorted coffees Come for the cute  I was there early morning and found parking right across the street  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Really glad this place opened up downtown. It fills the gap for good coffee that's actually affordable. (Sorry, 21st Street, you guys are the best but if I stopped in every day I'd go broke.)  The drinks here are good, the staff are very friendly, and it has a relaxed, chill and pretty quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"I literally signed up for Yelp just so I could offer my review of this excellent coffee shop.   1. Great price. 2. AMAZING brew--I would compare this coffee to Intelligentsia of Chicago, IL. Seriously that good, and for the price! The coffee alone merits all 5 stars, but the other stuff reinforces that. 3. Great atmosphere. Not the most spacious place but they use the space they have effectively. 4. Also delicious snacks. Delicious snacks are a must, and their chocolate chip muffin was moist.  Experience it for yourself. Seriously, I am this excited that such great coffee has opened up so close to the Burgh. Today was my first day at this place and I know that it is going to be a regular stop to and from work for me henceforth.  God bless America and see you at Gasoline Street."}
{"text":"Just a short walk from the bus lines coming into downtown, Gasoline Street Coffee is a cool place to grab some coffee and chill (or study - aren't they one and the same?)  You walk up a ramp towards the back to order your drink of choice from a wide variety of options for coffee and chai. I went for my typical hot chocolate and made a mental note to come back for the spiced chai another time. My friend and I found seats by the windows/ glass garage door and I settled into a comfortable armchair.   While waiting for my hot chocolate, I noticed the attention to detail with respect to interior design. The artwork all signed by MA on the side wall, the bicycle chains on a bright green background, and the smooth concrete floor all add to the unique feeling of a Saturday afternoon spent in your garage working on the latest project.   I enjoyed my hot chocolate which came with beautiful latte art :) and spent a few restful hours studying/planning to study :D"}
{"text":"From Florida, saw this place and drove 35 minutes to get to it.  Well worth the drive.  The atmosphere, service, coffee and food were excellent.  I am not a big coffee drinker (19 yr old is, she loved it) so the barista suggested the seasonal drink and it was great.  I will visit every time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee shop. I really enjoy going here because the decor creates a relaxing atmosphere in my opinion. All drinks are reasonably priced and the staff is very nice and professional. They make a really great London Fog as well! This is definitely a must try place for anyone looking for a cool coffee hangout."}
{"text":"So I'm walking down First Ave on my way to traffic court (Mondays, amirite?) thinking to myself how I'm SO in need of a good coffee to prep myself for this day.  And then, seemingly out of nowhere, I see it - calling my name from across the street is a coffee shop.  The name kind of threw me off but I didn't let that deter me.  I made the detour and crossed my fingers that this would be exactly what I needed.    As soon as you step inside, you're greeted by a variety of seating options - couches, bar style, and even some recycled cinema seats - and in the back and up a small ramp is where you order.  I was pleasantly surprised by their menu of specialty coffee drinks, smoothies, and snacks, and the prices are AMAZING.  For $4 I got a 16 oz Maple Coffee Drink (if only I could remember what it was called -_- ) and it yes, it WAS exactly what I needed that morning :).  I made myself comfy on one of their couches and just enjoyed myself for about 10 minutes before I continued to trek to Municipal Court for the morning, but that short, unexpected visit to Gasoline Street Coffee made it just a little more bearable.    My only complaint is the location.  Apparently they've been there for 2 years!?  I work downtown and am a seeker of all things local AND all things coffee, and I had no idea.  None.  I guess if you're a frequent court-goer (not judging.) it's a prime spot.  But, unfortunately (I guess?) I am not and so my visits to Gasoline Street Coffee will be few and far between.  However, if you find yourself fighting that parking ticket or arguing the fact that you were caught driving 40 miles over the speed limit, I highly suggest skipping DD or Starbucks for the day and paying these guys a quick visit."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for local businesses with a great backstory, so of course I love this place. I was introduced to Gasoline Street Coffee Co. by a Post-Gazette article in January 2016. It's named after the side street perpendicular to where the business sits on First Avenue. The building used to be a loading dock and the gasoline theme comes from the diesel trucks that used to idle by the dock to pick up freight.  The interior's gasoline theme is executed wonderfully. Quirky decor, high ceilings, and exposed brick provide a nice backdrop to the three distinct seating areas which give the whole space a laid-back feel. While I didn't have time to sit down, the furniture and layout look comfy and inviting. There's plenty of outdoor seating on the patio as well.  My americano tasted great and the barista was warm and friendly! The whole experience is definitely worth the 10 minute walk from my work."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for our morning caffeine.  We had never been on the part of 1st Avenue where Gasoline Street Coffee is located but it was on the Pittsburgh Coffee Passport and so we decided to stop.  Once we found parking the first thing I noticed was that they had some outdoor seating.  We then proceeded inside and what a cool space it was!  Giant Texaco and Gulf signs on brick walls , an old school gas pump with everything from a leather couch to theater seats made this place really unique.  Almost everything was gas themed as well including some of the condiment bottles on the table.  This is probably the best decorated place that I have been to in a long time.  With our Coffee Passport we were given a couple of options for our drinks and my wife went with their car-a-van latte while I went with the London Fog Latte.  My London fog latte consisted of earl grey tea, honey, vanilla and milk while my wife's consisted of espresso, cardamom syrup, vanilla and house spices.  Both were absolutely delicious and I loved that they were sweet without being overly so.  With mine specifically I could still taste the tea but got some sweetness from the honey and vanilla while the milk added some nice texture to it.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  As a matter of a fact I think that my wife and I have found our new go to coffee shop for lazy Saturday Mornings!"}
{"text":"This place is right near my work, so I decided to forgo my normal breakfast routine and try it out. Service was speedy, i had a egg and cheese plain bagel in my true Plain Jane nature, and a chai latte. Latte was served right under a piping hot temperature, which I LOVED because i enjoyed it immediately while I waited for my bagel. Then, I heard a microwave beep. Instant loss of stars in my mind. I don't know which part of my sandwich was microwaved.. When i tried the bagel, the eggs were okay, and the cheese didn't have a strong flavor. I'm hoping it wasn't premade or dethawed but it kind of has that flavor."}
{"text":"I believe all the great reviews of Gasoline Street Coffee. It was just unfortunate that on a Saturday morning, there was only one barista who also prepared the food. I waited over 30 minutes for two customers ahead of me before I finally got my latte and breakfast sandwich. Sadly, my coffee tasted burnt. The sandwich was great! Loved the ambience and unique decor of the place."}
{"text":"You absolutely can't go wrong with Gasoline Street Coffee. This turned into my almost-daily caffeine stop. Baristas are friendly, coffee is top notch, and the atmosphere is both hip and welcoming. Don't forget to ask for a punch card!"}
{"text":"My friend has been raving about this place for a while, so I was happy to finally check it out.   The location is a little off the beaten path, but with a bike rental place across the street, it will be the perfect summer hot spot for those looking to liven up with some caffeine before a city bike stroll.   I loved the aesthetic on the inside. The decór lives up to its unique name, even down to the gas-pump art installations on the interior walls. There was plenty of seating, and what I appreciated most about this place was how every cluster of seating had a different vibe to it: high top and low top seatings, tall stools and couches, ground level and elevated seating. It's the perfect coffee shop to do some afternoon work while sipping on some coffee.   They had your typical espresso drinks + drip coffee + tea options, plus an even longer list of out-of-the-box drink specials.   Why four stars instead of five? If you're traveling by car it is very difficult to find affordable parking during the week. Weekends are much better since garage fees are drastically reduced.   Special perk: they have several food options at a super affordable price (including breakfast sandwiches and soft pretzels to name a couple)."}
{"text":"Nice relaxed atmosphere. Excellent coffee. Delicious food from local vendors.  You can't go wrong stopping in for a great cup of coffee and a bite to eat!!!"}
{"text":"My search for good coffee in Pittsburgh led me to here and I have to say the service is REALLY good.  We got a fantastic barista who quickly realized we weren't locals and then spent the next 10 minutes just talking to us about really cool places to visit in Pittsburgh.  He ended up recommending some amazing places to look and admire.  So I have to give him a particular shout out for being great.  As for the cafe, I really loved how they took the decor and just went crazy went with it.  The place is open and has a lot of great comfortable seating among a lot of really interesting 'car' and 'gasoline' paraphernalia.  You can easily find a cozy sofa seating and relax if you wanted.   The place is one of the better places I've been to and far faaaar more interesting than the sterile corporate places that have no personality.  It is off the core downtown area but it isnt so hard to get and there is a lot of parking nearby.    We grabbed a few iced things since it was pretty hot that day... an iced Chai Charger and also an Iced Brew to go.    Iced Chai Charger - mildly spiced tea with a shot of espresso to get that caffeine kick going.  I do appreciate how they didnt overload it with sugar but still had enough to temper the black the tea.  I did find the spices on the light side and could have used more tea flavour too.  It's a pretty good drink if you don't want an overwhelming strong flavour.  4/5  Iced Brew - It comes in a pretty cool looking bottle and quite a generous amount too for only $5.  Ice brew should be always less bitter and acidic than brewed coffee. This one was more smoother than a normal brewed.  I found it a bit light on the coffee flavour though but still a nice refreshing drink.  3.5/5  Overall, great place with really amazing service.  A very good spot to hunt out if you're looking for coffee and near the end downtown core."}
{"text":"Bedecked with gasoline and gas station paraphernalia, this place has a super interesting vibe! Seating, however, is very limited. There are 4 tables and enough seating for around 8 people. The coffeeshop, furthermore, is not particularly easy to get to. I do not recommend coming to this coffeeshop if your intention is to get work done.   However, they do make a decent latte and compared to other coffee shops in downtown and therefore they stand a notch above. The location and space are just a bit inconvenient."}
{"text":"This place rules. Randomly found it online, and was super please when I checked it out. Wife and I had cold brew, lemonade, apple hand-pie, and a chocolate chip cookie. Everything that we had was killer. The atmosphere is awesome as well. On days with nice weather, they open the garage door that leads onto the front patio. Check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"Charming coffee shop tucked away in a corner of downtown Pittsburgh. The location is bit more inconvenient to get to, but I'm telling ya, it's worth the few extra steps! True to its name, you feel like you're walking right into a garage or gas station. There's a cute patio area with plenty of seating as well as couches to lounge on inside. The staff are wonderful - so friendly and approachable. I stuck with a simple drip coffee while my friend got a cold brew. Definitely one of the strongest I've had! High quality coffee with a bold, rich taste and it even comes at a good price. I am an instant fan!"}
{"text":"Business traveller just passing through, who's never willing to waste time or money at underwhelming places. That's why I hand-picked Gasoline Street! Cosy open space with the hip concrete floor, garage door and live edge wood thing going for it. Sustainable vibe with all the locally-sourced and locally-roasted. Best of all, owner(s) who genuinely want to meet others and spread good spirit. Went in for a coffee and a work spot, left with a bag of beans and a go-to hangout if I ever get back to Pitt. Try this place!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this coffee shop!  Their drinks are so creative and delicious. I ordered the Midas Touch: lemon, ginger tea, turmeric, honey and steamed coconut milk. It was incredible! I'm not a coffee drinker so this was the perfect drink!  They also offer many different espressos, coffees, nitro-brews and more! They also serve baked goods, sandwiches and other tasty things.   I love the atmosphere and how quiet it is. I got all of my graphic design homework done here! I enjoyed the welcoming feeling and how laid back it was. I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am so jealous of everyone who works around this coffee shop. It is honestly my ideal shop. It's comfy, inviting and has great beverage choices. I came here by default, because my seamstress is located upstairs, the first time I was here. I didn't take much time to hang out, so I didn't feel justified in writing a review.   But yesterday I finally spent some time in the actual coffee shop. It was such a pleasant experience! There's tons of comfy couches, chairs and tables for you to sit at. There's even an adorable little room with 4 seats if you want a more private meeting space.   I am super particular with chai mixes and love when a shop creates their own. Let this be said, people need to retire the Oregon Chai brand, it is gross and too sweet. So Gasoline Street makes their own blend and while not as spicy as I would like, I think everyone would be happy with the mix they make. It was really well balanced. They also have almond milk, which I appreciate. I also was relieved to purchase some fresh fruit and a delicious peanut butter granola bar from a PA brand I'd never heard of.   They really work the theme too, with lots of touches from old gas stations everywhere you look. I'm a sucker for good design, and they are experts. Parking is the only downside. I would come here weekly if there were better parking options. I literally stalked a parking spot in front of the shop and just waited until a car left. I just researched it more now and realized the First Ave Parking garage should be right in front of it... So I will have to investigate and update!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop for A) the coffee and food and B) the motif! They've done a good job with the gasoline/fuel theme and have tons of great vintage (vintage look a like) signs, pumps, and toys around the shop. Both they're cold brew and drip are on point. They're pretzels are great too and you can get it as a bun on the breakfast sandwiches. The only downside is that it's a little out of the way but that's what gives this place such a unique space."}
