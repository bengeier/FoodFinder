{"text":"I just paid $33 for an overcooked ribeye in a place with VFW-style decor. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Best steak in Madison! It has a great family atmosphere and also has great food. The portions are big and the staff is very friendly. It has a old rustic feel to it. The filet mignon is great and so are the hash-browns!"}
{"text":"Who would even know if the food was good?  Our party of 10 got up and left. It's good to have friends.  The service was a nightmare.  The waiter accused me, a hearing impaired person, of being drunk because of my speech.  He treated me like I was some floozie  and all I was trying to do was communicate.  I am a human. The manger came over but was no better. I have never felt so humiliated. I felt I ruined my friend's birthday party. It was such an degrading experience for me. They were unkind and really just mean people.  Shame on them."}
{"text":"We were very dissatisfied with the service we had for dinner tonight. We went here for a birthday and were excited to try Smokys for the first time.  Everything started out great and we had no complaints. I ordered the prime rib medium rare and so did my friend. When the steaks came out they were noticeably WELL done. Gray, dry, and chewy. I mentioned to the waiter that they were well done and his response was \"well those are our last two pieces of prime rib and I told the chefs to try and make them as rare as possible.\" When he realized that the steaks couldn't be medium rare why didn't he tell us right away so we could order something else? They also declined reducing the price of the overdone (I mean really overdone prime rib) steaks from our bill. We each only ate about 3 bites of our steaks and could not finish the rest.   I should also mention that they push the hash browns as your potato side because \"they are their specialty\". They didn't tell us that they are actually served family style (one small plate of hash browns to share). They also were mushy and unsalted.  I really like to give restaurants a second chance but I can't in this case. I left the restaurant feeling very embarrassed and uncomfortable because of the poor customer service."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for fifteen years, and try to return when I can now that I live far away. My parents, who still live in town, come about once a month and are treated like royalty by Reno and Martini Bob at the bar. The club has recently remodeled, so much of the old kitsch is gone, but it is also a cleaner, more modern space. The sweet, attentive servers are still there.    These are excellent steak house steaks. There is fish and chicken for non-beef eaters, but not much for real vegetarians. The entrees come as part of a three course meal, including relish tray, soup, salad, and potato -- get the hashbrowns, the hashbrowns are excellent. I always have the same thing (new york strip, hasbrowns, soup, salad with french rocquefort dressing). It has always been excellent (maybe with one visit when it was just good). Consistent excellence for years and years is what Smoky's provides."}
{"text":"Smoky's is a traditional Wisconsin Supper Club, but it's reputation may have outlasted the actual experience.   My dinner mate and I both ordered the most expensive steak on the menu and it was not exceptional. In fact, half of mine was so grizzled that I took it home...& fed it to my dogs the next morning.   I wish this local establishment the very best, but it will have to step up it's game to compete with Madison's emerging restaurants. Drinks at the bar were well made and strong; average wait time 45-60 minutes on Saturday night."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite steak houses. I have been to St. Elmo's in Indianapolis and this is on par. The steak is so good at Smoky's, its worth the trip. I don't give many 5 star reviews, but this one earned it. The hashbrowns are worth it by themselves....."}
{"text":"Smoky's is truly a gem.  Great place to take out of town guests for a kitschy, memorable meal. Martini Bob makes martinis that are out of this world.  The James Bond martinis are worth the trip alone... from anywhere in the country!"}
{"text":"Great old local restaurant, generous portions, good service...walleye was outstanding, chicken dumpling soup was very good, would love to have a bowl on a cold day..."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Smoky's last night, after a long period in between. The decor had been updated which is nice, however, that's about the only positive thing I have to report.  When we got to the restaurant we were told there was a 15 Minute wait (sat night). So, we went to the bar. It was not busy..after 45 min upon approaching the hostess she said she had told us to just come back over when we were ready....odd that I had to give her my name for her list...she did not say anything like this to us. She stated she was \"sorry for the communication error\" and did nothing.  The best thing about the meal was the salad (Roquefort dressing) and the modified cottage cheese. My steak was ordered medium rare and one side was so charred it was well done. Could have sent it back as others have stated but after an hour and 45 min, we had it. The meat was not seasoned and was bland. My husband has prepared steak MUCH better than this.  If we wouldn't have had a gift certificate we would have left with the hostess oversight. We won't ever be back again and wouldn't recommend dining here to anyone. Too many other choices in Madison that are stellar compared to the service and quality of food we received."}
{"text":"On a friend's recommendation (and despite the deservedly mixed reviews here) I stopped in for dinner.   I ordered the homemade pickled beets and the tenderloin open-face sandwich with hash browns. The bartender described the beets as being \"on the sweet side\" and he wasn't kidding. So my fault there.  The tenderloin was about an inch thick and maybe five ounces. Sadly one half of it was overcooked while the other half was done about right. The meat itself was not one of the better pieces of beef I've had in Madison.  The hash browns were the biggest disappointment though. I asked for them to be crispy. The edge and part of the bottom was charred (way beyond crispy!) while the insides were undercooked and slimy.  I could've sent the food back I suppose but I didn't have any confidence the second try would be better and didn't want to spend another 30 minutes there.  Service at the bar was reasonably attentive but I have had better meals elsewhere and won't be back. Smoky's might be a fun place to order a martini with friends but..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite steak houses around.  The meat is very high quality, but they don't over charge you for it.  A lot of the high end steak houses are quite expensive and have about the same quality.  I like Smoky's old school atmosphere.  I travel a lot and I always compare steak houses in other areas to the ones around the Madison area.  I love how much food you get for the price.  Around 40.00 can get you a nice NY Strip with potatoes, cup of clam chowder, and a salad.  You will never be disappointed here."}
{"text":"I apologize to all the Mad City natives that rave about this place, but I don't get the fascination with this dingy little restaurant My filet was good, but not a t the level of Ruth's Chris or Flemings. I like real martinis (gin, dry, and cold).  Again, Fleming's and Ruth's Chris are much better (Johnny's Italian Steakhouse still leads the pack).  All in all, a decent joint, but absolutely not the best steakhouse in the Midwest that my web searches promised before I moved here five years ago, but thanks for trying."}
{"text":"This was our first and probably last visit to Smoky's.  Drinks were good but very pricy. Relish, soup and tomato juice with lemon were the highlights tonight.  My filet Mignon was black and burnt on one side and lightly seared on the other.  We ordered mushrooms as a topping and they arrived in a greasy pool of butter with no other seasoning. The onion ring appetizer was also flavorless.  Hard to make onions flavorless but they were.  The hashbrowns were cooked on one side and turned out onto a plate raw side down resulting in barely warm potato pieces drowning in butter.  Also very bland and greasy.  My husband's prime rib was mostly fat.  The bill for all of this blandness was $120.00.  Service was friendly but no one said thank you or good evening when we left.  One of the picture frames above a booth in front of us had old butter smeared on the frame.  Gross.  Holes in the bathroom wall stuffed with toilet paper was also a major turn-off.  Definitely not the experience we were expecting."}
{"text":"How long has it been since I went to Smoky's? Since before they took all the \"stuff\" off the ceiling and walls. (Long-time Madisonians will know what I mean by \"stuff.\") It was the best place in town for a steak (pre Tornado and Delmonico's) and was packed pretty much every night. Now, the memorabilia is gone and nostalgia - and martinis - are pretty much all that's holding Smoky's together.  We started with cocktails. I found the martini menu overwhelming, so it was a Templeton rye old-fashioned for me and a Korbel old-fashioned for him. He said it wasn't sweet enough, I thought it was perfect. (I hate a too-sweet old-fashioned.)   The meal still starts with relishes (carrots, celery, radishes and green onions) and a so-so bread basket. The salad has been upgraded slightly - where it used to be all iceberg, the greens are slightly more mixed now. Still a single slice of cucumber and one cherry tomato, though. Yeah, it's basic - but it made me smile in an \"oh, the charm of an old-time supper club\" way. I had the soup - a very nice butternut squash bisque that was perfectly creamy and nicely seasoned. My companion had the tomato juice.  Our entrees were good, but not spectacular. He ordered a T-bone steak, medium rare. I ordered the fried walleye. (I love steak but we decided to mix it up so we could share two different main courses.) One of us ordered hash browns, the other got the steamed veggies. The steak was flavorful, but it was more medium than medium rare. (Kind of hard to tell visually, since Smoky's is as dark as it ever was, but I could tell by how it chewed.) My walleye had a lovely, light batter, but I have a small tip for the kitchen: season the fish before you batter it. I know walleye has a delicate flavor, but a little salt and pepper wouldn't be amiss. The hash browns were as good as ever. The veggies...well...they were steamed broccoli and carrots. Not much to say, except that they were cooked just right. Not too crunchy, not mushy.  I guess my biggest quibble is that, for a $100 dinner (including two cocktails and a glass of wine), I expect at least one \"wow\" moment. The best I can say about our dinner at Smoky's is that it was \"fine.\" Not memorable. Not, \"Gosh, have I missed this place.\" Just...solid."}
{"text":"I eat at Smokey's Club once or twice a year. I've never had a bad meal. I've had a few meals that were average.  In the fall and winter I go there often for martinis. Martini Bob and Reno are masters of the martinit. I personally like the James Bond martini and the Vesper martini (which is the original 007 martini as described in the novel \"Casino Royale\".   I enjoy the bar as a nice place to enjoy a quiet drink with friends."}
{"text":"There's something about a place when the staff have been there since the beginning. They could retire, but they don't want to. That says volumes.   We had fish fry (cod) and it was one of the best I've had in Sconnie. It's not AYCE, which is fine by me (lest you add pounds). Thick cuts and not dry or greasy, perfectly cooked. Smoky's serves hands-down the best clam chowder I ever had and FANTASTIC hash browns. True to the classic supper club tradition, you get a fresh veggie \"relish tray\" with your dinner but the pickled beets are extra. I have never had the cottage cheese side, another classic relish tray component, cuz I'm not dieting. Here cc is mixed with chopped green onions and caraway--a great taste combination and makes it something to actually look forward to.   There is a huge book of martinis and ice cream drinks made by master bar manager Martini Bob, who has his own web site listing all his fabulous concoctions. He's been with Smoky's 30 years and it shows, he's a true mixologist, an artist and a scientist, who has created, with his customers, a hundredvariations. We got the extra from the shaker in a small glass on both counts (martinis and ice cream drink). Since I was with 3 peeps we all shared several martinis for a taste-a-thon  and I don't remember which ones we had--but Bob kept 'em coming and all were fantastic. Tho out of towners, we had to join the Martini Bob club too.   Six stars."}
{"text":"Yum! Old school steak house. Great filet & drinks!"}
{"text":"Looking to experience Madison's supperclub scene of the 70s? You're in the right place. The food, the staff, the atmosphere -- all seem to sadly refer to a simpler time, when restaurants were filled with smoke and Mayor Soglin was serving his first term in office. The food was nothing special and served up exactly as it was in 1975. We've moved on. Smokey's hasn't.   I wish I could be kinder, as Smokey's was once a legendary spot."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to try it one more time... It was much better the 3rd time around. This time I made sure to ask for my salad dressing on the side and ordered the grilled salmon with baked potato. I did get my potato this time and it was very hot which is always good. My salmon was also hot and very good. My husband was pleased with his meal as well. After dinner we had Martini Bob make me a grapefruit martini which was delicious! No hurry to go back again as it was just OK. Maybe just for a martini next time."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We walked in at 6pm on Friday and were told they were full from the night. Restaurant was 80 percent empty but that's fine. Asked if we could sit at the bar and eat and were told a limited menu. Could we see one? Rude lady at front counter wouldn't get us a menu and said it was up to the bar enters whether they were too busy to serve food. Considering the place was mostly empty this seemed unlikely. Walked over to bar to request a menu. He explained it was a bar menu only. Ok...can we see it please? 10 minutes later no menu had shown up. We left. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Poor quality food, bad service, high price, filthy bathrooms."}
{"text":"Bacon bloody Mary martini!  A must if you like bloody mary's...skip the food but you must try the martini!"}
{"text":"Swanky little place. I personally would prefer a little more lighting, but it was also a cold rainy day when we came so I'm sure that didn't help.   I came here with my family for a drink and appetizers. Small selection of appetizers, but literally some of the tastiest, squeakiest fried cheese curds I've had in a long time! Yum!  Each table gets some fresh veggies and a bread basket. Love the veggies.   For drinks, I ordered a blue lagoon and my mom got a bloody Oscar. I rarely drink, so my martini was a little strong for my liking but tasty nonetheless. And the Bloody Oscar looked down right tasty. So many veggies and bacon infused vodka!!  I'm cheap and frugal most days, so I'm not sure I would order an entree here ... But to come for a drink and an app, it's not bad. Also, Richard is the best waiter!! He's so sweet and cute. Friendly, prompt, and attentive. Make sure to ask for him :)"}
{"text":"I have never eaten at Smoky's. This is a review of Smoky's as a Martini Bar.  As a martini bar, it is freaking awesome. There are 90 \"Martinis\" on the menu. They are all $10. What I love is that the charming and talented bartender, Bob, pours all the extra booze into a side glass for you. In short, these are stiff, well mixed, large martinis with top notch ingredients.   Remember, Winston Churchill said, \"Martinis are like breasts. One is not enough a three is too many.\" Please drink carefully! I've seen people make poor decisions after their second Smoky's martini, and I, personally feel that 3 martinis at Smoky's could land me in the hospital.   I agree that the atmosphere is a little questionable for an expensive meal, but for martinis, it's great. Dark with unobtrusive music."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star I would. :-( Terrible terrible service, \"out\" of every alcoholic beverage/ beer we ordered. Soda arrived tasting funny and very flat. Stale crackers and a hard as a rock bread basket. Resturant was dirty with cobwebs hanging, looked like no one had really cared for a while. $40-50 steaks in a dirty restaurant with bad service?????  Needless to say we left before we ordered dinner, the amount for our drinks was refunded to us by the manager. Very disappointing. Not the old Smoky's I remember by a stretch! We left and went to Flemings a couple blocks away and had the best steak ever!!"}
{"text":"Meh is right... rude service, ok steaks at best. they even tried to charge me for an extra side of hash browns that we never received."}
{"text":"Wonderful filet. Great service. Clam chowder was real/good. Margaritas on the rocks good. Veggies and bread also nice to start is nice. Soup and salad not one or other."}
{"text":"I really didn't know what to expect. I drive by Smoky's Club every week and it easily goes unnoticed. Coming here was like meeting the quiet kid in the back and realizing this was the most interesting person in the room.   I almost ordered the veggie lasagna, but then my red wine came so I went for steak. The steak comes sizzling on a metal platter. You can salt and pepper it if you like, but what more do you need than well-sizzled meat. A relish bucket filled with ice, crunchy radishes, carrots, celery, and curling scallions will sit at your table for dipping into between bites of steak. Is this what eating is supposed to be like? I have not yet lived.    They have a house Roquefort dressing, which is like french dressing with chunks of blue cheese. Another house specialty, their hashbrowns, come round, crispety and buttery. The tables are uncluttered, no caddies hovering with crusty A1 bottles, as this place keeps it classy. And the napkins were so soft. Is it paper? Is it cloth?   I haven't gotten to the best part -- the attention to service. No small talk, just an announcement of the soup and featured vegetable of the day. When soup arrived, the bowl was carefully turned so the spoon was facing my dominant hand. We were asked minimal questions like, \"do you have everything you need?\" at which point we did request ketchup and it came promptly and with purpose. Our waters were filled in comfortable silence. No desserts or drinks were pushed on us. No lecture on how hot the plate would be. It's hard to describe the absence of something, but we were treated like people with sense and autonomy, and it was glamorous. As we left, I wondered if this place could be the Ritz-Carlton of steakhouses.   Or...just a regular supper club. Had I been living under a rock?"}
{"text":"Was not impressed. Started out at the bar and had a good experience. It all went wrong once we got to our table. The waiter was horrible! Older gentleman, if I can even call him a gentleman, in his 50's, greater than six feet tall, and grey hair. Just nothing but a jerk and not helpful. It's one of those situations where you knew he looked at our crew and decided he wasn't going to be helpful. When I ordered there was a choice between broiled and fried walleye. I asked, \"What do you recommend?\" He said, \"Well, one is broiled and one is fried.\" Yeah, I could tell that by the description, jackass. I was asking what was popular or suggested by the chef. That was the way the whole night went with this guy. If I managed that place and saw any of this he would be gone! The worst part is that I really don't know why we got that kind of treatment. Discrimination, I would guess. He seemed like he was trying to be helpful to the table next to us. Anyway, the steak needed salt! What?! I've never seasoned a steak at those prices before...never! I had to salt and pepper the steak. Trust me, you will cook a better steak than this at home unless you microwave it. The walleye, fried, was pretty awesome though. The clam chowder was also unique. If you go, check those things out. Otherwise, don't waste your time. It sad, too. The place looks so cool. Maybe just go have a drink. The only saving grace is that the waiter screwed up the bill so bad that nobody paid for drinks. For such a smart-ass, the guy wasn't the brightest on the block."}
{"text":"Madison does it better than this.   My steak was cooked to order, if under-seasoned. The meat itself was a little tougher than I'm used to. Maybe they don't age their beef?   The salad was great, with large chunks of fresh vegetables.   The cheese curds were a joke. Maybe I'm spoiled, but it seems like most fancy-type places in the area try and do something to set their curds apart--varying the size or the sauce or even wrapping them in bacon. Smoky's uses the regular bulk stuff, around what you'd get at a culver's or A&W but with a 12$ price tag, and I'm not sure why they're on the menu.   I also ordered the cheesecake, which was small and unassuming but had some flavor."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. My friend had perch so bad could not eat it. Waiter response, same perch as we always serve.  My walleye was tasteless. Green beans uncooked"}
{"text":"It is impossible to imagine how this place is still in business.  Possible my biggest dining disappointment ever.  Ridiculous crummy tavern atmosphere.  Food that I'd be disappointed to make for myself at home, and I'm not much of a cook.  No conceivable reason to come here."}
{"text":"This isn't our first choice for steak, but it was pretty average.   We enjoyed the breaded mushrooms. A lot. The breading itself was actually seasoned well. My wife had the 12 oz rib eye. It was medium-rare as she requested, but the flavor was just okay for her. She had a side of vegetables, which was steamed cauliflower, yellow squash, and zucchini. I think she liked the vegetables more than the steak. The salmon was barely average. I ordered a side of hash browns, which had a good amount of crisp and not too greasy.   The theme for the night was the sides were better than the entrees. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best steaks I have ever eaten in my 76 years of life. My only problem is that I don't live close enough to go there regularly. I have only been able to eat there on business trips. I rarely give any restaurant 5 stars but this place deserves it. The steaks are special."}
{"text":"this place as awesome steaks drinks are good too but i dont drink any more so i go by food and this is worth the drive 1 hour form my place"}
{"text":"Ok, ya gotta love, \"old school\" supper clubs, and this one is absolutely it!  Great steaks, great drinks and excellent service.  This place is a classic!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails and the food was incredible. There were 7 of us and we each were thrilled with every aspect of our dish. They were delicious. And the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Love the history (my father-in-law worked as a bus boy when he was a kid) and the ambiance. Come hungry, because you won't be able to eat it all otherwise! SO MUCH FOOD, which is great. I love the relish dish is a fun starter. The steaks are delicious! The staff is very friendly and helpful. Don't forget to try a grasshopper."}
{"text":"My wife and I have started a new Wisconsin adventure in the state, find the best supper clubs, and Smoky's is the first on in Madison that we tried.  I use to live near this place many years ago. I remember it being packed on Friday and Saturday nights, but the day we went, during prime time, I think there was maybe 20 people max.  The food was good, not great. My steak was not cooked how I liked it, and was pan fried not grilled. The sides were good, but had better.  Times must be hard for Smoky's, wont even give you a refill on your soda without charging you again; $6 for 2 sodas? No thanks. The friends we ate with were telling my wife and I that they came here about 10 year ago and it was WAY better, both food and atmosphere. It's sad really, it looks like it could have been a sweet place at one time, but has since lived far to long on what was working for them in the past and have not changed since."}
{"text":"I have to say, I don't get it.   $30+ for bread, a mediocre salad, veggies, soup, horrible prawns, a poor baked potato and a half decent steak in Madison? There has got to be better steak for cheaper elsewhere...   And table salt and table pepper? Sorry, but if you're trying to be serious about meat, you've in the least got to have some sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper.   The beer selection was OK, but you can get the same stuff elsewhere at places that have better food.  I don't know... I've heard that supper clubs are big in the Midwest, and that this place offers a quintessential experience, but maybe I'm just too much of a urbanite-city boy-hipster to enjoy this."}
{"text":"I'm torn.  I really wanted to love this place.  Atmosphere is great.  Old school supper club feel.  Service is excellent.  We really enjoyed the relish bowl, bread and salad.  The tomato bisque soup was lick the bowl delicious!  We were just not impressed with our steak.  We both ordered a filet cooked medium.  It was cooked to perfection.  However, it lacked any flavor.  The hash browns were good, but very oily.   The one thing that prevents me from giving this place at least 4 stars is that they had two women handing out \"free flowers\" to the ladies on Valentine's day.  Of course this flower came with a caveat.  Fill out a form and we will call you for a day of pampering with Mary Kay.  This is a pricey place to eat.  I do not want to be bothered with a cheesey flower followed by a sales pitch.  Tacky to say the least.  I would go back here for drinks at the bar, but I would not spend my money here for a steak."}
{"text":"I have been going to Smoky's club for many years and have always had excellent service and food. The bar is a nice place to start and we had good service there as well. Granted there are some new faces behind the bar now but some of the food servers have been there for decades and are real pros. Unfortunately our server  on this Friday night was not on the A team. This guy forgot to bring the relish bowl out with the raw carrot and stuff to begin with. That has never happened before! We had to ask for bread and he couldn't remember who had what throughout the nigh. We also had to rubber neck for ten minutes to get the bill and another ten to pay it. He ruined the evening for us. The good thing is that the food was excellent, except for the salad. That was a few pieces of lettuce with enough dressing on it for one four times bigger. All four salads were like that. Again the steaks and Walleye was very good and the hash browns excellent. I tried to contact the manager direct and not use YELP but when you click on \"contact us\" its the same number as the regular phone number. A server like that can kill your business and I wanted to point that out to whoever manages Smoky's now but couldn't. Oh well, I tried. It is a little pricey now but they have the best rib eye in Madison and most of there other steaks are excellent as well. Give it a shot if in the mood for a good steak and hope you don't get the waiter that we did."}
{"text":"Went there with my family after a thirty year absence. It was all I remembered. Less clutter though.( last time we were there Crazy Legs Hursh  was drinking at the bar) hash brown omg. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"It's dark, it's old, it's classic. No need to change, every city worth its name needs an original restaurant that time forgot. That is what Smoky's Club is. The good news is that the quality of the food is pretty good. And the service is very old-skool professional, welcoming of our Saturday night walk-in party of four.   I've been a couple of times and can recommend the steak. NY Strip, Ribeye, and Filet Mignon all have been very good, always ordered medium rare. Also the jumbo shrimp. Good portions and a decent steak house value with potato, soup, and salad included. Salad is a simple affair but the French Roquefort dressing is a standout. Bread basket needs some work. The toasted bread is good but the fresh loaves could stand to be upgraded. Hash browns are terrific. The sauteed mushrooms are whole and at $4 half the price of new fangled steakhouse prices.  We haven't made it to the desserts because each time we've been too full. Other than a couple glasses of wine, we've haven't had any bar experience. But the drinks going by looked good.  With the Avenue Bar gone upscale and corporatized, Smoky's is one of the last of the old guard Madison restaurants. Enjoy it while we can. Fortunately the food makes it easy to dig the ambience."}
{"text":"My mother-in-law wanted to go to a steak restaurant \"Not overwhelmed by people there for Friday fish fry.\" She got exactly what she wanted at Smokey's Club. One of the main reasons we chose this restaurant was because none of the other steak places we called would take reservations - and when you're celebrating 88 years old, you don't want to wait in the lobby. So kudos for still taking reservations!  They put out edible centerpieces with radishes, carrots, green onions and celery, which was cute and nice to nibble on, but could have used a dipping sauce. I had the lasagne which was smothered in a very tasty red sauce. A friend had a broiled chicken breast which was - just a broiled chicken breast. It was dry and bland, but I had so much red sauce we added some to his plate which he enjoyed much more.  Others had steak which they all enjoyed. I don't know what a steak is supposed to cost at a restaurant, so forgive my ignorance, but several of us thought that $34-46 for a steak was a bit much. It probably isn't so my review stars are not based on this.  We were a party of nine and the service was attentive, courteous and not overbearing. Two of our party arrived quite late but the waiter got their order in right away and it delivered not long after the main group that had ordered earlier.  Main reason for 3 stars is I found the menu limited. The bread basket had 7-8 pieces of fresh bread and then a lot of deep fried \"crouton-like\" bread - tasty but a variety of rolls would have been nicer.   It's a nice place and we enjoyed ourselves, but I wouldn't go back. 3 stars is \"A-OK\" and that's exactly the way I felt about Smokey's Club."}
{"text":"The best martini list I have ever seen--the menu is thicker than the Monday New York Times. Martinis range from sweet to tart and spicy with a lot of great variation. The portions are extremely generous. After 1 I was in probably one of the best moods I've ever been in. A friend described the martinis as \"betch bomb good\". I'm not sure what that means but I agree.   Atmosphere is relatively quiet and laid back. There is enough room for a party or a small group of friends.   And on the plus side, it's easy to reach and on a bunch of bus lines (safe driving!).   I love this place"}
{"text":"Excellent steaks in a classic steakhouse atmosphere. Everything included for one price, refreshing. Fantastic martinis and desserts!"}
{"text":"Tradition is the best word for this place.  I've been going since I was able to eat.  I always try and make it here when I visit Madison.  Okay so maybe 1 or two of the stars is for nostalgia.  Who knows.  I like this place."}
{"text":"I went to Smoky's for a drink with a few friends last night, and it was our first time there (we had heard great things about their martini menu). The atmosphere was great, but the service and drinks were the complete opposite.  I asked the bartender if we could order an appetizer, and he said \"we're slammed,\" and walked away. I thought it was a joke because others at the bar were being served appetizers and it wasn't very busy, but he didn't come back to try to take our order.  Later, other bar goers started getting ice cream drinks that looked fantastic. I asked the other bartender what it was, and her first words were \"dear God, please don't order one, I don't want to have to make another one.\" The two bartenders were both visibly and audibly frustrated to be working there last night, they were complaining to us and other patrons, and it rubbed off on our whole experience. I would not recommend sitting at the bar.  The martinis were also incredibly subpar for being $12 each. Go to Cento or Merchant for a cocktail instead."}
{"text":"Has a really old school supper club feel to it.  Service was average.  Decent beer selection, but two of the three times I've been there they were out of a few beers that were on the list.  I don't want to sit there and be denied two or three times before I finally chose a beer they have.  The food is good, but over-priced in my opinion.  A steak will run you $30-35"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here recently for his birthday. The place itself definitely looks like a low key supper club, but the waitstaff and food make the experience. It is a little on the pricey side, but the portions are fair. (And delicious!) Our waiter was excellent, and most of the staff thanked us for coming as we left after our meal. The menu itself was able to cater to both my steak-loving partner and vegetarian self.  I highly recommend the veggie lasagna!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best steak house around Madison. Outstanding food and service for reasonable prices. We always come back."}
{"text":"I didn't think this place was all that great. The food was mediocre, the menu boring and service just ok. While I wouldn't say it was a horrible experience, i didn't really leave the place desiring to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner.  I love how steak houses and supper clubs don't seem to change. The decor and atmosphere is still a very 50s and 60s feel - very Mad Men.   The relish dish was fairly plain, just some radishes, celery, and carrots on ice. I ordered a brandy old fashioned which was well concocted. I ordered a 12 oz ribeye and he ordered a prime rib. All the dinners came with a salad, soup/tomato juice, and choice of potato/mixed vegetables. It was a substantial amount of food. The soup of the day was ham and pea and quite yummy. The waiter had told us that the hash browns was their specialty, which the bf ordered. Nicely crispy on the outside and soft potatoes on the inside, but more of a thicker hash brown than a really thin and crispy one.   My 12oz ribeye came on a sizzling metal plate with beautifully seared outside, and the prime rib came on a regular plate. I found it under seasoned. Compared to other steak houses in Madison, this was a disappointment.   Perhaps it was just an off night and I'd be interested in returning to give them another try."}
{"text":"Five stars for the martinis ALONE. The martini menu here is the most extensive I've ever seen. The best one I've had to date was a delicious chocolate raspberry martini. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I haven't had a full dining experience here, but I've tried their bar food. It's yummy, especially if you're drunk, haha."}
{"text":"A very mediocre dinner earlier this evening.   Martini Bob may be an icon here but he was clearly overtaxed when we ordered our drinks and was flustered and irritating.  A very poor way to start an evening.   Retire.   The evening was not much better after that.   Our waiter was either overtaxed (though the club was not particularly busy) or uninterested.   Service was slow.  The bread in the basket was stale and hard.    In our party of 6 no one was excited by their dinners which included the Saturday prime rib, scallops, surf n turf, and a steak.   My prime rib was inferior in quality though it was done correctly.   Just not a good piece of meat to start with. Having been here on a number of occasions over a 15 year period this was the most dissatisfying experience.   There was nothing that would make me want to return.   So I won't!"}
{"text":"Smokey's is a neat place to dine in an atmosphere where my parents would have enjoyed going out.  The decor dates decades ago which is fun.  I recall going to dinner with my parents and loved it.  This time when I visited I had to pay the bill though and that's the difference.  The martini menu at the bar is endless if you are looking for some neat stuff before dinner.  We've been to smokey's a few times and each time I look to be wowed because everyone talks about it.  I do like the Crudités and few if any places do that today.  The bread is nice and you ARE served soup AND salad with your meal.  Who else does that?  The most recent time we were there we ordered a fillet and shrimp for one entree and pork chops for the other.  When dining out I steer away from pork because I always want a good steak.  At this outing we both thought the chops better than the steak.  The fillet was a large diameter and flat and most places have a small diameter and thick leaving the center nice and pink.  We ordered medium rare but got more of a medium.  The flavor/seasoning was good and we had another meal left over for the next day.  Dinner is pricey.  With drinks and two meals don't expect to leave spending less than $100.  On the other hand for what they provide, noted above I can see that the price provides good value.  The servers were very nice and dressed in uniforms with the men almost old school tux like.  This place had to be the classiest in Madison in its day.  For us we enjoy it for the nostalgia."}
{"text":"Glorified supper club and not in a good way.  I mean the food is ok but man, this place is expensive for what it is.    Its a bit dirty, its uninspired food, its expensive, it feels old and tired and its expensive.  Have I mentioned its not worth the price?  Its a supper club serving steaks not a steak house that looks like a supper club...  Go elsewhere for a steak experience.  You'll pay about the same price."}
{"text":"Decor is a blast from the past. I can deal with that. Server and service was mediocre. I think it was some college kid looking to make a few bucks.  For a $60/pp tab, I'd expect better.  NY strip was bland. Again for the price paid, 30 something bucks, I've had better.  OK, OK, I'd give some credit.  Unlike other nice steak joints, this place didn't charge for sides. It was included. For that, I give them 2 stars!"}
{"text":"When God created the universe on day 1, on day 8 he created the claim chowder at Smoky's. I had it and it was amazeballz. I would suggest that you go back in time to Friday December 18th at 6:30 pm and run to the back plane room turn left and grab the cup of soup from the large bald white guy next to the chimney looking thing. But I won't suggest that, because it wouldn't be just one of you. Then we would all remember the holiday riot at Smoky's back in 2015.   I asked the waiter about their pours for whiskey neat, I got knob creek. He said they were generous. I felt like orphan Annie at the orphanage and Daddy Warbucks comes in and takes me away to a life of luxury but replace Daddy with a whiskey snifter and me with Annie and Daddy cost a measly ten bucks. It might not make much sense but it was awesome.   PS steak great, salad great, atmosphere great"}
{"text":"Another review of Smoky's bar since we did not eat the food:  The drinks were amazing.  Martini Bob, the mix-master, was friendly and warm and excited.  He made me a \"Halloweenie-tini\" that consisted of pumpkin liqueur and black vodka that he floated on top.  Another Halloween-inspired martini I tried had a graham cracker crust rim and vanilla and pumpkin flavors.  Both drinks were wonderful and when there was leftover mix, he put it in a glass next to the martini.  He also gave me a garnish - a chocolate eyeball filled with peanut butter.  The banter was wonderful and the drinks were great.  It was extremely dark and it was quite obviously an octogenarian's hangout but the decor was \"delightfully tacky\" (as Bob's card boasts) in a dark room/leather bar stool kind of a way.  It was a fun spot to hit before we went to dinner and I would do it again if I wanted a great martini.  I even managed to get a vodka coozie.  No idea what I'll do with that... but it was hilarious.  Definitely 4 stars for service and product."}
{"text":"Being in Madison during a beautiful summer weekend (as opposed to our last trips when it was 0 degrees and snowing), we decided we had to experience a supper club and fish fry. We got both at Smoky's after hearing from a  local that it was a Madison tradition and had the best drinks. It did not disappoint! We started in the bar with a couple brandy old fashioned crafted by the famous \"Martini Bob\"...they were delicious. We had our daughter with us, and he crafted a kids mocktail for her in a martini glass that made her night. :)  We then continued into the dining room for our meal. Our server was so sweet and when she heard it was our first time at a supper club, really paid great attention to us. I had the fish fry (wallaye) and my husband had a steak. Both were good, but my fish as actually really yummy for fried fish (something I don't typically eat). We also started with the salad with the famous dressing, which I really enjoyed. After our meal, we went back to the bar for a cocktail, and Martini Bob worked his magic again. My husband had a grasshopper, and after telling Martini bob that I didn't care for creme-based drinks, he crafted me the most delicious coffee/chocolate martini....I still think of that cocktail two weeks later!  He also surprised our daughter with an ice cream sundae in a martini glass that made her night!!   Such a nice guy...told us about different places to check out in Madison, and gave us his card to check out some of his martini recipes online so we could make them at home.    Overall...Smoky's was not the most gourmet meal...but it was simple, good food in a cozy, non-pretentious setting. I suppose that is exactly the point of a supper club, and we completely enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"We made our trip to Smoky's on the recommendation of one of the nice staff at our hotel, who swore that this is where her family has eaten good steak for generations.  Who am I to question the dining habits of Midwesterners?  I found a description of the place in one of the Madison free magazines designed for tourists, which focused on independent restaurants, and it sounded like a fun dive, so we went.  Now, a word of advice.  Don't go out to dinner on a game day in the state capital when the Badgers have beaten Michigan State to a place that has been around since the Eisenhower administration, where grandfathers who are WU alums bring their grandkids after the game.  Don't do it.  This isn't a small place, but it was beyond packed when we got there, and we had to wait for close to an hour.  Football photos and tacky christmas lights, whorehouse-red lighting and red naugahyde covering most surfaces might give you an idea of the ambience, described in the magazine I referred to above as \"delightfully tacky\".  I don't know how delightful it was, but it was tacky.  And crowded.  And loud.  And so we waited.  We ordered drinks at the bar to while away the time.  Peter ordered  a local microbrew, and I was served the best Bloody Mary I ever had in my life, which comes standard with a small PBR chaser.  Both drinks came to $8.50, which, to my NYC perspective, made it a hell of a deal.  Get a load of what garnishes went into my drink:  One celery stalk Two huge pimiento stuffed green olives Two pickled asparagus spears Three pickled string beans One garlic pickle spear Three pickled Brussel Sprouts    Garnishes notwithstanding, it was really delicious.  The garnishes just made it more so.  As for the rest of the meal, there were highs and lows, heavier on the lows, and glimmers of what could indicate a good meal on a less busy day.  All tables get a relish tray of radishes, carrot sticks and scallions.  Not really sure why the scallions were there.  The breadbasket was horrible.  There were small melba toasts in it, thankfully, but other than being warm, the bread itself had zero to recommend it, other than being a place to put butter.  Peter ordered a decent shrimp cocktail for $10.  Entrees come with salad, soup and a veg or potato.  We both ordered the special of the day, prime rib, with Peter opting for the King cut ($28) and me opting for the Queen ($22).  I love prime rib, and was looking forward to it.  Peter also ordered sides of sauteed onions and mushrooms ($3 each).  The salad was fair, fresh, and not bad, but the dressings offered were pretty sweet and not very tasty. The signature dressing is French with Roquefort in it.  DON'T try it.  I did, and the salad went right back. The soup of the day was cream of chicken.  Normally, that sets the alarm bells off in my head, but instead of a gluey starchy gloppy sludge, I got a well-balanced, soupy soup with delicious chunks of tender chicken and a chickeny base.   The signature potato is a hash brown loaf of sorts which has a nice crispy outside but it basically bland and underseasoned shredded frozen potato underneath.  Not terrible, but not worth eating.    Now...for the prime rib.  We ordered ours medium rare.  The first dishes to come out looked gray.  When we cut into ours, there was no pink apparent.  One bite and we sent them back.  Peter's second piece of meat was textbook medium rare, and the single largest piece of beef I have ever seen served to one person.  He said it was delicious.  Mine, on the other had, was virtually raw, full of fat and gristle, and was inedible.  Sent it back again.  The third time out, I was so annoyed that when I tried to cut into it and could not get my serrated steak knife through it, I gave up.  That was three steaks I had been served, and not one was as ordered or edible.  I'm not that demanding--I would have settled for an overcooked steak at that point, but it was not to be.  As it was, the steak Peter had was very good, and on that note, I am giving Smoky's two stars.  Several tables around us were also sending back meat, so I am assuming the kitchen  was simply overwhelmed by the volume, although it isn't like this is the first football game day ever to come to Madison.    Our server was excellent and patient, and the soup and cocktail both indicated that this might indeed be a serviceable restaurant when they have time to prepare the food properly.  I don't know when I'll be in Madison again, but if I did go back and was taken to Smoky's, I will make sure not to go on a Saturday during football season."}
{"text":"I see a lot of talk about how expensive the food is. And it's not cheap. But  what you should focus on is how much food you get for that $30.   - An array of vegetables. Radishes, celery, onion and carrots. Throw a touch of salt on your plate and you'll take in some extra veggies for the day. - Basket of bread. Far more than two people need. - Salad- I recommend the ranch. I always try ranch when it's made in house. The salad isn't anything spectacular. Traditional with some cucumber, tomato and croutons.  When topped with the house made ranch, it was simple and delicious.  - Soup - I had to place it on the other side of the table to stop eating it because I was starting to get full at this point. - HUGE steaks. My significant other got the T-Bone and it was wonderful. I got the rib-eye and I should have ordered it a little less done. It was entirely my fault. It was still a good steak. - Choice of potato (among the choices, hash-browns from heaven, aka very crunchy on the outside) or vegetable of the day.  We opted for the side of mushrooms and onions, which I highly recommend. (If you like those sort of things.)  This dinner was classic. Our server was fantastic! I would go back just to see her again. What a sweet, hospitable woman who I could have sat at the bar with for ages.   By the way, we went on a Thursday night and it was practically empty. I cannot wait to get back and try a bloody!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for Smoky's for my wife's birthday.  After sitting in the bar for 45 minutes and going back to the front desk 3 times I was ready to walk out and they finally seated us.  The food was no better than Tornado 9who really seats you at the time you make a reservation) but the drinks and food are more expensive.    I will not be returning to this \"legendary\" place - it is weak and there are definitely better options."}
{"text":"Kind of surprised with the negative reviews here, as I've had reliably good experiences with Smoky's. They serve very nice steaks and their prices are quite reasonable compared to your a la carte type steakhouses.  A steak includes salad, soup and side all for one price.  They don't exactly season the meat all that much so if you're looking for a salt crust on your sirloin then you will be disappointed, but I don't mind having to use the salt & pepper shakers a tad.  You can always add salt, but there's no fixing too much of it.  Besides, there's plenty of salt to be had in the hash brown, which is by far the best side dish option as long as you're not counting calories. Overall, a good option if you want a good steak with not a lot of fuss and a reasonable price compared to say, Tornado Club."}
{"text":"Was pumped to try Smoky's after trying a number of other Wisconsin supper clubs, but it was a disappointment.  The decor was dated and walls and furniture were worn, but not in a charming, old school way where it was done deliberately to enhance the restaurant's charm (vinyl tablecloth?).  Food was good, but certainly not great, and was disappointing for the price."}
{"text":"So this is one of those places riding on the laurels of a bygone era. Has a reputation for the best steaks around. In fact it is a run down establishment with rickety chairs, uneven floors and plastic table cloths.  Prices were extremely high, the bread dry and crunchy and the relish trays stingy. The steak was average quality and unseasoned. The service was ok but I got tired of watching a waiter making gestures and faces behind a slower patron trying to get to the restroom.  At half the cost it would be ok but at premium pricing it was huge disappointment.  Spend your money elsewhere"}
{"text":"We'd been meaning to check out Smoky's for awhile now, and had the opportunity a few weekends back. After our initial plans fell through, we called Smoky's last minute on a Saturday to see if they might still have reservations available. To our surprise, they were able to get us in fairly quickly even with a extremely busy night, and they were very friendly and helpful on the phone and in person.   First off, Smoky's has the typical Wisconsin Supper Club Decor that anyone who likes supper clubs can appreciate. The restaurant and bar were buzzing with groups out, including many holiday gatherings. It has a great atmosphere.    My fiancee and I both ordered the 13 oz Top Sirloin for $33. It includes your standard relish tray and bread basket on the table, soup or tomato juice, choice of side and a salad. Trust me in saying that you will not go home hungry! I prefer my steaks a little more well done, and normally will order it medium well. My steak was cooked very similar to my fiancees who had ordered it medium, so his was probably a little more well done than it should have been. Regardless it was good and we pretty much finished everything.  The drinks menu is endless! Our server literally brought out what they called \"The Bible\" which contained pages upon pages of drinks. There are many martinis to choose from, and my dirty martini was great. They also serve ice cream drinks, so be sure to order a few cocktails to try.  Our service was great from the moment we called to the moment when our final check was brought over. This wouldn't be my go to place for steaks, BUT I'm glad we finally had a chance to try it and I'm sure we will be back sometime. Although it was just the two of us this time around, it is a great place for special occasions and group meals."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why anyone would bother eating in this place, when they clearly have the most awesome bar and bartender in the universe.  The 90+ martini menu is unbelievable, and everybody is really friendly.  The only downside is that it's so far out of downtown, but really, it prevents it from being overrun by DBs and...well, more DBs.  Martini Bob is fantastic, the drinks are super-strong, and the atmosphere is a thousand times awesome. I haven't eaten here, and I don't plan on it; I just want to drink at the bar and watch the parade."}
{"text":"I am writing about the martinis in this post.  We stopped here last night with another couple and AS ALWAYS get the best service from Master Mixologist Martini Bob!!!  It's hard to pick from his extended list of martinis.  So we just tell him what we would like and he knows EXACTLY what to whip up for us!!!  Love this place, love the staff, the owners are awesome too, but especially LOVE Martini Bob. He has a list of martinis on his website at:  www.martinibobs.com.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Honestly, Smoky's was average at best. The historical factor of the restaurant seems nice. Although, admittedly, I knew nothing about its history before going on Yelp!  First off, I'd like to say that their martini menu has a strange and eclectic variety of martinis. We got the Blue Lagoon (vodka, blue curacao, pineapple) and the Spiced Cucumber (red pepper gin, cucumber liquor). Sounds cool, right? So, it was literally straight up vodka/gin. If you're looking to get drunk, get the cocktails!  For entrees, we got the fish fry (perch) and filet mignon. For $46, the filet mignon wasn't super. It wasn't seasoned very well and the server immediately offered us A1. The fish fry tasted a lot like cumin, so also wasn't seasoned very well.  Also kind of strange, the two soups were clam chowder and tomato juice. I asked the server to repeat, and he said tomato juice. What? Maybe I just don't realize tomato juice is a soup.  Our server seemed pretty disengaged and made a bunch of assumptions about what we were saying instead of asking us to clarify."}
{"text":"Totally overpriced steak.  You get a choice steak with strains of cartilage running through it at times.  Go to Tornado if you want a steak."}
