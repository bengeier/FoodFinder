{"text":"Worst grocery store ever. Bought a PC air chilled chicken there and it was rotten before the best before date. Tried to exchange the chicken as per Loblaws customer service and instead got a lecture about how I should not expect their meats to last beyond expiry date and that I should instead buy meat from Longos. If you want to be able to actually cook with and consume your food, shop at Longos by ACC."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" grocery store, love this location, open 24 hrs and it has a big free parking lot which is great.   For being located downtown its really never that busy and they have the best roasted chickens !  And its very close to my favourite LCBO located 1 block away."}
{"text":"Updated to be claustrophobic. Left a half full buggy of groceries and walked out. Was a great store to shop but has been changed to uter confusion. I was Very disappointed to see it go so far down hill."}
{"text":"Pros: 
*large parking
*location
*usually not too busy, line ups are short
*big selection of fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood

Cons:
*I've purchased expired tylenol (without knowing of course until I was already home)
*need to check expiry date because I've accidentally purchased expired hot dogs, cold cut pre packaged meat slices, almond milk - usually I do check the dates but sometimes I'm in a hurry or forget because I expect that expired products would not be on the shelf"}
{"text":"With loads of free parking (you will be asked upon entry, \"Are you here to shop?\" otherwise, there's a charge) this store would be quite handy for the SUV hauling groceries set if its location (the lower half of Jarvis) wasn't always beset by construction or a pile-up of all-day traffic trying to get onto the Gardiner.  I keep telling myself: it's Toronto; there's traffic; get used to it. 

Formerly a 24 hr a day location, hours have been reduced from 7 am to midnight.  Take a cart up the nifty escalators that the shopping carts adhere to by way of some mysterious feat of modern day engineering  or find carts, but not always, stashed beside the second floor  landing.  The prepared foods and eat-in area has a nice view of Sugar Beach and sometimes a real live actual ship.  Produce is fresh but pricey.  Deals can be found on baked goods (my last visit : four large chocolate covered croissants for $2.49; but  being on a diet, yet again, I resisted.)"}
{"text":"For a grocery store in Toronto, this massive location is really hard to miss.  What frustrates me is the road to get there. It's almost always blocked with construction on one end, and jam packed with traffic on the other. 

The best part is the open 24/7 option. I cannot tell you how convenient this is for last minute pickup. 

There's 2 floors so when you walk in from the parking lot, you are faced with a dry cleaner, mini LCBO, flower shop and a pc financial office. This really helps the one stop shopper. There is escalators taking you up/down to & from the grocery section , which is great because you have no choice but to take them to get to the parking lot. So you can never really tell the difference between the lazies and the one's that would've taken the option to take stairs. 
 
Personally, I feel what they lack in customer incentives they make up for with convenience.  As in, they really should offer a rewards program without having to apply for a credit card. On the flip side, they have independent checkout so you don't have to wait in line and there is always an attendant ready to help you with scanning produce items.  

cons
no organic parsley and tomatoes
selection of brands is less here

pros
huge free parking lot. shocking for Toronto
organic section
impressive meat section

{"text":"I have visited this Loblaws location twice times and have been impressed on both occasions. Free parking for patrons is pretty darn awesome. The first floor has LCBO, florist, dry cleaners and a Joe Fresh stores. It is like a one stop shop for all your needs. 

Their produce section is extensive, fresh and always stocked. They have a great bakery and deli section. 

The aisle ways are wide for a pleasant shopping experience.  The great thing about this location that it is 24 hours!  You can get your grocery shop on at 2am if you like.

I am a repeat customer, hope you will be too!"}
{"text":"Massive expanses of free parking- hurray! But come here on a Sunday any time of day and this is what I heard. \"They can't possibly be out of all of this stuff!\" 
I needed some simple things like spinach- there were a few bags left of sub-par quality greens. 
Whole wheat tortillas- the shelves were totally empty. 
Now that there are all the new condos with built-in grocery stores, I'm hoping not to have to make this trek out again. At the end, I was just glad I can get the bulk of my groceries delivered from Grocery Gateway, now that's service."}
{"text":"My favourite supermarket in the city.

Massive, fully stocked, friendly staff and yes, a fantastic Joe Fresh Store on the lower level.

This place has got everything you need: a wine store, a marketplace cafe, Joe Fresh downstairs, a dry cleaners, a cell phone service stop, ATM, banking booths, a parkade, a florist, and the list goes on and on.

If you need it, they will have it. Period."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of shopping at Loblaws but I guess I end up going to this one as its quite close to moi:) This Loblaws is quite convenient and has a huge parking lot which happens to be free (they have figured a way to make more money by charging parking for the club goers across the street at Guverment) Selection is quite good but prices are not if you shop around you can get a better price on most items at other stores. The downtown market for grocery stores has heated up quite a bit as there are three 24 hours stores in this area now. I wish they would convert this to a Real Canadian Super Store. This store is now somewhat of a celebrity as well due to the appearance on Top Chef Canada. 
P.S. Loblaws can you please start accepting Amex!!!
Also the store is now open from 7 AM to midnight"}
{"text":"This location is huge and has a wide variety of selection. I'm a big fan of the section where you can get fresh sandwiches or daily deals on chicken. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Came in here to grab a quick bite before the Yelp Elite party.

Pro: Quarter chicken dinner for like... $4 because it was the special that day.
Con: Quality wasn't so great. It was about 6pm at this point so everything was pretty dry. Also, paying took FOREVER. A combination of slow service and the guy in front of me having some complicated take out order. 

I've been here to shop in the past and it wasn't memorable. It has a PC bank machine and onsite parking, which is good."}
{"text":"DO NOT USE THE DRY CLEANER HERE! 

Brought in my wedding bespoke suit to dry clean and when I got it back all the pant buttons were singed off and there were several burn marks on the left jacket sleeve and on the back of my pants! WTF

I am going back this wknd to try and sort it out.  I will update and let ppl know how it goes..."}
{"text":"Great Loblaws location!  Great store!  Lots of everything available including an LCBO and Joe Fresh. 

The downside is that the store is on the second level and it can be annoying to get a cart up and down those escalators. There's usually no carts upstairs, so if you forget to grab one, you have to run back downstairs. 

The bakery, deli and produce sections are huge and have an awesome selection. The rest of the store is okay - but they don't really have the section where they sell home goods like cutlery and dishes or seasonal items. 

I've never had an issue with parking at this location, but I could see that someone not familiar with the area might get annoyed. I prefer to access the parking lot from Queens Quay so turning in and out is easier."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of my favorite supermarkets....anywhere! I first visited this super-huge market back in 1998 and it was way ahead of its' time back then and in many ways it still is. You enter by going up a slanted walkway to the second floor (first floor is a series of small shops including an LCBO since Canadian supermarkets can't sell booze....boo!) right to a small restaurant area with fresh soups, sandwiches, muffins and other baked goods. Then a huge produce area awaits followed by a large bakery area offering Loblaws own baked goods alongside breads from bakeries like Ace and cakes from Dufflet (including the new frozen desserts) and LaRocca. Then you go to the organic/natural food area, the bulk area and a huge frozen food section among all the other good stuff. President's Choice is the boutique store brand and it rocks with so many options. You want frozen Jamablaya? They got that? Organic Oatmeal. PC Organics has that. They also have a No Name generic brand that's pretty good too. I usually leave with a big thing of their Peanut Butter because it's so good and denser than typical US PB's. Just a fantastic store and it's just too bad to hear that the corporate parent is suffering financially."}
{"text":"I said before that The Dominion grocery store in Liberty Village was my favourite, but I take it back. This Loblaws is the best grocery store I have been to in the city, hands down. Their selection of produce is unparallelled. Everything is fresh, and the store is always well stocked. They have a great fresh fish and meat section. Their selection of cheeses is pretty spectacular, too.

I also notice that they have comparably lower prices than Dominion, but my friend pointed out that might be because it's not 24 hours. Anyway, I noticed a lot of the stuff, including non-perishables, were quite a bit cheaper. 

And don't go through the prepared-food section if you're hungry because it will be impossible to leave without buying something. All the prepared sandwiches, pastas, soups and pastries look and smell delicious and I have never been disappointed eating there. 

I think what I love most about this grocery store is how open and bright it is - tons of natural light and windows. It makes that dreaded weekly grocery shopping experience just slightly more manageable. If you live in the area, I highly recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"Love this place...haven't experienced the full Loblaws experience just yet but I come here for lunch and it's a great place if you're on the go.

Salad bar secret? Everyone grabs the small container ($3.59) and loads it up. The soup here is delish as well, especially the Italian Wedding Soup....but in my opinion, the headliners would be the muffins...freshly baked, $1.29 each...they're massive and beckon for you."}
{"text":"YES folks, this is one of the best Loblaws in the city... still doesn't even come CLOSE to the Real Canadian Superstores, but what can you do?

Star #1: Joe Fresh! Big one! Separate from the rest of the store! This is always a good sign in Joe Fresh World.
Star #2: LCBO in the store! Yesssssss! Even though there is a HUGE LCBO less than a block away, this is a one-stop shop! Always appreciated by me who tries to do as many errands as possible over lunch!
Star #3: TONS of FREE parking! Love this. Especially since two blocks away you have to pay like $5 for half an hour or something ridiculous like that.
Star #4: FAB gourmet selecion! Imported products from all over the world, a great selection of Italian and Jewish products especially!
Star #5: Lighting. NATURAL lighting. There are floor-to-ceiling windows along one whole wall of the place. WICKED AWESOME!

Extra points: 
- ALWAYS gorgeous produce
- Great place to go for lunch - they have one of those take-away marche-type areas where you can get a variety of meals to eat there (at a few bistro tables) or take home. GREAT soup, sandwiches/wraps/paninis, sushi, pizza, hot stuff like chicken, fries, mac & cheese, rice pilaf, etc. Best lunch feature in my mind? The fresh salad bar in the produce section - check it out! You can build the salad of your dreams!!! 
- Other \"stores\" within the building: Dry Cleaners, Florist, Cigar/Smoke Shop, PC Financial, Travel Agent..."}
{"text":"Don't bother going if you want actual food - maybe on a Friday night, they have stuff, but over the weekend you're standing in lines, trying not to get hit with other peoples carts and most importantly they are sold out of everything - especially stuff that's advertised.  The free parking is great, but if there's no food, what's the point?!?"}
{"text":"If you're like me, and I seem to think that you are, you sometimes need food.  And if you're also like me, you like the food that you get to be not too too expensive.  And you'd like there to be a decent amount of variety in what you get.  So if you like food, and I think you do, Queens Quay Loblaws not only has lots, but will sell it to you.

Actually, this is my store and location of choice, so I'm not sure why I'm being a bonehead off the top.  The Loblaws complex at the bottom of Jarvis at Queens Quay has some great things to offer.  It borders on the expanse of a super store, offering much more than just food and amenities.  During the right season, you could not only pick up burgers for your barbecue, as well as a barbecue, if you forgot to get one of those.  The produce is usually fresh with a good assortment of seafood, cheeses, and breads.  The butcher there will also indulge and procure for you specific cuts that you may need for your cooking.  As well, this place can have some decent sales on, so you may want to get your freezer primed for those lucky visits.

Admittedly, for produce and meats that are superiorly fresh, the Loblaws is too close to the St. Lawrence Market (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/st-lawrence-market-toronto) to compete in that regard.  It also provides a liquor store onsite, right next door of course to one of the largest LCBOs in the city (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/lcbo-toronto-14).  However, if you're in a rush and don't want to spend the extra walk there and back, everything you need can be found under the single roof.  So, where you lose variety and perhaps a little bit of selection and freshness, you gain in convenience.  If nothing else, it's a fantastic pivot point to the other shops."}
{"text":"This Loblaws is great! I found it well laid out and the selection was great compared to my normal grocery spots (metro, rabba, sobeys express). As with most large grocery stores, there was a big fresh produce section, deli and bakery, along with lots of frozen foods. Shopping at Loblaws also means you can buy presidents choice - their delicious and well priced generic brand. 

Other perks of this location - lcbo, joe fresh (!!), flower/plant shop 

The only thing about it is the location isn't so convenient if you don't have a car. It's not on the subway line, so transporting your groceries would be quite difficult sans personal vehicle.

I'd like to say I'll be back, but it will depend on if any of my friends would be willing to drive me (hint, hint!)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to give this location a one star for the time being, which I hate doing.  The location itself is great with everything you can find, but it has major pricing issues.  The last few times I went, I checked my receipts and noticed I was overcharged on about 20% of items I purchased.  And the differences are not small, we are talking about $0.50 - $1.50 per item.  Hopefully Loblaws resolves these issues.  If you do go, I would look out for the pricing for the time being."}
{"text":"Alright people, let's just put it out there - the reason we all come here:

It has a separate Joe Fresh store.  Admit it.  Which one of us is really going grocery shopping without swinging by the Joe's to check out the latest and greatest items?

Aside from a plethora of fashion goodness, this is the Loblaws I frequent when I really want a special night on the ..... grocers.

It is my second favourite Loblaws in the city - and purely for poshiness.  I find that in general most Loblaws have similar offerings, but most don't have such a fancy prepared food area (complete with a faux outdoor-ish eating space upstairs).  

Aside from the food and the clothes it has the ramp escalator thingee.  That, my friends, is super fun.  I don't know why, but it amuses me.  Five Stars!"}
{"text":"This review is for the garden center - yes the Loblaws is good - it's probably the best in the city, but I wanted to call out one staff member for her amazing work!

Joni in the garden center (she's the horticulturist) was amazing!  She took time with me (I newbie to gardening) to help me pick the right trees, flowers and plants for my balcony garden.  She was funny, sweet and super informative!  Joni took the time to get me a trolly, help me pick out the best of the plants we choose and even ensured that her attention was not diverted by other customers.

She made making my first planter garden super fun and rewarding!  Gold star Joni!"}
{"text":"This is so far my favorite grocery store in Toronto, though it's not that good.  The organization is bad in that some product categories are located in three different locations but the individual products are not redundant so you might have to check all three areas to find the product you are looking for...and then you still may not find it.  Like all grocery stores in Toronto the selection is weak and the prices are high (compared to the equivalent store in the US), but this one at least has wide aisles, ample parking, cleanliness, and is much larger than most others.

Though the store closes at 11:00pm most days, all the specialty sections (meat, deli, seafood, bakery, etc.) close much earlier (sometimes by 8:00pm) so keep that in mind if you're planning an evening shopping trip.  This complex also contains a bank, a travel agency, a liquor store, a dry cleaner, tobacco shop, and other stores that would make it convenient except all these other places also close too early (e.g. 7:00pm).  

There are some items that I can only find here so I'll keep coming back.  I say it's my favorite but it's a pretty low bar, it'd be easy to make a better grocery store but I haven't found it yet."}
{"text":"I LOVE Lowblaws. I just wish downtown Toronto had a Great Canadian Superstore including a home section!

I walk a good distance to and from this grocery store for the bulk of my grocery needs. I grew up in the suburbs where Zehrs is most common grocery store and  I am loyal to the Loblaw brand. I love the Loblaw brand (President's Choice) and appreciate the selection that these stores offer."}
{"text":"Even though I live close to the Maple Leaf Gardens, I actually prefer the Queens Quay location for a real grocery list because the prices of some items are double or more at MLG, like fresh grated Parmesan or fresh salmon, organic or not.

I like that this location has a great selection of organic produce, even if most of it is PC organics brand.

This location has a lot of take out food options including sandwiches, sushi and hot food but not as good as MLG, but I usually am here for a restocking of the pantry, not lunch or dinner.

The one thing that made me not give this Loblaws 5 stars is the customer service desk - many of the staff are downright unpleasant."}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh fruits and vegetables, seafood and staples. Pricing here is much better than Sobeys and the location is very convenient too. Free parking in this area is very rare, and most of its parking is covered too. Lots of cashiers help you get out of here faster. If you live downtown and need to stock up this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"The new TNT station opened here in August and it's really good! You get to fill a bowl with your choice of vegetables (no weight limit), just fill it until it overflows! The staff at the station is nice from my one encounter. Their Rotisserie chicken is of course delicious and their sides are okay too but their chicken tenders are HORRIBLE. The staff for the most part are nice."}
{"text":"MY supermarket of predilection! and when you go out of it, by sunny and warm days, you can smell hot sugar in the air, coming from the Redpath factory, located just besides. If you are lucky, you will even see the plant cranes bringing out tons of sugar from the tall ships, arrived from \"I-don't-know-where\" full of sugar."}
{"text":"A super-massive grocery emporium! With Joe Fresh and LCBO, PC Banking, a travel company, an optician - what more could you need in one complex? It's like a suburban strip mall all landed in one building! 

Selection of organic and specialty food items was good at this Loblaws, if you are into that kind of thing. The veggie selection was fantastic and the bread section was the size of my regular, close-to-home grocery store. 

A great Loblaws for one stop shopping."}
{"text":"Love this store!  Picked up a bunch of great clothes at Joe Fresh as well as yummy sushi and a salmon teriyaki bowl from the food section upstairs."}
{"text":"Big. Clean. What you come to expect from loblaws.  A big bonus that they have the fresh mixed berry muffins I like. Richtree style.  As of today they are under construction. Btw. Free parking."}
{"text":"Came here for the PC Pavilion. I think I got lucky because it was raining the day I came here so, the pavilion was empty.

But, when I left there were two people waiting behind me. How lucky! Maybe because the rain lifted as I was strolling here too.

I checked out the grocery loblaws upstairs, and it is pricey like the longo's near ACC. Was alright!"}
{"text":"im not sure, but if i had to guess, this location would be the largest grocery store in toronto? honestly...if you cant find what your looking for at this location, its not in toronto. super clean, happy and helpful staff members, and a decent amount of parking. 
its a shame i wont be visiting this location anymore, but it holds alot of awesome memories, and is a benchmark for all other loblaws"}
