{"text":"Think this place is gone. Nice idea, but the high prices killed them. Yup, even in Scottsdale you can't charge $10 for a salad and expect to get away with it."}
{"text":"Fresh Salad Company is like a higher class version of Souper Salad, and a much better tasting version of Sweet Tomatoes.  The difference is that here, not only do you still get a \"make your own salad\" option, but you can always choose one of their salad's off the menu too.

In addition to salads, they also have wraps on their menu and again, a \"make your own wrap\" option.  I decided that I would make my own wrap, and that it would be damn tasty.  I chose the garlic herb wrap, and decided to fill it with so many vegetables that it would be a virtual veggie fiesta in my mouth. 

Artichoke, avocado, broccoli, onions, green peppers, black olives, sun dried tomatoes, celery, carrots...they were all there, smashed together in my wrap and drizzled with green goddess dressing and feta cheese.  It turned out to be a delicious wrap, but I found it to be a bit pricier than I expected.  I guess my addition of artichoke cost an extra 50 cents, and so did the avocado.  And, you can only choose 4 ingredients for your wrap, and the rest are 50 cents after that. Maybe I will tone down the veggie fiesta next time.

All in all, it was tasty, fresh food, and it was perfect for a fast lunch."}
