{"text":"Come here all the time. One of my favorite Charlotte bars. Great prices. Reasonably priced drinks. Go for the wings."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot during the week.  Not especially crowded.  Fast & attentive service.  Better than average bar food (I've had their queso, their burrito, their chicken philly, their white bean chicken chili, a chicken parm sandwich and a few other items).  Laid back old school environment.  Feels like a neighborhood joint on the inside."}
{"text":"This is a very good place for families, folks who like a good beer selection and hole in the wall restaurant fans. Really excellent service, good food and more than reasonable prices. We had wings, burgers and local beers - all enjoyable. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte. Coming from Buffalo, NY it was a must to find a good wing place. More of a hole in the wall Bar/Grill, but the wing selection is solid. I will say anybody putting ranch on wings are ruining them. 

Decent beer selection if you like the local craft beers."}
{"text":"Eaten here 15 times, great for kids, and they eat free some nights.  I like most entree items, none are over-the-top good, but I always look forward to going.  Easy to put together table for 8 or more, and kid friendly, some arcade games in one room.  As others have said, solid bar food, good service, beer and other selections excellent.  Try the sweet potato fries, they are often excellent."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch not once, not twice, but three times this week!! First of all, the food comes out quickly so I can enjoy my lunch break and get back to work in time! They have two dining areas so there's always a place to sit without having to wait. The service was excellent!!  Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and offers great suggestions. The hamburgers and onion rings are AMAZING, but they have healthier options, too like fresh salmon and salads. My friend got the salmon plate with veggies and rice and said it was the best salmon she's had in a long time.  I like the variety of the menu and will be back to try more!  Can't believe I never knew about this place before!  This just might be my new favorite restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I went on Saturday night with my sister. We ordered wings, a turkey burger and a hamburger. The wings were great. The burgers were terrible. I'm not sure what kind of meat was used, but they had the consistency of...scrapple or liver mush. I'd guess they used the cheap tube meat. Whatever it was those, burgers were absolutely gross and I felt compelled to post this to hopefully let them and others know. Great wings. TERRIBLE burgers. Beef and turkey BOTH!"}
{"text":"My sons and I ate here this afternoon. I have ordered from the restaurant at least 30 times on foodie call, and the food was perfect every time it was delivered to us at home. On our first actual visit into the restaurant, we were greeted with stark faces, subpar service, and an entire tray full of BURNED to a crisp chicken tenders. It did not amaze me that the waitress brought out this entire tray of BURNED tenders to our table, due to the fact that she didn't appear to be happy we were there. The Manager never came over to apologize for BURNED TO A BLACK CRISP tenders and tiny potato skins..Clearly no one was comfortable with us being there, including the entire staff we came in contact with... P I will not be returning. Or ordering online, We will stick to Harper's. FYI, Our money is green too!!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for Providence Road Sundries, so we decided to give it a try.  We were looking for someplace casual, but I was worried I might be a bit underdressed in jeans and a sweatshirt being that Providence Road Sundries is smack-dab in the middle of 1/2 million dollar homes.  Turns out, I couldn't have been more wrong.  In fact, I may have been OVERdressed.  PRS is very casual (not that there's anything wrong with that, but it just differed from my expectations).  Our server was also the bartender and she greeted us at our table from behind the bar (we went on a slow night).

The booths are highbacked (nice for some privacy) and made from an old wood.  The tables elsewhere were tables my grandparents had in the 70s, with the rounded seats reminding me of wagonwheels.  The restaurant had the feel of a place I might have really enjoyed during my college years -- hang out with friends, get cheap beer, and eat greasy food.  As an adult, though, it really didn't feel like my scene.  

Don't get me wrong.  I'm all about greasy food sometimes.  In fact, we both tried the burgers, but they were average.  As were the french fries that accompanied them.  I guess that was fitting for the setting.  

If I lived in the area, I might walk over to Providence Road Sundries for a drink or dinner, but... Ah, heck...who am I kidding?  If I lived in one of the 1/2 million dollar homes in the area, I'd probably have my chauffeur drive me somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have only ordered uber eats from here, but their food is always delicious!! I have never had anything bad from here. Wings are great!! And I love the Kale & Arugula Salad with blacken Salmon! Will definitely be going in person soon to check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is very old, but the ownership has changed hands many times since I was a child.

When I was a kid my mom would bring me here for the best bacon cheeseburgers ever.  They were almost like sliders and my memories still make me salivate.

These days PRS is more typical bar & bar food than it's legacy suggests.  The kitchen will deliver something typical and depending on who is working you'll get something far more greasy or closer to right than wrong.

We hit this place up from time to time because it is centric to a driving route we have often and having a touchstone memory always draws me close but it is something to be wary of.  I'd like to see it revitalized to it's old glory but I don't know who manages it now or their goals.

Enter with low expectations and be surprised on occasion."}
{"text":"I come here fairly frequently. I go at various times - weekday lunches, takeout for dinner or to drink/snack at the bar on a weekend. Service is always fast and friendly. Food is bar food, but it's pretty good. They've made some renovations and menu changes in the past year that are for the better. I do miss some of the veggie options (veggie chili and a veggie panini were my go to favs), but there are still good vegetarian options. It is still a local watering hole, but it's one that we bring out of town guests to for a casual/easy night out. 

Parking is the reason they get 4 instead of 5 stars. Parking can be tricky, but once you go enough you learn to maneuver the lot."}
{"text":"Finally a bar that has obviously been around a long time.  Late 30's, early 40's crowd.  Slow going even on a Saturday at 6pm.  Not a great burger but not bad either.  A little over-cooked, but solid.  Hot french fries.  I'll be sure to visit again and try other items on the menu mainly because of the full bar.  They have a respectable selection of draft beers, scotches and vodkas.  There's billiards and video games but nobody's paying attention to that.  

It's hard to categorize because it's mellow enough to have a conversation even with the juke box playing and plenty of people watching games on multiple TVs.  It doesn't feel like a sports bar.  This place has charm and warmth.  Something a lot of newer bars in town are missing.  This is a true neighborhood pub."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to hang out but they have great drink specials and some of the best chicken chili I've ever had - in fact that's really the reason I frequent this place for the chili.  I've had a few other things on the menu and everything is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Although I've only been out to this place once, I'd say I was pretty impressed. I'm a big fan of hole in the wall bar joints and this is definitely up there with some of my other favorites. 

I don't usually find myself over on this side of town too often, but in the past couple of months I'm beginning to realize I need to be. I attended a graduation party here where we had an entire section of the bar to ourselves. I first took notice of the interior design and layout, then generally started noticing other attributes. Low lighted, adequate seating, and a modest crowd. Very nice.

The food for our party was supplied by the bar, and we had a great combination of chips & salsa, mozzarella sticks, pizza, and a few others. I could not keep my hands off the pizza, which was a flatbread-type with mozz, buffalo chicken, blue cheese, jalopenos, etc. Don't know what it was called, but it was great! Service was decent for the number of people in our party. 

Beer specials on a Saturday night- can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Gone here several times. Very nice atmosphere with attractive wood bar and booths. Food is solid. The craft beer selection is on the light side and could use a couple of quality IPA's."}
{"text":"This famous local haunt has clung to the edge of Providence Road since 1933 and served up some of Charlotte's best burgers ever since. Amazingly though, until my recent lunch there, I never tasted one. I'd say it was worth the wait, almost.

I just went with the standard cheeseburger with cheddar. Although it doesn't say on the menu, what is listed as a cheeseburger is actually a double cheeseburger, as they all are. The ground beef was lean and tasty and the patties were completely encased in melted cheese. The accompanying lettuce, tomato and onion were fresh and crisp; however, I must say that the lackluster bun disappointed me. It was cold, untoasted and seemed an afterthought to an otherwise excellent burger. As I have said before,  the bun can either make a break a burger; in this case, it didn't break it but it certainly was a detraction. The fries appeared to be freshly cut in house but were a bit soggy. The combo ran $9.99 and overall was good.

Service was also friendly and attentive. The atmosphere what's nostalgic and quaint. The booths appeared to be original however were a bit uncomfortable. The entire restaurant was clean and had a high sanitary rating. Overall it definitely warrants a return visit"}
{"text":"First time here, we had queso and mozzarella sticks to start. I really fell in love with the queso and my husband enjoyed the cheese sticks. I got the quesadillas. The fajita chicken was great and the portion was well sized. I liked that there wasn't too much onion and came with jalapeños on the side. The service was quick and attentive. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the Myers Park area. Food is amazing. I've only been in Charlotte for 2 years and they by far have the best wings in the city! Perfect neighborhood bar and grill. Staff is friendly. Check this place out! You will love it!"}
{"text":"While I probably drive past this restaurant every week, I'd not been in for probably 10 years.
Then, I ended up there twice in one week.
Very pleasant and unpretentious, kind of a standard \"beer bar\" decor.  Menu was interesting, and they had a wide selection of craft and local beers, and a couple of decent wines, all at a reasonable cost.
Waitstaff on both occasions were very nice, quite knowledgable on menu and beers, quick and efficient, while being very personable.
Food was excellent, very fresh, generous portions at a reasonable price.
We don't get out much at home in Charlotte, but this is back on my list as a great spot for a quick and tasty dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends, and I've always had a great time. It's good for big groups, and it's enough off the beaten path that it doesn't get too crowded in the evenings. The veggie burger is really good, and the vegetarian chile isn't bad, either.

Twice when I've been here, there were kids in the group, and they enjoyed the menu and seemed to have a good time generally. There's a pool table, and there's never a long wait to get your turn to play. There's also some good-sized televisions for watching games.

Even with it being a sports-centered kind of bar, it's not ever too loud or too smoky. I appreciate being able to have a conversation with the folks I'm out with, and being able to go out and have a good time without feeling like I need to come home and jump immediately in the shower to get the smog off my flesh and out of my hair."}
{"text":"I loved it! The wings were very good. My burger and onion rings were also good. Great place to watch games and visit with family. Everything was freshly made. We will definitely come back when we visit charlotte."}
{"text":"Menu looks awesome! Tuesdays there is $5 wines and kids eat free. Has a funky smell, but it's minor and the place is old. Parking in front is tricky, but plenty of parking in the back. Menu is great for large crowds and plenty of seating throughout. Salmon wrap was just okay, but black and blue burger was amazing!! Kinda divey, but I like it. Seat yourself."}
{"text":"First time here - we happened in after a storm swept through Myers Park but a partial lack of power to the building didn't affect the staff who kept things going as the bar side was filled. Casual place with a full bar. I enjoyed the Firecracker Salmon wrap (very light and flavorful) with steamed broccoli for the side, while my dining companion had Eli's Cowboy Burger with tots. We'll definitely return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Burgers cooked exactly as ordered (medium well is medium well, not well done, etc.) and quite flavorful. Onion rings are decent. Overall a solid place!"}
{"text":"Very Nice.

It was like falling back in time when I use to visit the place back in the late 80's early 90's.

I stopped by just for a nostalgia moment having a few apps and drinks with the wife, and was definitely not disappointed!

I will need to re-visit this location again, as we stopped in on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, and just had a small snack.

I am happy that this Providence Road Sundries is still kicking, and as usual, it is a locals place.

{"text":"Great place.

If you are looking for a place to unwind, get some great food, and have a great time. this place is it. when my wife and I went there, there was a little kids birthday party going on, a couple of frat guys drinking beer, an old couple having dinner, etc. Everyone is represented. The service was very good, we sat at the bar and were helped right away. it looks like they had some great nightly drink specials. I was a little skeptical at first about ordering bar food, but let me tell you... my grilled burrito was fantastic. The chicken in it was fresh and it was perfectly cooked. I ordered a side of fried okra and it was some of the best ive had too. Not overly friend and crispy, but still had a nice coating. I was very pleased. My wife got some of the Sundries chili which was also very good. 

A great place to go with the family, watch a football game, grab a drink, or just hang out. We will definitely be frequenting this establishment! well done!"}
{"text":"Rating based on enthusiasm and attitude I would rate them low. I've been her three times and do not think I will be back. They just have this down vibe I just can't get into."}
{"text":"This rating is based on the reuben from one time there so it's possible it was an off night or the reuben just isn't that good there. I stopped into Providence Road Sundries to continue my adventure around Charlotte to find the best reuben the city has to offer. I didn't know exactly what to expect, and the reuben ended up being fairly sub-par. The corned beef was lacking flavor, the bread was mediocre and a bit burnt, and in general the reuben just didn't have much going for it. The proportions of ingredients were fine, but that doesn't matter much when the ingredients themselves aren't very good. In my opinion this reuben was in the lower quarter of all I've tried around Charlotte, which is quite a large list at this point."}
{"text":"Amidst the over-priced sit down restaurants that prevail Myers Park and Eastover is a little slice of heaven in Providence Road Sundries.  Yeah, it's typical bar food but what do you expect: it's a bar!  Well, no that's not entirely fair.

While PRS has a large bar, they actually serve good food.  Of the dozen or so times I've eaten there, I've never had to send back an order and have always returned.  

Try the fried Okra...yum! It's a great place to meet as a group as there's lots of seating, tv's for watching the game, the food is good, and staff is always friendly.  They even have the old time video games (no Wii here...try space invaders) so bring your quarters.

ONE WORD OF WARNING: Parking SUCKS!  No seriously, this place is very popular so bring a small car and park in back.  Otherwise, plan to park at a church and take a stroll to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service not so much.  We waited 30 minutes to receive our checks.  Management needs to hire more staff."}
{"text":"The food is always solid.  Wings are big and crispy, get them charred. Sandwiches are all great with good sides. Basically bar food that is as good as any in town.  And ambiance is quaint and when the weather is nice and they open the door/windows it is hard to beat. 
But they neeed to improve their tv situation. Please get all the channels, and don't have every tv turned to the same show/game. And make it a priority. Also the bar staff does a good job but they always seem understaffed and the customer suffers."}
{"text":"Lovely sports bar on Providence.  Solid food, excellent service and comfortable seating.  I had the Chicken Tender Salad with a cup of white bean chicken chili.  The chili was very flavorful.  The Chicken tender salad was so yummy, with plenty of veggies and homemade dressing.  Excellent wings, too."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever! Nice selection of beer and always some kind of drink specials going on. Plenty of locals will be found chatting it up. This is one of those bars where you don't feel the need to get your \"going out\" clothes on, just come on by in jeans and t-shirt, you'll fit right in. Great spot for an after work beer or just an anytime beer."}
{"text":"Usually only have drinks when we swing in, they always have good specials and good service. I have eaten there a few times and food has been hit or miss, not really a place I go to eat, usually just to drink. If you want to relax, chat watch some sports this is your spot"}
{"text":"The service was awesome. I sat down at the bar and I was greeted quickly. I wasn't sure what I wanted so I sat there for quite a while debating. Anyway I decided to go with wings. I tend to try wings at any establishment where it is my first time trying them... these wings were really over cooked.. I mean it sounded like I was eating chips. Good flavor but obviously had just been over cooked.. I brought them home to try and doctor them up but was unsuccessful. I ended up throwing them out."}
{"text":"This was a cool place. I've been past this place hundreds of times in the past 15 years, and never stopped. Now, I realize i've missed a hidden gem of a place to hang out. Its not fancy, but has a nice home feel to it. 
It was a beautiful day outside, and they had the big garage door open creating a open seating area. Our waitress was outstanding, super friendly. The service was fast. The food was good. What's not to like? I had a Triple C Black IPA which was on draft. My daughter had an IBC root beer. We had chips and quest, which were very good. Potato skins, which were good, not great. And we split a Talapia fingers entree, with fried okra. We had 45 minutes to eat, before we went to an appointment at 6. This was a super relaxing place to spend it, and we got our food quickly, and it was all very tasty. I'll definitely be back to hang out here."}
{"text":"Get the hotdogs

Not a foodie place.  But the hotdogs were a scream.  PRS dog was like crack cocaine."}
