{"text":"We stepped into this pizza shop and were very impressed with the service, and more importantly, the PIZZA. We watched them make our pizzas with fresh ingredients. And the most important part is the crust, which gets 10 stars! Excellent!!"}
{"text":"Can not believe I got yelled at and scorned several times in front of my family by the owner because his employee messed up my pizza order, it was not even the fault of the person taking my order because he wrote my order correctly, yet he got yelled at by the owner. It was the person who made our pizza. I couldn't even discuss what happened with the owner because he just kept saying that I needed to order my pizza correctly in a crude manner... I ordered a pizza with no pork (please do not put salami, ham, pepperoni or anything that has pork on it, the guy who took my order understood that) I really don't know how I could have made it anymore clear than that and I am a nice person so I'm not yelling or being rude at all. I will not be spending $39 plus a $4 tip to this place again; the pizza and gyro was ok and the owner did ask how our pizza was when we were leaving."}
{"text":"John treated me and my friend like family after a long day of work. Kept us company and genuinely asked us about ourselves while hooking it up on the baby sized slices of pizza and we even texted his daughter a picture for him. Definitely coming back because John is the best, most charismatic man I've ever had make me a pizza!"}
{"text":"Been going here since I was little cant tell you how amazing this pizza is . Way better than Pizza Hut and dominos combined. Well in my opinion that is."}
{"text":"Food is fine but i came in a while back and the person who helped me out got angry that i took extra napkins for the take-out extra large pizza I ordered, for 2 napkins was not enough for a family sized pizza that I wasn't going to eat by myself.  If you need to go the route of charging for napkins as fast food places charge for extra sauces now, then by all means do it. That way customers know where the line is drawn and we can choose whether or not to cross it and pay for extra napkins, red pepper packets, etc.  I have since made the extra trip to visit Barros near 51st and Baseline for pizza since they have no problems giving extra napkins there."}
{"text":"I live 3-4 minutes away from this joint, so I've ordered and picked up my food several times.   I really love the food here! Pizzas, wings, sandwiches, great food! I dunno why are ppl giving low ratings.. Maybe they expect a \"fine dinning\" atmosphere??? Smh   All you need to know, food is good, place is clean, good prices, and good ppl there. Ben knows me already by my name lol thats how much I order/pick up from there."}
{"text":"Love this place! ! It's our go to pizza party spot!! The colossal pizza is not only impressive it's really good too!! One pizza fed our sons entire birthday party it's great!!! The crust is melt in your mouth buttery with a hint of garlic amazing! ! The staff is super friendly and the service is incredibly fast."}
{"text":"We always order for delievery when we are too tired to cook for the family. The food is so amazing and comes to us hot every time! I rarely do reviews but we order so often and not once had a complaint so they deserve props! Enjoy."}
{"text":"Loyal customers. Family Deal is the only thing we ever get. Includes 2 XL pizzas, wings, and 2 liter soda. Yummy! Kids highly recommend the BBQ flavored wings. You have to love real New York pizza to love this place & we do! (Go New York Giants!!)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today after reading some reviews.  I had a slice of garlic and ham pizza with 6 hot wings.  From the other reviews I thought that it was going to be excellent but it was just ok. The pizza was very limp and the hot sauce on the wing was just you basic wing sauce.  I may come back since it is fairly close to my house but I wouldn't go out of the way for it."}
{"text":"Giving this place two stars.  Nice clean place, but staff wasn't that courteous.  Only tried slices of pizza.  Hubby ordered  pepperoni which was really good.  I ordered mushroom and sausage.  Mushrooms were from a can...bleh..but the sausage and the pizza crust were good."}
{"text":"Best slice of pizza money can buy!! Owner has been here for 16 years and has never compromised quality. I will always be loyal to Manhattan Pizza!!!!  Go for the Colossal!  Great job Ben.... Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Best salad ever (minus the onion) the taste of the chicken makes it even better :) my husband loves the calzones and pizza as well and kids love the spaghetti."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. The staff is very nice. I eat here quite a bit. Just wished they delivered but the pizza and wings are worth the drive to pick up."}
{"text":"I have tried several different kinds of pizza here and never been disappointed.  Tonight I tried the grilled chicken salad...again, I was not disappointed!  Generous portions, fresh ingredients, and prices that are reasonable.  The service is always exceptional...I think the pizza is quite possibly the best I have ever eaten...I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Sad. We so badly wanted to love this place and make it our \"spot.\" The food is pretty good, but the service remained consistently poor with no apparent desire to improve.   Our orders have been messed up many, MANY times as we went almost weekly for well over a year. Every time I mentioned it to the manager/owner, he never seem to really care. Not one single apology. Ever.   In fact, one time he even explained that \"parmesan MEANS cheese\" and that I'd need to ASK for parmesan if I wanted cheese. Thanks Cap'n Obvious!!   The last straw was when he actually had the balls to say \"Well, you must keep ordering it wrong.\" That was a head-knocking, hair-pulling moment because my personal take-out order was always the same exact thing - Spaghetti Meatball PARMESAN.   Anyhow, I'm leaving my old review below. You know, for historical purposes and all. ;)  -------------------------------------------------  \"Manhattan Pizza Night\" has a spot on my family's weekly calendar. Ironically, not for the pizza. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good. It's pizza. Hard to mess up. It's their Spaghetti Meatball Parmesan and Philly Cheesesteak that's our obsession. The staff is friendly. The place is clean. The atmosphere could be improved, but isn't an issue for us as we always get it to go. When the say it'll be ready in \"10-15\" minutes, plan on 20-25. There has been a few times the cheese wasn't put on the Meatball Parm, but they were very apologetic and fixed it right away. Overall, it's a great place that we'll try to help stay in business for a very long time."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Great food great service. I have been eating here for years and have never been dissapointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good wings. Taste better than Grand pa's. Pizza good too. On the expensive side"}
{"text":"Visited this place after a long day of errands and really craving pizza. I had their white pizza and it is definitely the best one I've tried! It was constructed very well, and the garlic complimented the flavors great. It had a delicious natural sweetness to it. Management was very friendly and courteous when it came to deciding what kind of pizza to try.   I have returned a few times, and they've yet to disappoint. Even a simple pepperoni pizza is worth the hype."}
{"text":"We were really hungry on New Year's Eve and of course we called too late to order at our favorite restaurant so we wanted to try this place out.   Although super helpful over the phone when ordering chicken fingers for a large group, we were surprised to see that our bbq chicken fingers were frozen chicken fingers, deep fried, with bottled bbq poured all over. But I would have to say that the garlic Parmesan was mediocre. Overall, probably wouldn't try this place again, unless they work on their chicken finger recipe."}
{"text":"This place has been around for 15 yrs. I'm a big fan of New York style pizza and this place does a great job. Plus they add a little butter on the crust at the end to to top it off. They have lots of choices on there menu and a great drink selection. This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza and cheese sticks. The marinara for the cheese sticks was the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Manhattan Pizza is a nice, fairly cheap option for New York style pizza in the Southwest Valley. Their prices are reasonable for the style of pizza they offer (i.e. not quick and dirty $5 takeout pizza from Little Caesar's or Hungry Howie's) and, as has been mentioned before, their customer service is great. Everyone that works here is very friendly.  Their wings are the best I've had at a pizza joint. They're nice and crispy and the sauce is pretty tasty.  They generally have good deals going most of the time, including lunch specials and an extra large pizza and 25 wings deal that's quite affordable."}
{"text":"Good pizza and friendly people! They always have a pizza and wings special like most pizza places do. I've only dined in once with my two kids and it was during after school hours. Every time I have ordered from here and picked up they are never super busy. They have 3 TVs in there place and plenty of room to sit down and eat while watching a game. They also serve beer and soda too."}
{"text":"Food was great. Store was clean. Staff was very nice. Ordered a gyro and slice of cheese. Fries with sandwich were great. Large serving size on both meals."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the area hands down! Not greasy like chicago's and chain pizza joints. Highly recommend checking it out. Guys are super nice running the place and focused on making sure you are pleased with the order."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! We have ordered delivery and pick up for 12 years. Started out fairly good, not the best pizza, but ok. The last five years gone down hill. Tonight ordered pizza for delivery. Hour and a half later no pizza and no phone call. Hubby called, they said they could not find us-after 12 years? I heard hubby give address and directions correctly first time. They finally called us back and told my husband they couldn't find us. He gave same directions again. I called back to say we wanted fresh made, not hour and a half old pizza. He said making new pizza and husband gave wrong address. I said I heard husband give correct address, he said he has to hire/fire bad drivers all the time and said making new pizza. I told him good customer service you do no blame customer and customers for 12 years. I asked for half off price he said no way. So never ever order from worst customer service place agin. Plus, pizza, food mediocre to begin with"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now. The first time I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was good and so were the wings. I remember my husband and I shaking our heads in agreement that we would eat there again. A little pricey but.... it was close to home and it was pretty good. Now, the second time.... guy that answered was a complete jerk. I was attempting to call in ahead but the guy was so rude i had to hang up. I thought to myself, \" Self, everyone has a bad day. lemme get pizza anyways because I am far too tired to cook.\" When I went in I informed the guy he was rude and he apologized and explained that he was busy and offered me a drink, the guy making the pizza was kinda nice in a \"I'm irritated kinda way\" but I accepted and forgave them both. Pizza was still over priced and didn't taste as good this time but it was ok. I think it's a hit or miss kinda place. Not too many options in Tolleson :("}
{"text":"Great people great food great price. Beef pepperoni is my favorite! The pizza is made on the spot and ready in 15 min. Only downside is no delivery but it is worth picking it up."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. It hasn't changed since day one. where can you get a great tasting ex large one topping pizza and 25 wings for 19.99. Not bad... Don't forget to order your wings extra crispy, there is so much meat on these wings it's crazy and our favorite flavor is Honey Sweet Barbque.. BOMB! They also have excellent Calzones and they are huge that you can share. They are fast and fresh and finger lickin good! Their attitudes natch their great food. Youv customer service matches their great food. I say you will be happy an da very full!"}
{"text":"Manhattan pizza is my favorite pizza place to go to for pizza and wings made by real italians I haven't tried anything else yet on the menu but I highly recommend them also the ladie and the man that work there have always been kind and make you feel at home whats even better is I stay close by"}
{"text":"Food might be good as some reviewers claim, but the service was horrible, never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to Las Vegas. On a recommendation from a friend, they said to try Manhattan Pizza. We try to avoid the chain places so we gave it a try. On our first visit we saw \"The Collosal.\" They had one available and we took it immediately. Needless to say, we ate almost the entire pie that night. We have been customers ever since. John is one of the employees there and every time I call, he takes care of everything. Great guy and great place for pizza. We are now loyal customers and wouldn't consider going anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza not too thin and too thick! Better than Bambinos. I have yet to try their subs but they look delicious. They probably have the best deal in Summerlin area with one of kind pizza! :)"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the pizza and wings at first but whrn I decided to get one drink for my husband and I the staff denyed they could give me that. They said that soda is very expensive and we had to get our own individual cups. They were rude to us and said that we can't be sharing soda and getting up for more refills. So told them they should have the soda dispenser facing out. We went back a second time to see if maybe they would treat is better bit the moment we walked in the the staff smirked at us. When we asked for cheese on our garlic bread in a order of spaghetti they totally denyed and would charge is $3.50! Never coming back yo this place again  Horrible service!!"}
{"text":"We have been going here since they opened. I love that they haven't changed their recipes and their prices have pretty much stayed with in reason with normal cost of living increase they still manage to give good deals and excellent food! Their food is all made fresh to order so it's piping hot. Our favorite to order is their famous deal 1 XLg 1 item Pizza with 25 wings for Under $25.00 Can't beat that most places charge crazy for wings and these wings are huge. And if you love ranch with your pizza & wings they have great tasting ranch. So great fresh food with great friendly customerservice because their a family owned place. These are the places we need to keep in business!"}
{"text":"This place makes a good pizza, but they charge you extra for using a credit card, and they do it without telling you.  After I questioned the price I was told about the extra fee.  If they don't want to take credit cards, then they shouldn't accept them.  Bad way to conduct business."}
{"text":"The pizza taste different than any I've tasted and is absolutely delicious. I live on the opposite side of town, but always like to take the drive over to this pizza place. And above all the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Love that this place is right around the corner from the house.  We have ordered the special a few times and its definitely enough to feed our family of four.  The staff is very friendly.  People complain the pizza is \"limp\" and I guess they never had pizza in NY before.  i think the pizza is very tasty.   We get our wings from here now that Buffalo Wild Wings is closed and they are very good wings though their hot isn't really that hot.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I seem to be just a bad review giver, and I swear I am not. First and for most this review is only for this location because I went to two. Now, the guy at the first one (on Tenaya) was the most friendliest, nicest, helpful man I've encountered in a while. There was an error with the online ordering, so my pizza was at this location (Charleston). Now the man at the Tenaya location was very concerned and helpful with helping me get to the right location and apologized for the error even though it wasn't on his account. This was awesome and I will make sure my encounters are only with the Tenaya location.   Now, the nitty gritty of this crap. We walk in, not greeted, the man sighs as if the appearance of my life is the absolute most disgusting piece of any human experience. I pay and we leave. I got two pizzas and garlic knots. On the way home my kid was starving so I hand her a garlic knot, she bites it and hands it right back. I taste it, it's not bad but it is chewier than a pack of Super Bubble. Not only were they chewy but on every single one, one side of the knot was extremely hard the. So the tops were perfect, the middle chewy, and the bottom hard as wood. I could understand a few or maybe even half BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE!? The pizza is sweet, not in a good or a bad way, just in a weird way that I had never experienced before. The pizza is okay, it was not hot when I picked it up, so maybe that's a factor. I kind of went into it expecting New York style pizza but that's not at all what this is. First time here, I may go back to Manhattan Pizza but only for the great service from the man on Tenaya."}
{"text":"Pretty run of the mill bad pizza. Tasted like re heated tombstone or other home made. But the place was clean and the guy behind the counter seemed ok."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. They have Great Pizza and last Valentines Day they made me a heart shape pizza."}
{"text":"I miss the old owners of the place. They were wonderful, made great food, and were generally nice people. Now this place sucks. Ordered wings for a potluck at work and it was embarrassing because there was barely any meat on them and there were so many feather pieces. I ended up just throwing them away when I opened them up for the potluck at work because it was so bad."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. When we want pizza we never go anywhere else. Their entire menu tastes amazing and the staff, though sometimes hard to understand as they are Italian, are all very friendly! It says no waiter service but if they aren't crazy busy, they do bring you your food."}
{"text":"This is our go to for pizza delivery. They only have a couple tables inside for eating so we get delivery from here. The pizza is thin crust New York style and it's pretty good.  The customer service is what makes them 5 stars though. The owner is always around and is so friendly. He will give us random discounts or extras just because. When I stop in to pick up our order with my 3 year old he always interacts with him and has given him free quarters to use in the toy machines. He gave him a handful of pizza dough once just to play with while we waited. Everyone here is over the top friendly and considerate.  We have only had the whole pizzas from here but they offer a lot of other choices of food and good pizza slice deals. We love the ham pizzas from here the best."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever wings are fresh and juicy costumer service is very good whatever they make it's fresh you can see it from the other side prices are very reasonable because you go to a restaurant and you pay 15 dollars for a little plate here for 25 dollars you get xl one topping pizza and 25 four people can eat not only one prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"This place is pretty chill and wings are good pizza is good as well. Make sure you remember your number if you call and order food."}
{"text":"I can't review the food because I didn't get a chance to taste it. I stopped in on my lunch because I seen the lunch specials on the window. I get to the counter and point at the special they had posted on the counter top. I would like the 2 slices and a drink. The boy at the counter said they have no slices. So I said ok thanks and turn around to leave. He said, \"how about a calzone.\" So I turned around and said ok. I'm thinking it's a substitute for the special but when he rang me up it was the regular price and about double the lunch special I came in for. At that point I just wanted to eat lunch and get back to work. So I paid. The $4.50 lunch special I stopped for was now $9.67. I sat down to wait for my food and he again asked me if it was for here. I said yes and he told me it will be about 8 mins. At this point I had no choice but to wait. About 3-4 mins later the \"cook\" came around  and put the calzone on my table. I said thanks. I cut open the calzone and the filling was still partially frozen. I showed the boy at the counter. Just looking at it you can see the frozen chunks. The boy showed the \"cook\" and he started ranting and waived the boy off and said give him the calzone money. I said feel the middle, it's still frozen. He then took the plate and brushed the calzone into the trash. The boy at the counter gave me the refund and seemed frightened. I didn't touch my drink. So I took it to the counter and said I didn't need this. But was ignored. I've seen good food reviews but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to form my own opinion. I had to rate a 1 Star but should be 0."}
{"text":"The pizza is good better than pizza hut .The wings are also good.for something near home its pretty good. Also Good prices"}
{"text":"We've been eating at Manhattan Pizza for years & love it!  We'd never make it home with that aroma in the car, so we always eat in-house when it's hot out of their oven.  They make a decent antipasto too.  Grandkids  eat wings & chicken fingers in addition to a pizza. They say it's better than mine & I'm a pretty good Italian chef!  That's ok. No clean up for me!!"}
{"text":"Frequent Orderer, but NO MORE!! I ordered a Greek Pizza with NO onions (because I'm allergic) and extra gyro meat. What I got was Greek Pizza, Extra Onions and they had the audacity to argue with me on the phone. I have previously ordered where I wanted something off the menu (always with no onions). Guy got on the phone said he was the owner and began to argue with me RIDICULOUS! He claimed he took down my order correctly and I said no way, no how, onions make me violently ill. He then started to yell at me over the phone-I will NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN!! Not only that but the last time I ordered a salad I asked if they could put a little spinach on it-they put frozen/thawed spinach on it which made the rest of the salad soggy. Who the hell running this crap-hole."}
{"text":"first time here to this pizza i order 1 big slice pizza definitely really good pizza and will try the chicken wings too will always come back here"}
{"text":"I like it here.  The pizza is pretty good, the wings are awesome!  Lots of good deals to be had here and the service has always been speedy and courteous.  Very easy to feed a large group for not a lot of cash. I agree with the below comment.. very clean place, even the ladies room is nice and clean (hard to come by)  which is very much appreciated."}
{"text":"I decided to try Manhattan Pizza for the first time since moving to the area,  I was not disappointed,  I am from NY and this is the closest I have gotten to the flavor of the pizza in NY. Loved it and will definitely be back!  The wings are awesome also!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Went here for dinner tonight and it was good! The shop itself is nothing to look at, has a bunch of old cheesy posters but nobody really goes to a pizza parlor expecting a first class atmosphere. They were very friendly but overcharged me for my already very expensive order. Two twelve inch pizzas and some cheesy bread came out to $40.  Ouch. But it was amazing! The shop did seem clean and the order was ready pretty fast. I was charged an extra $2 for broccoli and didn't see or taste any on my pizza so that made me a little miffed.  Overall, the taste of the pizza was 5 stars, price/value get 3 stars being generous. Try it out though, just watch what they are charging you$$"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. This place has the best pizza and wings i have ever had. The employees are great very friendly good service and great price."}
{"text":"Pizza was good old NY style. Wings were good just enough spice. Service was also good! Only beef I have which is almost petty but they charge an extra dollar if you want to split the wings in different heat levels! Other then that I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They are nice and fast. I never have any complaints about their pizza, I love their chicken fingers and fries. I dont know if they make the ranch there but it tases home made! The only thing I wish was different is their dining area, its too small to have a big group or a big family. Theres only about 4 tables next to the wall. Hopefully they will grow and expand their business."}
{"text":"Workday lunch and wanted something other than Subway... I had a meatball sub (supposedly 10 inches) which came with chips (Lay's regular flavor) and a drink ($5.99). Meatballs were tasty, covered in a slice of melted cheese, but the sauce was just so-so. Felt very full upon leaving!  My coworker ordered the pizza lunch special--2 slices of cheese and a drink for $3.99. Added toppings were .50 cents each, per slice. They looked like tasty slices and seemed like a good portion!  Seemed like a family run operation and they make the dough while you're there. No frozen slices of pizza!  Nice option for something different with cheap prices!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I decided I would try Manhattans Pizza over some of the other nearby pizza choices. Here I go; the pizza and wings are actually not that bad. However, nothing about the pizza and wings really popped out and made me say \" wow\"! I tried the large cheese and pepperoni pizza. The sauce was tasty and the crust was good. Keep in mind that this is not \" brick oven\" pizza, but good nonetheless. The wings were hot and tasty as well. I wouldn't say they are the best in town but they were good. The price for a large pizza and 25 wings was under $25.00. Not bad for a meal that can feed at least four adults. Will I return? Yes I would."}
{"text":"This has the best pizza place and other wonderful takeout. The service is absolutely awesome every time we go. John is the nicest man, very professional, and always so friendly. My husband and I will only go here for pizza, salads. And other take out.. The owner is amazing and all of the employees.. I truly enjoy 8550 w charleston pizza. Kim and Gabe"}
{"text":"Ordered from grub hub the other night for fathers day. Didn't expect much. Well my dad and I were pleasantly surprised!  First of all the pizzas are pretty big. It's a good amount of food for what we paid. We like more expensive pizza places so this was surprisingly great.   The pizza tastes pretty good. Not going to lie it's not jaw dropping amazing. Hence only 4 stars instead of 5. But it's waaaaaaaay better than I thought. And we are seriously picky pizza people lol crust is kinda thin but that's to be expected with the style. Great amount of topping coverage. Not too much sauce. Decent amount of cheese.  We got the supreme.   We also got cheese sticks and wings. Cheese sticks were great and came with plenty of red sauce on the side. Wings were nice and crispy. Not a lot of hot sauce on them though. The wings did come with a TON of fries. Had to dig for some wings but that's not much of a complaint lol   Not to mention we were pretty far from them and ordered delivery. Only took about half an hour. Food was still piping hot and fresh at the door.   I would definitely recommend these guys. Only thing is when ordering through grub hub it was REALLY difficult. Items would disappear from the cart. Then appear twice. Then wouldn't accept our card. NOT THEIR FAULT. Just saying call them yourselves. Lol grub hub is glitchy...."}
{"text":"Today's trip for dinner at Manhattan pizza was extra special, the beer was extra cold , the pizza burning hot, and the wings were like volcano hot! But the beer cooled it off. I love this place. Always have a game on tv and people that work here are very friendly. I'll never stop coming here. Love, Chris and Vonda"}
{"text":"Good little place. Their pizza is Hella greasy though, but pretty good. Customer service is excellent and their wings are damn good, love the suicide wings! WHOOO addictive! Only get if u like and can handle spicy. The place is also tip top condition, very clean. The price is very good, $20 bucks for a large pizza and 20 wings"}
{"text":"Came into this establishment for the first time with my girlfriend we had a gyro, restaurant is very clean I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Make Manhattan Pizza your family tradition like we have! We order the colossal pizza every time we are in Las Vegas...it's HUGE and delicious! They will custom cook it for you...we order ours well-done and cut into squares. Ben and John are always welcoming; and treat us and our kids like family. We skip the pizza chains...this local joint is the best. We love Manhattan Pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok...Sauce is not good...Very clean eat in dining, beware of signs everywhere telling you your on camera...Guys behind counter don't smile, and aren't Italian...They have a \"version\" of NY pizza, and a very large pie...Price is ok!"}
{"text":"Just ordered pizza and the guy says it will take an hour. I just live 1 mile away and don't have time so I tell the guy I need to cancel. He says ok I will make right away and be right there. 1 hour later the delivery guy knocks on our door."}
{"text":"Good food for good price. I come here at least once a week. I get the dinner meals that come with a salad. large pizza for good price. Manager is a good guy! They have a yelp coupon for pickup orders!"}
{"text":"This place while close to home which is usually enough for pizza but this place just doesn't cut it. The staff is nice & the place clean but the pizza is meh! Just so so & soggy center every time. I know NY pizza is not Chicago thin & crispy or pan but this place just doesn't do it for me. I wish it did as it's the closest pizza place besides Pizza Hut. Which is the ultimate meh to me."}
{"text":"A lot of places advertise a NY style slice, however, they under deliver for us East Coasters who really know... 2 thumbs up on the pie! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Typical pizza takeout spot with saucy pies, various apps, salads, and lunch specials. The pizza is their forte, but I can't say I'm the hugest fan- as others have mentioned, the sauce is a bit too sweet for my liking and it was a touch greasier than I would have liked. However, the slices are huge and reasonably priced and a $4-5  slice is filling enough to be your entire lunch! The pepperoni is solid but the veggie slice is my go-to.  The salads are huge and fresh, and the gyro version in particular comes topped with tons of tasty protein. They also offer their gyros with fries as a cheap lunch special on Wednesdays, though I didn't particularly care for their tzatziki as it was mostly plain sour cream. Each day has it's own discounted special, though.   Service is pretty stellar- the guys working take my order, make it fresh, and have it ready in under 10 minutes even when I don't remember to call ahead. Dining in here IS an option, unlike other takeout-exclusive spots.  Don't forget to check in for 10% off your walk-in order!"}
{"text":"Best lunch special ever!! I also like the sauce they use on their suicide wings."}
{"text":"I really appreciate quality food and this place is definitely quality. I finally found a pizza place that takes care in their preparation. The pizza, wings, and salad were all delicious and had great flavor. The gyro salad was way better than I anticipated! The meat was cooked perfectly and the pizza crust was brushed in oil...not dry like all those other pizza places. And the service was awesome. I hope they get a lot of service cuz if not, its a shame!"}
{"text":"Being of Italian descent and a New Jersey native, I give this place a Legit Rating! Everything from the dough to the cheese to the toppings tastes great! It was my first time here and it won't be the last."}
{"text":"Manhattan is near where we live and is our go to place for pizza and tasty sides like cheese breadsticks or the garlic parmesan fries. The chicken Alfredo pizza is amazing and full of toppings and sauce and is absolutely delicious. We would definitely recommend this family owned place!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!    What an absolute joke! How this place could call themselves Manhattan Pizza is beyond me. To even attempt to associate themselves with the Pizza capital is false advertising. I would expect the Pizza chains to play the size game, but not someplace named after NY. Show me a place in NY where they have a 16\" pizza quoted as a \"Large\" for $12.99? After a short argument with the owner he offered to make  me another 16\" for $10.00. Really? $3 dollars in material and 10 minutes for $22? You should be ashamed! My original thought was he could have made a happy customer had he either cooked the size pizza I wanted originally, or offered me another for free. But when I got home and tasted this crap I realized that would have been a waste. This was hands down the worst pizza I have ever had EVER! I could have bought a frozen pizza for half the price and been more satisfied. Seriously, you can get a better pizza at Chuck E Cheese!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, you get a lot for your money. We go there entirely too often, they know what I ordered right when I walk through the door. We get the same thing every time the Everyday Special. The wings can be hit and miss but the service has been great and friendly."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and gyros, but if you're ordering a pizza, be prepared to spend a big chunk of money for a large, because the small is like a mini personal pizza and it tastes horrid. Always stick to the larger sizes, even if they are way overpriced."}
{"text":"one of my favorite delivery spots. All of their food I've had is so bomb! I highly recommend the spinach and feta stromboli, the veggie and fish burgers, the cheesecake and the chocolate cake! Mmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza shop !   It's quick and yummy!   Try the Greek Salad, I like it with extra meat myself, more meat more better:)   They have big pizza by the slice with all kinds of toppings.  You can order form Yelp and use a 10% discount is you pick up."}
{"text":"Tried using Groupon and not only did they first turn it down but then decided to take it but charge me more for the initial pizza I ordered previously!   On top of that, when I commented \"Thats a joke\", they had to get the last word and tell me, \"Your a joke\"....  Horrible customer service.  They had a chance to make things right but instead lost a customer for good.    How do people stay in business with this type of attitude?  Mind boggling to me."}
{"text":"I think people need to remember what this is...  It is a pizza joint.  Not a restaurant.  Those are two very different things.  Although they both serve food.  This place is about the quality and taste of their food.  I like their pizza, i LOVE their wings and I LOVE their Gyro salad.  When I am more in a pizza mood, I will definitely come here just for the wings and fries!!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some great pie!!! 3.99 for 2 slices of cheese and a drink! !!!! Right amount of sauce and the cheese is perfect. Great find on a lazy afternoon."}
{"text":"First time I came by.. I liked the pizza, but service wasn''t the most friendly, but I kept coming back and they have gotten way better, the guys are always trying their best, and pizza remains to be AWESOME! Still, the appearance on the local can for sure improve, but still... carry out is my favorite option. Try it, the flavor and taste won't dissapoint!"}
{"text":"I just placed an order online with this restaurant through a 3rd party company that the restaurant uses on it's website. When I walked in to pick up my order, I presented a Crowdsavings.com voucher to pay for my food. I was told by the owner that he could not accept the voucher for this order because he has to pay a fee to the 3rd party company for their service and that I would have to call them and cancel this order through them. I walked out without my food and I am very unhappy with them. Now I have a voucher that I do not even care to use because I wouldn't feel comfortable going back there again!"}
{"text":"The only complaint I have is that the lettuce for the salad needs to be fresher but the cheese and banana peppers make up for it.  I usually have the eggplant spaghetti and it definitely makes my comfort food list."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Affordable prices. Great conversation discussions with the staff. Plus the staff remember your name."}
{"text":"I'm confused at the good rating on this place. We went there because it was rated well and it unfortunately ended up being a bad decision. Place was completely empty when we walked in. Young guy at the register looked displeased that he was getting customers. Ordered mild and honey hot boneless wings and they literally just brought us 2 plates of mild wings, even thought he asked who ordered the honey hot before he sat the plates down. Food was mediocre, the workers attitude did not get better at all and we were very polite and respectful (there were 9 of us). He did not smile once throughout the entire time we were there, and made it seem like an inconvenience when we asked for anything. If it wasn't for the poor customer service, I might consider getting pizza from there again but its honestly not good enough to put up with that bad of service to get it."}
{"text":"Fried ravioli is just ok. Not homeade or anything, the idea on the premise is great but could be executed better. Even deep fried the ricotta cheese in the middle doesn't exactly melt, just barely warm. Overall taste not bad though, but sort of disappointing."}
{"text":"I am NOT a big pizza lover... BUT, Manhattan has Great Pizza!  It is Always delicious.  All the guys are friendly and go out of their way to make your pizza the best!  Service is always fast.  I would highly recommend eating IN for the best hot pizza experience.  Taking it home just isn't the same... The whole cardboard box thing is okay for leftovers but the yummy crispy crust just looses something riding home in a box.    The chicken gyro plate is very good too!"}
{"text":"We come here often to eat, we are never disappointed.  Wings were great, pizza was great.  Atmosphere is very casual and nice to just relax, enjoy some good pizza and watch some tv.     We ordered medium wings, were amazing. The supreme pizza was sooooooo good, I love a crunchy crust."}
{"text":"Great food, super clean, quick for dine in and take out... 100% perfect pizza spot for boca/tivoli area. Nice staff with quick, helpful service. Good quality and reasonable price  we have gotten their pizza three times now-Manhattan is our go-to pizza spot now!"}
{"text":"The pizza is the biggest and best in town! The slices are ginormous and only 2.79 a slice! What a steal! Check it out!"}
{"text":"We love Manhattan Pizza. We usually have one of the specials, Med or XL pepperoni w/wings depending on who is with us.  We have never been disappointed. There is something special about the crust. Sandwiches and appetizers are also great. We really need to try their salads... they look delicious. We haven't tried the pasta yet either...mainly 'cause we are hooked on the pizza with AmberBock on tap. Owners are no-nonsense....so that can get entertaining. We drive 25+ min to indulge, until we make it back to NY to have the real stuff. Waaaay better than a chain and putting on airs!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved, and found this spot is super close to my place. I have seen it before while driving by, but never had the desire to stop in. It's in a small strip mall on Durango and Charleston, right next to CVS and Popcorn Girl. After moving all day, cooking was the last thing we wanted to do, so we decided on pizza. I found this place via yelp, and from there found their menu online. They have pizza, wings, sandwiches, salads and appetizers. They also have lunch specials, and what caught my eye was their anytime specials. One of the specials is 2 large cheese pizzas for $19. Seems like a good deal! Any additional toppings are $1.50 extra. So I got one just cheese, and then added pepperoni and sausage on the other, and an order of garlic knots. Total came to $28 and the guy who took my order said it would be ready in about 20 minutes. He sounded busy so I told him not to rush.   We showed up around 30 minutes later, and the pizza was just coming out of the oven so it was fresh and hot! A minute later, the garlic knots came out and I saw the guy brush the tops of them with butter. I knew they were going to be good.  I also added a couple sides of ranch to go with the garlic knots. So we get home and the pizza was just OK. The sauce is a bit sweeter than others, and the crust was a bit flimsy. The garlic knots were also just OK. I really liked the marinara sauce that accompanied them. I think it is the same sauce they use on the pizza. The ranch though, was bomb! It is homemade and has a delicious garlicky flavor to it. So yeah this place was just OK, good but nothing amazing. I may be back to try the wings and possibly another pizza special."}
{"text":"I arrived upon Manhattan Pizza since I was staying with my friend Karen who lives nearby.  Being that she's from the east coast, I trusted her judgement and this place was great.  It's pretty nondescript but the pizza was just what I wanted.  Their \"giant\" slices are pretty damn big and nice thin crust.  The delivery large size is ridiculous too FYI..."}
{"text":"Very good chicken fingers/wing, grilled chicken salad and pizza!!! Nice people as well. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I've ordered take out from here twice. I recently moved to town and this place is only a couple blocks from my house. The first time I ordered here, my boyfriend and I agreed that is was pretty good take out/delivery pizza. The crust wasn't super thin nor super thick and it was both soft and crunchy. Great!  So we order it another night when both of us are too lazy to cook. this time we use a coupon deal that included an order of hot wings and soda. We both fill up on the pizza but I managed to get in two hot wings just to try them out. They tasted fine. But they weren't. Nope, not even close.  That night I was sick beyond belief. FOOD POISONING from the hot wings. They were either undercooked or were left out for too long or something. My boyfriend who was fortunate to have only eaten the pizza had to care for me for 3 days, while I threw up everything and bowed down to the porcelain god every hour.  The last thing I want is for anyone to get as sick as I got. So um, read this review."}
{"text":"Had to try it.  Had to try NY style pizza anywhere outside of the NY Metro area.  The slice was oversized, long, thick, and sweet.  Something Disney would recreate if they gave a damn about replicating NY style pizza.  I am noticing a trend on the west coast.  They all seem to follow the same recipe and exaggerated presentation."}
{"text":"The hubby and i were looking for a pizza place that served greek food AND hot wings...  DIng, ding, ding, we have a winner!  Orders hot wings (with fries), Gyro (with fries) & jalapeno poppers.  Ordered over the phone for pick up. Gave special instructions for the gyro (only lamb, sauce and lettuce, no onions or tomatoes). Wanted my hot wings medium and extra ranch.  The gyro was for the hubby, so i didnt try it. He stated that it was good with lots of lamb but the cucumber sauce was lacking something.   We both ate the jalapeno poppers and i have to say they were the best poppers i've ever had. No joke. So soft, yet crunchy. So juicy and good. The sour cream inside was perfect! Gosh, i want some now!! They tasted homemade, not bought. Being a foodie, i can tell the difference.  The fries were good. Not soggy, but crunchy. Their ranch is good. Plus they followed the instructions and gave us extra.. for no charge! I personally thought they gave way too many, I couldnt eat them all. I guess i should stop complaining.   My wings were good. At first sight I thought what a rip because it looked as if they had no sauce. But then I noticed the sauce was some what at the bottom and once I tasted them I realized it was the perfect amount. It made them nice and sauced, not soggy. It was a good amount and i left 2, which my hubby ate.  The prices at this place are well worth it.   It only took 15 minutes for our food to be ready. Pretty good, normal amount of time.   Will we be back?! of course. next time we shall try the pizza."}
{"text":"Their pizza is great and their service sucks.  Seriously, if you are a female be prepared to endure backwoods construction style attention in person.  If you call for delivery on the other hand try to remember that you are paying them to provide a service not the other way around.  I have no idea how these guys stay open, wait yes I do. The pizza is great, the people who run it, not so much.  Side note, I am absolutely positive they do not wash their hands after corn starching in the back."}
{"text":"I live nearby and I love this place! I went in the first time and had a gyro (which was amazing) so I went back today with a friend and we were determined to conquer the colossal! We ordered it and are still in awe! If you love to eat this is the pizza for you, its 28' of joy and happiness!"}
{"text":"Rude workers... ugh. Good fast food and that's about it lol. Not worth my anger to get some cheap food. Palermos at 83rd and lower buckeye is better."}
{"text":"I ordered from here over the weekend through Uber eats.  The pizza was delicious! I also ordered the fried pickles, tenders and antipasto salad... everything was good. I'll definitely order again"}
{"text":"It's not gross, but it's similar to Little Caesar's. It's like a half step above a little better.  Has a thick, chewy crust and generic sauce. I wish that I could say more about this pizza, especially since the staff is very nice via telephone and delivery is pretty speedy."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. Shouldn't even be considered Manhattan pizza I am from NYC and let me tell you I know hat pizza in LV will never be NYC pizza but this was absolutely disgusting, the cheese was all over the place the pepperoni was like sandwich style the sauce was just all over it was a terrible pizza"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  John is the best in helping out and making things right!  Food is tasty and fresh.  Not too greasy and not too heavy.  Subtle blend of spices makes it stand out."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas!!! Friendly service and timely prepared food. Highly recommended for anyone who love traditional Brooklyn-style pizza!"}
{"text":"This place has great owners and very nice people I changed it to 4 because they now are using filtered water in their dough recipe. Much better tasting and nice environment!  :) Happy eats!"}
{"text":"Great Food , great service would recommend this place to anyone . The pizza was out of this world ! This is a must for Italian foodies ! Everything was on point"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in town! Trust me I have looked   The closes you will get to a NYC pizza and the slices are HUGE!!!   Plus the owners are friendly and make you feel welcomed. You know they truly care and enjoy the customers that come in.    TRY this place out. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite pizza joint in town. The owner is friendly and the place is clean. Be prepared, one slice of pizza takes up two plates! The pizza is great!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER! I can eat here every day crust is amazing, sauce is perfect, and the guys that work there are so nice!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The pizza is amazing and the service is superb. We have been coming here since they opened and the owners are so sweet. Big 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Delicious, everyone is so courteous from the phone to delivery.  Pizza is reasonably price and the quality is fantastic."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a different pizza place, one that I haven't ever been to.  I came across this joint. Just a pepperoni pizza and lemon pepper wings.   It arrived promptly and hot! This place is about 5-7 miles from my house. I can't get a pizza this hot from a pizza place that is 1 block away from me! Driver was nice and friendly.  Pizza was just average for me. Not bad but not great. Wings were slightly better, also not bad but not great.  Don't mean to make it sound like a bad food review, it just didn't \"wow\" me.   But what i didn't like was the fact the they charge a delivery fee and an online ordering fee. Neither of these fees gos into the delivery drivers pockets. I had to tip on top these greedy garbage fees.   Not a place that I will be bragging to with other friends."}
{"text":"Good pizza and gets additional star for being a cheap eats.  Crust is pretty crusty and chewy.  Sauce has good flavor.  I would definitely go back especially when money is tight."}
{"text":"If you like the classic New York pizza (grease dripping) this is the spot for you! It's family owned. Real respectable owners. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Prompt service and always with a smile. I will gladly support this local business before spending money at a chain restaurant because of how well I'm treated here."}
{"text":"I had barely moved to Arizona last month and was craving pizza and wings and this place is near my home so I stopped by.   When I got home I deeply regretted that idea.   First of the guy who I first spoke to was rude from the start but whatever I was ordering to go so I don't really care.   I ordered the large pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni and sausage, cheese sticks, jalapeno poppers, and wings.   Everthing was burnt. The wings, sticks, and poppers were all black.   The pizza had little to no cheese and I had paid for extra cheese.  Last but not least, it was flavorless.  I felt bad for my family because they were not enjoying it either.  Anywho, you live and you learn."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza! It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for. I just wish they weren't stingy with the pepperoni"}
{"text":"So i used to love this place when i first moved to vegas, but goodness it has gone down a lot it the past few months.  So i order the spaghetti and meatballs, fried ravioli and some of the desert sticks-Cimmanon. I split this order between me and my husband and son. My hubby has a steel stomach and can eat anything but this made him sick to his stomach within minutes of eating it.   The pasta has no flavor, noodles are over cooked and the meatballs were definiteyly undercooked. Bread was stale and after looking closer looked like it had some mold growing on it. Salad was definitely old and droupy. and the fried ravioli was just overpowering pepper.   I will not order from here ever again. Mind you i wrote this post within the hour of eating and recieving my food. Almost 30.00 dollars is ridiculous for the quality of food and one actual plate."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and myself love this place for the pizza and really good prices. I say don't listen to the nay Sayers on here and try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"He was on his game tonight everything was cooked perfect. I have been going to Manhattan for awhile now and have to say as of late the quality had gotten a lot better. Pizza wasn't greasy at all, wings were perfectly cooked and sauce was hot and not vinegary like they use to be, the new chicken fingers are miles better then they use to be great flavor went garlic parmesan, garlic knots also cooked perfect not one overdone or under done. Will be going to Manhattan for pizza and wings now for now on."}
{"text":"After visiting Italy last year, I have looked and looked for good pizza in town.  A friend got pizza from Manhattan for a birthday party.  It is BY FAR the best pizza I've found since returning from Italy.  I live on the other side of town (Green Valley) but have been back to Manhattan Pizza on Charleston just to have it again!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery tonight and got a 16\" one topping, Alfredo pasta, a garden salad, and a 2 liter of soda.   First the pasta was AWFUL, there was no flavor.. at all. There was melted cheese on top and I couldn't even taste that. Alfredo is supposed to be creamy, yummy, and this was far from it. Ive literally had better from the grocery stores freezer section. The pasta itself was mushy, really mushy. The garlic bread tasted like oil, no garlic taste at all, no butter-y goodness, just oily and tough (like chewing beef jerky)  The pizza was weird, like the crust was almost cardboard-y, the sauce had a strong sweet taste like they added to much sugar, its got a strong basil taste as well. The cheese had no flavor again, it was almost fake tasting. The sausage I got on it reminded me of ground beef thats how SMALL the chunks were.   The salad was even odd. For one they put it in the SAME bag as the pasta which means it was warm, and sweated. The tomatoes were slices (how much energy does it take to chop a freaking tomato) and the cucumbers were soggy. Lettuce as meh, but what got me is the ranch was gross. It tasted like a cole-slaw dressing mixed with ranch. Sweet and mayonnaise-y with an odd powdered ranch taste.   The soda was good though, perhaps its because they didn't make it. They took over an hour to deliver and they are less than a mile away.   Now the driver was awesome, nice guy, even thanked me for the tip which shows great customer service ."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this little place. The pizza is like they say, \"Manhattan,\" in style, appearance, and even a little bit in taste. (You can't really get a New York-tasting pizza without New York water, which is the trick. I say this as a native-born New Yorker.)  The people working there are wonderful, and will remember you, if not by name, then by face and voice on the telephone. The little dive is remarkably clean and put together, though nothing fancy.  The prices are what you would expect, and the portions are good. If you are in Summerlin and hankering for a pizza, (or a Gyro or Greek salad), check this place out."}
{"text":"The two stars is a balance between decent (not great) food and HORRIBLE service. I was coming here a couple times a month despite the horrible service because it was nearby and the food was decent. Decent pizza from a local spot is still 100 times better than the best pizza from some chain. The lady behind the counter has a chip on her shoulder and either hates her job or her life, still not sure which. The guys are quiet and nice and will toss you whatever you ask for. Every time I went in it was a struggle as the food was decent but the service was just so bad. I was stopping in a couple times a month and ordering pizza, wings, and drinks usually dropping over 30 bucks a visit. A couple weeks ago my son wanted a happy meal and the wife and I wanted pizza, so we grabbed McDonalds on our way to this spot. We get in and were asked to leave because my son was eating his happy meal. Honestly I was about to drop 30 bucks for 2 people on a pizza and you are not happy because my son wanted to eat his burger? I laughed and walked out never to return. I get why the rule is there, but there is no law or health code being broken, just a stupid rule that cost you hundreds if not thousands of my dollars. I now go to the spot next to Fry's on 83rd and Lower that is honestly about the same quality with AMAZING service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch when I was craving some pizza. Had their lunch special which included 2 slices of cheese pizza (added pepperoni to mine) and a drink. It was under $6 and the pizza was fairly decent, but a bit too greasy. Service was friendly, but if I'm ever in the mood for pizza again I'll stick to Palermo's on 83rd."}
{"text":"I had high hopes because this would be a convenient place to pick up food on my way home.  However the Chicken fingers smelled and tasted of old oil.  Maybe they are better early in the day but they were soaked with oil."}
{"text":"Always pleasant visits. Always great food. Great alone or a group. They have gumball machines for the kids and 3 televisions for all your sport watching fans. They have great service, no long waits, you can call ahead with your order or order upon arrival."}
{"text":"Great food! Delivery took a little over an hour, but the items I ordered were awesome... lasagna & Greek Salad. I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I love this pizza! The owner is cool and always remembered us when we came in, which was often lol They would hook us up with things here and there, and again, pizza is delicious (:"}
{"text":"We got our food to go so can not comment on servic. However from my brief interaction with the staff I found them friendly. The pizza was very good loved the crust. Also had very good flavor. The wings were also pretty good not the best I've had but not bad by any means. The prices are pretty decent. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff, right when I walked in I got barked at by the lady taking orders for walking in with a drink from QT,  was getting stared at the hole time I was eating, can u say uncomfortable! Food was nothing to get hype about if you want some good pizza and wings don't come here. My niece and nephew didn't even eat to slices and they are usually savages !"}
{"text":"In a world gone mad there is very little someone can hold on to as true, as right, as constant. Rex Marvin is that person. Rex Marvin's search for the greatest food and the most huffable gasoline makes him the tragic figure that in literature would get the girl, save the day, and have the most severed heads in jars in his basement (if it was a Disney book).  The good news people, is that all of those things in real life are true.  If you consider a graveside ditch near the freeway to be a \"basement\".  Rex does. Recently, Rex was accosted for no reason.  Rex and his woman, Three Legged Midget Maggie, were minding our own business.  Rex was casually tossing TLMM up in the air until she was able to grab onto a ledge and let herself in.  Rex tossed her and she didn't come down. A sure sign that TLMM has accomplished her mission. Rex turns around to have 4 metro cops staring at him. They were big. They were not smiling.  Rex decided to break the ice.  Rex asked \"How many buy one get one free garden hose or industrial blacktop sealant coupons does it take to get 4 cops to walk away and pretend like they saw nothing?\" The next thing Rex knew he saw flashes of light. Rex smiled. Darkness. Rex woke up on the floor of a squad car while the cops talked about the loser they beat and were taking into custody. It must have been someone else.  Rex's left eye was shut but he saw that they had stopped at a gas station. They talked about food. They were getting gas station pasta. The smaller one looked back to check on Rex, and said that he was in the mood for \"frozen noodles in sauce\". Rex closed his eyes and tried not to vomit at the idea. He felt with his food that the back door wasn't closed all the way. Rex dislocated his wrists, slipped off the cuffs, and pushed the door open...and much like the time Rex woke up in Candice Bergen's bedroom...he was out before something that could never been taken back happened.  Not going to jail...no Rex can do hard time...but smelling heated frozen pasta is something that Rex will not endure.  Rex has endured more than most. Remember, Rex lived in drag as Jodi Foster's lesbian lover for 3 years...Rex HAS ENDURED! Still everyone has a line not to cross. One of Rex's is frozen pasta...the other is participating in the underground black market 8 track tape racket...lucrative, but Rex only needs to lose 3 toes to know that some money just isn't worth it. Rex has brains.  Rex needed to cleanse himself from the memory of that awful experience...so Rex ran. He crawled. He climbed into someone's trunk. He eventually reached the closest place he could find...Manhattan Pizza.  It is in a strip mall behind a bank and near a place that sells fancy popcorn, and none of that bodes well...but ignore the warning signs and go in.  There are a few staples in an Italian restaurant, and one of them is the Chicken Parm. If you can't make a lights out Chicken Parm then you should close your doors. Manhattan makes a very good one. The chicken is tender, the batter is crispy, the mozzarella is good and the sauce is great. Their red sauce is excellent. Just the right amount of garlic and acidity. The pasta is always cooked well, never over cooked and mushy. The next is meatballs. Manhattan makes a very good meatball; it is almost all meat and no unnecessary fillers. Lastly, can it make a pizza...a great pizza...and Manhattan...excels! Rex is more the New York style pizza kind of man. If you like a doughy crust, you are a hick, and this place might not be for you. They do put a lot of toppings on it, and that is a good thing.  The truth about Manhattan is the same truth people say about Rex Marvin...almost everything is good.  There isn't too much Rex hasn't tried he didn't like. The fried foods are all good, with a nod to the mozzarella sticks.  The pastas are all good and have good sauces.  The Alfredo could have some more parmesan cheese in it for Rex's taste, but you shake some more on and it is good.    The prices are too high. Period. The food is good, but Rex finds himself not going because for the same amount of money there are better options. If they dropped the prices Rex would eat there a lot more.  There are a lot worse places to go than Manhattan especially for the pizza. They do a very good job at New York style pizza, not perfect but a very good job.  They obviously care and try hard to make a quality product.  Sometimes they succeed better than others, but it is never awful. Rex can appreciate that. Just like Three Legged Midget Maggie, sometimes it takes a few throws, but she always tries. She always gives an effort...and in the end of the day...that means something.  Rex doesn't know what it means, but it means something.  Mahattan isn't Rex's first choice. It isn't even his second or third, but in a pinch it is good. It is really a 2 1/2 star place. Order right, catch it on the right night, it can be very good. Normally it is just above good. For the money, you can do better than good."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick slice, great authentic flavor. A friend had the Philly cheese steak and it looked great will try tht next. Owners and staff go out of their way to please. This has become a regular lunch stop for me."}
{"text":"First thing, I called in for a delivery right at the time they were closing and I didn't realize they closed at 10. regardless the time, the man took my order and delivered it to my house 20 minutes later. It was still piping hot and it was cooked perfectly. Being the last customer of the day it's normal to worry whether or not the food is prepared right. No worries here, the pie was great.   I ordered a pepperoni and cheese and it was spot on. It was very flavorful and the cheese was cooked perfectly. The dough was the perfect crispy and they put the perfect amount of sauce on the pie. You can tell that the pepperoni was not on the cheap, rather it tasted of a higher-quality pepperoni. I also ordered the cinnamon breadsticks and they were fresh and cooked perfectly also.   The two gentlemen that delivered my pie were friendly, unlike a lot of places that deliver.   I've ordered many times in the past from this Pizza shop and will continue to order again."}
{"text":"The name of this pizzeria caught my eye so we stopped in to get some slices to go. Service was excellent and the pizza was good. The slices are HUGE!! The full menu looks enticing and would return if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I was truly suprised by the food here. The place was empty, middle of the afternoon, looks like your average pizza spot. Should have just ordered pizza to stay on the safe side since it was my first time but I ordered some hot wings and fries. Not a risky meal but plenty of places ruin such a simple meal, either undercooked, soggy, etc. But I really enjoyed, the chicken was throughly cooked, crisp skin and tasty sauce. French  fries were some of the best I had in a while, seasoned and stayed crispy the entire time i was eating almost like they were battered. The prices are good and staff was nice.. Will go back again to actually try the pizza"}
{"text":"We live this place. First off you will never find characters like the crew at this place. They will deff put a smile on your face. And the food is great. The 28 inch pizza is good, we always ask for it well done. They will cater to your needs. Give them a try...it's worth at least one shot."}
{"text":"We have to thank Ben, for his generosity!! He donated THREE huge 28 inch pizzas to Valley Vegas. Once a month we go to Shannon West Teen Homeless Shelter   and bring them dinner, dessert and fun.   The pizzas were delicious!!  Especially enjoyed the sauce.   Manhattan pizza's taste won us over.  Its our new fav lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Everytime I've ordered from here the food has been amazing! I think I'm addicted lol"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Cali and was looking for a good pizza place that delivered. Well Manhattan Pizza certainly does that. Great taste, crust done to perfection and the large pizza I ordered was as bigger than an extra large back home. Great value, too."}
{"text":"Got the meat lovers pizza. Honestly, I thought it was just okay. It didn't taste bad but I've got old school pizzeria ingrained in my head and in my arteries lol."}
{"text":"I work in one of the neighboring businesses and the owner and his team are always friendly and sweet. The food is phenomenal too! Great value and Great dishes! Always my go to spot for pizza now."}
{"text":"Second time ordering delivery from them. Last time we ordered and received our food we devoured it before I could take any photos of the food but this time I remembered so here they are. Notice we already snagged some pieces. Lol. We got the same thing as last time. Ordered the medium buffalo chicken pizza which is amazing. Nice leftovers for tomorrow. :) not overpowering on the buffalo flavoring and has a moderate spice to it. Decent amount of chicken pieces too. Not to saucy and just enough cheese. Lingering spice left on your lips. Also got the fried ravioli with marinara that is so tasty and the anti-pasta with extra meat. Definitely worth the extra $3.00 for it. We got the large anti-pasta and it is usually enough for us to have leftovers for two nice salad lunches. It's  just the two of us. We live down the street which is nice so we actually received our order 10-15 minutes earlier than ETA. Definitely has been our first choice for pizza since we have tried them out. They have lots of other menu items as well such as chicken fingers, calzones , etc... you are not just limited to pizza."}
{"text":"Wings are burnt to a crisp. Pizza is about the only item that taste remotely well. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Almost everything was horrible that we ordered! The calamari was a joke. It went straight to the trash. The baklava and cheesecake were ok. We won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"the pizza was garbage and it made me sick to my stomach, literally!!!!  i'd never order from here again, first & last time they'll get my service !"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and great service. Strongly recommend. They have a long time customer in me, highly satisfied every time."}
{"text":"I ordered two slices of pepperoni pizza. The slices were big but I was shocked that the total was $7.45. The food was good but too pricey to me just for pizza"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good here!! Crust is crispy and the toppings taste fresh! Their burger is huge and delicious too  never had a bad experience here. And I can assure this place is a hidden gem. A+ place here"}
{"text":"I have passed by this place several times and finally decided to give it a try for dinner. When I went to pick up the pizza it wasn't ready yet so I had a chance to chit chat with one of the employees. They are very proud of the pizza here. I was told they use 100% mozzarella cheese, fresh (never canned) ingredients, crust that is made from scratch daily, and the pizzas are cooked in brick ovens. Aside from pizza they also offer calzones, burgers, subs, chicken fingers & wings, gyros, pasta, ribs, salads, sandwiches, and appetizers.   They have pizzas in sizes 12\" (meduim), 16\" (large), 20\" (giant), and 28\" (colossal) inch. I like the variety of sizes and the 28\" sounds interesting! I just decided to order a 20 inch \"Pepperoni Pizza\" that ended up costing a total of $18.37 with tax. The pizza wasn't bad. I liked the flavor of the sauce and amount of cheese. I don't know if they use garlic in the sauce or crust, but I tasted a distinct garlic flavor that I liked. The 20 incher was to big for me and hubby, so I had leftovers to take in my lunch to work the next day. I found the price of the pizza to be flat out ridiculous! Sure it tasted good, and I would eat it again, but not without some sort of really good coupon.  I was given a menu with my pizza and discovered they have a variety of specials. If you are just wanting pizza then they have a walk-in special for the 12\", 16\", and 20\" inch sizes, but I still didn't find it a fair price at all. They have different specials if you are ordering more then one pizza, or want to mix it up and have maybe pizza and pasta. You can also just stop in for lunch and order pizza by the slice. From 11 am - 3 pm they have a different daily special. The \"Daily Special\" is priced at $6.99 and comes with a soda. These prices don't sound bad for what you get. Here are the current daily specials:  *Monday - any pasta with garlic bread *Tuesday - any salad with garlic bread *Wednesday - lamb or chicken gyro with fries *Thursday - phily steak or chicken philly with fries *Friday - meatball sub or chicken parm sub with fries *Saturday - pastrami sub or french dip sub with fries *Sunday - italian sub or ham and cheese with fries  Delivery is offered with a minimum $15 purchase with-in delivery range of the store. Catering is also offered. If you want to order online you can do that too right from their website.   Store hours are Mon - Fri 10:30 am - 10:00 pm."}
{"text":"Ive been looking for a better slice in Vegas and I havent found one. This is goodness for single slices."}
{"text":"My family ate their yesterday. It was fresh and very delicious. I had the Gyro and now when I get a gyro craving, I'll know where to go."}
{"text":"This review is just for the gyro plate.  Although my husband reports that the pizza is very good.  I love this dish.  Lettuce, tomato, cucumber, two kinds of olives covered in gyro meat two kinds of cheese and some herbs.  Sounds simple buy the combination is magic."}
{"text":"I had been there several times and I thought the pizza was pretty good. It's close to my house and convenient. However, one day I went in and ordered a pizza and salad to bring the girls at work and I paid for it. Then when I had a question about something on the receipt the owner started screaming at me in front of everyone. He said, YOU THINK I WANT TO TAKE YOUR MONEY? YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK? Well I didn't until then. Great customer service, huh? If it was the best pizza in town (and it's not) I wouldn't give him one penny of my money again."}
{"text":"The pizza here is over rated and over priced.  I ordered a plain cheese pizza with extra cheese and when I got home the pie hardly had any cheese on it at all.  My bad for not checking the pie before I left.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice; well, not likely."}
{"text":"Naming yourself manhattan pizza might set the standard too high. This pizza was good but its not New York at all. So if you want new york you should go down the street to villa pizza. This pizza sauce is sweet. If you love oregano you will like this pizza. Good crust."}
{"text":"I love this place! Both my family and coworkers are regulars here. The family specials they have are good deals - the wings are delicious and the pizza is always fresh. Every time I go in for either work or home, the staff recognize me and ask me how life is.  We chit chat while my food is being made.  I love local places like this and am thankful that Manhattan has stuck around."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I have gotten food from here a few times expecting to have a better experience from the last, but I was wrong to hope for that. I once called and they answered \"Hold on\" and just put the phone down. After waiting a few minutes they just hung the phone up. I called back again and they answered \"Hold on\" again. I waited for 5 minutes before they took my order. I asked for their specials and the guy on the phone just says \"Well what do you want to know specials on?\" In a kind of sarcastic tone. We've ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged for them but received chicken wings instead. This has happened multiple times. When going back they did not even apologize and  they just took the wings back and made us wait for the chicken tenders to be made. Horrible customer service. The food here is WAY OVER PRICED. The pizza is mediocre. They may use \"fresh ingredients\" but really the crust is the best part of the pizza. Maybe I would have thought the food was better if I received better service.   If you want WAYYYY better NY pizza go to rockos pizza. Way better prices, extremely friendly service, way better EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place in Las Vegas for more than 10 years now. We just keep coming back!May it be for lunch, dinner or party! Yummy pizza, fries, gyros, phily cheesesteak and many more! My kids love their meat lovers and chicken alfredo pizza. Ben, the owner is awesome too!  May it be dine in, pick up, take out or delivery... you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and wings. Drive from south Phx just for their delicious pizza!!! They have great family specials."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good! Tried this place, because my daughter's friend's Mom owns the place. We'll probably order again sometime."}
{"text":"Tasty, thin, soft crusted, greasy and cheesy pizza.  All Great things.  The crust has a buttery garlicy sauce.  mmm..."}
{"text":"Just try this place the other week.  Pizza, wings & eggplant parm dinner.  It was delish.  Personally, I'm not a fan of their wings but I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So being from NYC I decided to try since I was shacked up with my son at the urgent care next door and he was hungry. I sent him over with my card to get a slice, only to have him come back saying they needed cash, (which I didn't have on me) so I walk over with him and ask for the special that's on the window only to find out that it's only until 4pm. OK. I tell the lady \"I just want a slice for my kid\". Ask her what do I have to buy in order to get to the minimum allowed for a card purchase. She says 2 slices. OK. 2 slices it is. Then she proceeds to tell me that they get charged $.80 if it's under the allowed amount. OK. Didn't really need to elaborate I was buying the 2 slices. Back to urgent care I go with Pizza box in tow. Only to try this \"NYC\" style Pizza which has no flavor at all.. I'm going to blame it on the fact that I am sick and maybe can't taste real well right now, but sick or not, you know New York Pizza! Either way I will give it one more chance because like I said it could be me being sick,but I don't have high hopes."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the valley. Been eating here over 10 years. Stop calling pizza franchises and call a long-standing local pizza spot like Manhattan Pizza. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"The pizza here has this delicious garlic glaze on it that makes the giant slice of cheese pizza worth it. Not the best pizza ever, but good. I love the chicken tenders though!  They charge for ranch and other sauces though!"}
{"text":"I needed to update my review because this place has become my number one take out and delivery spot. I have ordered from them so many times and my order is always right and ready before the time they give. The delivery man is so cheerful and lovely as well as the front desk man. I wish I knew their names but they are amazing. The deals and pricing is on point too! It's a great steal for the quality of food. Thanks Manhattan pizza!"}
{"text":"I will never go there again!  I have been eating at Manhattan Pizza for 5-6 years. In fact, I have not had Pizza and wings anywhere else in that time choosing to spend my money there. I have noticed a decline in the restaurant over the last couple years both with service and food. Tonight I had the worst dining experience in my life at what was once my favorite restaurant. I will never go there again. The service was completely unacceptable and the food even worse. The wings were burnt and had a weird taste, what was stranger is they were mostly broken bones sticking out and it looked as if the wings had been broken in half to count as two. When I brought it back up to the counter I was offered a doggie bag for them and told they could NOT make new ones or give a refund. To make matters worse I was told the owner cooked them and he was fine with how they looked. The owner refused to even speak with me. When I stated that I had been coming to that restaurant for 6 years and was about to walk out and never come back....the employee at the counter actually said, \"that's fine, we are ok with that?\" What business allows a customer to leave like that? Obviously this is one restaurant that does not care about the quality of food or service."}
{"text":"Wings are amazing especially  coming from a buffalo girl! The pizza seemed it was made with day old crust......it was stale and really hard especially  for a deep dish.  We are pizza people so I was disappointed  about that.  I must say I will be back for the wings tho!!!"}
{"text":"I went to purchase a slice of pizza.   I was told a slice was $3.00.    I said fine and would like to have the slice warmed up.   The owner placed a slice in the oven.  I asked to see the slice as well as the other slices in the pie.  The owner took the slice of pizza now out of the oven and put it back with the other slices.  He was not interested in now serving me.  I told him I just wanted to see the other slices.  Maybe I wanted a slice with the vegatables or just a larger different slice.  He said not interested in serving me.  I am the customer and wanted to see the other slices.  Don't go to Manhattan Pizza on Charelston Blvd in Summerlin, Nevada.  The owner is not friendly.  Not a nice man."}
{"text":"HMPF.  I ordered a large cheese pie and was really excited to get home and eat it. My review may be one sided since I'm not a huge fame of red sauce, much less sweet red sauce, which is what was on my pie.  The location is easy to find and 5 mins from my place, I walked in and was not greeted and felt awkward. I let them know I had placed and order after a man from the back came over to me. My pie was ready, but I was not offered any cheese or peppers.   The pie was just ok, we actually had left overs for 3 days, which is rare with pizza. The pie is a decent size, and the cheese is somewhat plenty, but the texture wasn't quite right.  They have many specials online, so check that out prior to ordering!  Semi Yay!"}
{"text":"We thought this place was the same as Manhattan Pizza on Craig. We were wrong.  We understand we ordered on a football Sunday, but the pizza was not good, and later than what their website said. The crust was chewy, tough to cut and bite through. The delivery driver obviously had the pizza tilted because the cheese ran into one corner of the box. We thought about taking it back, but decided to give it a try. This will be the last time we order from here."}
{"text":"I live right next door and whenever I'm craving Pizza or fried food this is the go to place for me. I like to try different things every time I order and it's always been delicious. Plus, the portion sizes are insanely generous, and you end up getting a lot more than you expect in most cases.   The only downside for me are the hours, as I find myself craving these types of foods way too often after they've already closed. Oh well."}
{"text":"The pizza is the best in the west valley.  The wings are even better.  Really good food.  Excellent choice for carry out."}
{"text":"First time stopping by and I picked up a gyro and fries. Service was quick. John took my order and was super helpful and friendly. Gyro was bomb. Their tzatiki sauce was thinner in consistency than what I'm accustomed to. The tomato in the sandwich wasn't freshest. But still a great spot to pick up a gyro. I plan to return and try their pizza soon."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service, did not wanna make me a colossal pizza , very lazy, threatened me, cussing & left a nasty message on my voice mail don't ever go here"}
{"text":"Best fries ever.. Philly steak sandwich is so good.  I love the owner and their staff, super friendly.  I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Been using this place ever since my wife managed the Sport Chalet up the street,  and my boys played NYFL, 8yrs in total. He always recognizes us, the service is great, the Pizza is awesome...BUT...THEIR EURO SALAD IS DEFINATELY THE BEST! Loads of lamb, seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in town!  Def worth the drive.  They also do pizza by the slice which!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place !!! Small family oriented feeling !!  Crust was amazingly delicious . Will be coming back"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent!! \"Inglewood\"  & the owner r hilarious!! Pizza is great!!! Thanks guys!! I will b back!! \"The Other Inglewood\" ;-)"}
{"text":"i ordered from here last night and John was the nicest guy on the phone he told me they were a little short handed and it would probably be over an hour for delivery ..which was fine by me ...but to my surprise John got me my food in about 45 minutes and with them be short handed I was worried about how that would effect the quality of the food and it surley DIDNT I think last night was the best I have ever had from here!!! the chicken alfredo pizza we add bacon of course was amazing and I cant wait to get another pastrami pizza I think that is my new favorite thing thanks again for the great service from john and great food!"}
{"text":"Went in a couple weeks back to check out the menu and get a snack. Staff was rude so I grabbed a menu and left. Called recently for delivery, the guy who answered the phone was unprofessional and rude. Won't be ordering from here."}
{"text":"Gotta love Manhattan. Always fresh, always fast, always friendly. I usually have the Philly Steak and chocolate cake. Great selection and great prices."}
{"text":"This place is becoming a standard for me.  On Monday nights, I have a rehearsal that goes until 9:30...and by the time I'm done, I'm ravenous!  Of late, I've been ordering Manhattan and having it delivered just as I arrive home!  I KNOW it's a pizza place, but their grilled chicken salad is great!! I don't know what they marinate the chicken in, but it's SO tender and moist!  It's a great salad for just $6, or splurge for the large for $8.  (Sidebar...when I order the large, I always say I'm going to save half for the next day.  That's never happened.)  Along with the salad, I order the Pastrami pizza for my boyfriend.  I haven't eaten it myself, but he says it's awesome - and our friends agree.  It looks to DIE for.  I'm a pretty picky pizza eater...so once I try the actual pizza, I'll re-review, but for now, it's getting 5 stars for convenience and tasty salads!"}
{"text":"This is our pizza place. We absolutely love their pizza and we eat here about 2 times a month. I love the location, it's right by my house, in the CVS lot at Charleston and Durango. I'll admit that it isn't that fancy on the inside but we never eat there so I really don't care.  I honestly don't know what it is that we love, but the pizza tastes so good! It's the crust and the sauce and the cheese. Aaahhhhh, cheeeese. The crust is a perfect thickness, not thick like a pan and not greasy at all and not too thin that it will snap or break in half. The slices are a great size and you can fold them!!! I love folding pizza, it just makes it taste so much better.  The cheese always tastes fresh and the sauce is neither sweet nor salty.  My husband always orders hot wings with our pizzas and he thinks they taste great. They also have these 2 foot pizzas that are made for large parties. Huge pizza!  We have never had any rudeness with any employees and they have always been nice to us.  I can't comment on the delivery because we haven't had delivery in so long since we live so close to the restaurant.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I Absolutely love this place, the food here is like love at first taste. I took the first bite of my chicken tenders & WOAAH.  This is my go to place after work at least once week! :) :)  The crew is great! (( specially John ))  I really recommend this place, great service!! Place is spotless clean..   *** the pizza is AMAZING ***    Manhattan Pizza is the place to go!"}
{"text":"There are 3 top pizza places in Las Vegas and this is one of them. When you walk in it feels like a New York pizza place even the booths remind me of the ones in some of the best fast service style joints in NYC. They have a 30 inch pizza! That's as wide as a standard door! And the price is great too. Lost a star (would only be half a star if I could) for the chicken philly cheese steak that was a little dry and burnt bun. Their pizza will is way above average though."}
{"text":"At first, I was not impressed with this place, not because the food disappointed me but because I thought the service lacked warmth. The owner of the place was just not friendly at all. But I looked past that because their pizza was amazing. After, he saw that my boyfriend and I became regulars and is now always super nice! He appreciates tips... I suppose anything to keep the family business running. He practically lives there. We always order their pineapple and ham pizza. I love the sauce, not too salty and a tint of sweetness. I love that their pizza isn't loaded in grease either. The price may appear higher than other joints but their pizzas are bigger. Love this place."}
{"text":"Moving from Columbus to Vegas, we had to have people over for THE Buckeye game. New to the area, I wanted to try a local pizzeria instead of the usual Papa Johns. Knowing we were going with the 28\" colossal pizza, I preordered it. The gentleman on the phone (I think was an owner) was professional, personable, and guaranteed our pizza would be ready at the time I needed it by.   We were not disappointed. The pizza was so big, I had to fit it in my trunk. Our group of self-proclaimed foodies, ate damn near the whole pie! Having soooooo many options to eat in Vegas, its hard to become a regular at a place. I don't foresee that becoming an issue with Manhattans. The pizza sauce is a sweet, the cheese on top was the right amount, the pepperoni spicy.   Great local business, give it a try. I think it might be pizza night, tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"**EAT WITH CAUTION**  Don't get me wrong, food is decent but unsanitary. Found 2 flies in my food, 1 dead and 1 still alive (who knows, I may have eaten more and didn't realize it) owner didn't want to acknowledge restaurant'smistake, he was very adamant about it being basil until he saw with his own eyes a bug crawling out from my salad. He gave us our money back which was nice but it definitely won't bring us back as customers."}
{"text":"POOR BUSINESS PRACTICES - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND AVOID THIS PLACE.   I'm still in shock over what took place. I'm running an event at the JW Marriott and decided that pizza and salad sound just right after a long hard day. I ordered because the pizza sounded good and they deliver. I ordered a Large pizza $16.99 and a Large salad $5.99. The total was $32. with a $2.50 deliver charge and tax my total should have been $27.28.  After the driver left I decided to look up the prices as it didn't sound right. Sure enough I was over charged. I called up and the guy on the phone handed me off to the guy that placed my order. He had a very heavy accent. He first told me they changed their prices yesterday. To which I challenged and then he said the delivery charge is $7 and when I told him that on the phone he told me the delivery charge is $2.50 he then said the Large Pizza is $19.99 to which I said no it says $16.99. He then said since I did half and half so he charged me for 2 medium pizza's to which I said you don't even have a Medium on your website only Small and Large. He then said well the difference is the tip to the driver. Of which I said you don't get to decide how much I tip the driver. He then had the nerve to tell me that I'm over at the JW Marriott having fun, he can charge me whatever he wants and I should just enjoy my pizza.   I then realized that since my cell number is an 818 area code that this guy thinks I'm a tourist and is fully taking advantage. Not only am I a Las Vegas local but I also run events in Las Vegas. He said that I shouldn't be arguing over $5. It's the principle not the money and I don't like being taken advantage of.   Hopefully this happened to me because I do question things and I will speak up. I hope this review will help save someone the frustration.   As for the food. Here is my review. The salad was good, no complaints. The pizza was OK, not bad but not great or even good. I'd say it was similar to Papa Johns.   There are way better pizza places in town and especially on this side of town. If you want deliver go with Papa Johns if you want awesome pizza try Eastside Pizza or Nathans. Not only will you be very pleased with the food but you don't have to worry about being taken advantage of.   Shame on you Mr. I don't have to tell you my name."}
{"text":"I'll start with the wings...Meh. Really small wings but the sauces aren't bad. Not great but not bad. The pizza is good. The Sicilian is too bready for me. The Neapolitan is good but you HAVE to get it well done or the bottom gets all mushy and flimsy."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I've ever had.  We lived in Las Vegas for 4 months and this was the only pleasent thing about Vegas.  We hated it there and moved back to Cali, but I still crave this pizza all the time.  Wish we had one over here.  There sauce is amazing but the best part of it is the garlicy olive oil stuff they brush on the outside of the crust, OMG, it's phenomenal.  You have to try it!!! It's heavenly!"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent.  Sauce was okay.  No fountain drinks.  Can for $1.00, 20oz bottle $1.75, 2ltr $2.99.  The problem I have with that is they had 16.9oz bottles of diet coke!  Of course they charge the 20oz price for it.  They don't bring your food to your table like most pizza joints, they set it on the counter, cut it and then you have to carry your extremely hot pizza to your table on the metal serving tray.  Will I be going back?  Not a chance."}
{"text":"This was the most unsatisfying expensive meal I've ever ordered from a pizza place. I ordered the large one topping special with hot wings and ordered fries on the side. The fries were disgusting, way too greasy and the hot sauce in those wings was so bland. The pizza, was ok, better than Dominos and Pizza Hut, I guess. I have no idea how they get away with such expensive prices and such poor quality food. Definitely won't be ordering here again."}
{"text":"The WORST pizza we ever had - PERIOD!  Domino's Pizza is better than this pizza!  NY Style?  NOT even close!  Been to NY many many times and this does not even come close to NY style.  The crust is THICK and NY style is THIN!  There was so much Basil on the one pie and over powered everything else to do with the Pizza!  The second pizza had pepperoni and they added no were close to the amount of topping of the basil.  Next, their site says $2 delivery charge but once you CLICK pay you are charged a $5 deliver charge.  They do not have their own delivery drivers but out source to some driving company.    The DRIVER was VERY rude!  So 2 medium pizza's with one topping each cost $26.00!  If you want GOOD NY style pizza then may I suggest  \"Upper Crust\", \"Rocco's Pizza\" or \"Mark Rich's Pizza\".  In vegas this is the CLOSEST NY style pizza places I've ever had."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!  I'm from Chicago, and all about deep dish, pan style pizza.  Never have been a big fan of many \"New York\" style pizzas.  This place though, has become my favorite pizza place ever.  The guys in there are always nice and awesome, they make the pizza fresh, and go out of their way to get what you want.  Even if you want a slice of pizza they don't have for slices, they'll take a cheese slice and do it up proper for you (if they're not incredibly busy, which is pretty rare).  Awesome food, awesome service.  The rest of their sandwiches and other items aren't half bad either (their fries are the best... I love, their baked, but still golden crispy and delicious)."}
{"text":"This review is for their chicken fingers. Great stuff at a reasonable price, comes with tasty fries and ranch dressing too!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 20\" giant pizza with pepperoni and mushroom, extra crispy....it is out of this world, cooked to perfection!  Great people here! Great pizza's, I go here on Sundays and our 20\" lasts for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"I have lived right by this place for 10 months now and was always skeptical to give it a try because it's a tiny shop next to CVS. It seemed a little to \"fast food\" for me. I finally gave it a shot and I am thrilled I did! I walked in, and I assume either the owner or manager greeted me warmly and offered suggestions. Before I walked in I checked YELP and I always disregard the extremely negative ratings. It was 50/50 but I felt the need to support my small community regardless! I went in, was helped with my order and walked out with a fresh, gourmet style meal in less than fifteen minutes. The guys that work there are fantastic at what they do! I just wanna say this place deserves a great rating. They are clean, friendly, and most important GREAT food! I walked out with a meal (two to three meals actually) for $9.75. The welcome alone prompted me to tip and take the time to write a review .. I waited until I tried all the food and if calories didn't exist I would probably be there 3 times a week! Thank you for the service! Give this place a try! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Don't go for the chicken fingers. I might try their pizza in the future, but the chicken fingers are no better than you would get by heating up frozen ones from the grocery store. Fries are pretty tasty though, and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've ever had! The guy who works there is great! I don't know what's in that pizza sauce but it's remarkable! I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Takes your order but may never deliver and won't let you know.   I ordered recently through seamless and after waiting an hour I decided to call, and they said it was never started  because they never confirmed it. They never bothered to let us or seamless know and just hadn't bothered to do anything.   Rest assured I won't try again."}
{"text":"I've been here 2-3 times.  The pizza doesn't remind me of NYC pizza.    Once I asked if they offered 'Grandma-style' pizza and the guy made a wise crack saying they didn't have that nor Grandpa-style.  He obviously didn't know what I was referring to.  http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2008/09/what-is-grandma-pizza-erica-marcus-explains-once-more.html  In the Avondale/Tolleson area, I prefer Costco pizza or 1 Brothers Pizza over this place."}
{"text":"Grabbed To go from here last night ordered the chicken fingers, yes I went with that because well I am not a huge fan of pizza :P. I will say extremely fast service! Very tasty food, the fries were seriously unbelievably good for just being french fries. No special seasoning, nothing just super fresh! I had a Cannoli as well and it was Crunchy which is how a cannoli should be but the chocolate inside the ricotta had already been in there for a while so it didn't really give me that nice bite of chocolate. All in all will definitely order from them again, just maybe skip the Cannoli."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was probably the worst pizza I've had! I'm usually not picky at all but it had no flavor and I didn't even finish a full piece. Our order of garlic knots were way over cooked and so hard we threw most of them out. Maybe they were having an off day but we will not be back to find out."}
{"text":"Have been trying to find different places and read the reviews and gave it a try....we are glad that we did! Great food at a good price, feed 3 for less than $40. Supreme pizza had so much flavor and the crust was so good. Chicken wings are good size. We will be back for another try!"}
{"text":"Great pizza at good price.  Staff was courteous.  Helped me with what I wanted.  Think this will be my new \"go to\" place in Las Vegas.  I ordered a combination garlic and BBQ chicken.  Worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Whoa, this place is uneven. Or maybe they had a really bad night. I've ordered takeout from them several times, usually the the eggplant parmesan. The first time I was a little taken aback that there wasn't much eggplant to the eggplant parmesan, but the flavors were decent and I got used to the pasta:eggplant ratio.    The last time I ordered the eggplant it was such a disaster I'm afraid to order again. It was not only overcooked to the point of dryness and burnt eggplant, but they had, for some reason, put ricotta into the mx somehow, creating a weird graininess. I don't know if they botched an order, mixed two orders together or what and then tried to get rid of it by sending it out, but it turned me off altogether.  If you take pride in your product you NEVER send a bad order out. Ever."}
{"text":"I have been going there for a few years. In my opinion the crust is wonderful and the pizza is sauced correctly without it being overly greasy. Staff is responsive to your needs and will make it thinner crust if you prefer. Ben is always friendly and helpful. Best pizza so far!!!"}
{"text":"With a huge pizza and great customer service, I love Manhattan."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quality ingredients- quality pizza.. Family owned and across the street. Manhattan has been our go to for 4 years and counting."}
{"text":"Delivery service 5 stars; prompt, professional, and friendly. AS IT SHOULD BE for the ridiculous $5 delivery charge, not including tip. Gheesh! That's an extra order of cheese sticks! Which by the way, were not impressive. Chicken tenders were SUPER GREASY, stay away. Cheesecake was frozen and bland but the cannoli was BOMB!! I had a sweet tooth obviously. Cheese pizza was pretty good with its chewy dough. Make sure you order a side of their ranch dressing. It's the real stuff. Overall, I definitely would order again because I like supporting small businesses. And their prices are very competitive."}
{"text":"Moved into the summerlin area and saw this cute little pizza spot right next to my new apartment and absolutely loved it! It's hard finding a good pizzeria in the west coast but I highly recommend this spot :)"}
{"text":"Very good food. It's hard to find good gyros in Vegas and the slice of pizza is huge. Overall a very good value. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This pizza was great, it just had cheese on it but it was very tasty.  The cannoli was the best I've ever had.  People have said the guy inside is rude but he's Italian, straight and to the point. I thought he was very nice. Never rude, he doesn't smile much but he's always nice!"}
{"text":"Still same delicious pizza as they always had ! I highly recommend this place if you are real gourmet ! Try Gyro and Hawaiian pizza - you'll love it !  Delivery is fast, pizza is hot and delicious - what else you need?  Thanks guys !"}
{"text":"Good pizza at a family owned establishment. They are always fast. My husband enjoys their wings and he's a wing guy--and I love their calzones. Good ranch too!"}
{"text":"Believe the reviews!  This pizza is hands down no questions asked THE BOMB!!!!   Best tasting pizza in Las Vegas.  That's a bold statement.  Cheesey perfect crust with my pepperoni and sausage oh boy what a treat, side of ranch now I'm on cloud 9.  Thank you Manhatten Pizza for my great tasting pizza and such fast service and gracious customer service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I order from here prob once per week. Either take out or delivery. The food is consistent.. Its fairly priced. They have the BIGGEST SLICE OF PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD"}
{"text":"When I worked in this area, I tried many different pizza places. I always found Manhattan pizza to be the best value, and good. Today I had a slice of Hawaiian that was so huge...for 3.99 and an ice tea...total bill 6.22. I used to order pizzas from here for my work crew....they always delivered on time and good quality. The two guys running the place have been here a while and are friendly and solid guys, and I support them and their business. I hope you will too. Nothing fancy, just a good slice and clean."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza for delivery as my wife and I worked late shifts today and were bombarded with guest and cleaning that needed to get done. No problem we yelped a pizza place near us and ordered a \"20 pepperoni pizza wings and a salad as well as a coke the total was $44.00 I thought it was a bit pricey but my wife loves to try hole in the wall joints When the pizza arrived the pizza was stuck to the top of the box and we ordered coke and received a sprite. I was quite irate as my family was starving and we had just paid a decent amount of money for CRAP!!! I called and spoke to the store who instead of trying to calm me down and apologize it was excuse after excuse after excuse well it was an accident and we'll thing happen an immediate refund would have been enough instead of an argent for who was right and who was wrong IF YOU WANT POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AS I TOLD THEM ON THE PHONE SHIT PIZZA CALL MANHATTAN THEY WILL SURELY OVER CHARGE YOU FOR THERE HORRIBLE ATTEMPT AT MAKING THE SIMPLEST THING KNOWN TO MAN A PIZZA!!   **Update the manager sent another pizza and the correct beverage I changed my 1 star to 2 stars simply because they attempted to rectify the problem however as I told the delivery driver we did not want the second pizza and had to find a homeless person to give it to as I feared of food retaliation I just will simply never eat at Manhattan pizza thank you for trying."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast and friendly owner, will definitely be back. The slice that I had was huge with paper chicken mushroom n cheese it looked nice too. Defiantly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Changing the review. Taking it from 5 stars to 3 stars. Last few times we have gone in or had it delivered the food has been subpar. One order my husband never got the soda we paid for and now this order we got the wrong order. And now I remember why we don't have it delivered, the driver was too busy trying to get the tip out of my hand than giving me my food. I had to have my son take the soda and then my daughter had to take the wings since the guy made me take the pizza from the bag.  He couldn't even do that. I don't think we will be ordering from here again and that's a shame we used to really like the food. But even the food is going down hill. The French fries this time were super soggy and usually when we order for pick up and bring it home the French fries are still crispy. And this time the pizza was super greasy and tasted off."}
{"text":"We're regulars here! Owners chit chat with our son bc they know he loves and plays football! Their &19.99 deal is big enough for family of 6! Always  Ale their wings fresh! Our family pizza night comes from manhattan!"}
{"text":"Still the best pizza you can get in Tolleson. They don't deliver, but it well worth the pickup. The wings are okay, pretty standard...but the pizza is too good. My lady is from NJ/NYC area and confirmed, this is as good as it gets in the area (and trust me, we've looked EVERYWHERE for something that is NYC quality).  If you're looking for some good pie in the west valley, this is where you gotta stop."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to do this for a long while, and to do it often. Sadly I've failed. This is one of my favourite places to go, I'm allergic to wheat, but don't care when it comes to this place. Fresh ingredients, no sugar in the dough, brilliant service. This is one of my guilty pleasures. The staff is so hard working, pleasant, and generous. I highly recommend this place to anyone. Fast service made like it was a sit down parlor. Cheers"}
{"text":"Came here to try it because it's close to my house. Ordered pizza and wings and garlic knots. Nothing special, actually the pizza was really greasy... Far from impressed.. Cheap but you get what you pay for. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Super disappointed for delivery regardless it's $25. I asked the gentleman to give me a medium pizza and I ended up getting a small so basically plus tip I paid $30 for a small pizza ridiculous!!!! Was not told what so ever."}
{"text":"I know we have posted about this place a couple times.  But we cannot emphasize enough how much we love this place!  Last weekend we put them to the test, there was a local place back in Humboldt that made a pizza called the stuffed mushroom, we told Manhattan the ingredients and it was AMAZING!  they nailed it!  and the homemade canolli is a little slice of heaven!  okay a large slice of heaven!  but this place is awesome we love them and you should too!"}
{"text":"First time here and not impressed.  Only had a slice of pepperoni and it was very bland, no taste at all.  And no soda fountain machine, only a cooler with cans and bottled drinks.  Staff had no personality, either."}
{"text":"Review number 71 :)   This is a killer good pizza joint.   Philly cheesteak pizza -- 5 out of 5 as close to a outstanding pizza I have had. There sauce is really good almost like a creamy Alfredo sauce cheese witch to me makes the pizza is high quality stuff. Also this is a pie that you can fold has nice shape and taste to the dough. This is def. a lighter style pizza not too heavy seasoning are nice on the pizza also good quality steak. A must try.  Also got chicken wings--  these comes french fries witch I was a little shocked at first and thought I got the wrong order. The Chicken wings are jumbos really good and clean tasting not fryer like witch is nice. Also the french fries where really good to also came with celery and carrots . Ohh get the blue cheese dressing I think its in house made and just amazing !!  Barry V you need to try this place .   I wasn't thinking that this place was going to be that good but expectations nicely meet   will re order for shure !"}
