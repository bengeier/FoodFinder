{"text":"I was told the burgers where great here......well last night we gave them a try.   I was not impressed.  We order two jumbo cheeseburgers one with fries, the other with onion rings.  The burgers where BURNT to a crisp.  All the favor of the meat was gone. On a good note the onion rings where great.   Please don't burn the burgers."}
{"text":"Let me say that I will never order from this place personally. I was just picking up an order for my mother and I go in to pick it up and there's a difficulty understanding who ordered the food. I tell them my name and they say there's no order with that name. So I have to sit and list off all the food on the order and of course my the order popped up but under some ridiculous not existent last name. So then they had the gall to sit and refuse to give me the food and basically treat me as if I'm going to steal someone else's food like their food is some great 5 star meal and I couldn't even say anything I was a loss for words because of how idiotic it was.  I said whatever and was about to leave and they rung it up anyway. After all that needless to say the customer service is horrible, the food is sub par at best if you like grease drenched food. I'd give it less if possible. I would not recommend wasting your time or money here."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch if you want something quick and easy. All-American food and speedy service. I love the jumbo burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Visiting friends in NC and we stopped here for breakfast. At first our order was take out but then we decided to eat in. They got out order wrong but was friendly in fixing the error. The food was okay for the items that we got."}
{"text":"I grew up getting onion rings and chicken fingers from South 21. It still to this day is one of my mothers favorite places to get onion rings. I do have to say though that while the staff is incredibly friendly. I have noticed a slow decline in the quality of food. Nonetheless, it's still a wonderful piece of Charlotte memorabilia."}
{"text":"Food is crazy good! The fried BBQ chicken is delicious and the French fries are awesome. Fast friendly service sodas are very fizzy and the restaurant is very clean. Try it out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was greasy. Fries just average.  Chuckwagon burger, a breaded patty was not good at all. Don't know why they get reviewed so well. Just average or a bit below."}
{"text":"This place is right down from where I work so I thought I would give it a try. Just finished a jumbo cheese burger and fries. It was not the best I had but very good.  I like the old diner feel and the staff was very friendly. For $7 it was a home run lunch.  I got my burger fix for a few weeks.  Cheers"}
{"text":"We love it here. Easy to order, such a cute throw back and you can't beat the prices. I Iove the country ham biscuit, it is salty, soft and so delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a burger and fries! Always courteous and always fast service. If you're in the area stop by."}
{"text":"Today was the 2'nd time that I've ordered food here, and it is nothing like the South 21 in Matthews.   The first time, I had a hot dog, all the way.  It was ok, but not that great.  Today, I ordered 1/4 chicken - white meat, with onion rings instead of fries.  The chicken looks really good and has a beautiful crust, but it is literally crunchy with zero flavor.  Likewise, their onion rings are very different from onion rings that I've had at other South 21's, and lastly - their slaw!  I LOVE South 21 Greek-style slaw with oil & vinegar.  This slaw that came with my meal today was quite dry, with a sweet taste to it.  Again, not at all like the slaw in Matthews.   I'm so disappointed because I can make it to this location from my office during lunch.  Can you PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE send your kitchen staff to train at Matthews South 21 in order to learn how it's done?  There is quite a difference.  :'("}
{"text":"The best onion rings I ever had. Good crunch and flavor and the onions are cooked and don't come out of the crunch on the first bite. Fried chicken and vinegar slaw also good. Best price around for a filling meal."}
{"text":"I grew up in this part of Charlotte and this place has been here since I was a young kid.  I go here about once a week and I ALWAYS get the Cheeseburger special w/ fries and a drink for $7.  A great lunch deal!  It's so good I can't bring myself to even try anything else on the menu but the other food that comes out looks great though.  The staff is real friendly and the food comes out fast.  I recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to go here a couple mornings a week for their breakfast special. It's a couple eggs, about 4 strips of bacon, an awesome biscuit, and a ton of breakfast potatoes, all for about $4. The people are always friendly and service is pretty quick.   I used to go to lunch their occasionally and get the BBC plate. It was really good too.   In general, the food is good, the prices are great, and people are friendly. I couldn't really ask for much more."}
{"text":"OK. I love diners, dives stops and family restaurants. This great place satisfies all my needs. They meet you at the door smiling, get your order out quickly and the price is right. Hot burgers, fries, onion rings, good ice tea, clean restrooms and tons of parking. Make it a stop next time you go by IKEA or Target off of 85."}
{"text":"Tried it out today. Not sure why it took me so long...Don't let the construction hinder you. I went at 11am on a Thursday when they opened and was served, ate and out within 20 min. I got the fried chicken (white meat include breast and wing, slaw and fries. Chicken and fries were cooked perfectly although it definitely needed a little more seasoning in the breading. Ok not a little, a lot more. Texture was perfect but needs seasoned! The slaw was ok. A lot of vinegar. I love all forms of slaw but a little mayo and sugar and celery seed would've raised it to a level of perfection. This meal was under 6$ and well worth it! I still have half to eat later! As far as the service it was more than amazing and friendly. I'm happy to add this spot to my list of a go to and support our local businesses. Get the seasoning down and I would rate it 5+! Thanks for the full belly:)"}
{"text":"Had a friend with a long layover at the airport.  Saw this was sort of nearby and decided to give it a try.  Sadly, we missed breakfast by about 10 minutes.  That was a bummer, but we went for cheeseburgers and fries instead.    Seriously, why would I ever go to a \"fast food\" joint and pay about the same for a trash burger?  This was fantastic and so is the price.  Was able to get iced tea to my liking - mostly unsweet with just a tad of sweet tea added to make it drinkable.  No explanation required, she made it proportionately perfect.  Burgers were excellent.  Fries were awesome.  All three waitresses checked on us for drink refills, etc multiple times.  Any fast food restaurant ignores you after the food is served.  We were treated like kings here.  Sure enough, as it got closer to noon, the place was packed.  No big surprise there."}
{"text":"Really good food. Ive had the fried chicken and the cheeseburger and both were good, although the chicken can stand a bit more seasoning. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars cause I didn't like the food. I ordered the fish and shrimp combo, it came with fries, slaw and bread. I'm not a big fan of vinegar based slaw so that was thumbs down and the rest of the meal was ok. It was edible cause I was hungry but I won't eat here again. The place is clean and the customer service was good I just didn't like what I ordered. I cut back on red meat so that's why I didn't get a burger but that seems to be their specialty cause that's what everyone else was ordering and they had a nice little crowd. Not a bad place I just wasn't happy with my food."}
{"text":"This place is great. It may be small but the food is amazing! You have to try the milkshakes. They are worth every calorie."}
{"text":"A common complaint about fast food is that it isn't fast and it isn't food.  In contrast, my excellent, made-to-order flounder sandwich with fries came out quickly.  Both were piping hot!  I'm an out-of-towner but South 21 Jr just made my list of favorite breakfast/ lunch spots in Charlotte.  A great locally owned business that deserves your attention."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Highly recommend this place for a good eggs and potatoes style breakfast."}
{"text":"Good food and cheap. I had the breakfast special. Four strips of bacon, scrambled eggs, potatoes,2 piece of toast. Enough for two breakfasts. Yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this establishment. My only complaint would be the location, it's an interesting path to get into the parking lot. The decor is simple yet functional. The food was made to order, hot and fresh. Worth the cost and the headache to get there!"}
{"text":"I have visit this place in the past food was awesome however I believe they're up Under New Management food tasted nothing like before service was nothing like before restaurant very unkept. Visit doing lunch hours however maybe a total of 6 customers in the restaurant will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, and since the last time I've came here they changed the menu. For the first time I saw a burger called the 21 express. Three Patties?! ...Umm, I definitely will get that next time. But at first glance I was a little intimidated by the burger. I however decided to get the Double Cheeseburger. And whoa, explosion in my mouth (or a slight clog in my arteries) I felt it. But that's all good, the lettuce and tomato was there to kind of open those arteries.  Overall, this place is always busy during lunch time. And I could see why. Cheap prices, homey feel, and the long lineage and history of South 21 gives you the bang for your buck for a fast and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Made our first trip to South 21 today and it was great! The onion rings are fantastic. I had the super boy burger special for Friday. Excellent burger. Cooked perfectly with just the right amounts of lettuce, tomato and onion.  Will absolutely be going back here!!"}
{"text":"Love love love South 21. But do a call in order of you're in a rush. They move fast but you'll be in and out a lot quicker."}
{"text":"The crusty Super Boy burger rocks (with a dill pickle on top).  The shoestring fries are hot and crispy.  The fountain sodas are strong, icy cold, and served with pellet ice.   Fast, extremely friendly service by smiling waitresses.  The employees remember you after a couple of visits.  A ton of regulars dine here, and the place gets crowded very quickly during lunch.  I always tried to arrive when they unlock the doors.   I LOVE the décor, with the red metal flake vinyl upholstered booths, and the fifties movie posters.1955 lives at South 21 Drive In!  I also loved the fact that this is a major CMPD lunch hangout.  I have seen as many as 15 officers having lunch here at the same time.  If there is a safer place to eat lunch in Charlotte, I don't know the location.   Prices are extremely reasonable.  Food is made from scratch and it is served quickly.  I have never had to wait over ten minutes for my order to be ready.   There are many menu options, including fish, pork chops, etc., and everything is tasty.   Extremely easy access from I-85 North, Exit 42.  The restaurant is also convenient to IKEA and UNC-C."}
{"text":"Great little spot out in middle of nowhere. Give it a shot. Simple food. Simply prepared. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Good burger, friendly counter staff. Quick and cheap! :)"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the burgers and that's about where I call it quits. If you enjoy really good fried chicken, don't order it here! While it has an awesome crisp to it, it has NO seasoning to it. My burger is always how I order and how I like it. Ooey, and gooey, hot and melty cheese. Do wish they had crinkly fries though. Sun drop is on tap...that's a positive!"}
{"text":"Food is fair and prices are very reasonable for such a huge platter.  I would rather order a cheeseburger meal here than a fast food restaurant because it tastes better and sooo much cheaper."}
{"text":"This is a really good place, food is good, fast, service had a family vibe to it... Excellent. Love their milkshakes."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, fast service, decent customer service. Great place to go for a quick bite or lunch break. Wish they had better hours. Close a 3pm everyday except Thursday and Friday...closed Sunday and Monday"}
{"text":"Service was quick and great.. Food was very good. I had the Cheeseburger Special which is just enough food for me. Atmosphere is pretty quiet despite the ongoing construction in Tryon. I definitely recommend this place for lunch so far."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN FAVORITE DINER! This is the place I go to to get the lengendary Super Boy! It's a double patty burger with onions, mustard, and a huge bun...(maybe tomato comes on it, but I always get it without) and it comes along with great fries. Pair this burger with a vanilla milkshake and you will be all set! I swear this hidden gem is as good as it gets. Its family owned and the people that have worked there have been there since I was a child. Its nice to come in and always see a friendly face :)"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!! In fact, everything on the menu is great! Chicken & trout plates are not to be missed. I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  I go here for lunch quite often and have yet to be dissapointed. The employees are very courteous and friendly.  The burgers are mouthwatering and their fries are always hot.  Also a big fan of the chicken chef salad.  Although i did try out the s21 in mathews and it was a total 180 from this place, definitely not as good.  My coworkers and i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Breakfast is pretty good the services so so all in all not a bad place to eat. I've had some bad experience and I've had some good experience eating there I will definitely recommend this place if you have a lot of patience."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  Call in your order, gets kinda crowded!!! I used to come here often years ago. Also,to the other location on Independence. This location is Dine-In/Pick-Up. Very clean, that may be due to the fact of it being so small on the inside. Small as diners can be, this one packs a punch.  And if you get here at peak lunch time... It pack em in.  I've now been twice for lunch. Hot Dogs, fries & Milk Shake. All were good, but honestly it's a hot dog & fries. (How hard it that) I will say the fries were better than standard fries, and the food is always hot & ready in 10 mins usually.  I don't usually hand out 5 stars. I do when the service is consistent, the food is consistent, wait time is consistently good, and lastly a fair price. All of which they ball spot on..  TTFN"}
{"text":"Chili hotdogs were the bomb and just what I ned d on this particular day. A throwback dive diner with a great staff and wonderfully greasy food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been going there for 50 years, no kidding! They just don't do drive ins any more and that's a shame  This place had the best burgers and fried chicken in town. Go and ask for a Witch Doctor for your beverage, it's a southern classic!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, typical fries, and Cherwine on tap. My brother's chicken salad looked tasty and they did not skimp on meat whatsoever. Overall great place just wish the construction wasn't so darn annoying to park."}
{"text":"Not sure how low some peoples standards are on here but this is no Five Guys. Maybe '2 and Half Guys'. But seriously, no offense to the owners, but this is the worst burger I had in Charlotte or maybe anywhere. I really tried to make it taste better by adding condiments, salt, or anything to make the bland taste magically disappear. But nothing. After eating 60% of the Jumbo Cheese Burger, I stopped and I was gagging and throwing up and I never do that with burgers. My stomach loves burgers but said NO to this one. I should've just went to McDonald's. But no, I was starving and wanted to try something new and different. Ugh. Shame on me."}
{"text":"What a great burger!  You get the Super Jumbo with two beef patties and two cheese slices fixed any way you like it for $4.97, plus fries or onion rings. The O rings are excellent. They have great sweet tea.  They don't do curb service here. Very casual, easy in and out.  Owned by the Original South 21 Drive-In on Independence Blvd, going strong since 1955."}
