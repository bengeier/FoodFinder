{"text":"First time I dined here quite possibly a day or two after they opened & everything was spectacular. Their shrimp linguine was generously portioned with loads of very fat shrimp & I inhaled everything on my plate in a matter of minutes. Sis couldn't keep her fork off my dish either. I forgot what she ordered but it was also pretty good & I kept stealing hers to the point of no return. Second time around, sis & I used a $30 for $15 Groupon voucher & OMFG! SALT ASSAULT/INAUTHENTIC B.S. EVERYTHING. Do I detect a faint whiff... no, a quadruple sucker-punch of new management sabotage? The bulgogi tacos were the absolute wrong cuts of beef (tasted like overcooked stewing beef smothered in the absolute worst attempt at bulgogi seasoning known to man & looked like dry, puckered Rendang. I swear I also detected a faint hint of gristle. It took all my TMJ strength to chew it into swallowable pieces). The Angry Duck spring rolls were possibly the best stuff there. Still, very unimpressive & unmemorable. I got ambiguous mush/a practical joke instead of tangible, deliciously game-y chunks of duck. The thing that really irked me was their Pizza Margherita. The cheese was shredded low-grade mozza-cheddar crap (instead of Fior Di Latte as falsely indicated on the menu. DAMNABLE LIES!) & the crust was way too thick & reminiscent of commercial freezer-to-oven pizza. Not to mention, no fresh basil leaves. Guess what we got instead: dried, green particulate matter in a shaker. I was beyond appalled. At $12~13, I expected some effort towards authenticity, not just a basic delivery-calibre cheese pizza. Margherita D.O.P. methinks totally not! Margherita of Savoy would be spinning in her grave! Also, the washrooms were just EW. Toilet ring, lack of paper towels= appetite crushing (as if it already wasn't). Even if someone else paid for it, I felt like arguing with the manager for a refund. It would have been a great deal. Sigh... if only the food was actually fit for human consumption. Wishful thinking/too much to ask, perhaps? I should have known to avoid the place entirely since in spite of their Groupon promo wackiness, the place was virtually empty."}
{"text":"First time at this new place. I had the butter chicken pizza and found it only average, though a very generous serving! The service was lacking. A lot of reaching over the table by the servers because of the small space and crowded areas around the table. I'm not sure if it's normal- but there were a lot of kids there when we went. Not only being noisy, but also running around and bumping into our chairs and things. I will probably go back and give it one more shot- but it will definitely be during the day or a weekday and only if there are no kids. I love the fact that you can do your reservation online!"}
{"text":"Horrible food and inattentive service I had lunch with my husband on Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was not very busy, but service was very slow. The menu looked interesting, and since we really like Mexican food we opted for \"freshly made guacamole with avocado, jalapeno, tomato, onion & cilantro; served with warm corn tortilla chips & two salsas\" The guacamole was definitely not made in the restaurant, but it was one of those prepped and packaged ones, and unfortunately not even from the fresh package. The colour was brownish and it was quiet bland.  The tomato salsa was also not freshly made, very acidic and underwhelming. The tomatillo salsa was slightly better, but President choice has better one in the jar. The \"warm corn tortillas\" looked like leftovers from the bottom of Tostitos bag... miserable app all around and completely overpriced at $12 for stale guacamole and left over Tostitos chips. For our mains we had \"blackened\" burger and stir-fried beef \"popular hakka chinese dish\". The burger did not have any of the flavours that would qualify it to be called blackened. The patty was dry, overdone and tasteless, just ordinary burger badly executed. The \"hakka\" dish was inedible. The beef was supposed to be stir fried but instead, it had a really weird texture: somewhere between chewing gum and wet cardboard. The only spice that I could detect was soy sauce, and plenty of it, very, very salty... all other flavours normally associated with hakka dish were awol. No traces of cumin, coriander, or green chillies... there was one red dried chilly that was sadly floating in the over salted soy broth. The veggies were somewhere between raw and barely steamed, so nothing in the dish was really stir fried. After tasting the dish, I decided that I simply cannot eat it. To add insult to injury our server came over inquired about the dish, and after explaining that I really did not like it and cannot eat it, he proceeded it to billing us for it?!? What a waste of nice Saturday lunch! So with all other restaurants in the neighbourhood we definitely  will not be back to the Bazaar."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and were excited to try Bazaar Global as we've been fans of Amaya for years. My husbands birthday was coming up so I dropped in to get a gift certificate/card.  There was only one table occupied and yet when I finally got someone's attention, he seemed bothered and stated that they would be getting them in \"next week\".    Going back a couple of weeks later, again no pleasantries, no smiles, just dismissive.  I was told that I was incorrect and that no one would have said they're coming into the restaurant.  I was simply instructed to \"do it online\". No \"here's our website\", no explanation whatsoever.  When I mentioned I'd prefer to do it in the restaurant since I was already there, I was again met with \"do it online\"...but this time with a little exasperation.   With all the options (and some great ones) in our hood...and great ones with great service at that...how can you be a brand new resto with Amaya's experience and have service so bad that we would never even consider eating there anymore.  And with word-of-mouth being such a common way amongst  neighbors in Davisville Village to hear about where to dine and such it's too bad that this neighbor was turned off so much even before trying the food."}
{"text":"What an utter disappointment. The food was underwhelming, fries were soggy and service was lackluster. All of this for with the additional bonus of everything being overpriced. Don't expect this place to be around for much longer."}
{"text":"I went to Bazaar with a group of friends last night, and there were definitely some highs and lows in our experience.    Highs: + I was able to make a reservation for 6 people at 7:30 on a Saturday night just a few hours before 7:30.   + The main courses were all really great.  I had the being human salad, which was flavorful and very filling.  I'm not used to that with most vegetarian salads.  Friends ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza, and they raved about it.   + The mango mojito was really refreshing + The coconut ice cream was delicious  Lows: - As other reviewers have mentioned, the \"house made guacamole\" definitely didn't taste or look house made.  Very unimpressed.  The salsa was ok, but was mostly liquid, without a lot of chunky tomatoes or onions. Not great. - We were waiting for the sixth person in our group to arrive, but had ordered the chips and guac and salsa to snack on.  While we were waiting, the server just came over and said \"Ok, so are you ready to order mains yet?\"  I realize it probably sounded harsher than he intended, but it just felt like we were being rushed. - While the coconut ice cream was definitely delicious, it was also ridiculously expensive.  The ice cream by itself isn't on the menu as a dessert option, so shame on me for not asking the price, but when I asked for a scoop of coconut with a scoop of chocolate, I was charged $9.  Nearly 10 bucks for two scoops of ice cream is just insane to me.  I could have gotten a flourless chocolate torte with a scoop of ice cream for $6. - To follow up on the point above, the menu lists the price of the torte at $6, but when my friends got the bill, they were charged $8.  The server corrected the error, but just something to watch for.    Overall, the food was good, so I will go back for dinner.  However, I'll skip the guac and the overpriced ice cream next time around."}
{"text":"April is Taco Month at Bazaar Global Food Bar.... I love eating Tacos...  Especially here I could mix and match my $12 for 3 tacos..great if you want to try out different items!  Korean Bulgogi Green Chilli Chicken Chipotle Pulled Pork  All decently good and well seasoned with a punch.  The Sticky Toffee Pudding with Coconut Ice cream ($8) is a little disappointing though... As the overly sweetened cake has this really heavy texture, the ice cream though is really good and tropical!  Though having a kid's menu might have bring in more families, but at least when I was there, there's hardly any kids...  This used to be Lai Toh Heen's old location.. Bazaar Global Food Bar kept most of original set up but just change the decoration a little and the lighting is a lot dimmer than before too.  I think I need to be back again and try other items on the menu... but will probably skip the dessert."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is getting bad reviews ! I've been there three times and loved it every time !   The food is really good. Their calamari is AMAZING.  If you're looking for a place to go with your kids , this is the one ! The whole upstairs area is screaming for kids to go and have a good time , all those chalk walls will keep the kids happy.  Even if they are not serving in upstairs area , they still let the kids go and play till the food is ready ! that's awesome and you know it if you have kids !!  Never been there during weekends so have no idea if its busy or service is slow during weekends.  for us ,it works perfectly."}
