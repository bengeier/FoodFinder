{"text":"This place rocks! I love their outdoor area. The fireplaces make a romantic warm addition (except if your with your brother... which I was). There are several outdoor TV's and couches for comfortable relaxed dining. The day we were there, the new Panthers coach was there too. COOL! 

We drank some beer and ate wings... Buffalo style HOT HOT HOT! The food was good and the service was good. I really like this place."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but the place has changed so much! Soooo busy. The outside patio area has been upgraded lol. Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"I was going here when they first opened back when...

It sort of took the place of Nickeo's Rodeo and Deramus's (Providence Road Sundries) etc.. It catered to that \"St. Elmo's Fire\" type of crowd. For those that can identify, this is your sort of place. Only problem, if you remember Nickeo's, you'll probably have to be the one buying the drinks. 

As I recall, food was really good. The hand tossed pizza. Good pub food in general. details are unimportant when you're drinking stout.

Girls can be exceptional but a little snootie. Take a puppy with you. 

Lastly, this place is a clique joint. Great in the summer with the women hanging out, if you know what I mean, and perfect for chilly fall weather with the ballgames and the fire pit etc.. Just know that the folks here shop at South Park and live in Myers Park and if you ain't in the crowd you better come loaded or you'll be just another guy drooling at the bar."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here last night. It was my second time here, first time ordering food. Worst service I've ever received anywhere in my life. It was packed for the women's World Cup game, but the service was inexcusable. First, they were completely out of menus and my table wasn't handed a menu until close to 30 min after sitting down. Finally we ordered. After waiting over an hour for our food, my waitress brings out a sandwich I didn't order. When I tell her I didn't order what she brought me, she said \"our kitchen is really backed up, if you want me to fix the order it will take another hour.\" No apology. I was starving so I just ate the bland chicken sandwich I didn't order, but was still charged full price for. My friend's buffalo chicken dip came out as globs of cream cheese with shredded chicken on top, not mixed together. All of us looked at it like \"what is that?!\" Our waitress was MIA most of the time, and we could tell she was swamped but she never appeared to care about the customer and wasn't apologetic. When the game was over we tried to hand her our checks to pay but she said she would have to be right back and wouldn't take our money... 20 minutes later she finally showed up again to take our money. If it weren't for the game being on, I would have walked out after the first round of drinks. This place was so utterly terrible I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came craving pub food and left more than satisfied. We sat outside (in February--I love the South!) and there were heaters to keep us warm and TVs to keep us entertained. Our waiter was superb!  We could tell he was really trying to take care of all of his customers.  
The french fries were awesome--the size of McDonald's, but actually good. I had a junior Hickory burger, which was large and delicious!  My husband had a Buffalo chicken sandwich, which he said was good, but he is going to get a burger next time.  The fries heated up well in the oven the next day too.  
Everything was reasonably priced, and the draft beer selection was more than adequate.  We left happy and ready to return soon!"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful afternoon in February. 67Â°. We all want to enjoy a nice day out in the sun. Wanted to get a bite to eat however, no silverware. You're seated with your food to eat but are told there is no silverware to use. What does one do? Asked for plastic forks. Told they don't have any. We have to wait for the silverware to be cleaned.  Really, no clean silverware?"}
{"text":"Not impressed. The outdoor area is amazing but unfortunately the whole experience was ruined by the awful service. We sat at the larger community table in the center - we were on one end (two of us) and a party of 4 were on the other end. They had a server come to them, she took their order, looked straight at us and then walked away. We stopped another server and asked her about us getting a server and she kindly said \"I'm sorry, I'll take care of that for you\" then we never saw her again. So waited...and waited...and waited...server on the end cam back and ignored us again...so we waited again. 

My boyfriend got up and walked to the bar and complained about us being there for 15 minutes now and not being served. 10 minutes later, the server at the end of the table FINALLY acknowledged us - and she seemed annoyed. We ordered, and got our food quickly. We ordered the wings, chicken philly and chicken tenders. It was all delicious but it doesn't stand out from any other chicken tenders, wings or cheesesteak. 

Unless they get some systems in place for the set yourself concept, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place so I finally made it here and I was somewhat disappointed. I had the Selwyn Sliders with fries. The fries were great and plentiful but the sliders were not good. They brag about using the potato bun but it's too soft and squishy and falls apart.  Bacon was thick & you couldn't bite through the rind. Burger was bland. Menu wasn't all that large either. The good news is all the lounge seating outside with plenty of tv's. great place to meet up for drinks-just don't eat what I had."}
{"text":"Home of the weak drink. Ridiculous. Waste of money. Stick with beer or wine. You can't charge good money for a two ounce drink. I don't know how they keep repeat customers."}
{"text":"For a great neighborhood bar Selwyn is really as good as it gets. Fire pits, fire places, lounge type seating, lots of TV's for sporting events, great beer, a really cool big old tree in the middle of the out door area and awesome bar food.  The pizza is worth the trip alone. It does get crowded but that's just because it is a top notch Charlotte must see. Michael Jordan and many other celebs hang there because, well, it's just that good.  When the weather is great for sitting outside there are only a few others that compare."}
{"text":"Pros: good for drinks, and the pizza always looks good.

Cons: the 3 times we have come here to grab something to eat - poor service, very slow to get order, and food (other than pizza) - is very so-so. The reason we keep giving it another shot is because we live around the corner and try to keep hope alive. But we just can't do it anymore - so many other places to go to on Montford!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food but the owner needs to wake up and take a look at the outdoor area. It's filthy, worn, smelly, and really disgusting. How can you let a great place like this go to hell?"}
{"text":"Ugh....used to be my favorite place in Charlotte.  Unfortunately I think I have to part ways.  Not that it will matter.  Location, location, location.  Selwyn's will continue in spite of its poor ownership and management, which is a shame.  I went there Sunday to order a pizza to go and grab a beer, watch a game while I waited.  Went to the outside bar which was relatively empty and sat down.  Looked down the row and most people had empty drinks and the guy next to me was looking to cash out.  However, the bartender would have nothing to do with that.  He was engrossed in a deep conversation with a friend.  Both looking down at a cell phone and have extensive dialogue.  Never once did he look up during the 15 minutes I sat there.  Eventually, I got up to walk inside to get service.  As I walked by the bartender and his friend, I saw they were deeply engaged in a Clash of Clans discussion.  I now understand, that can be serious work if in the middle of a war.  The patrons can clearly wait this out.

When I went inside, the bartender inside was great.  Put my order in immediately, got my beer and was out the door 20-30 minutes later.  

Here is the problem.  Whoever manages the place, doesn't really manage it.  Some people are great and attentive, however the majority of the staff could not care less about the customers.  I've had several of these instances there.  Wait staff that decide to take a food break in the middle of service, leaving us to get up and get napkins, order drinks at the bar and then finally interrupt her eating with another server so that I could finally ask to cash out.  I've waited long periods of time while wait staff breeze by, never taking an order, mostly congregated somewhere talking to each other.

I love the place.  The food is good for the type of place it is.  However, somebody has to get people in place who care."}
{"text":"This place is a solid four.  The outdoor space is unbeatable.  They have mister-fans, tons of TVs, and cushy outdoor furniture.  The food is pretty standard bar food, but well made.  I had a veg pizza.  Drinks were slightly pricey, but the place seems relatively upscale and caters to it's Myers Park environs."}
{"text":"The food isn't great for the price. The wait staff will ignore you. And if you have an issue, don't count on the management to fix it as they're completely incompetent. This place survives on reputation but that can only last so long."}
{"text":"Hello, Frat-tastic, nice to meet you!

Some other reviews have mentioned it, but this bar is where all the dudes who wish they were still back in their fraternity house at college hang out.  That being said, it is one of the best spots to hangout in the spring/early summer, thanks to a great outdoor area.  It's like the PlayMobil of patios...seems like they are always adding something (an extra TV, comfy patio furniture, etc.) to their collection to make it more entertaining out there.  The indoor area is lousy though...very small, and the arrangement of tables is ill-advised, but I guess it's the best they could do when given a broom closet to work with.  If it starts to rain and everyone heads for the hills, you better like the person you are standing next to...ya'll are about to get REAL close.

The food here is above average for bar fare.  The servers here have always been friendly and attentive, but something seems to happen when an employee gets the opportunity to work behind the bar.  They turn into HUGE dicks for some reason....must be a \"rite-of-passage\" thing?

So, if you can put up with the Fratstars and cranky bartenders, slide the croakies on your Costas, pop the collar on that pastel Lacoste polo, pull up your seersucker pants and have yourself a good time at Selwyn pub!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were headed to Mellow Mushroom when we saw the sign for Selwyn Ave Pub - a big Shamrock, all Green and Irish Specials lured us in believing we were about to eat some Irish food.. We were so dead wrong, there wasn't a single irish related thing on the menu. The server was friendly and greeted us right away, My husband asked for coffee and the server told him \"There isn't any brewed, so.. anything else I can get you?\" ... So they HAVE coffee..but he didn't feel like making it? COOL. We should have left right then and there.. I guess the server kind of realized his error, and then tried to back pedal and excuse that the coffee takes \" a while \" to brew. My husband and I have been in the service industry before and I recognize laziness when I see it. If you don't have coffee brewed, you alert the customer of how much time it will take to brew - then let them decide if they still want it. 
( The food \" takes a while \" to cook also.. WE STILL WANT TO EAT, THOUGH! )  
But instead of making things complicated - My husband told him he would just take sweet tea instead and we just moved forward with trying to find out which meals we wanted. When we inquired about why there was no Irish food; the server told us it was because \"The regular customers would get sick of eating Irish food\" .... WHAAAAT? an Irish pub that doesn't serve anything Irish? This business is decorated in and advertising IRISH everything.. and it has a hanging sign that says IRISH SPECIALS. We were informed the irish specials are only during St. Patricks day.. So I guess that hanging sign is just left over from then = Example of More laziness and 2nd opportunity we should have just left.. but No.. we were running out of time, and we were hungry.. so we each ordered food the server recommended and it came out quick and hot. Thats cause it was all frozen and deep fried. Yaaay.. ( -_- ) I'm sure Selwyn Avenue Pub is a decent BAR... but don't go there hoping for anything special to EAT. Their outside seating looks inviting and the service was fast, just a little uneducated about their menu and less than eager to make you a pot of coffee."}
{"text":"I really should call this place, the every other month selwyn pub, as in a give it a shot about every other month, and every time it sucks so bad it takes me another 8 weeks before I give it another shot, let me also add the fact that I can see it from my living room, so it should be my go to place, but I continuously pay for an Uber to much better alternatives, including Moosehead, angry ales, roasting company, and lets go ahead and say everything in South Park"}
{"text":"Quick recap: if you're looking for a place to grab a beer outside, this is a nice place. If you're looking to have a good meal, this is not your place. Good beer, good wings, not so good everything else. Very much a neighborhood bar where people know each other. 

Been here a few times usually to drink outside. Only once inside bc it is a bit dark and confined. But the beer was fine, service was ok, wings were fine as well. 

Outside of the wings, I have yet to get anything that really hit the spot or made me want to order it again. This is classic bar food you eat when you are not sober. At that point it doesn't really matter. 

Not a bad place, but not a place I would recommend to people looking for a cool spot to eat and drink visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'd say this is about average for a pub.  With food that's good but not five star, and makes for a good place to hang out.  It's very relaxed and homey feeling, which I really enjoyed.  The burgers are very tasty and pretty good sized as well.  Since I've only been here during lunch time, I haven't tried the drink menu.  I'll have to go back some night and check it out.

The waitstaff is also a main attraction.  They are always looking out for their customers, and they are a riot if you're the type to joke around.  My favorite part of this place though, is the patio.  It's habitable even in the insane heat.  They keep fans with water misters going to keep the patio nice and cool."}
{"text":"So...another one of my \"been in Charlotte 3 years and I just tried this place?!\" moments (ie Penguin). Was out with a buddy last week and after some good beer tasting at Dockworkers, we were in the mood for pizza. Decided to head in the direction of the new Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn, but unfortunately (fortunately tuned) it was not open yet. Decided to go across the street to Selwyn Pub as we'd never been. 

OMG...place is awesome. Was busy for a Tuesday and the patio area is twice the size of the pub itself. Huge TVs, couches, fire pits, high tops, low tops, fireplaces, separate bar. Selwyn could be my new favorite pub in Charlotte, but I'll let a few more visits in the coming weeks decide that. 

Found ourselves a fire pit near the TV. Baseball game was on and checked out the menu. To my surprise and delight all the pizza was $12.99. That's right, za for $12.99. And that's their specialty pizza prices. You want A 10\" (I think that's the right side, then it's $7.99). You want an 18\" cheese pizza with all the toppings...yep...$12.99. Witnessed a few handfuls of customers picking up the pizza to-go, which means like usual I'm the last one to the party. 

I'll be back soon, especially with the nice fall weather in store!"}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks in upscale Myers Park / Selwyn Ave.  Very casual...great conversation pub.  Pizza blah.  Avoid ordering Coaches Pizza.  Sports on TVs.  Drink!  Cocktails and an array of bottled + draft beers."}
{"text":"Service here is slow (I was warned by friends before coming here.) My group ordered the chicken nachos to split while we enjoyed the patio ... every single one of us thought they were terrible. Parking at this place is impossible. I found out after the fact that there is a garage across the street (where Mellow Mushroom is) that you can park at. Cool environment and set up, but I don't think I would recommend this place to anyone unless they stepped up their food game."}
{"text":"Why have I waited so long to check this place out?  I had such an awesome time here this weekend.  The crowd is diverse which I liked and thank you so much for all the heaters and letting me enjoy the patio.  The patio is what really sells this place two fireplace lots of TVs and good drinks. The bartenders were very attentive even though the place was packed.  I can't wait to go back and grab some grub.  I think this is my new hangout."}
{"text":"Great place! Great drinks great food and I actually met my husband there. Perfect environment and the staff is always super accommodating. Definitely a charlotte staple."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Stumbled across this place as I was driving around with a co worker, as we were out of town. Great atmosphere, service, and most importantly a HUGE outdoor patio area with plenty of couches to chill with a large or small group with numerous tv's. Great place to watch a football game."}
{"text":"My major complaint of SP are the beers on tap. It's hard to compete with Mellow Mushroom's beer selection across the street but at least have our local breweries (other than OMB) available. I'm guessing the owners favorite beer is Goose Isoand since that's been on tap for years now. Switch it up guys and keep us surprised! Food is meh. Great neighborhood hang out though and everyone should give it a try. I have a friend that swears by their blackened chicken wings. I usually go for the sliders. And, avoid the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Alan U.  That is one of the nicest bartenders in CLT. A one star review is ridiculous  Selwyn gets crazy crowded. Has great pub food. And quite a scene. Has become our local BECAUSE of the bartender you call out. Enjoy social media, you're not very good at it. 

As for the review. This is an establishment in Myers  Park with an amazing location and outdoor bar. Generally solid food. And a great vibe."}
{"text":"Looking for a patio to watch your favorite team on tv? Selwyn Pub has a fantastic patio! It's spacious with lots of table and chair space and lots of tvs...the problem you may have is securing a spot. The inside is typical. When the weather is great, everyone is out! 

The service is good and they offer some good happy hour specials. The food looked good, but didn't try any. They don't have any \"girl beer\" (e.g., Smirnoff ice), but lots of regular light and dark beers and wines.

Parking can be tricky, but it's not a problem to park across the street or down a block and walk over."}
{"text":"the food here is good, and i can't complain about that.  but the service leaves something to be desired. there was something \"off\" about our drinks and the server just looked at us, we ordered water, the drinks stayed on the table the whole meal. they weren't taken off until we asked for the check. a runner brought our food and no one ever stopped back to see if we needed anything or if everything was ok. the place wasn't busy enough to justify the disinterested service. 

patio area is nice. the music was good. there are too many TV's but i guess you get that with a sports bar. the parking lot is a hot mess, tight to navigate and doesn't really have enough spots."}
{"text":"I really liked the setting and feel of Selwyn.  Think of an old grungy Irish bar with an awesome Patio.  During football this place gets packed and the people that come here are usually a fun group. As a bar this place is great to catch a beer, you don't have to dress up, and the patio is perfect.   It goes downhill though.

We first got our wings ( frozen) that were actually cooked very well.  There are a bunch of sauces to choose from so they were suprisingly very good.  I had the pizza and my friend had a sandwich.  He hated his sandwich, which is suprising because he will eat anything.  My pizza was just ok.  The service took forever and our appetizer and food came out at the same time ( a huge pet peeve of mine).  

The only reason I would come back is for drinking beer outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Service is AWEFUL due to management not scheduling enough servers. The ONLY reason I'm giving this 2 stars is for the pizza and servers who had to step up due to our original server's incompetence. There was a female bartender with glasses who was extremely rude. Might come back I when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"The only thing that kept me from giving a 5th star is the speed of service. Servers were nice but we were unable to find our server when we needed something. It's possible they were under staffed the day we were there. 

Otherwise we really love this place!!! Big fan of the sliders, you can get 6 for $15 and I normally just share them with my boyfriend. 

This place is oh so fabulous for the patio! Lots of TVs, big sofas and fire pits. I am pretty sure I haven't been inside the place unless I had to use the restroom. I go here when the weather is nice because I know it's gonna be an awesomely comfortable laid back setting.

Parking can be a big big problem! I truly don't have many suggestions for that issue but hopefully they will figure out a solution for it!"}
{"text":"I know this is a very popular local dive, but to me it's just an OK or \"Meh\" bar. Lots of younger \"kids\" in their 20's and 30's, which leaves me as the \"grandpa\" in the crowd! Food is decent, drinks are average, not a great beer list. So to me this is simply an average but popular local dive bar."}
{"text":"A good pub close to Myers Park Country Club. Packed on the weekends with a lot of fratty people, but still a good vibe."}
{"text":"So we come here quite often. Though we have never sat at the bar. Today we decided to sit at the bar because there were only 2 people there. The bartender basically dared us to order a drink and we had to beg for menus. My thought is that if we aren't the right kind of customers (old) let us know. We'll leave. Truth is, I can stay at home and be ignored."}
{"text":"I love Selwyn, but as I sit here thinking about it, I have no real good or specific reasons why.

It is a small place inside, nothing special. The outside patio/courtyard area is nice, but there are many similar places around town.

The crowd is like a fraternity/sorority reunion, with plenty of polo shirts and khakis filling out the seats.

For some reason though, ever since my friends and I started hanging out in south Charlotte more, Selwyn has always been one of, if not the first, option for the evening, especially on a weekday night.

It's simply a comfortable, casual place to grab a beer and sit on the patio. It's in the middle of a residential area, so it feels like a neighborhood pub.

I have always found parking to be somewhat of an issue however. 
The lot behind the place is small and hard to turn around in.

Overall though, Selwyn is an unassuming little beer joint for me, as I have never tasted the food."}
{"text":"Cool patio.  This bar has been around for a long time and is a staple of this part of town.  TVs everywhere.  Service can be a little slow when really busy.  The fire pits are great on cool nights."}
{"text":"The workers seem like they are constantly too busy to give anyone a second more of attention. The atmosphere is grim, even for a bar that has a college interest group."}
{"text":"Only eaten here one time, the food was fine. The service was fine. We were eating at the late lunch, early dinner time so when we arrived there weren't many people there. Then all of a sudden a group of people just started showing up. i couldn't figure out what they were doing. It looked like they were there to watch a game or something, but they took no real interest in a particular event on tv. Guess they were just there to hang out, which that patio space is perfect for. Maybe i was jealous. Their outdoor area is pretty amazing though. It could definitely be a place to hang out or meet up on a nice day. i think the next time i'm here, i'll have to give the pizza a try (i trust the Todd). Just seems hard to justify with Mellow Mushroom so close..."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Charlotte.

Hard to know where to start. 

Best outdoor seating. 

Wings and pizza are my go tos.

All the wing sauces are delicious but my personal favorites are the Cajun blackened and bee sting.

I love this bar."}
{"text":"Selwyn Pub, How I want to love you.  If only your servers felt the same way. 70% of the times we have dined here, we receive basic service. The other 30%...none whatsoever. Tonight, we left after 15 minutes of sitting alone and watching 5 servers breeze by.  So hungry....so alone...."}
{"text":"Super fratty and yuppie, but what can you expect with the location.  If polo shirts tucked into khaki shorts on drunk frat boys is your scene then this is this is the spot for you.  Not my favorite place.  Went to eat here one Sunday for lunch and the place was still filthy from the night before... Just reminds me of a frat house with a kitchen."}
{"text":"I love this place!  

We came on a random whim recently and sat on one of the comfy couches on the patio.  It was surface of the sun hot and the fans they had with mist blowing cooled you off just enough.

My husband had read somewhere that the pizza was good so we opted for that, I got a cider and he got a beer on special.  Both were relatively decently priced.

The pizza was the best I've had in Charlotte so far, we opted for the supreme, I think it was called something else but it had all the toppings of a supreme.  Pepperoni, Sausage, Green Pepper, Onion, etc.  The crust was chewy and crunchy at the same time and the cheese and sauce were awesome.  We went to a movie after and totally chowed a piece or two in the car before heading in to the theater!

Try this place out when you get a chance!"}
{"text":"Rating on environment alone, selwyn has everything I could ask for in a bar. Cool, dark,  pubby feel indoors with an awesome outdoor patio space with heaters in the winter and misters/fans in the summer. I'm obsessed with eating outdoors so the whole 4 seasons feel to it is right up my alley. There are also a ton of large tv screens and tables for large groups so it is a great place to go for a game.

The staff is always super friendly and they have a pretty decent draft list w a lot of local beers.

Per some other reviews, it does get a bit rowdy and the music could Definately be turned down a smidgen outdoors but I may just be a geezer.

Shy of 4 stars because the food leaves a bit to be desired. Not high expectations as it is a pub but there are certainly others in town with some more inventive, high quality options. I've had a couple of their wraps and all were fine, just a bit pricey at $11 for some meat wrapped up in a tortilla. No up charge to swap sides though so points there. 

All in all, lower your food expectations and you'll have a great time"}
{"text":"Selwyn Pub pizza is my favorite pizza in the world!  Well, I haven't been around the world, but if I crave pizza, theirs is it.  The perfect balance of cheese and sauce and crust, the crust is amazing because it's thin so you get that fantastic mouthful of every ingredient together!  What else can I say, I absolutely LOVE it!  Go get some pizza and beer at Selwyn Pub while you sit outside on one of their couches or chairs on the patio, and if it's chilly, find a fireside seat!  But if you're going there to watch a game on TV, you better get there early because the patio and even inside is always packed!"}
{"text":"Some folks I work with decided to grab a couple of brews together after work to celebrate my \"official transition\" to being full-time. We picked Selwyn Pub. This place was awesome. We showed up post 5 o'clock on a Friday. The place was hopping! 
We managed to snag the patio room on the far left side of the building; the area had a couple couches, two tvs, a coffee table and a comfortable level of seclusion from the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd around front. 

We ordered all kinds of food to share; chips and salsa, fried pickles, fajitas, hummos, and I ordered the chicken wings (go for the spicy honey coated ones....oh my oh my!). The food was surprisingly delish for \"Bar food\". The beer selection was not up to my standards, but when you frequent Brixx and Duckworths as much as I do, you undoubtedly produce a snobbish palate concerning your hops. Still, I was able to order Sweetwater 420 and therefore will reduce my complaining. 

If you enjoy being outdoors while you wind down, this pub has THE outside setup. During the cold months, they boost overhanging heaters, and have a fireplace as well. There is ample seating, even more standing area. The service was great too. waitress had close to 7 separate checks going on with our group, but wasn't short-tempered or snippy about anything. She seemed very laid-back and friendly.

All in all, it was a very good experience. My intentions are to return again soon!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor space, tons of big screens, friendly laid back staff. Fried pickles the best I've ever had! Great for watching sports. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have to agree, the outdoor patio is pretty spacious and sensational.  We came to see a singer-songwriter perform though, and could barely hear him over the crowd's conversations.  I'm not sure why they have live music here, he should be playing a place like The Evening Muse.  But the staff was very friendly and accommodating given the amount of people there.  We didn't wait long for any service or food.  I do have to say the fried pickles were extremely salty.  I'd go back again to chill on the patio and socialize, but not to hear live music."}
{"text":"My friends and I used to have a saying, \"Nothing good happens at Selwyn after midnight.\" Expect things to get blurry if you're here late. 

This is like a little slice of a Chapel Hill college bar in Charlotte. Come for the amazing outdoor patio (warning: it gets crowded on nice days/nights, Masters weekend and when the Tar Heels are playing). Drink light beer or bourbon. Wear your boat shoes. 

The food is so-so in my book, but that's really not why you're here. 

Pro tip: Michael Jordan and Gov. McCrory are both known to pop in to Selwyn for a drink. Act cool."}
{"text":"Although I find this place to be a little forgettable, it's partly because I've never had a bad experience there. A few friends of mine lived in the neighborhood for a while, so we would go there to start or finish our nights out, and sometimes we stuck around for the whole night.  

The crowd is a little older than some of the places more in the heart of town, which works well for me, as I'm turning into a grumpy granny when it comes to kids in bars. 

I have to agree with Brett M. It's a great bar. I don't know why. It just IS."}
{"text":"Somehow I always get the somewhat hot female bartender that could give 2 sh#ts about weather anyone has a drink or not. I mean you are a bartender. You're supposed to TEND THE BAR. Not slink over in the corner playing candy crush on your phone and smirk at thirsty patrons who are just trying to get a cold beer. Maybe you can figure out a way to make a living taking selfies and playing video games. That would be GREAT!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Selwyn Pub for a laid-back evening when you want to stay local.  I must admit - I must be getting old cause it is TOO LOUD inside at the bar for me.  The music is old school which i LOVEEEE but it is so loud I can't wait to leave.  

Outside is heaven tho - an all evening (or afternoon) cozy spot to chit chat with the locals  Not a super-young crowd, mostly business professionals and college grads.  Plenty of tables and couches and seating - just a super outdoor patio!

The bathrooms are TINY - just two stalls ladies and be careful you are not standing behind the door if someone comes in."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Possibly the only Charlotte patio that does not allow dogs. I guess it's because the patio is too full of pretentious frat boys or 60 yr old creepy men that drive Vipers but park in handicapped spots. And this is why the brewery scene is thriving and restaurants are going out of business."}
{"text":"Bee sting wings are amazing, my wife loooooved them and she never eats/likes wings. She already said we are going back this weekend for them. The pizza was really good as well. Our daughter got the cheeseburger sliders they were overdone. Tyler our waiter was awesome."}
{"text":"What do you get when you mix a college frat party with the Meyer's Park crowd?  You get a bunch of drunk guys with shaggy hair and blue blazers pounding beers and hitting on girls while the bartenders roll their eyes.  That was pretty much the crowd at Selwyn on Saturday night.

I've gotta give this place props for their outdoor space.  It's FANTASTIC.  Huge, with lots of heaters, so you will have no problem staying warm while sitting outside in the winter.  They also have a bunch of fire pits in case you have a group that just wants to hang out.  The bartenders just don't seem like they want to be there, so the service was a bit slow for a place that at the time I was getting another round, wasn't even packed.

So here are a few reasons you want to check this place out:
1. It's the end of the night and you're looking to meet someone.
2. It's early in the night and you want to go somewhere that isn't crowded yet.
3. You want to relive your college frat years with the guys.
4. You're trying to find a place that can comfortably seat 10-15 people in one place.
5. You like cold beer.
6. You love a good outdoor space."}
{"text":"Best BURGER and PIZZA in Charlotte!  The Pub Burger rocks and so does Doc's Specialty Pizza.  Give it a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite \"non uptown\" place to hang if the weather is nice.  Best patio in Charlotte IMO.  Food is well....bar food mostly but still great.  Big fan of the fried pickles :)

Patio is full of love seats, high pub tables, couches, etc.  There is also a fireplace (maybe two?) and TV's mounted all around the patio to view effortlessly.  

Honestly, the only reason I didn't slide it up to a 5 star review is because of the parking.  Ugh....never enough spots and you may end up having to park a block down, etc.  Not a big deal but an inconvenience none the less.  

NOTE: You can sometimes catch a local celebrity here also.  My latest sighting was Bill Deihl (lawyer for George Shin - for those that were here back in the day!) and also voted at one time one of Charlotte's 10 scariest people.  Guy seemed nice to me? Lol!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place to spend football Sundays!  I have quite a few friends in the Charlotte area who rave about Selwyn Avenue Pub.  I was fortunate enough to visit Selwyn last weekend and it lived up to the expectations.  We arrived early on Sunday morning to make sure we got a good table on the amazing patio they have outside.  The service was great and on point.  There are multiple TVs outside to watch all the games and the atmosphere is perfect.  The menu is your typical sports bar menu but the pizza is definitely the highlight of this pub.  I love thin and crispy pizza and Selwyn has some of the best I have ever had.  So tasty, crunchy, and delicious!  I loved the place so much I even bought a T-Shirt in my Panthers colors.  Next time you want to go watch some sports and enjoy some great pizza make Selwyn your choice!"}
{"text":"I do find myself still coming here time to time. The patio is beautiful but they still havent invested the money into the inside to update it. It's dark and dirty. The prices are similar to uptown but the service and atmosphere dont even come close to matching. Parking is always difficult. The food is really good for pub food."}
{"text":"I'm writing this from Mellow Mushroom because we walked here from Selwyn Pub. It's a Friday. 7:30pm. We were never served. Understaffed. (6/9/18) The server walked by us numerous times and he looked pissed. We were sitting outside. Waited 15 mins and left."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Great patio. Didn't venture inside, was too nice outside. Service was a little slow, but still solid. Considering how many were outside I wasn't surprised. Plenty of tv's outside, plus the outdoor bar was great. Food is typical bar food in title, but excellent in taste. I had chili cheese fries and the Cajun blackened Wings. Both excellent. If service had been a bit better I'd give 5 stars. But still a great place and I'll be headed back soon to enjoy another beautiful summer day."}
{"text":"I've been to Selwyn Pub about four times (to celebrate the end of exams usually). As a graduate student, this place is so convenient since it's minutes from Queens U. The outside seating area is really nice, especially when the weather is sunny. The food options are typical for a bar although I wish they had a few more vegetarian options, but there's a veggie pizza and a cheese quesadilla, both of which are fairly good. The staff, I have to say, are on their game; glasses are rarely empty, they have a great demeanor, friendly, fun. Just what you'd expect. 

I went earlier this evening as a matter of fact (May 25) and had this new guy. Can't remember his name, but he was three days on the job and did fantastic. I even had him suggest a drink for me, which he called a Colorado something. It was great!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, especially Adam!! Great pizza deal late night- love this place. Stay the hell away from Shane - he is a nut case and only attentive if you attempt to leave with a drink that he was too lazy to serve you in the first place."}
{"text":"Good food and great place to watch the games. Our server was very attentive and made good recommendations. Try the pizza,they don't skimp on the toppings!"}
{"text":"Though I'd constantly heard people talk about Selwyn Pub, I'd never been before the other night. And I'm not sure why I hadn't ventured over there. It's great. 

Though it was a little cold, Selwyn's main space is outdoors. They have a ton of heat-lamps and space heaters, so I guess the cold won't always be a problem, but it was definitely a little nippy as it got late. The inside of the bar is super small and super crowded, so this is definitely place to hit up when it's warmer out. 

Lots of people were watching the SEC football games and baseball playoffs. Everyone else was just really wasted. Fair enough. A wedding party seemed to crash the place as the night got late, and that was actually really enjoyable. 

Super friendly staff, which you don't often find at a rowdier, packed bar like this. So that was nice. Drinks were pretty standard. They serve food late, which was a nice touch obviously. I'll be back. A lot."}
{"text":"SEXIEST Bar! Such a shame..establishment has a great location, outside patio seating, apparently good food BUT managed POORLY!
2 female waitresses running around to handle the flow of customers as dirty dishes & cups pile over on every table and lazy entitled bartenders stand behind bar watching the waitress scramble to clean tables, take orders,deliver orders and DO NOTHING to assist. What happened to chivalry, and team comradely, team work? I personally went over to them and asked if there was a \"bus person\" to help the ladies and the bartender looked intoxicated himself that he got confrontational with ME! A paying patron that just wanted to sit at a clean table! They look down at women in general at this bar! The manager looked 12 and acted it because he was one of the dudes standing watching this whole interaction and watched the staff scramble and did NOTHING to help his team! Give your business to any other bar then this place !"}
{"text":"Went here a few months back with some buddies of mine. I like the food here a lot. Heard great things about the pizza so we had some of that and pretzels too. And of course beer.

The food was pleasing. The pub itself has a cool vibe. Some tvs and decent service. It's a little more laidback than some other bars around the way. 

The outdoor area looked awesome. It was a rainy day when we went, so I didn't get a chance to enjoy it, but I definitely want to hang out there. Plus I hear that Michael Jordan goes there sometimes, gotta run into mj!

The worst part about this place is the parking. Honestly if parking wAsnt such a hassle here I'd be here more often. But one of these days I'll be back. Cool place."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my favorite places to frequent. I try to come at least once or twice every other month. I'm a huge people watcher and just like the other reviews mentioned, it is full of some fratty dudes. Boat shoes, khakis, light blue button up shirts and shades around the neck is a normal look around here. I can't seem to avoid going to places that are fratty, but it's all good. They're just worried about beers and hanging with their \"bros\". Our waitress had a bad case of ADD, but she was still a sweetheart and she was fun. Tons of good looking/classy appearing ladies (if that's what you're into). The inside gets pretty crowded fast, so I try to get some seating somewhere in their awesome outside seating area. Tons of TVs to watch sporting events, food is pretty good as well. On Bobcats game nights, pizzas are half price (or at least they used to be). Overall, love the place and will continue to stop on in whenever I can"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here.  Definitely a great patio area, but the inside is nice, too - especially on a warm day.

Plenty of tv's and different levels of seating (couches, tables, bar seating, booths) and a great fire pit.

There is plenty of people-watching here.  It seems to be a place to try to meet people and there were definitely a couple of people that would actually move around to different seating areas to see what kind of attention they'd get.  Lot's of loafers with no socks and maxi-dresses with oversized sunglasses.

The staff makes sure that ID's are checked and that people aren't walking in already intoxicated.

All of the staff were extremely welcoming & attentive.

We only had the nacho's, but they were good with plenty of queso, chicken & yummy toppings."}
{"text":"People aren't very friendly here.  I went here when I first moved to town and I found the place chilly and lonely.

The place gets super crowded and you have to muscle your way to get a drink.  It has more of the feel of a college bar some nights and other nights it is a good old place to sit and drink with adults."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time with a few co-workers and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The service was prompt and courteous. The outdoor area to sit, drink, eat & mingle is nice and open. I would say to get there early because the place gets packed. I really loved the pretzel with queso and the veggie pizza. I wasn't a big fan of the pimento cheese dip but with beer it was okay. I wish there were more options for beer but what they have was not bad.  Also, the fries, pickles & nacho chips are fried in the same oil as the chicken tenders....in case anyone is vegetarian. Great place to hang out and relax!"}
{"text":"My first pub experience in Charlotte! It was a Friday night, and the place was definitely popping. Parking was very limited to how many people were occupying the place. Also, do NOT park in the back of the shopping mall next to the pub with the intention of walking over. If you're lucky, they'll stop you right there and tell you to move your car, but I saw a lot of unlucky cars with boots on 'em. We ended up parking a ways away down a street.
The bouncer was very nice, and all the staff were polite and prompt. Miller and Bud buckets were moderately priced, and the fried pickle chips, onion rings and fries were also very good. No complaints on the food or beer front. Comfortable seeing to watch the game, as well. The waitstaff came around with delicious beer samples, as well. All in all, a very relaxing and awesome night. Also, great outdoor atmosphere."}
{"text":"I think all of the other reviews have pretty much summed up Selwyn Pub.  They have a great outdoor area for the summer and plenty of fans to keep you cool.

I usually go here for drinks but I've had their pizza and nachos and both are very good.  The other night I had the privilege or trying the Tuna Medallion wrap and it was hands down AWESOME!  It is packed with tuna cooked just right (pink in the middle) and very flavorful.  For $8.99 with a side it can't be beat and is now my favorite item on the menu."}
{"text":"Perfect place for drinks after work or to watch a game. The staff was friendly, and it was a really fun environment. There were also lots of TVs so we could keep up with everything going on, both inside and outside. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly bar service! Food is great, too! Chris always has great conversation and a smile on his face! Can't recommend another neighborhood bar better."}
{"text":"While Selwyn Pub can certainly fill up with a boat load of popped collared, frat boys of yesteryear, it's still a great place to grab a drink or a bite to eat...especially if you're mindful of when you go! 

The Good: The patio is one of (if not) the best in Charlotte. Fire pits, plenty of TV's, comfy seats and tables a plenty. The pizza is super solid - really, surprisingly, delicious! The service has always been friendly and pretty prompt considering how busy they get. Additionally, the beer list is decent. 

The Meh: Because of the said popular patio and plethora of games shown, this place can get SO loud, SO fast. When the clock turns to 11 pm or so on the weekend evenings, the bar can get exorbitantly crowded and obnoxious. This is when I feel too old to be in such bar. Also be aware that some of the booths inside have absolutely zero padding...that does my arse no service when I'm sitting there for an hour or two. 

Overall, if you can score a seat on the patio and take in a relaxing drink with a few buds, Selwyn Pub is a fine place to do so."}
{"text":"If it's not the best... this is one of the best outside eating areas in Charlotte. Hands down!
Big outdoor couches, televisions, and nice sized bar make for a real fall outdoor football Sunday atmosphere. Oh, did I mention the food? Yeah check out this local favorite soon!"}
{"text":"Sad to say this... this place use to be amazing, however now it is just horrible.  Our food was handed out to somebody else so our app can out with a cold dinner at the same time, what was the point of ordering it. Do not let this full you.. the servers are constantly  touching there hair and faces and pulling there paints off of there skin. The pizza had no taste and the crust was burnt. How can you call it a chicken with barbecue  sauce pizza when you can not even taste the barbecue. Did I mention that the price was 15.99 what a big let down. I use to be a miller lite promo model and this place use to be so great.. What happen? Needles to say I would only go back.dor.the drink special."}
{"text":"Being from the Myers Park area, many a good memory has been had at the Selwyn Pub.

This is a great place to go if you are looking to grab a few drinks after work or after a Panther game.  

The drinks are reasonably priced and the service is excellent.  The smoke can become a bit of a problem due to it being a smaller bar, but that might just be nitpicking on my part.

One of the best things about Selwyn is that it attracts people of all ages from the surrounding area from the old money Myers Park residents who have been living in the area for years to the young professional crowd. There always seems to be that person at the bar regaling the rest of the bar with stories from the neighborhood past that everyone can relate to in some way or another.

I would recommend this bar to anyone who is looking to have a chill evening, drink good beers, converse with good people. In my opinion, it is the perfect alternative to going downtown.

P.S. Watch out for the older gentleman who comes in after Panther home games and acts as if he has an ownership stake in the place.  His stories border on outrageous and he constantly asks where \"Coach\" is.  I'm not sure if this is a reference to Cheers or not, but it is definitely a little strange.  He is harmless though and adds to the experience in a positive way."}
{"text":"Selwyn Pub enjoys business that other places could only dream of. No matter how poorly they treat their customers, they keep coming back because that's where \"everyone else\" goes. Well, tonight should be the last straw. The bartender outside couldn't have been more rude. Service was so slow I think I'm 30 now. I was 29 when I wanted a drink. 

The bartender outside blamed one of the customers when he spilled the drink he was serving. He yelled at him. When a server spills a drink and blames it on the customer? I don't think that happens in North Korea. Shame on Selwyn Pub and their owner/manager for allowing this type of egregious bs to continue. 

I guess the bartender outside became overwhelmed. Who knew three days before Christmas there might be some people who show up?? The bartender closed the bar 2 hours early. I hope the owner/manager is reading this. Do you know the business that man cost you? There had to be 200 people there and he shut down early. Well, screw him and screw this establishment. 

Do not patronize this place. You'd be better off buying a six pack and drinking it under an overpass on I-77."}
{"text":"I love coming here.  Plenty of screens to watch the games.  Outside heaters to enjoy the patio just about year round.  There is a good selection of beers and eats on the menu."}
{"text":"Not my thing, but sports pubs never are. 

Food selection is tiny and very un-vegetable-based. Aging frat boys draped everywhere in cornflower blue biz shirts. Somewhat decent beer selection, and of course, such a concentration of TVs that everyone's face is bathed in zombie-blue light.
 
Had some pretty dismal service both times I stopped in for a pint, so yeah, I think I'll leave this place to other, more interested parties."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, with good beer options and surprisingly tasty food.  Wings some of the best in Charlotte with a choice of crispy or saucy.  Can't go wrong with the blackened chicken wrap as a moderately healthy option with some sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for the Panther's play off game...side note: tough loss.  The patio was cool, bartenders were on top of it, food was decent and I had a good time.  Things were a little weird with our first server. She took our order and then immediately asked us to close out because she was leaving.  She also said she would send our new server over. Come to find out our new server wasn't there yet and she was still taking new tables.  Not sure what happened there.  Great place to gather with friends and enjoy a few cold ones."}
{"text":"Love this place,  even thou I haven't been there in a while. They have a great patio and pretty good service. Food is what you would expect from a pub, but I don't go there for the food, but the fabulous beverages."}
{"text":"I dont know if I can closer to five stars than this place.. The only reason I didnt give it the big high five was because I didnt try out the food, but I heard it was really good.  We went to drink and enjoy the weather.  The outside patio area is the best!!  So many chairs, so many TVs, so many fire pits.. This place is awesome.. I kid you not, my wife turned to me after being there for twenty minutes and said, \"I wouldnt mind dying here.\"  LOL.  

Beer plentiful.. They have bottles.. They have drafts.. They do not have specials and we could care less.  You have to give it a try.. We will be bringing our visiting friends here next time they come to town... Do it..  

Enjoy!

-Ian M."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good people.  Good Service 
Trendy Myers Park \"Go to \"spot.    If you know Charlotte you know the Selwyn Pub"}
{"text":"Went there with my girlfriend to watch football. Didn't mind it being fairly busy. When we did get an open seat we waited for over 15 minutes with the prior patrons food in front of us, after we informed the server. The server stated they would get our server, after they retuned to get our order (with the food in front of us still) we decided to move on. For a sports bar having only what appeared to be 2 servers and one food runner with a lot of uncleared plates and poor service. They do not have their act together and was not a great way to start the Saturday. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went to this place to watch a little football!!!  Had the sliders - definitely something to share, and the sweet potato fries!!!  Cold beer, good bar food, football and great service.  Sat outside, where they have many TV's.  Was able to watch the Patriots/Saints game as well as the Panthers/Bills side by side.  Looks like a lot of regulars frequent the place, as many knew each other.  This is a place I would hang out at on a regular basis - cool bar and staff."}
{"text":"Amazing patio! Just stopped in for a quick drink and some fried pickles... good specials on sunday and pickles were salty crunch good."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating.  The interior was definitely someone's residence at some point.  Plenty of TVs for games.  The heat lamps outside and bar outside was key.  Beer selection was average, and we didn't have any of the food.  Overall an excellent time at the selwyn pub"}
{"text":"After years I finally made it back to Selwyn this past week.  Nothing really has changed, great patio and \"comfy\" inside.  The bar is somewhat small inside, which makes it hard to get drinks.
I have had a few items  from the menu, and so far, everything is just okay.
Overall, it is a great place to meet friends for drinks, especially to watch sports, but expect a crowd and be prepared for slow service."}
{"text":"Great patio! Cold Beer! Best Pizza in town!!!"}
{"text":"Great little happy hour spot with a fair amount of outdoor seating.  I haven't eaten here so I can't tell you if the food is good, but the sights and sounds are worth checking out.

Be warned parking is a pain."}
{"text":"Very small indoor area, but great outdoor seating type of a restaurant! Thus, weather dependent. Tons of TVs to watch any sporting event. The food is delicious and service is quick!

The pizza is AMAZING!! Seriously, the best pizza I've had in a long time!!

Best Tip about this place - there is a huge private booth at the back."}
{"text":"Solid bar/restaurant. Great outdoor seating and tasty bar food. The service was very attentive, and plenty of TVs to watch whatever you are looking for."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte a long time, I've been to this place many times. I just don't get it. Terrible bartender, smoking at the outside bar... couldn't wait to get my check so I could leave. Worst experience I've ever had in Charlotte. Unbelievable that this place exists. So many better places to go in Charlotte .."}
{"text":"Do you like things that are awesome? Do you like chicken nachos? Do you like having the opportunity to see Michael Jordan in real life!? Then go to Selwyn Pub. 

The service is always good, the fried pickles are always crispy and salty and while the beer list could be a bit better, you can always find something you like. The owner is also very serious about making sure the kegs are always fresh; no nasty tap line beer here! 

Now, let me get down to business on these chicken nachos. I think of myself as somewhat of a Charlotte area chicken nacho connoisseur, and while many have disagreed with me, Selwyn Pub has the best chicken nachos in Charlotte. It might be the atmosphere, it might be the crowd, it might even be the sodium, but they are amazing. 

Now to the best part! On to this MJ sighting. After spending many-a-happy hour on the couches of Selwyn Pub, I finally had an MJ sighting. In my book, if it's good enough for Michael Jordan, it's good enough for me."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and it was during the summertime which is ideal since their outdoor space is great.

I like that it is a little \"off the beaten path\" but a lot of things on Selwyn have definitely changed in the past couple of years with construction and new businesses moving in.

Parking can be an issue if the place is packed, but they still make it work and it is parking is definitely worth the headache to get to this pub.

Unfortunately for me I got a whole beer poured on me by the waitress and I had my menu positioned perfectly on the table to funnel all the liquid goodness into my lap.  It was rather embarrassing since there was a bit of a crowd there that day, but it was the summer and I didn't really mind too much.  The waitress was super embarrassed and paid for my beer.  It's a fond memory that my friends don't let me forget about every time we think about going to Selwyn Pub."}
{"text":"A great outdoor bar to drink some cold beers with a group of friends.  The outdoor area is very impressive. There are wicker couches and chairs surrounding large tables with fire-pits in the middle.  Nice TV's are placed throughout the outside.  A key factor for this bar is the weather since it is mostly outdoors.  If it is chilly out, the fire-pits help and when it is hot out they have fans with misters, but I really try to only go here when it is very comfortable weather.

The food here is your average pub food for the most part.  I like their pizza the best and the burgers and wings are ok.  The service is hit or miss.  The servers seem to be overwhelmed at busy times but I usually get buckets of beers so I do not require much attention.  

Overall a great place to hang in Charlotte on a nice day or night."}
