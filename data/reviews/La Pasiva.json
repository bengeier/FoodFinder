{"text":"Ordered chivito canadiense al plato. Cames with green salad, potato salad, palm hearts, one egg sunny side up, steak, bacon, provolone cheese, ham, olives, red pepper, tomatoes, mushroom, mayo. A delight! Had the sandwich version before but this is much better!"}
{"text":"Very good food and very friendly.  The best Uruguayan food this side of the border.  I love the hot dogs and my wife loves the Chavito. The fries are yummy and next door there is a bakery which had very good Cakes and Pastries.  We enjoy this cozy Restaurant and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Very good service. Steak was a little dry, didn't like the potato salad. Empanadas were cold but good flavour."}
