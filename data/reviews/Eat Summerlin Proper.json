{"text":"My son and I had breakfast 3 weeks ago and it was wonderful.  I had the pancakes and he had the huervo M?   We were very pleased with our meals.   My granddaughter and daughter -in-laws took me there this a.m.(at my request) for my birthday.  Two of us had pancakes and they were horrible--tough-burnt and no flavor.  We did get a credit back for one pancake meal.  Explanation:  Newl Chef!   Will not refer my Sun City neighbors to you again"}
{"text":"I walked up to Eat in the Village Center Shopping area for my second visit with a Sunday newspaper and my Starbucks latte in hand and the hostess barred my entry pointing to a sign on the window \"no outside food & drink\". Having lived in Las Vegas for 40 years and Summerlin for 10 years I have never had a problem bringing in a Starbucks coffee. She suggested I finnish it outside before coming in and after some discussion I agreed to not drink it until I had finished my breakfast and left. She stated this was required by the health department as something from outside that made someone sick they would be liable for. Why management would not want to welcome and attract customers from an anchor store like Starbucks in the same shopping center is beyond me? The restaurant has a lot of windows with nice lighting, the servers are very pleasant, the food is healthy (therefore no hashbrowns available), my only other complaint is the fast beat, moderately loud rock music they play which I find somewhat abrasive & counterproductive to a relaxed sunday morning breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious! Today was our first visit and we will be back often. So happy to have such a great local restaurant in our neighborhood, within walking distance even! Service was wonderful and pretty fast for a full house.  The biscuits, chicken fried steak, pancakes and grits were all fantastic. Next time we'll control ourselves and won't over order!"}
{"text":"I looked forward to trying this new restaurant in Summerlin. I was very disappointed--they have a lot of work to do! The service was fair, I never got a re-fill on my drink and I think the waiter checked on me once. The ceaser salad was tasty, but the portion size at the price was very small."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about here. Good service and excellent food. It was my first time dining with them. My mother ordered the truffled egg sandwich and said it was delicious. I ordered the rueben, I'm a lover of the rueben and can say I know my stuff when it comes to that sandwich. First off the bread was excellent, and there was a good ratio of kraut to meat. The thousand island/russian dressing  was good, nothing crazy. All around a good sandwich with no complaints. For dessert we had cinnamon bisquits with berry compote, mix between strawberry, blackberry and blueberry. The bisquits were awesome, not dry but were moist and flakey, the compote was very tasty, not overly sweet. This is a great place and will be a repeat customer in the near future."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits were amazing , the service was amazing , and Natalie is awesome !!! I'll be eating there a lot :-)"}
{"text":"Went for Breakfast to Eat with family. We went there on a Friday morning and it wasn't crowded, so we received fast and gracious service. Plus, we really enjoyed the food!  Dishes we ordered included Shrimp and Grits, Huevos Motulenos, Corned Beef Hash, and Truffled Egg Sandwich. Everything was served piping hot.  Presentation was beautiful.  Taste was outstanding.  I had the Huevos Motulenos and found it to be an interesting twist on Huevos Rancheros, I especially like the use of two different sauces (red & green) and the addition of bananas and sweet peas.  This is probably now my most favorite breakfast restaurant in town."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have an extensive menu selection, but the food we've tried have been delicious! Not only were we served good food, the service we got from Dominick was exceptional as well! Our experience have been so positive that we ate here two weekends in a row! We now have a new favorite breakfast place in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I've been going to Eat. downtown for a good year now and couldn't believe we were getting another location in summerlin, 5 minutes from our house! I popped in this week just to check them out and see if it lives up to the original, and YEAH IT DOES. I had to get the deviled eggs and they were perfect, as you'd expect, and I tried the roast beef sandwich for the first time and it was amazing-it came with a delicious blue cheese sauce and sautéed mushrooms, and I'd get it again. My husband was jealous he wasn't with me so we'll be coming in this weekend and I'm sure we'll become regulars real quick. Thanks for expanding out here and saving us a trip downtown every time we want a great brunch!"}
{"text":"Great food! Had the truffle egg sandwich and I was awesome. Saw the BLT and it looked amazing, I will be having that next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Parking was easy, service was good, the truffled breakfast sandwich was outstanding ... however as a breakfast place they don't have breakfast tea?!?  Only earl grey, green, or some frilly organic stuff. As a tea drinker only, that's like not having regular coffee ...  I was disappointed to be relegated to water"}
{"text":"Well I decided to try this new breakfast spot and new EAT location when I see the good atmosphere in the kitchen and the new Executive Sous Chef  John Castro WOW  I know this kid  since he worked in the restaurant mercadito at the Red Rock hotel & casino is a Rockstar the Food is excellent good flavors beautiful presentation have a good success chef keep going up good luck to you and the owner"}
{"text":"The food is good, but they only told us they wouldn't split the check once we'd already finished eating. Not good for lunches with friends who want to pay their own way."}
{"text":"New to Summerlin. Facility is clean, and staff very professional.  Breakfast came out  quickly and hot.  Good quality.  Had their version of Juevos Rancheros.   Great flavor.  Plantains are a nice addition.  Also, grits are G-free.  Well done.  Will return."}
{"text":"I have been to Eat. at the Downtown location, and fell in love with the Shrimp & Grits breakfast. I couldn't wait until Eat. opened up at this location in Summerlin. I took my mom on Saturday morning, and she fell in love with it, too! From the delicious coffee, to the cinnamon biscuits, and of course, the Shrimp & Grits, it was all heavenly! Love that this location is closer to me than the downtown location, and I love the new place. It is very roomy, and lots of comfortable seating. Dominic was our waiter, and we just adored him! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Both of her Eat restaurants are AMAZING! As well as Chow! I love the owners style and creativity put into the place and good. Perfect delicious food every time. Just what we needed in this corner of the center! This place will stick for a longgggggg time :)"}
{"text":"Loved the ambient and decorations but Horrible service by our waitress ! And the food was horrible ! We were disappointed"}
{"text":"Cool vibe!  70s rock music in the background. Staff is great. Food is awesome!  You've got to try the deviled eggs!  Who knew deep fried breaded eggs could taste so good!?  I also had the chilaquiles. Nachos for breakfast....spicy and sweet with the savory sausage.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We are always searching for a new and exceptional breakfast eatery in town. And we were delighted to have found a delicious brunch restaurant right here in Summerlin!   Our first time for brunch today, and we LOVED the Cinnamon biscuit w/ fruit compote, for the delicate sweetness, flakey and buttery biscuit. We also tried the Huevos Motulenos, and the Corn Beef Hash, which were both fresh and tasty! The staff were super friendly and sincere as well!"}
{"text":"I very pleasant surprise. Food is great, service is very friendly and overall atmosphere fun and inviting. Best corned beef hash I've had in a long time.Will definitely come back and recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Oh man! Had some of the special cinnamon bread pudding and shrimp and grits and this place is right on. Great food and service, we'll be back for sure! My only suggestion for improving is maybe to add a baby changer so we don't have to go back to the car in the heat. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Happy they opened a location in Summerlin! Friendly staff and delicious food. Love the Truffle Egg Sandwich and Cinnamon Biscuits. Will definitely be having breakfast more often."}
{"text":"Ate here today and had great service and food! Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because they have no kids menu or option for kids and the regular portion was just way to big. I had the blt and tomato soup everything was very fresh and the bread is amazing my son has the grilled cheese also really good and my brother had the enchilada soup it was amazing and if I went back I would order a full bowl of that!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give them 2 stars is for the nice decor/ambiance and really nice staff. The food? Read the \"inspirational\" message they put on the wall above the kitchen. Maybe it should be displayed to the kitchen staff and chef, rather than to the diners. The food was terrible. We've eaten at their downtown location several times and it's much better! Ordered the eggs benedict and found them to be a strange concoction with chewy bread, giant roasted tomato slice which took over all flavors, a thin slice of weird chewy and dry chicken breast replacing the traditional Canadian Bacon, sautéed spinach that was just \"OK\" and a very sour hollandaise. I could tell they make it in house, which is nice, but there was way too much lemon in it. Made the whole dish sour. My eggs were overcooked, but staff was nice enough to quickly bring me 2 new eggs cooked the right way.  The roasted potatoes they throw on every dish were such a \"great success\" that all of us left them untouched on our plates. sad. The grilled cheese sandwich was so greasy it was inedible. The cheap cheddar cheese they use inside - shameful. My daughter ate barely half of that sandwich before putting it down and saying she's nauseous and feels like she's going to throw up. The tomato soup that came with it, tasted more like something out of a can, with some pieces of bad mozzarella in it, which simply turned into rubber from the heat of the soup. The Devilled eggs are breaded and fried, which I guess is another one of the chef's attempts at being \"clever\", but it only served to make the dish greasy and heavy. The flavor of the filling was very bland, and the only thing giving it some flavor were the Sriracha sauce and Bacon they sprinkle on top. The egg itself was completely lost in this composition. The only thing they managed to get right is 2 sunny side up eggs and 2 strips of bacon that were cooked right, but then they also came with terrible potatoes and 2 pieces of burnt toast, so no, they couldn't even get a single dish out of that kitchen without terrible flaws.  Generally, someone should tell the chef that \"more\" is not always better. Overcomplicating and throwing everything but the kitchen sink into eggs benedict, doesn't improve on the traditional recipe!  with tax and tip we paid $104 for a 4 people breakfast that left us all a bit queasy.  Again, the place is very nicely designed, and the staff was absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, that's not enough to make up for the really bad and very overpriced food. $12 for 2 sunny side up eggs and 2 strips of bacon, with some really bad potatoes and a burnt toast, is too much. I can get better than that at Denny's for less than half the price and they serve better potatoes and won't burn your toast!  Make kitchen staff and chef read and memorize that inspirational message you plastered all over your wall for all diners to see. They need it more than the customers do."}
{"text":"Content with the high reviews and excited to try something new that is conveniently a short drive from our home.   The host gave a warm welcome - we needed a table for 4, 3 adults one child - although my niece was coming from the opposite side of town, we were going to get stared to get some food in my two year old. Unfortunately, we needed to wait for her to arrive in order to be seated.. the restaurant wasn't full; in fact the other back half of the restaurant was empty and several tables were open in the front section of the restaurant. I would understand if the restaurant was packed and/or if we were a larger party, but regardless if she was to arrive or not - we would still need a four top table. Thankfully the weather was nice out so we waited outside until then.   We promptly ordered some starters and then entrees for each of us. We had to ask twice for a paper cup for the apple juice we order for my daughter. Which is fine, sometimes people forget. No biggie. Although we also had to ask for creams for our coffee three times as well.. the third time was with the closet person around, Our host as we already gotten our entrees and still haven't touched our coffee.   The timing on the food coming out was great.  Cinnamon Biscuits - It's true, this is a wonderful dish. I really appreciated the fresh fruit.  Fried Deviled eggs - I really wanted to like this, unfortunately all of us didn't even bother to look up at each other to even acknowledge the dish.   Truffled egg sandwich - Lacks that \"wow\" factor. Wasn't that impressive for the cost for a breakfast sandwich and the side of tomato salad was too strong.   Grilled Cheese Sandwich - Best entree out of the three we ordered, as agreed amongst the table. The tomato soup was tasty and I dig the thick cut bread.   Chicken Pesto - My niece took one bite out of it and I took the rest home as I didn't want it to go to waste. I wasn't very hungry after the grilled cheese I had.   All three sandwiches were heavy/greasy. I'm sure the concept of the menu is great but the execution wasn't there.  On top of everything else, we never saw our server after she took our order. The host and the busser actually took more care of us, even checked on us to see how our food was. There was a large party she was taking care of at some point, which explained her absence in the beginning, but their orders were put well before we were even remotely done with our entrees.   I'd like to think sometimes servers are just having an off day. Since I work in the restaurant industry, I'll make excuses up for them to give them benefit of the doubt. Taking into consideration the flow of the restaurant, etc. We came in after the breakfast rush and before the lunch rush. I will definitely come back in for a second try with the service and as an excuse for those biscuits, in fact I'm craving for them right now."}
{"text":"Always good to find a cool place to eat breakfast that serves unique plates. We had the golden brown pancakes with chicken apple sausage...pancakes had the perfect crust.   The other plate we had was the chilaquiles breakfast...think breakfast nacho but tastier.   Try this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had actually been to the original location downtown not realizing they had made one in Summerlin! Once we saw the menu, we were reminded that we have ate here before & it is soo delicious. Im really glad they built one closer to our side of town because we enjoyed the food there but never returned because of the 30 min drive. Walking up we noticed there was a lot of people dinning which is a great sign because i believe the last establishment did not have very many people who went there. I think because many ppl are familiar with their downtown location. The Location is kind of hidden in a shopping plaza by the Trails community but saves a drive going all the way downtown. Food is great, service is quick. I hope they stay permanently in Summerlin. Pay them a visit!"}
{"text":"1st thing, hold off on the side order of short stacks. Get the cinnamon biscuits to start everything else builds off of it. Coupled with quick, friendly and professional staff, everything stacks up 5 stars high"}
{"text":"I love EAT! I was ecstatic that they added a second location near me! They have such a great breakfast selection for any mood food. I keep coming back for the same dish... because I absolutely can't get enough! The truffle breakfast sandwich, the sandwiches of sandwiches. It is the perfect combination of a brunch sandwich. I always recommend this meal because it pairs so well with their crispy house potatoes. I recently came with friends and the waiter recommended the favorite deviled eggs, it was definitely different, it was a fried deviled egg, I wish it had more flavor to it that would make it more enjoyable. I will be coming back for my favorite dish, this place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Saw the EAT banner announcing it's opening on the top of one of my favorite Starbucks on Village Center Drive.  Took my best friend in for her birthday and loved the decor, staff, location and of course great food.  Had the egg sandwich which was awesome. Perfectly cooked eggs with mushrooms, chives, etc. Homestyle potatoes are perfect. Don't eat bacon, but my friend said it was the best. Took my hubby back Saturday as he loves Reuben sandwiches and they had one on the menu.  However on Saturday & Sunday they serve brunch so it wasn't offered. He opted for the chicken fried steak. Big portion and he declared one of the best he'd had. I stuck to the egg sandwich, will try the Veggie burger next visit. One of my pet peeves about restaurants is that there are lots of servers during busy periods, but no one around to help when you need them. NOT the case here. When our server wasn't around there was always someone walking by to re-fill iced tea, water and get you whatever you need.  LOVE THAT, good training.  Alas, we are leaving for the summer heading to cooler climates, but will definitely be back this fall."}
{"text":"Just as amazing as the downtown location.  Truffle sandwich is my go to!  Always great service. Love the bar table so I never feel guilty taking a whole table when going alone. Clientele often strikes up conversation with others. Always makes for a great time. If you like honey get some tea because their honey is amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place! The chicken sandwich and homemade chips are amazing! So glad they came up to Summerlin!"}
{"text":"First visit on a Sunday.  Restaurant somewhat busy, but not full.  Menu is limited, but seems like they switch things up frequently.  Seated quickly and drink order taken, by someone other than my server, and coffe was promptly delivered.  This is where the good service ended.  Server inattentive and was more concerned with taking care of his regular customers.  Coffee went unfilled until I was almost done eating and when refilled it was by a busser.  Check was quickly delivered by my server after food was delivered, but paying the check when I was finished took a long time since the server was oblivious to my table (though I was seated between two groups of his regulars).    Seems like a good server with the tables he cared about, but after this experience I won't go out of my way to dine here again.  Food was good but not $16 good for a chicken fried steak, eggs, potatoes, and jamless toast.  Btw check for 1 person $20 ($16 chicken fried steak $3 coffee + tax)."}
{"text":"Super cool eatery in Summerlin!  Met my nephew here for lunch before heading back to LA. Very nice menu of assorted goodies and you can order a late breakfast if you want! That made my wife very happy as she loves her breakfast. I had the grilled cheese & tomato soup-WOW! The toast was super-thick and was perfect for dipping in that rich soup. Probably one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I ever had.   The restaurant is very hip and clean. Servers are totally on point here and they are very professional. I really appreciate the patience and service they provided as we waited for the rest of our group. Can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out for brunch. I've heard of their other location in downtown Las Vegas, but didn't know they had a location in Summerlin. The restaurant itself is situated in a strip mall, so parking is pretty easy  convenient. The decor had a cool, casual hipster vibe to it and service was friendly.   We started our meal with the cinnamon biscuits and deviled eggs. The biscuits were served with strawberry compote and fresh berries. I like that it wasn't overly sweet. The deviled eggs were very tasty, probably because it was partially deep fried. Then we ordered the shrimp and grits and the chilaquiles. The shrimp and grits were flavorful and had a good balance of flavors (also no substitutions for the grits), and came with bacon, over easy eggs, and pico de gallo. The chilaquiles was also very flavorful and I liked the different textures the dish provided.   Overall the food was very good and its a nice brunch spot away from the busy downtown area or the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Went to \"Eat\"with two friends for lunch today. I was extremely pleased with their customer service. The food was awesome. The customer service earned five stars because we ordered the deviled try, not knowing that they had bacon on them. When the deviled eggs came out and we seen that there was bacon ,I politely said it's OK and I would just wait for my food. Our server was nice enough to make me one deviled egg with no bacon. I've never had that type of service, usually ppl frown at me if i mention that I do not eat pork. I will for sure be back. Thank you."}
{"text":"I had the Huevos Moltenos and they were absolutely fantastic! The sautéed banana gave it an extra twist. My husband had a dish with Chicken, gravy and eggs and he love it! This place is really good!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but the menu is very limited. They also do not let you modify any of the menu items, which can be difficult for someone with food allergies or restrictions."}
{"text":"We have loved Eat since visiting the downtown location and are thrilled it's open in Summerlin!  Highly recommend, great food.  I recommend the chilaquiles and the pancakes and they have fantastic coffee."}
{"text":"This Sunday a couple friends and I met up for brunch. Our server was great and very helpful. I opted for the truffle egg sandwich and even though I really don't care for truffle this was a great sandwich. Simple and exactly what I wanted. My friends both got the chicken fried steak and said it was great as well. I will hopefully go back soon and will recommend Eat to my friends."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place as much as I love their downtown location. After hyping up Eat to my boyfriend, we decided to check out their breakfast. We ordered coffee and the cinnamon biscuits to start. The server seemed a little preoccupied as he was the only one on the floor for the later shift and forgot what our entrees were as well as kept forgetting to bring creamer for the coffee. By the time we had the creamer, the coffee was already cold and the entrees were out. The boyfriend's Shrimp and Grits had great flavor, but my truffled egg sandwich was pretty bland. I ended up only eating the bacon off and leaving the rest.  I really wanted to love this place since it's so close, but between service and the so-so food, they're not worth the short drive for me."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and wish it had been a better experience. The menu is super limited and they don't allow substitutions. Had the arugula salad and that's what I got-- a whole plate of arugula. My husband didn't care for his sandwich but ate it anyway. I sent mine back as it was not good at all. Our server was very rude. Couldn't get out of there fast enough. The kicker was that they wouldn't remove my gross salad from the bill."}
{"text":"Had the Cinnamon Biscuits & Chilaquiles. I enjoyed my meal. Service was great, ambience cute and the quality of the food was good. I'm happy to have another restaurant option in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the staff was really friendly and very attentive. The pancakes are AWESOME! Also had the huevos motulenos and those were great just a bit spicey. Overall I liked this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had brunch today with some friends at Eat. I enjoyed myself, the company, and most definitely the food.  I ordered the chicken sandwich (might be named something else) it had mozz cheese melted on it! A nice twist on a grilled cheese sandwich! Also had a tomato soup on the side! Both were delicious! Even the left overs I took home. I also tried the deviled eggs they are famous for from what I heard and though my company didnt enjoy them due to food preferences I loved them! Such creativity with a basic food item!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Yippee!  EAT has arrived in my neighborhood.  So happy that their eclectic menu is available close by.  Chef Natalie has brought all that was great from her first location and revitalized the space.  Great for breakfast and lunch...."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled to have a great new fresh spot for breakfast in this beautiful location. The orage juice is fresh squeezed.The menu is simple yet innovative. This is quickly growing in to my favorite brunch place on the weekends. The owner is very nice and physically present during this grand opening, giving the environment a hands-on family-friendly feel. I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Heard so much about the downtown spot I was watching for the Summerlin opening and went on opening day. Wonderful, excellent, attentive service. The background music was way too loud but it was eventually turned down or off (without any request from me). The tomato soup was good. The shrimp po boy was somewhat zippy and I liked it, but I thought it could have used more or bigger pieces of shrimp. I'm not sure there was enough shrimp to be at all noticeable on the sandwich--the sandwich bread was very good. I got a side of chive potatoes (I doubt the chives added anything but color) but the potatoes, prepared with onions, were outstanding and were the hit of the meal for me. I'd be hard pressed not to order them every time I visit no matter what else I was getting."}
{"text":"We always wanted to try the original downtown location so we're happy to see they opened a location near our neighborhood!  Came here for lunch and we enjoyed the food and service.  We split an order of their twist on deviled eggs - uniquely tasty.  My wife had the roast beef sandwich and I had the corned beef hash as I always need to try every restaurant's take on it.  It was delicious but I really loved my wife's sandwich - I actually thought about stealing it from her but quickly checked myself!  And the potato salad that came with it was delicious as well - vinegary German-style that went well with the sando.    Can't wait to go back and order that RB sandwich for myself!  Every item on the concise, focused menu looks interesting so it might be tough to choose.  We'll see!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place.  We were talking amongst my party about plans we had for my sons birthday the next day. The server immediately says ,\"Oh we have cinnamon biscuits to celebrate birthdays!\"  He brought it out but at the end of our meal he charged us $8 for it. I ask the manager why we were charged because we didn't even order it. We had never been there before and we were told they were birthday biscuits. She was snotty and said we don't give anything for birthdays. So I felt that was just a way for them to up our bill. We ordered four meals total and our ticket was $81. I thought it was way overpriced for what you got. The group I was with and I agreed we would probably never go back again."}
{"text":"Ordered grilled cheese and tomato soup. The soup came out like warm. No on bothered to ask."}
{"text":"Simple. YUMMY. Casual.   This is my second time eating here and it is such a delight! The staff is so so so friendly and attentive; they know the menu and give great recommendations.   I love the 2 egg breakfast with sourdough toast! The toast is sooo fluffy, I have never had such delicious piece toast in my life. The chive potatoes are also such a tasty bite."}
{"text":"just ate here at eat in summerlin.wife had shrimp po boy and I the ruben sandwich. we split em up.both were very good. will be back need to try some of the breakfasts offered."}
{"text":"A solid place for a weekend brunch. The ambience is fantastic- rustic industrial. The service is super professional and the servers are knowledgeable about the ingredients and make excellent recommendations. I enjoyed it but wanted to love it the way I have loved CHOW.  I'm hoping to fall for this spot, so I will come back."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed eating here! My boyfriend and I both ordered chicken fried steak and it was tough! I was chewing on a piece of steak for so long. It was also under seasoned as were the potatoes! Everything looked amazing but it was all very underwhelming unfortunately."}
{"text":"Was heading to another eatery for breakfast but was reminded of this \"new\" spot. Heard could be a long wait, but arrived a little after 11:00 am to a \"ready to seat two\" availability. Husband was not eager at first for the food options, basic omelette kinda guy, has a comfort zone, but I offered that he could always eat at the other spots, to try something new. He relented. Ordered the Truffle Egg Sandwich, he had the BLT with a side of potato salad. Service was primo, everyone worked the room which is refreshing to see. Food arrived and presentation was photo perfect. I immediately had to sample my husband's potato salad because honestly, my mother makes the best in the world. BUT.....OMGosh......this was amazing. Fresh and flavorful. Not heavy with mayo as is with many others. My sandwich was delicious and the truffles added a zest to the eggs. I did jazz mine up a bit with some hot sauce and it seemed to accentuate perfectly the flavors of the bacon, egg and truffles. The side of potatoes and onions was a perfect compliment.   I found that this place is unique in that it has a very bistro feel, with earthy, wholesome, organically flavored cuisine. For the first time since I can remember I did not immediately feel tired post the plenty of potatoes served. I wondered if because they were not ladled with heavy grease and artery clogging substances as other breakfast foods. It is amazing when food is fresh and prepared as this is, how much better you feel AFTER you eat!!!!   The staff was attentive, responsive, and kind. Our server offered the perfect suggestion when as I was ordering the Truffle Egg Sandwich she offered \"with avocado\", I hesitated, wondering, should I or shouldn't I? Her offer, \"either way you will not be disappointed by it\". SOLD, no avocado. She was right. It was delicious absent avocado.    I understand \"alcohol\" is in the works for here. The only item missing was some Champagne to sip with the fresh yummy ingredients offered by this most delightful eatery, Eat.   We will return, with family and I will share my excitement for this fresh, new spot for our breakfast and lunch options in Summerlin. My husband, the one who sort of needed more convincing to try, is a \"thumbs up\", fan now. He was not disappointed. It reminded me of a large, happy home with a very big family style kitchen where sounds of laughter, clanking dishes, flavorful smells and favorite foods are being served. It will do just fine here in Summerlin. Wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to go to new restaurants. My husband and had breakfast . Coffee was really good. Biscuits and berries was really good perfect size for a breakfast appetizer. Then my husband had chicken fried steak and eggs which he said was good I had the truffle and egg sandwich which I was very disappointed I could not taste any truffles. Over all services was ok food not bad. But I don't think I will be go back."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend and boy it did not disappoint! Started with their delicious biscuit with fruit on top. I ordered the corn beef with two poached eggs and couldn't finish it because the portions were big. Everything was delicious. Their staff was nice and welcoming and made sure we had excellent service. Will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Went once place has a great feel and the food was awesome cant wait to go back. I recommend the veggie sandwich."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in Eat today, I brought my girlfriend for the first time and of course it was the worst time I've been here. I've come a handful of times and never had a problem but today put a bad taste in my mouth, enough for me to not want to come back. I ordered the country fried steak and it was so tough that not even a steak knife could get through it. When I finally managed to cut a piece it took about 2 minutes just to chew that piece because of the toughness of it. I decided to take a break from eating the steak and have a bite of my toast to only find a hair on top of it. I addressed it the server and she said she would address it with the manager. It was never brought back to our attention nor were there any accommodations made for the mistake. Still charged us full price and didn't bother to make any of it right. To top everything off we were shorted our change by almost $15, I guess attention to detail is not a priority on the list here.  Eat makes me never want to eat here again because of this experience."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and lunch place. Have been a big fan of the restaurant downtown and have patiently waited for her to open in Summerlin. This restaurant is just as amazing and the food is fantastic. Great setting and unique tasty dishes. Looking forward to having breakfast at on the patio. This is is the epitome of a small business doing it right. Grind before you shine!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, located where Jacques used to be. Decor is super cute, seating was fast and hostess was very friendly. Acoustics are a weird though, I don't know if everyone in the restaurant was speaking really loudly or the open setup made it difficult to hear my companions.  The menu needs a little work - the font they used is terrible. The selection was large though, quite a variety. I had the tofu mushroom scramble with the potatoes. Really tasty, the food was good.  Service was great, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice to have another place to eat in the village center area.  However, eat's menu seems stale and I can't recall many serious changes over the last couple years.  The coffee isn't very good, the staff is great, the meals are HEAVY!!!  Definitely not a place to go on the regular but every now and then for a real gut bomb, eat will fit the bill.  The smug \"no substitutions\" concept is lame.  I get the whole \"chefs inspired\" thing but you're in a neighborhood now, relax a little bit!"}
{"text":"Best grits you can get are at Eat Summerlin Proper! Extra shrimp and bacon please! The service is extraordinaire.  It's really cute- when you walk in, the door says \"Eat\" & when you walk out, the door says \"Ate.\""}
{"text":"This place is such a good brunch or lunch place to go. I like this location too and all of the workers are very friendly and willing to help if you have questions. My absolute favorite is the grilled cheese with tomato soup. It is definitely a must try and you get full with just that."}
{"text":"I've had their food before, but at the downtown location. They just opened the Summerlin location a month or two ago. I brought the family here for breakfast and the food was amazing!  The kids had the pancakes. Very good. Light and fluffy on the inside with a bit of crunch on the outside. They both loved it. My wife had the eggs Benedict and she was very happy with them as well. I had the truffled egg sandwich which was delicious. The service was fantastic as well. Our waiter was very friendly, even when our 1 year old started getting fussy!  If I had to give a critique I would say that the breakfast potatoes could be a little crispier. But other than that everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Went to Eat Summerlin last Sunday for brunch. First time at this location, that was not disappointed at all @chefnat and her team are always spot on with everything they do. Chicken fried steak is always to die for. Thank you Dominick for the excellent service. We shall return!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite breakfast spots! I can't get over the truffle egg sandwich! The staff is always very friendly and attentive. I often order breakfast to be picked up before work and it is always quick and ready to go when I get there! I was just there for lunch & my food was ready before they even said it would be. I wasn't having the best day but the friendly staff turned it around very quickly! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious!! Very unique which is what I seek in a breakfast joint. The truffle breakfast sandwich is to live for! And the deviled eggs also amazing. Ordered both without meat. Great service. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have reviewed the Downtown restaurant previously. This is our first visit to the Summerlin location. Arrived for breakfast shortly after 9 AM and the restaurant was very busy. We submitted our name and waited about 5 minutes for a table. Once seated service was prompt. The kitchen was slammed but the wait time for the food was acceptable. With a full house it was a little on the loud side, border line conversation friendly.   We ordered the Huevos Motulenus. Two eggs over easy, with red and green New Mexico Chiles, black beans, peas and pico on corn tortilla. This was a very tasty dish. The eggs were cooked to my satisfaction. A little heat from the red chili and the addition of peas was a welcome addition. The dish is served with Chive Potatoes which were crisp on the outside and soft inside. Soaking up the potatoes in the sauce was enjoyable.  The menu offers Pancakes in three sizes, full, short stack and one pancake. On this day the one pancake and a side order of Chive Potatoes was the right amount for breakfast. The pancake was fluffy and moist. Glad we arrived when we did as when we left people were waiting inside and outside.   Our thanks to Natalie for opening in Summerlin so that us west siders can enjoy her cooking with only a short drive from home."}
{"text":"JUST like eat. downtown. Same menu, same coffee, same not so warm breakfast potatoes -_-    The space itself IMO is a lot cuter than the one downtown with more windows and a giant corner window that faces the parking lot. I *believe there is more seating at this location too. As mentioned in previous reviews, the server was a little pushy in trying to upsell more items, but hey they need to make their money too.   Truffle egg sandwich was just as good as expected, and I peeled my bacon off & gave it to the man-friend to put on his sandwich. I'm glad that this spot is here as the downtown location is less than a mile away from my house, this location is less than a mile away from the man-friend's house :). Parking lot is huuuuge, coffee is strong, AND you can get a nice hot to-go cup when you're ready to leave!"}
{"text":"EAT is a tasty little hideaway in a Summerlin shopping area. Unfortunately their staff aren't too friendly or accommodating. Twice now we've had to wait for a table in their tiny dining room front while the back dining area was empty. This was at 11:30 and they are only open for breakfast and lunch. Yesterday we came with an elderly friend with a cane and same thing happened: empty back room, no available tables in front. The greeter told my wife it would take awhile for a table and they had a private event later on. My wife said that maybe we'd go elsewhere and he said, \"ok\" without attempting to accommodate us in any way, shape or form."}
{"text":"Heard good things about EAT and came for breakfast and was very impressed with the food and the service. The truffled egg sandwich rocked !!"}
{"text":"Food wise Eat is perfect. Not many of these types of places in Vegas. A neighborhood morning and lunch only restaurant. No dinner just egg and sandwiches galore. Prices are around $10-15 for the most part but the sizes are generous so could bring some home for sure.   I had one of the best BLTs here. Thick toasted bread and some fantastic bacon. The avocado was good but might have been to slimy, making the sandwich fall apart. The large sandwich came with a side which I like as many places now a days are a la carte only. I had the tomato soup which was nothing spectacular but nonetheless perfect for dipping the great bread.   Service knocked my review down. We had 4 separate waiters before ordering. 1 have us specials, 1 took drink orders, 1 took food orders, and 1 was going to take food orders then just disappeared. Getting seated our table was for 4 when we had 5 so we had to squeeze in. At the end, we sat on a check with a credit card sticking out, ready for payment for literally 20 minutes. We had to ask them to let us pay.   Eat has some great food regardless of location. Good foodie spot for sure. No alcohol from what I saw which is unfortunate but good for a lunch, brunch, or breakfast in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I wanted to order their one of their breakfast menu items. I was bummed to see some of their options end at 11. Next time I will be sure to stop in earlier. So I ended up getting a lunch item.   We did order the biscuts as a starter. They did not disappoint. Sweet and tasty!   Chicken sandwhich was tasty. I liked the sauce on it. The potatoe chips were super delicious. I ordered an ice coffee, loved it. I am a coffee drinker and it was phenomenal! I do wish they would've filled my water more often.   Servers were very friendly! Their system went down and they had to do a paper/pen ticket. They remained happy and relaxed.   It did feel a bit warm in there!! Doesn't help it is summer."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good. I had the cinnamon biscuits they were so fresh and fluffy and soft with the fruit compote just fruity not heavy at all berry delicious. The deviled eggs are also really good don't forget to order those. There creamy, crispy, and spicy definitely one of a kind. And the staff is also very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"Great staff and the food was delicious. Got the cinnamon biscuits which were a nice appetizer to share and dessert. The Benedict's sandwich was by far the best breakfast food I've had in awhile. Added avocado to my order and got the eggs medium."}
{"text":"This is the only breakfast in vegas I will eat. I would go every week to the spot in downtown and so happy they are in our neighborhood now. The highest quality delicious sit down breakfast spot for locals by a landslide. I don't yelp usually ever but for this spot I will:))"}
{"text":"I love the downtown location, but now this is my new favorite breakfast spot! SO close to home. Delicious food. Amazing food! The owner is a gem, and so is her staff. I love their local love and phenomenal menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  From the funky decor & great wait staff, the food was delicious.  They have some signature dishes that aren't your typical fare.  The shrimp & grits breakfast was amazing.  The homemade corned beef hash was very good.  Where do you find real hash these days?  It was real cubes corned beef with vegetables not mush cakes or from a can.   Go!  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"UPDATED due to 2nd visit. Due to the limited hours I was never able to get to Eat downtown when they were open so I was happy to see them open in my neighborhood.  I came in for brunch and was trying to decide between the chicken fried steak and the shrimp and grits but the shrimp and grits won out.  It was really flavorful and filling.  Service was good and the food came out promptly.  The only thing I would ding would be that I was not offered a refill on my coffee.  On my second visit with my sister and her fiance the refills were right on point.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak this time and it was fan-fricking-tasic.  Now I need to go back and get the deviled eggs. Review also on Trip Advisor."}
{"text":"I'm such a fan of eat's downtown location so was eager to try the new Summerlin location on this last trip.  I'm very happy to say that it's the same quality of food but with no line for a seat! ... well, on a weekday anyway, haven't tried it on a weekend which I bet is crowded.  We got here right as they opened and were the only ones in the restaurant for most of the meal.  The interior space is larger than the downtown location with some funky decor.  The service was also super friendly and welcoming.  We both got the Chicken Fried Steak and both thought it was really good, nice crispy coating with a creamy pork sausage gravy.  The one critique about the dish when compared to the same dish at the downtown location are the country potatoes, while plump with a soft interior, didn't have that slightly charred exterior and caramelized onions and garlic like the ones at the downtown restaurant has, I love those potatoes.  Another thing to talk about, the toast that came with the breakfast was worth mentioning.  The sourdough toast and the toasted whole wheat english muffin were both better than the toast you'd normally get at other places.  I don't think I've ever mentioned in a review the side of toast that comes with a meal before so that should be an indicator of how good they were.    There are quite a few uninspired restaurants in this area so Eat is a great addition to Summerlin."}
{"text":"New location, who dis ?   I will start by saying I'm not a huge breakfast person. Brunch I enjoy, but breakfast isn't very exciting to me. That is of course unless you're asking me to join you at Eat. Here you will find the absolute best pancakes. Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy inside... they are amazing. I recommend the pancakes to all you waffle lovers out there.   The location is in a busy shopping center in Summerlin. I do like the vibe of the downtown location a bit better but this location is a lot closer to home. It is kid friendly however I can't say it was stroller friendly.   Minus one star for their hostess: We have been here a few times, she both seats parties and takes orders. She is overall a bit high strung and abrupt. We never get a hello before she comes to our table and gives off a very unwelcoming and rushed demeanor. I've seen patrons shocked at her briskness. If she slowed down just a little bit she would have time to smile, say hello and wouldn't have to pick chairs up in the air and slam things down on the hostess stand while clearing tables.   Mom Rating 4/5  As a parent to a little one who will soon be eating table foods they do offer high chairs. I did not visit the restroom to see if they have a changing table. The atmosphere is welcoming to young children."}
{"text":"We s"}
{"text":"The service is always wonderful - they treat you like family! And the strawberry biscuits...amaze."}
{"text":"Mediocre, overpriced, and the service was awful. Jacques Cafe tasted way better at a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Quaint little hidden restaurant... very tasty and good service... wish they had mimosas... lol"}
{"text":"Doesn't it bother anyone that the menu says \"changes and modifications to the menu politely declined\"? So many people have allergies these days, so it's not by choice. No item on the menu is listed as gluten free or vegetarian.  Very disappointing.  Walked in and walked backed out after reading this..."}
{"text":"Eating Summerlin Proper means that you cannot bring any outside drinks, no substitutions, and if you have a baby - do not bring a stroller in because there isn't really room for your stroller.... you gotta love first impressions because I felt like a stick needed to be taken out from somewhere in this restaurant.   Anyway, the food wasn't bad. I've visited at their downtown location before and I had no complaints. The chilaquiles we ordered was good. I like it when restaurants decide to add chips as opposed to tortillas. It was enough for two. I only had one bite of the complimentary cinnamon bread/cake whatever - that was ok. Probably don't plan to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice place. Now, second verse same as the first...   I'll divide this into 3 sections: vibe, service, and food.   Let's Go!  Vibe: I loved this place the second I came in. I guess you could let me fall into the hipster category sometimes. When it comes to objects I fall in love with vintage or more bluntly things that are old. This place has a lot of vintage decor which I love but it was very Instagram worthy. Some things were very aesthetically pleasing.It was very open and it had a bar area.It's very casual and comfortable.  Service: The service was lovely. Our server came to the front right as we entered and lead us to our table. She was nice but she wasn't very talkative.  Food: Now the cream of the crop... The food! I ordered the Truffled Egg Sandwich. Presentation was lovely but there was a lone strawberry that kinda confused me. The sandwich was good but a bit to much mushrooms even for a mushroom sandwich. It was very tasty though. My meal came with potatoes but I wished it was a bit more seasoned. Overall my meal was nice."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been a fan of the downtown location since it opened. So happy to have this location close to home. Chef Natalie is not only an amazing chef but she's a huge supporter of the community and great to chat with. The tomato soup is my absolute favorite but then again, everything is great!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food was delicious and we will definitely be back. The waitress (Erica) was engaging and helpful."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating brunch here with a girlfriend. We dine at the dt location often so it's nice to have a second location to visit. Service was outstanding( shoutout to Dom who took great care of us ) food delicious and hit the spot. Poached eggs (not soggy mess) and short stack for me. Friend had the truffle egg sandwich and extra side of crispy bacon. So good. Will be visiting again of course."}
{"text":"So happy that eat has made it out to Summerlin. Its a good place to go if you're looking for that something different for bfast. Super friendly staff and cool atmosphere make it a must try."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, it's in my community, and I've only gave it one shot but I just wasn't satisfied on my first visit. Our server, although nice wasn't very knowledgeable on the menu, when we asked if  any Items where Vegan she said you can order the Egg dishes without Meat... When we asked if there was Dairy in the Pancakes or the Cinnamon biscuits she said I think there's eggs.. She thinks eggs are vegan but also Dairy? Lol, Anyways she was nice and that's not that big a deal. However with a new business in an area that has 2 other Breakfast Restaurants, this place has to stand out to become the Favorite, it's got the vibe, the interior just needs to have better options then the other 2 chains have. The Turkey Bacon and Apple Chicken Sausage are a huge start. I, like others would rather support local and small businesses however those small businesses need to stand out, have what the big retailers don't, and that's customer service, and healthy, sustainable options. I'm sure the investors nor the owners will care about this as the most important for them is revenue, but caring about the product you give your customers is very important. Hoping to see new menu items someday as I'd like to have my go to Breakfast joint be a walk away."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing first time experience.  Firstly, they don't have a \"Please wait to be seated\" sign so the two of us came in and headed to a table and were redirected rather rudely.  Then, my order didn't get entered so my wife got her meal and before I could ask where mine was, my waiter disappeared for 10 minutes.  When we finally got his attention he said the order never went in ... at that point I was pretty fed up so cancelled my order.  No refills for coffee, very poor attention to our table and they weren't even that busy.  Their management didn't even attempt to apologize.  Although they didn't charge us for my meal, they didn't comp any of the rest of it (not even the one cup of coffee).  The one dish was ok but pretty bad experience overall."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now and my last visit, Chef Young was in the house.  Chef was just hanging out at a table but it's still nice to see the owner/Chef in their own business.  At first, when I ate at the downtown location about 3-4 years ago, photos played a part in how I chose what to order.  Now I don't need to since the menu was kept the same.    The food is good in Summerlin as it is downtown.  I encourage people to test the menu as much as possible.  The servers all help each other out so every time we come in service is good.  My benny's are always delicious and cold brew always filled.  Welcome to Summerlin."}
{"text":"Welcome to my neighborhood! Very limited menu but absolutely delicious and great service. Unfortunately I cannot say I will be a repeat customer since there is no healthy choice. But there is nothing bad to say. I will recommend this place to all my friend and neighbors."}
{"text":"Great food but selection limited.  Be prepared to not be let in with your Starbucks drink from the same shopping center, no outside drinks allowed.  The music selection is limited to 1960's fossil rock/hippie movement."}
{"text":"This new branch did not disappoint. The food is just as great as the original location and the staff was very professional and welcoming. Couldn't ask for more"}
{"text":"Always enjoy this place. Glad they have 2 locations now since I live in Summerlin and I work close to downtown. Food is always fresh and tastes great!!!"}
{"text":"Adorable new place in the heart of Summerlin Exactly what we needed!! The owner is hands on and super sweet! Both my daughter and I were very happy with the staff, food and ambience!! 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch spot. The homemade wheat toast and two egg special Was amazing!. I will definitely being coming back"}
{"text":"Delicious! Saw a Yelp notification for this place and it looked yummy so we went right away. Boy, we weren't disappointed. Service was top notch and the food will keep us coming back again and again. Need to try the rest of the menu. We had the chicken fried steak, scrumptious, the grilled cheese with tomato soup (saw one walk by and had to try) yummy, and since I'm eating super clean right now I had the shrimp po boy without bread and a tomato salad as my side. I did have a bite of both of my daughters meals, so tasty.... and it was so worth it (cheat of clean eating, lol)."}
{"text":"Our new favorite breakfast spot. Fresh, top-shelf ingredients cooked with love and passion. Everything we've had here so far is delectable. Oh, don't miss the cinnamon biscuits or the country fried steak and eggs. I always need a short nap after breakfast here. For our money, this is the finest place in town to get it."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the egg truffle sandwich. It is amazing. It is flavorful and unique. The bread is delicious! The service is excellent. I highly recommend this place. Parking is excellent. I cannot emphasize how good the sandwich is!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Huge portions! Very tasty. Service was also good with helpful recommendations."}
{"text":"I have found that sometimes when a restaurant tries to expand to multiple locations the quality of  the food or service is not as good as the original location.  I love the original Eat location downtown, and was so excited to try the new location in Summerlin, but also a little concerned that it wouldn't be the same great restaurant experience that I have had.  I was not disappointed!! My weekend brunch was delicious! Great service and same great food as the downtown location. The Eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly with noticeably fresh ingredients. The fried deviled eggs are crazy good, but if you go to Eat downtown or Eat Summerlin, you must try their toast! They have the best bread/toast in the city!"}
{"text":"Food portions are delicious but small. Staff isn't super friendly. The comment at the bottom of the menu about no changes or substitutions is a huge turn off and shows they really don't care about customer satisfaction. Sometimes people may love a dish but hate tomatoes, or may hate swiss cheese but prefer american, etc. We eat out a LOT and give our repeated business to restaurants that care about their customers tastes, preferences and allergies. And before someone replies with \"this isn't Burger King, you can't have it your way\", that comment is invalid because the scale and prices of this restaurant don't even compare to Burger King, which is all the more reason to care about your customer's needs and wants."}
{"text":"Their deviled eggs were amazing! Very friendly service! The place was very cute and clean!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm just discovering Eat! It's delicious and I feel like I'm at home Highly recommend this restaurant, but wish  It had longer afternoon hours for after school"}
{"text":"Food is Awesome. Great location in Summerlin. I also have eaten at the Downtown location and the food is excellent there as well.  The Shrimp and Grits are great!   Staff is polite, professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Loved! amazing service, great coffee, delicious food, relaxing ambiance, cute decor..."}
{"text":"I took a small group (8 of us) to eat breakfast or brunch at the Summerlin location on a Monday. The restaurant were not busy when we arrived and we were promptly given a table. I always ask for separate checks since this is a foodie group and we all want to pay our own ways. Our waitress did not want to give us separate checks claiming they would only \"allow\" 2 credit cards per table. Since no one I know uses cash very often we advised her we could split into separate tables or go somewhere else. She finally agreed that she could calculate the separate checks (as if they don't have a digital system, come on!) but we would have to wait for our checks. Gee, it is Monday at 10 AM, we are here to try out the food not rush to work. Anyway, after that problem was solved, we were given menus. A young man then came to take our orders and he was very professional and accommodating. We ordered a variety of breakfast and lunch items. The kitchen was very fast (remember we were the bulk of their patrons). The food was hot and tasted good. Most everyone said they liked the food and would come back again to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Natalie has done it again! The Downtown and Summerlin locations consistently create delicious items that are sure to please any appetite."}
{"text":"Excellent service! This is a classy breakfast and brunch spot located in Summerlin. I was very impressed with the quality of the ingredients. The sourdough bread was very thick and dense, definitely bakery style quality. The eggs were perfectly cooked, over medium, which is sometimes difficult to achieve. The hashbrowns were crispy and tasty. I also got the chicken fried steak. The cream gravy was absolutely delicious. The coating on the steak was crisp and well seasoned. My only complaint is that the steak was chewy. The steak was thicker than I am used to getting for chicken fried steak which might be the issue. But I would still come back here as everything else was great. The best part of the experience was the attentive friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Such a big supporter of local, fresh foods and Chef Nat but highly disappointed. I would think after several weeks they would have most kinks worked out. We went last Friday around noon and were warmly greeted and quickly seated. We ordered deviled eggs to start (4/5), I got the arugula salad and the boyfriend got the roast beef sandwich. The eggs came out quickly and were tasty. I had ordered a cold brew coffee but had to ask several times for milk/cream. Minutes later my salad came out, as if the server treated it as an appetizer too while my boyfriend sat there with no food. It's a lunch salad, it's Restaurant 101 that you serve the meals together folks. The arugula salad was just that...a pile of arugula...bland dressing and a few tomatoes that lay on the bottom of the plate (0/5). Very sad dish. About 20 minutes later, after I had finished the salad his sandwich arrived. The roast beef sandwich was good, but to be honest, by that time it didn't really matter. They served the wrong side dish which we had to send back. When we then got the tomato side salad it was more like a tarragon salad accompanied by tomatoes sooooo we may give EAT second try, but doubtful. Bummed."}
{"text":"Some of the best pancakes with a crisp glaze and fluffy inside. And delicious potatoes! A little pricy but a nice homey feel inside.  Update: I recently tried their cinnamon biscuits. They were tasty but didn't appear to actually have any cinnamon. My friend and I both looked and neither saw nor tasted cinnamon."}
{"text":"The menu is very unoriginal and uninteresting. There's nothing creative that stands out and wows you. Eggs Benedict, country fried steak, pancakes, etc.. The service was pretty friendly. I didn't like how our server upsold us in the most sneaky way possible.  When we were finished ordering, he asked if we'd like some biscuits, we said sure. These biscuits were an extra menu item for $8. The way he asked was as if they were included.   Portions are huge so you can probably share one plate here.  I don't think I'll come back, just not impressed with the food."}
{"text":"The chef is very knowledgeable and friendly. The food is excellent. I recommend the fried deviled eggs."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast place! The hash was delicious and the potatoes are good as well. Would like to come back and try the country fried steak."}
{"text":"ate.  I developed a huge appreciation for this Summerlin location the minute I pulled up and realized there was no line outside! (Hallelujah...)  I decided to go out of my comfort zone and ordered the Huevos Motulenos $14 (scrambled vs. over easy eggs) and I'm glad I did. There were so many different flavors and textures my taste buds were all over the place in a great way (red and green Mexican chiles, black beans, pico, feta and sautéed bananas on a corn tortilla) . The chive potato's are my favorite guilty pleasure; they are the bomb! Our server Dominic was pretty smooth upselling us on avocado for a nominal fee of one dollar per order.    The Truffle Egg Sandwich $14.00 (1/5 stars) was very disappointing. The truffle oil was extremely excessive; the ciabatta bread was drenched. Truffle oil poorly executed to the point the sandwich was not enjoyable. No Bueno for such a pricy ingredient!  Of course I'll be back Chef Natalie and her establishments are overall a great addition to Las Vegas.   $38 Total"}
{"text":"Well, first let me say that I have eaten at Eat downtown many times and absolutely adored it!  Today was my first time at the Summerlin location.  First off, LOUD ugly music playing, too early for breakfast!  Asked to have it turned down and waitress said it couldn't be done, altho it did seem to be softer after that.   My husband ordered his standard, bacon & eggs w/rye toast.  It was a huge serving and he couldn't finish it all, but enjoyed it.  I had eaten the oatmeal with pecans at the downtown location, and thought it was fabulous, so I ordered it again at the Summerlin location.  Blah.  It was nothing like the oatmeal I remembered from downtown.  Tasteless, and three pecan halves and 3 strawberry halves with the green tops still on.  Asked our server for some milk or cream to put on it,  he left and after a long wait,  my husband looked around for another server and a young woman server was asked and brought it immediately.  The original server never stopped  by our table again to refill coffee, tea or ask how we were doing.    Since we have loved the original restaurant, and have been looking forward to trying the Summerlin location since it is just minutes from our house, it was somewhat disappointing for me.    However, I will go back again, because I know how good it should be, I just won't be ordering the oatmeal!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretentious. I support local businesses and would love to see a dining establishment finally thrive in this location, but this hipster place has too high an opinion of itself with inflated prices and poor service. When a friend wanted to replace the pesto mayo on her sandwich with avocado, the server smugly pointed out how no substitutions were allowed. Thankfully, he did let us know there was no charge to leave the mayo off the sandwich....We never were checked on, no refills. No split checks allowed. My chicken fried steak was rubbery, potatoes overdone. We left feeling that we should have gone to any of the other many, many breakfast places on this side of town. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This has a cute atmosphere but the food isn't the best, the deviled eggs weren't as good as the reviews lead me to believe unless you like the taste of fried breading. The Rueben was good but the tomato soup wasn't very tasty."}
{"text":"Just as good as the downtown location:) Food is incredible! Always has been my favorite breakfast in Las Vegas but I live in summerlin and don't love the drive downtown so I wouldn't go often! Im so excited for the new location 2 miles from my house! The truffle egg sandwich is so good! I also love the pancakes here. This location is nice because there is way more seating. Staff I'd say is even friendlier at this location! It's a win for me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in after an appt. as a suggestion from friends. We were greated by a gentleman and my husband explained he didnt want a certain table because of the chairs and his back. He was happy to sit us elsewhere until a completely rude lady approaches and decides we have to take that table or nothing. So we left! We happened to be greeted by the owner outside and she promised to make it right. Jonathan was our server and very kind. I had the truffle egg sandwhich, which was fabulous. I am glad we came back."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever had a basic meal like corned beef hash done with such excellence.  I think it starts with the quality ingredients they use and the magic they sprinkle on the food. I think it's called seasoning done correctly?  I don't know for sure, but my socks were blown off that such a basic comfort food could have such amazing flavor.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Well the place looks good but I'll never know because when my gf and I walked in the door with Starbucks we were told they don't allow outside beverages. Wow u guys must really need that extra $2.50 for \"your\" coffee huh..! Sorry to say EAT but u guys missed out on some possible good repeat customers cause of your stupid policy and your obvious greed. Seeing there was no one else in the place maybe you should have rethought your policy and stopped turning away customers when Egg Works across the street is packed w/ a 10 minutes wait , oh and they allow Starbucks here..!!!"}
{"text":"Summary :  Food not good enough to justify the attitude. I was excited to try this place, but left sadly disappointed.  The warm greetings that we received upon entering were, in retrospect, the highlight of our brunch.  As a group of 6, we had come for a late lunch about 40 minutes before they closed. The menu was mostly breakfast food with the addition of three sandwiches and there was no children's menu.  While trying to find something that our son would eat, we asked if he could have a simple grilled cheese sandwich.  We were directed to the $11 adult size Sourdough grilled cheese and told that the chef refused to make children's size portion.  After getting the manager involved and pointing out that the had both white toast and cheese on the menu, we were able to twist their arm enough to get them to produce the saddest grilled cheese sandwich in existence.  After that, we were all hungry and hoping that our lunches would be worth all of the hassle.  Much to the dismay of all five adults, our entrées were mediocre at best.  The chicken on Cesar was dry, but on the sandwich it was soggy.  The adult Sourdough grilled cheese was decent, but not worth $11."}
{"text":"WOW!  Chef Natalie, Bean, and the entire staff were SO accommodating to our large group of 16 women, they practically bent over backwards to feed us!  I will come back and I sincerely hope that you, the reader, do, too!!  Thank you EAT."}
{"text":"Eats was great! I used to live in San Francisco and this definitely reminded me of it. I had coffee with almond milk and then the arugula salad. My family ordered the country fried steak and the eggs benedict. Everyone loved their food. The decor is very cute and Eats is exactly what we needed in Summerlin! Service was so great as well. A great option for breakfast, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Brought the family this morning!  It was worth the drive.  Shared deviled eggs.  Fantastic!!!!  Exceeded my expectations!!!  Also had the truffle egg sandwich.  Heaven!!!  The potatoes put my sandwich over the top!!!  Wish I could give an extra star thanks to the service!!!"}
{"text":"Chef Natalie Young serves hearty breakfast/ brunch food items that can surely satisfy even the pickiest eater. The fantastic food and service we know and appreciate from her first eat location in Downtown Las Vegas can now be had in the Summerlin area. This location is about twice the size of the first location which is even better because there's no wait time, yay!  I have my own personal favorites including Chicken Fried Steak, Chilaquiles, etc. My top favorites which I HAVE to have include...  Cinnamon Biscuits: Cinnamony, buttery biscuits with berries, and a berry compote. These are just a delight. For those times when you just have to treat yo'self! 4/5  Deviled Eggs: Chef Natalie's version is one of my favorites. The egg white part is battered and fried without being greasy topped with some delicious mustardy yolk with sriracha and bacon. 4/5  Truffled Egg Sandwich: Lightly toasted sourdough bread, truffled scrambled eggs, mushrooms, and bacon with a side of potatoes with chives. You haven't really had an egg sandwich until you eat this. The bread looks like it should be hard/ crunchy but it's not. It's soft on the outside and slightly crunchy on its toasted buttery side. Lots of good flavors and textures. Not your average breakfast sandwich. 5/5  More room, more parking at this location but same deliciousness served daily from morning til early afternoon."}
{"text":"The truffle egg sandwich is amazing, as is the strawberry cinnamon biscuits! Coffee is breakfast strength, very mild, but still decent. The interior is cute & the menu has a lot of different options & ala carte options. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little breakfast lunch spot we come to occasionally.   The food is delicious.   The tomato soup is my fav on the menu along with the potato salad.   Today I purchased a Roast Beef sandwich for my boss. The total came out to 12.07 and I gave the cashier a $20 bill. I got 6$ back in change. I tipped $1 and left it on the counter for them. I guess they decided to tip themselves because I only had $5 when I got in my car. Really?! A $15 sandwich?   The food is good and mostly homemade, the quality is good but this place is pricey.   I recommend the \"BLT\" with the tomato soup."}
{"text":"Tried eat for the first time today after seeing all the reviews I had to of course try the deviled eggs they were really good they're fried so that was a little different. I had the Reuben sandwich paired with the tomato soup. The Reuben was excellent the tomato soup was phenomenal. Only bad thing was the strawberry lemonade at the end it started tasting like emergen c. Great spot"}
{"text":"Great great atmosphere. Bright and clean. Great food. Prices makes sense. Very friendly staff. Food like you used to be able to get at home."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Thank goodness I don't have to drive downtown anymore to get my favorite breakfast and lunch!!!  Sincerely the best pancakes in town.  How they make them fluffy on the inside with the perfectly crispy edges all the way around the outer part is just genius!!!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the reviews that I saw on Yelp. They have a very nice atmosphere. I didn't particularly care for the food. My wife's coffee was bitter. I'm on a low sugar diet and everything was very sugary. I tried the cinnamon biscuits that reviewers have raved about, and I thought they were just okay. They are cinnamon biscuits smothered in a strawberry jelly glaze with powdered sugar fruit. I thought it was going to be something healthy. My fried potatoes weren't bite size and were kind of hard. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Anyways, that was my experience."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced. I TOLD my husband that the reviews said the grits were bland but he decided to get it anyway. MISTAKE. He had to salt and pepper the CRAP out of it so that it would taste like something.  The fact that he couldn't have the pico on the side was annoying. The biscuits and deviled eggs are the only reason why I'm giving it a 2 star. The guy who took our drink order told us that the lemonade was free refills but the strawberry lemonade was not. The strawberry lemonade was SOOOOO watered down and come to find out, the regular lemonade WASN'T free refills. Thank God for those biscuits..."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! So happy we were randomly looking to eat breakfast on a Sunday around 10:30am. The service was wonderful and we were seated quickly. The food felt like it was homemade from fresh whole food. The coffee was mothership coffee which is a local coffee company so that's awesome local businesses working together. I got the eggs Benedict and Joey got the two eggs with bacon. I recommend and would go again."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot! Service was top notch and food was amazing! I had the truffle egg sandwich and it was a flavor explosion in my mouth! Great place!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Summerlin, easy. We love the downtown location but we're lazy suburbanites, so we don't make it down very often. Enter Eat Summerlin! The vibes are so good: the space is eclectic and clean, servers are quick and friendly.  Food is amazing! We ordered a chicken sandwich with a fresh tomato salad, a short stack of pancakes and side of chive potatoes for the kids and an order of their truffle egg, mushroom, bacon sandwich (on an insanely decadent baguette style brioche bun... sorry, not a baker, but trust that it was amazing). The food was just on point from the flavors to how quickly it came out, piping hot. Coffee is Mothership Roasters and delicious. Husband loved his green tea. Kids got a kick out of drinking their ice water from mini to-go coffee cups. We love you, Eat."}
{"text":"I dont know why they are rated with only 2 stars..non-traditional combinations of traditional breakfast foods.  I truly enjoyed truffle eggs with wild mushrooms and bacon on fresh ciabatta."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this opening in my neighborhood. I've been to the downtown location many times.   Would love to see this be successful but off to a very bad start. I've been here twice and service was horrific both times.    Both visits, different servers, had horrible entitled attitudes.   Like you are doing us a favor by letting us into your dining establishment.   If you ask for a substitution you get a no and an Eye-roll.    Walked from my home in TPC and was given major attitude because I had a water bottle. Seriously?     Fire everyone and start over."}
{"text":"Excellent for breakfast or lunch.  The biscuits are amazing, shrimp and grits are delicious and everything else on the menu is equally tasty.  (I have tried almost everything.)"}
{"text":"You have been forewarned this place has great food! HORRIBLE SERVICE. I should of known when we got seated it was going to be a problem since the guy next to us had complained to the wait staff on how poorly the service was. I was trying to be optimistic and hope that after they got talked too it would change the service. NOPE! After our food was brought to us, no one asked if the food was good, not one single waiter asked if we needed anything else, I thought that should be serving 101. Not one single waiter was around for a good 20 mins and I kept looking around to see if anyone noticed we were ready to go? I had to call over someone to get me a box and our check. Only then did the manager come and asked if we wanted a refill, no we've been sitting here for an hour with our food and no one had asked prior. At one point new customers came in and you see the manager look around to see where her waiters were and no one was to be found so she had to go seat them and take their drink order. I made sure they knew they were shitty and wrote it on the pay slip !!!"}
{"text":"Cool small lunch spot. Enjoyed the food. Service was great. A little disappointed with the coffee. But over all, the perfect spot to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Chelsea was our server on Easter Sunday. There was only 3-4 tables rotating in and out during our lunch. Between 11-12:30pm. It took the waitress halfway through my food to even bring me my water so i had something to drink. Then she never refilled it. We had to keep bothering them asking to refill my husbands soda and they still never refilled my water. Not until our credit card was ran and we were leaving did they ask if we needed more water. The food was ok. You need to carry jelly for your toast. The strawberry compote is not a substitute. The bacon and eggs were cooked wonderfully. Service here (or lack there of) is the only reason I'll never be back. I can go across as the street to Egg works. The food may not be as good but the service has always been welcoming."}
{"text":"Yum as always. Pancakes are smaller here than Downtown. The server was not happy we didn't order drinks. We prefer water. He asked us twice, and then asked my husband again. No, we just want water. He seemed annoyed with our kids, but warmed up. I didn't let it bother me because every other server was friendly and smiled at the kids as they brought it good out. Maybe he was having a bad day.   It won't stop me from coming back. Hands down the best pancakes ever. I tried the free range chicken sandwich, way yum. Husband did shrimp and grits, amazing. We'll be back to try more things. So glad they expanded to Summerlin, we love eat!!!"}
{"text":"We have visited Eat Downtown many times and have enjoyed every meal. This location left us disappointed.  We were the first customers to arrive and were seated promptly. The hostess wasn't friendly or rude, she was just doing a job.  The chicken fried steak, which is a speciality of Natalie's, was subpar. It was cold and the breading hadn't been fried entirely.  When the manager saw that we hadn't eaten it, he asked why and when we told him, he just said \"oh no!\" and still gave us the check for the entire meal.  It wasn't worth arguing about, he knew it wasn't good and decided to do nothing. We just won't be back.  If they aren't careful they will suffer the fate of every restaurant that was in this spot before them. People have little tolerance for high prices and mediocre food."}
{"text":"I stopped here to eat breakfast before a friend's wedding later that day. The staff is super friendly and the food was great. This was exactly what we were looking for after our long drive from orange county that morning. Get the bacon!!!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot! Fabulous food, friendly fun service, great atmosphere. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Love the grown up food here.  Step up from other local places. Adult tastes varieties.  Shrimp and grits - not a grits lover - until today. The tastes and texture was just awesome.  The bacon and eggs were very good bacon nice and smokey. The corned beef hash and eggs (comes with poached and I asked for over well- no gripes on the change) were excellent. I have never had corned beef served like this in small cubes with tons of flavor.  Entree run $11 - $15. Bottomless cup of coffee was $4.  Coffee was tasty but I do prefer a bit stronger.  Great attentive and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great new place. Food was awesome and service was fast and friendly. We were here for breakfast and will definitely be back for lunch."}
