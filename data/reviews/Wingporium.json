{"text":"This place has the best wings in town!! Giving 5 stars for the 4 different flavours we started with out of 88 flavours, and the service is great. Will definitely try Black Mamba next time.  1. Garlic parmesan 2. Interview with Vampire 3. Tangy Thai 4. Honey Garlic"}
{"text":"I've been here over a dozen times. This is what you expect from a no frills wings and beer place. The service is always surprisingly fast and usually pretty friendly. The wings are decent, although not always consistent. I've had them large and juicy and tiny and overcooked. They have a huge selection of flavours (88 if I'm not mistaken). This place is a regular for me."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday. First thing ordered a coffee. The coffees were cold.  The waitress came and took our order after waiting twenty minutes.  The wings we ordered were not fresh and the dressing was horrible. We also ordered veggie sticks but just wanted to leave so we asked for the waitress to bring us a styrafoam container to go.   Well the waitress came with our styrafoam container and just pitched it on the table for us to put them in ourselves. I was appauled and on top of this she did not even bring back our change. We walked out and in all my years of eating out that was the worst service ever.  That waitress should be fired !!!! I would not even rate it one star !!!"}
{"text":"Yummy wings! Hot honey bbq, jalapeno ranch, interview with a vampire are my faves! Poutine is delicious too. This place is a local gem. Real close to Cineplex Odeon. And also has free WiFi just ask."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday and ordered the sweet&spicy blue cheese wings.  pretty big wings =)   Only con is the slow service but our server was awesome."}
{"text":"I am proud to write this review for Wingporium!  I have had the pleasure of making a few trips to this location in the last few months.  The quality of wings is superior to the other top locations I used to frequent.  They sell beef back ribs which is rare for most restaurants.  If there are any fans of beef back ribs, you will be in for a treat.  Their wedges are well seasoned and served in a healthy portion.  More importantly, the service is really good from Kayley and Addy!  I had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners on a recent trip.  Often times I visit the smaller businesses and management and ownership lack the ability to engage with their guests.  It was refreshing when Cheech introduced himself and asked questions about his guests.  This gives you a welcome feel which is ignored by many restaurants.  I hope the owners continue this trend and really engage with their guests since it is the guests that will make or break their business long term.  Well done and keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say I don't think I have ever felt less important to a business than I did when I walked into this place. Had 40 mins to kill before I had to pick up my girlfriend from work and stopped by wingporium. This place clearly is focus around its barfly regulars had to seat myself and after 10 mins of trying to fan a waitress down I finally got served a drink. During this time the other waitress is screaming old rock song and taking shots with the owner. To give you contexts it's 1245 in the afternoon. I order the beef ribs and wing combo, apparently their specialty. After 40 min I get handed a pound of wings and what looks like the remains of someone else ribs. I explain to the waitress that the ribs don't look right and there's no meat on them she calls the manager and he says \"that's how they come don't know what to tell you\" I looked shocked and say are you serious. He says the best I can do is comp ur drink. Needless to say I will never walk into this craphole again."}
{"text":"Taste wings that look like their on steroids they're so big. More than enough flavors to please even the pickiest of eaters. Limited seating. And awesome deals every day of the week"}
{"text":"The best wings I've ever had. This is my go to place. I come here often and they never disappoint. Try the Interview with a vampire. Amazing. Jalape√±o Rancher are great too. Lower your expectations on the service however."}
{"text":"My gf and I visit Wingporium whenever we get out to the far west end and for wings in Canada, Wingporium does the trick. Though they tend to be a bit on the saucy side, the hot is really hot and the flavour combinations are pretty fun, though it seems to make the 88 flavours there is a lot of ingredient swapping going on. Not the nicest atmosphere - it looks like it could've been a converted Mac's or Becker's, and the last time we went we had to listen to a man verbally abuse his significant other throughout the football game -- but the wings will do nicely and the price is good too."}
{"text":"Wings were good - medium spice could be a little hotter - need to provide more veggies with the wings - beer selection good and cold. Friendly staff. Decent place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Best wing place in Etobicoke. Good vibe and service, we went to another place in mississauga they told us 30 minutes wait. So we drove here in 8 minutes and had an amazing wing special.  I would recommend to anyone that loves quality wings at a good price."}
{"text":"Went here over the G20 week... awesome wings and good choice of domestic and imported brews... great times with great wings!!  Definitely will repeat!!  Love the names... \"Taj Mahell\", etc... quite witty!"}
{"text":"If you're in Etobicoke and want a great place to watch a game while having beers and excellent wings, Wingporium is the place to go! I've been to their place a number of times and have no problems recommending it to friends or family. Although wings are their specialty, they offer a wide range of pub/sports bar-type food, and it's all tasty! Personally, I don't like the insanely spicy wings (too much \"Ring of Fire\" potential!!!), but, if you like your wings super HOT, you may want to try out their famous Black Mamba's.  One minor thing to mention (but, important in the wing world) - Some of the wings classified as \"Suicide\" wings were delicious , but, I didn't really get a feeling that they were \"suicide worthy\" on the heat scale!  Besides having excellent food, they have a ton of TV's, and their staff is friendly and always willing to make great wing recommendations!  Here are a few of my personal wing fav's - Interview with a Vampire (Hot, Garlic Parmesan), Thai Domi and Dracula's Nightmare (Voodoo, Garlic Parmesan). (If those don't sound interesting, they've got around 80 other flavours to choose from.)  Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh god, I'm craving them now.....time for another trip!"}
{"text":"This place has the best wings by far from any wings that I have ever had. I found it last Sept 2015 and it still is awesome. Their secret is fresh not frozen. And the dry rub is the best. I will even say my wings come in second to this place. If you are ever in Toronto you have to check this out. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We were visiting family in Toronto and wanted to have Wings & pizza for dinner Sunday night. Called and placed an order and picked them up. They were delicious! We got the honey mustard, mild/ranch, and medium wings (5 lbs). Also ordered a side of onion rings and they were wonderful. Will definitely order from this place next time."}
{"text":"I would have to say wingporium is a great spot for wings in Etobicoke. They have like 75 different flavours and the spice level can be suited to your preference. My favourite flavours are interview with the vampire and simply hot. Watch the game grab some wings .. All good"}
{"text":"Simply the best place for the wing experience. Great staff and a friendly group of regulars make the whole experience incredible.   The rib, wing combo is great value. Best sweet potato fries ever!  No picture cuz we gobbled up dinner before we thought about it."}
{"text":"Great wings. But they just reduced the portion by half. A pound of wings now only have 5? This is ridiculous. This is a good restaurant gone cheap. Well if you are okay with 5 wings for $11. You are in luck coz their wings are good."}
{"text":"Amazing wings! Especially re-grilled since it makes them nice and crunchy. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because the wings are overpriced."}
{"text":"I've been to Wingporium on several occasions. There is definitely an abundance of choice when it comes to what flavour of wings you want and the quality is above average.   The owners have done all they can to hire women behind the bar that will keep the male patrons coming back - Tilted Kilt style.   It's a very open atmosphere so if you're looking for cozy booths - this isn't your place. But if you're looking to watch the game and enjoy a typical sports environment - you've found your spot."}
{"text":"The quality and the size of the wings are alright for what you pay. The only good thing about there all you can eat is that you can choose any favour you want and arent limited to the first one you pick. If you want a lot of wings I advise you go to the all you can eat and avoid spending too much per pound."}
{"text":"Never again!  We've always liked the food at wingporium. Unfortunately the last two times we've been there, the portion size on the wings has been beyond ridiculous. The last time they passed off 6 measly digits pound of wings . At $12/pound that's 2 bucks a wing. Yep. $2 for one wing.  I swore I'd never be back. Tonight my kids insisted on giving them another chance.   So we went back. As always food was good. Service was quick and efficient and friendly. Aside from the wings the portion size was fine for our other items.   The wings came and I kid you not, we paid $24 for 10 wings. Don't get me wrong. Their wings are great. But seriously.... $2.40 for 1 wing. As a former chef, I can tell you, 5 uncooked wings is NOT 1 lb. EVER! Second, Their markup for these things is absolutely outrageous. The waitress said it's supposed to be 6 in 1 pound. Even 6 I guarantee is not 1 pound.  This is terrible value. Wingporium has lost my family's business for good. If each of us were to eat 10 wings (not a huge number), that's 40 wings. At $2.40/ wing we would be paying $96.00 for wings. That doesn't include salad or heavens forbid drinks.   This place will never get another penny for my family."}
{"text":"It was my third time in the pub and I can just say one thing about the wings - the best one I've ever had..."}
{"text":"After work and a couple drinks downtown TO..my friend recommended we go get some great wings.   Had the hot all dressed..just right amount of sauce :) my friend had some called hot Sicilian ...or so I remember..both were fantastic.   The service was top notch..for a wings place and the owner came and mingled with us a little. Nice touch!   Great place for yummy wings ..and to catch a Leafs game."}
{"text":"I came to this place this weekend to watch Raptors game. Wings were very big and delicious but nachos was horrible. The server was also rude and kept forgetting about our order."}
{"text":"For a place that supposedly specializes in wings, they serve some pretty thin, skinny stuff. Shoeless Joe's is miles ahead."}
{"text":"I was looking for a really good wings spot so I came here. Wedges were soft and tasted good however could not really eat them cause it was over seasoned and heavy in salt. Wings were ok not good for it to have \"Wings\" in the name of the establishment, but to each its own. sauce ok. Atmosphere was welcoming server was great.   The attraction for this place is good to get a drink with friends if in the area or if you want to try a different random sauces with names like \"Voodoo\" then you will like.   Glass wear wasn't very clean Entrance not easily accessible due to construction."}
{"text":"This review is strictly regarding the nachos. As a culinary student this restaurant screams something is wrong in management.   The nachos were not properly prepared. Now, this may seem like a snobby comment but I am aware nachos are bar food and I do not ask for much. Nacho chips should be of good quality and not look like the no name low grade chips that are not the correct corn chip. The cheese should not be cheddar cheese because cheddar cheese is not a proper melting cheese because of its oil content. Tomatoes should not be diced in giant cubes on top nor should the onions be massacred and cut randomly. Clearly the cook was not trained because the first thing you learn in cooking 101 is how to properly cut.   I feel like there are budget issues. A place that offers so many flavours in wings could at least have decent nachos. These did not even qualify as decent. One of my friends said : ' these are the kind of nachos I made for myself when I'm drunk because I cannot function and I'm hungry'. Ouch. And my friend is not a food snob, he simply wants decent nachos! Also you can tell there are budget issues when you can't even get a personal plate for your nachos and just get the bowl for the wings.    Disappointed."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Wingporium, it was the night before the Canada-Sweden gold medal match. We were rushed to order because they were closing early because they were opening at 7am the next day. The service was sloppy but we thought it was because the game and decided we would try again. We took our wings to go and Loved the interview with a vampire. So the following Friday we returned. Service was absolutely AWFUL! I felt like I didn't exist and had to walk to the bar for a beer while one server chatted and the other got drink at the bar while they both ate potato wedges. The wings and wedges were great EXCEPT for the \"maple\" which is actually just table syrup, the drunk server had no explanation for this. The chatty server told us we needed to cash out so she could catch her subway and the drunk server sat at the bar talking to a customer while we were trying to get a beer. At the end of the day the wings are good but the service really ruins this place. Don't bother coming here!"}
{"text":"Great time! The staff was friendly, dont know what the other poster was talking about.   Food was amazing, wings were big and juicy. Lots of wing flavours for every taste bud, we are pepper heads so to find hot wings that aren't an extract is a treat, we got the voodho sauce, hot but not sour  and we got for dipping the Scorpion sauce ....really xxx hot.  Above the wings I was impressd by there REGULAR  wedges,, they are dusted with roasted garlic and a tangy spice, served with mayo (euro style).    The inside is not that small, patio looks amazing for hot days ahead.   I will go again!   Price was very reasonable and they run specials every day even on weekends!!!"}
{"text":"The best wings ever! You can order all drums!!!! I love the scorpion kiss!! Everything is the best about this place"}
{"text":"Awesome wings! Way better food quality than wild wing at a better price. The Karma Sutra is my favourite flavour! Soo good !"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Average quality wings. Upside lots of tvs and decent pint selection"}
{"text":"The wings aren't the best thing they got going for them. However garlic Parmesan wedges are to die for. It may be the only reason I even go back.    However it was a slight annoyance when the waitress asked for a tip . Let's just say she didn't get one."}
{"text":"Some of my friends are die-hard wing enthusiasts. They're also from Mississauga. So it's a given that they would choose this place to try out for the Raptors game.   First impression... ----- Not too packed for a Friday night, lots of TV screens all around. Perfect for game night. Walking in, we were greeted within seconds by very friendly waitress. The crowd appeared to be mostly 20 to 30 something-year-olds in mid-sized groups. Packed bar. Washrooms were nice and clean.  But guys, please, can we switch over from the strong vinegar-water concoction for wiping tables? Or whatever it is-- the smell is unbearably strong!    Food/Drinks... ----- We tried : Wings: Big Boys Cool Toys (Mild, Honey Gar, Roasted Gar, Blue Cheese) Wings: Taj Mahel (Suicide, Voodoo, Pineapple, Maple) Wings: Dry Tex Mex. Wings: Interview with a Vampire (Hot, Gar Par) Flatbread: The Big E (Grilled chicken, onion, tomato, mesquite sauce)   My favourite was the Big Boys Cool Toys. Sloppy, creamy, fully covered in sauce and delish!   I was expecting the Taj Mahel to be a real kick in the mouth. I am a big chicken (pun intended) when it comes to suicide sauce so I was loathing the minutes to come after I tried this one. I bravely picked one up, only to find out that chef had forgot to slap on the suicide sauce. Phew! BUT, the bravehearts that we were, we decided to ask for the the \"Scorpion Kiss\" sauce on the side to get the full Taj Mahel experience. We used our celery sticks to artfully brush on the sauce where it originally belonged. BAM. There's the kick we came seeking for. Loved it.  The flatbread was more calorie-ridden than first expected. It was far from healthy and drizzled with tons of sauce. Yet, no complaints since it was loaded with chicken and very tasty.   Since it was a Friday, we took advantage of the $3.95 bottled beers.    Service.... ----- Our waitress was very kind. She was very knowledgeable about the wings and had good recommendations. It was busy, but she managed to check up on us fairly regularly over the course of the night.   Walked away thinking.... ----- \"Wish I could take home some of that suicide sauce\"... and \"Darnit Raptors!!\""}
{"text":"When it first opened it was a fresh place to go of a quick tasty bite to eat but over the last year I have found that the quality has gone down for the price of the food. Semi cold beer. To many people who have \"their stools\" at the bar makes it uncomfortable to be not a regular to try and get service much rather go up the street to the competition"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I am truly disappointed.   I love the lemon pepper from Wild Wings, so I've ordered it a few times from Wing Emporium and it's always too salty (as in I can barely eat it - I don't know why I keep forgetting to NOT order it).   I've also had the Gar Par (Garlic Parmesan), Sweet Thai and Horseradish flavoured wings and they consistently disappoint in flavour.   There is always a sign on the front and side doors written in marker/crayon that \"they are looking to hire Experienced waitresses AND Cooks\".   Stay Away from this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Average wings, don't quite understand the hype around this place. Came here a few years ago and it was much better before. Also, the service isn't the greatest. Ordered two pounds and they only brought one. I would only come back if I really had to."}
{"text":"I love its spicy and tasty wings, along with the poutine! The staff are kind and helpful as well. Overall, I typically leave feeling satisfied with its food and customer service."}
{"text":"The only reason why I give this place 4stars is because their \"interview with the vampire\" wings are the best wings I have ever had in my life. There are 88 wings in their menu, and I have tried quite a few, but they don't give me that warm, fuzzy, can't get enough of feeling that I get when I eat the \"interview with the vampire\" . That is all. The place is a nondescript bar, the service is nothing memorable, but those wings, man those wings...... Ahhhh *sigh*"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews BUT this is the first place I've eaten where I couldn't stop myself to write about it... First of all, I'm a die hard fan of hot and juicy wings at anytime of the day!! I've tried pretty much all the different kinds of wings you can imagine from lots of places across town and outside town. I had a local favorite where I used to go all the time until I tried the wings at Wingporium... These are by far the biggest size wings I've tried in a loooong time.. I went with my friend on a weekday afternoon for lunch, and we tried the Mediterranean Dry. All I can say is WOW.. I became fan from the get go.. The wings were super HOT, FRESH and very very JUICY! I would be going back again next week and already building myself up to try their \"Snake Bite\"... I'll update once I try them out..  Couple more things, I really like their wings' naming convention (totally unique and sounds tempting). Also, the atmosphere is very laid back and cozy. Definitely worth checking out!!!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't too bad, but it took so long to actually get it. The place wasn't even very busy the evening I was there - maybe 10 people, most sitting at the bar - but it took close to 40 minutes just to get a sandwich with fries."}
{"text":"The best wings at a wings bar you can get... Ask for them grilled :). I devour the poutine here too... Save this for my cheat meal to indulge and enjoy."}
{"text":"Went to Wingporium in Port Credit for the first time last weekend and it was a great time. The food was kick ass- I had a pound of Spicy all dressed and I shared the WOW wedges with a buddy- the wings were juicy and tasted fresh the wedges come loaded with sour cream, cheese and real bacon, we just loved it. The bartender was great(I think Jen or Jess was her name) she was real nice and very helpful with suggestions, great attitude. After we ate we moved outside to the patio for more drinks. Love the patio here, very chill environment everyone seemed so relaxed it was awesome. we spoke to the guy server for a bit (can't remember his name, sorry) he was funny and nice to all the people outside. The bottles of beer were only 4 bucks so we hung out for a bit and took a few in. Definitely going back soon. I've been to the other location and the foods the same but it's got nothing on the Port Credit location as far as atmosphere. I don't really do reviews but I gotta tell people how great it was."}
{"text":"Long before the Wild Wing phenomenon, this shady looking place was spoken in hush whispers to select few that ventured in search of meat with bones a.k.a wings of a saucier calibre.  so anyway - this is the place that started it all. Seriously. This location has been here since 2005. The bartender/waitress has been working here since the place opened. You can't NOT believe me because the whole bar decor 'spills' it. HA! get it? Anyhoot.  The sign for 88 flavors was more than enough to suffice the gluttonous beast I am inside. On the positive note - they only use Canola Oil. No trans fat - waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa????? Oh ye.   The flow of the entire place isn't constructed strategically. It's the basic blueprint of a bar. 1 long bar , booths along the window and some random tables chairs in middle. There's some postings for wing hot sauce competitions that keep the locals busy. I got a few good material for Alias names here. Apparently the Black Mamba is the most dangerously HAWT sauce of dem all - (Texas sand dune tune)...If I could type it out.. I would...  They have daily specials that aren't really extraordinary but the only one I'd urge you to come for is Monday - All you can eat. Say waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa??.  for $22.99 you can eat all the wings you want. With the purchase of any beverage. Only catch is , everyone at your table has to get the all you can eat special and no doggy bags allowed.   The bathrooms are redone and speak awhole notha language. I don't trust it, but it works.   The menu is one long laminated page with different types of wing sauces. Some scary, some just down right odd, some make me call Dr. Frasier Crane , some make me believe I could been a wing-sauce mixing prefessor...at Harvard.    The service is very local bar ;friendly but nothing too ritzy - which is standard for a wings joint. The wait time was a tad longer than expected but a few beers usually does the trick ;)  A few suggestions that will have you craving Dry Lemon Pepper Mediterranean Dry - ask for dipping sauce with this.  Garlic Parm - do you really have to ask? Horseradish - yip Pineapple Curry - sweet and sour  Taj Mahal - different Hot Hawaiian Honey - sweet but mustardy Cajun Creole Dijon - My favourite. Dry mustard type of sauce with a zing   The bill was all under $40 for 2 which is pretty rad and with the open past 1am , I'll be back.   xoxo M."}
{"text":"My fav wings are interview with a vampire and hot honey Hawaiian. It's one of my fav places for wings ! I would also suggest getting their Poutine here. They don't have fries but they have potatoes wedges instead. Their wings are never frozen and always fresh! They also have an option for grilled wings instead of fried. Both very juicy and flavourful. They have very good deals so check out their website for the menu. Mondays are all you can eat wings for $24.99 with a purchase of a beer. Tuesdays are get a drink and order a pound for $9. Wed is order a drink and get a pound and a half for $12. All day jagger shots for $3.95 ! Thursdays are a pint and a pound for $16.99. I gave them 4 star because the service is a bit slow. It's not as quick as I'd like it to be, but I guess good food takes time to make ! Also you can choose all drums or All winglets too."}
{"text":"Ridiculously long wait times. Have been there with my department 3 or 4 times. Every single time, we have waited for 40 to 60 minutes or more for an order of wings.  The wings are good but do not expect to drop by for lunch unless you want to spend 2 hours or more."}
{"text":"The end unit at 170 Lakeshore Rd. E. in Port Credit has been many things over the years - a bistro, an upscale restaurant, and most recently, Wingporium. Is the third time the charm?  I actually stayed away from this place for a long while because I wasn't sure if it was going to stick around long enough to make an impact, but I eventually went with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  On both occasions I've been there, I've ordered the Cajun Creole wings, which I enjoyed greatly. The prices are fairly reasonable (there's also an AYCE option for just over $20 which seems quite good too, although I haven't tried it yet). I also give them kudos - I attempted a suicide-level hot wings challenge with my friends, and when I couldn't finish the order, they gave me a replacement order of a less-hot wing (the aforementioned Cajun Creole) at no charge.  Wingporium seems like a solid place to go and hang out with friends. I only dock a point because, while I like the design and interior of the restaurant (sans its darkened back area), the patrons are either the usual bar patrons or just really sketchy. Both times I've went, I've had to deal with leering looks from customers and at least one drunk person each time who tried to strike up a conversation with me.  Still, it's a very solid place to go for great wings, and there's a lot to love here. Recommended."}
{"text":"Average wings.  Worst service EVER.  Waited forever.  Got overcharged.  Not going back."}
{"text":"It's something new it's better then wild wings. Wings are great. I love them wet. Good job"}
{"text":"Great wings! Best we've ever had! Lots of meat on them and perfectly lightly breaded (but still crispy). So many flavors to choose from! Tried Spicy Blue Cheese (hot), Interview with the Vampire (hot) and Jalape√±o Rancher (medium). Didn't find that there was enough sauce to make the hot wings as hot as I preferred, but they provided extra hot sauce for free so that solved the problem! Interview with the Vampire was basically a shit ton of freshly pressed garlic and some hot sauce. Good, just not my thing (boyfriend loved them as do all the other reviews). The Jalape√±o Rancher had ranch and fresh jalape√±os on it. A little sweet, but cool when all the different flavors were combined.   I LOVE wings, and this will be our new go-to place because they were great quality, cooked perfectly and not too expensive (especially if you buy more than a few pounds)!"}
{"text":"Great wings and great service. I would have rated this place a 4 but they have really upgraded the interior. The wings are huge, tasty and full of sauce :)  This by far my favourite place in etobicoke and reminds me of Duffs wings."}
{"text":"Portions are ridiculously small. I've been going to this place since we've moved into the area. I use to get 10 wings plus on a single order and the last time I ordered I only received 6?! They've cut down their portion size and have kept the price the same- still expecting to retain existing customers? Let's just say I stopped going to this place. The portions are small for the wings, sauce is not included and the prices are above standard for a fairy average wing joint."}
{"text":"I feel I need to write this review immediately after returning from the worst chicken wing experience I have ever had. Although my service was friendly, it was about the only positive thing about my trip to Wingporium.  It's apparent to me that this establishment uses the wings of very large, very mature capon chickens. The meat to skin/sauce ratio is way too high. We ordered 1 pound of sauced wings and two pounds of plain wings with several sauces on the side. Although the restaurant was not at all busy, it took over 1/2 hour to deliver this order (but mere minutes to deliver our potato wedges and drinks which were all but gone by the time the wings arrived).  When the wings arrived, it was clear to see that they were grossly under cooked, mealy white skin and completely mushy and wet (beyond moist, I mean WET) on the inside. We immediately sent them back for more cooking.  While waiting for them to re-cook, we were eager to try the \"made-in-house\" sauces that were left. Let me make this clear: These sauces are not \"made-in-house\", rather, they're \"mixed-in-house\" as the contents of the little dixie cups left at our table weren't thoroughly mixed and you could see the glob of mustard within the pineapple sauce and the glob of generic maple syrup within the Frank's Red Hot sauce.  Upon return, the skin was now acceptably crispy but the meat inside was so plentiful, it had completely toughened up making only the outer shell of skin edible.  I feel I need to add that I have been a wing fan for all of my adult life and have had wings at tens and tens of locations across Canada and the U.S. These were the worst I've ever had.  I feel ripped of by Wingporium. $60 for 1 order of potato wedges, 1 pepsi, 1 beer and 26 completely inedible wings. There is NO value at all in that and it would take a very strong argument to get me back into this dump."}
{"text":"Last year I was fresh out of school and bought a pound of wings. For 14$ (1 pound) I had 8 decent wings, not battered to hell but nice and juicy chicken. Cajun and spicy gar par.   This year I'm slightly more balling than last year and for 14$ (1 pound) was served 6 wings and a stick of carrot and celery. Interview with vamp(spicy gar par) was very good.   However, with my new job I cannot justify eating here due to the sheer fact that the adjusted increase in inflation rate for my salary/wing ratio does not equal 20% annually.   In a year I expect the wingporium to conduct expansionary wing policy as we head into a global recession so hopefully I will receive an increased supply of 7 wings for my 14$.   Thank you"}
{"text":"After visiting the sister (original) location in Etobicoke to tango with their famed Black Mamba, I wanted to pay this spot a quick visit for some good old fashioned chicken wings and beer!  They did not disappoint! I had a Shocktop Belgian Wheat beer on tap to start and it was uber refreshing (the perfect summer patio beer). I use the term Uber to describe it because in addition to this brew they boast an extensive selection of German beers in both bottles and on tap! In addition they also offer Jagermeister at a significant discount daily!   But why else would you pay them a visit? Wings my dude/dudette.. wings. They've got a ton of flavours and for my money the hotter the better! Give them a shot, and if you dare ask for a side of Black Mamba sauce on the side to kick any flavour up several notches!   Eatcrest back! And out!"}
{"text":"Amazing wings and ribs, with lots of favor to choose from. Personally recommend killer bee, star struck, and atomic Thai! Love how they are hot yet full with flavor!   They potato wages is great too!"}
{"text":"place has great wings, much bigger than other places.  Sauces are good but not a big fan of spotsbars so I get takeaway.  Staff are friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Horrible service - it's like the waitress was more interested in talking to her friends/other servers than taking our order or refilling out waters.  Wings are overly drenched in sauce, and the \"most popular\" flavor isn't hot nor great tasting. Average wing place, wing size is a little small compared to other wing places north on hwy 7, and just an okay place to go to.  Would not return.  Please take note manager."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in the GTA. Usually not a fan of places with too many flavours but the medium, and spicy blue cheese were on point. All the sauces I tried tasted great."}
{"text":"Me and my parents have been coming here for a few months and always loved the food and staff. A month or so ago the 2-3 waitresses we kept seeing and enjoying the services of disappeared, and since then the service has gone down slowly. My last visit we waited around for 5 minutes at the door with no hostess, I had to go to the bar and ask the bartender and who I can only assume was a manager or the owner to have a table cleaned for us and be seated (it was a little busy but nothing unmanageable). We sat around for a good 15 minutes before we got asked for drinks, our food was another good 30+ minute wait after we ordered. 2 tables got their food before we did, and any subsequent orders for more beer or anything were slow or forgotten. The wings too didn't seem right, we usually get really hot wings and the heat was non-existent with this order. I think our waitress was new cause she was very overwhelmed, but trying to do her best. But the way this place was run at our last visit turned us away as return customers. On a side note the men's washroom is ridiculously laid out with the sink directly in the way of the door, on a separate visit a drunk patron kicked the door open and I was washing my hands and my arm got bruised... Terrible building planning tbh."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped by this location while we were in port credit for the evening and decided to try out their wings. Had previously heard good things about it.  We got a couple different flavors, one mildly spicy, and one was extra spicy. The flavor selection was decent, and the quality of the meat was average (I've had better wings, but I've had worse wings as well). The feeling was more or less mutually between all three of us in that the wings here \"average\".  The sit down location wasn't too large, but they did have a patio as well for the warmer days. Due to the fact there is a large selection of flavors, I have given this place an average rating, and if/when I do stop by there again, I will try a new flavor and update the review.  Overall, I would recommend this to a friend, but not as a first option if you're in the mood for wings."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try after reading about it on insauga.com as the #1 place to get wings in Mississauga. I tried two flavours, Interview with a Vampire (spicy garlic parmesan) and Kama Sutra (medium spice + ranch).  I LOVE Interview with a Vampire. I've had spicy gar par at many places before and this is definitely one of my favourites. Kama Sutra was disappointing. The sauce tasted watered down. I also had potato wedges with dill sauce, which was really good. The potato wedges had some seasoning on it that give it some flavour.  The service was great. Food arrived in a timely manner. Our server checked on us periodically (not too much and not too little). The ambiance is exactly what you would expect for a pub. It's not a fine dining environment but it's great for hanging out with some friends and having beer and wings."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian this might seem like a weird place for me to review, but ever since I moved to the area I've been curious to check out Wingporium! It seems to be an area favorite here in Mimico.  Recently I did have a chance to check it out. I was expecting to get onion rings + wing sauce on the side to dip in, but they had run out of onion rings by the time I got there :| I had deep fried pickles + nachos instead. Vegetarians might be taking a small gamble on the availability of the few meat-free dishes, so hopefully running out of onion rings was a fluke that night.  Inside, the restaurant was packed, people were engaged, lively, and happy. Plenty of tables looked like families, but plenty looked like groups of friends as well. The menu (and wing sauce list) was pretty impressive, I feel it would take many visits to explore it all.  Overall my experience was great, even with the lack of onion rings, but I'm definitely going back to give this another shot soon.  If you're looking for a spot to have 'wing-night' as a family, or if you and your friends are looking for a spot to meet I think you'll fit right in here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in over the weekend with some friends to try the place out.  It's definitely the place to go to get wings done they way you want, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're the best.  None of us were overly impressed but we'd certainly stop in again, if just for the poutine.  We practically licked the bowl clean."}
{"text":"This is now my GO-TO-LOCAL-PUB to stuff my face with perfectly fried food and beer!  I swear they must have the best deep fryer in here because their wings and wedges are ALWAYS PERFECTLY FRIED! Trust me when I say something is fried to perfection cuz if it's fried... it's been in my mouth!   \"DAILY SPECIALS?!\" Why yes, Wingporium has some! So, there may be a day in the week you get a FREE 1/2 pound of wings with a purchase of something. And there's no denying that free is pretty awesome!  However, if you're looking for attentive service, it's a hit or miss.  It's not always consistent. But if you're looking for decent wings and wedges and cold beer for a decent price... this is exactly the place you are looking for!"}
{"text":"im rating it a 3/5 not because of the food but because of the venue and crowd.  I had seen this place forever and always wanted to go in so i finally did. I went on a Wednesday around 7pm. it smelt like stale beer and cigarettes. It had around 10 people there all old and wasted. I didnt care too much i went to the back with my friends and ordered. The groups got louder and louder i could barely hear my friends who were infront of me !!   My wings were amazing, i had spicy garlic parm. and it was so flavorful and the wings were huge. there was a special so i got a pound and a half for the price of a pound. would 100% recommend it.  I came back one other time - about 2 weeks later on a saturday because i wanted my boyfriend to try the wings and he had the exact same impression i did. He thought it was more of a restaurant and was super disappointed by how small the dining area was and the smell.. He wanted to leave the second we walked in but i begged him to stay.  The atmosphere really ruins the whole bar. its just a bunch of regulars and a bad buzz."}
{"text":"What was the hype about again?  I've never been so disappointed in a wing bar before.  Why do I have to ask for the basic blue cheese and celery?   Sure, the wings were big but by no means did they wow me at all.  I rather spend the money at wild wings or allstars.    Biggest pet peeve of this place?  No free refills on my pop.  Are you kidding me?  Get with 2k15... 3$ for syrup.   If I was in the area, I rather across the street. Won't know what the hype is but I'd stay away.    Ps.  The staff was amazing though.  Sucks you guys work for a stingy restaurant."}
{"text":"For is a bit over priced for what it is, the wings were good but my ribs didn't have enough sauce on them so they weren't very flavorful. However, our server was support friendly and nice and gave us great service. The atmosphere was just ok and could use some updating. All in all an decent experience."}
{"text":"SURPRISINGLY good wings at a decent price. I ordered the Suicide All Dressed, which were very delicious and pretty hot. The potato wedges were AMAZING, I might go back for those alone!  The service was a little slow and forgetful, but it was a full house with a leafs game on."}
{"text":"Another triumph!   The wings are gigantic and perfectly cooked. I ordered the sizzlin Cajun or something and it was actually quite hot. My friend ordered the French Onion and nom nommed his way through them. As usual, I ordered the wings dry with no breading and sauce on the side. The wings were crispy as hell and juicy and hot on the inside. Absolutely perfect.  Service was a bit on the slow side but the wings more than made up for it. Also, their seasoned wedge fries are incredible.   The place has about a dozen booths and lots of TVs if you're into sports. There's also a patio and free wifi. This is right by my friend's work, so we're likely to visit this place quite often.  And Mondays are all you can eat for $24, which is roughly the cost of 2.5 pounds. I can't eat that many, so we didn't go for that."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to grab a beer and have a fun time with friends. Has a great atmosphere and the wings are delicious."}
{"text":"don't you dare try another wing spot.   crazy good flavours, the wings look like they are on 'roids (in a good way), and workers are always pleasant.   hot and honey BBQ and interview with a vampire are my go-to's."}
{"text":"Wall of Flame!  TBH- not as spicy as i thought it would be. Actually it was quite delicious."}
{"text":"the wings are solid, but the service is very shotty. never had good service and the food is overpriced. The specials make no sense, nor does the way you can order wings. and they make you pay for the wings if you dont finish them at all your can eat. Fountain pop is watered down way too much. not a place i recommend"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday nights night and it was pretty full but was able to find a spot at the bar which is fine because that's normally where I like to sit. Lots of tvs so it's a great place to catch a sports game. The wings are amazing, I had serpen venom which is there suicide sauce mixed with blue cheese, omg it's one of the best wing sauces if not the best I've had in my life, could have been a little hotter for my liking but once I got to the bottom it was more spicy. Very large meaty wings. Great beer selection, The bartender I think he name was Jill was very good even though it appeared she was training people and getting the drinks for a pretty busy bar she was very attentive and had very good knowledge of the different wing flavours which they have so many. It was pound and half wings for the price of a pound, which was my only knock on the place is the wings are pretty big but it seemed more like a pound of wings then a pound and a half cuz I've never still been hungry after eating a pound of wings. But definitely a great place and will go back again. Though it is pretty pricy!"}
{"text":"Found this place randomly on a wander down lakeshore, amazing little spot with tons of tvs, so it's an awesome place to catch a sporting event. Really good beer selection and wing flavour selection. I got the killer bee which is there suicide voodoo sauce mixed with honey garlic. The wings were super tasty and decent size. The bartender was pretty new she had said but she was very good at her job! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing wings! Lots of sauces and rubs to choose from! Service was great! My husband and I also enjoyed the atmosphere for a low key Friday night. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great wings.  Probably the best wings in Vaughan or even in Toronto.   But minimum 5lb order to have multiple flavours is ridiculous.  People just end up ordering 1lb per flavour and pay higher price for them.  Tuesday special isn't great either.  $9 for 1lb of wings with drink order. The waitress said you must order another drink to get the 2nd lb for $9.   Solid 4 - Stars if not those limitations.  Service wasn't that great compare to Buffalo Wild Wings or other similar places."}
{"text":"Great wings but terrible customer service!!  Pros: There are so many different flavour options and the wings are so big and flavourful. I usually order Interview with the Vampire and the Spicy Blue Cheese. The wedges are good too.   Cons: I've been a few times and I can say that they consistently have the worst customer service! The servers seem annoyed when you ask questions about the menu items and often ignore you to talk to the men who are sitting at the bar. Also, they only give one celery stick and one carrot stick per order with no dipping sauce on the side - I wish they gave more veggie sticks.   I think there are better wing places you can go to."}
{"text":"Garlic parmesan wings are delicious. Disappointed no Erdinger on draft."}
{"text":"Ok so im not much of a chicken wing kind of guy.  Not my first choice when going out to eat dinner.  A few of us were together and trying to decide where to go for a Saturday night last minute dinner with out reservations in the heart of Etobicoke.  Out of the 4 of us 3 had decided they wanted wings.  Great I was out numbered.  None the less I yelped the nearest place to get good wings.  Wingporium came up first.  Checked the menu and realized I had more choices and didn't have to get wings.  As soon as I walked into Wingporium it brought back instant memories of when I used to be a frequent at a local sorts bar.  This made me feel at home automatically.  My eyes wondered to other peoples plates and after scanning the menu I realized that the wings didn't look that bad.  Between the 4 of us we ordered 5 lbs of wings (3 flavors).  1 lbs - Dry dusted Cajun 1 lbs honey garlic (then grilled) and 1 lbs BBQ.  On arrival I thought that there were not a large amount of wings and after looking through the plates I realized how large the wings were.  Very meaty.  These had to be one of the best wings ive had.  Meaty, Tasty, well cooked, well coated.  Etobicoke if you haven't come here for wings steer yourselves right to it.  I will be back very soon.  Actually maybe today lmaoo."}
{"text":"With attention grabbing names like Serpent Venom, Dracula's Nightmare, and Voodoo Inferno: Wingporium is definitely worth a visit. Their Scorpion's Kiss comes with a warning: \"is not recommended for anyone pregnant or with heart problems\". There hottest, Black Mamba, is measured at 4 million scoville units (a Jalapeno is between 2.5-5 thousand Scoville units) so yes it's hot.   Waitresses double as hostesses and bartenders so service is lacking but they make up for it in personality (they love chatting up their customers) and knowledge of the menu. Let them know what you like and they'll give recommendations accordingly. If you still can't make up your mind, then ask for a sample of a sauce you're interested in. To get your money's worth, take advantage of their daily specials. Love their options: lightly dusted (makes the wings more crispy), non-dusted for those who like crispy chicken skin, boneless, naked with sauce on the side and sauced and grilled (which gives the wings a smoky flavor).  I had the Dry Cajun and hubby had Bubba's Backfire (Voodoo and All Dressed) with a side of the Black Mamba sauce OUCH! The wings were hot (cooked fresh so there was a little wait), crispy and well seasoned. Will definitely be back to try more of their 88 flavors."}
{"text":"I'm actually really disappointed with wingporium now. I go there often and every time I go it gets worse and worse. I called in for a pound of wings and wedges, I asked for the sour cream dip that they use on the side for the wedges and they no longer had it. ( they used to have cool ranch and got rid of that too) so I asked the girl what dip she had now, she named a few including garlic dill and jalape√±o. When I picked up the order the box had the garlic dill and actual jalape√±os on the side. Did she think jalepenos were a dip? Anyways, the wedges used to be amazing. They used to season them and now they are plain and so crappy. The size of the wings are bigger now (probably some cheaper quality wings) but still nice and saucy. Not going back because of the wedges."}
{"text":"Great wings. It used to be good but it has gone so cheap and so slow. They just reduced the portion by half!! A pound of wings now only have 5? This is ridiculous. This is a good restaurant gone cheap. Well if you are okay with 5 wings for $11. You are in luck coz their wings are good."}
{"text":"Wings are sooo yummy here. Pretty small establishment, beer, wings, sports, 'nough said =)  Haven't explored anything else they might do on their menu, but wings are great =)  Be patient and be expecting that this is a place you'll be going to chill in. Service is a bit slow, so expect it."}
{"text":"If you plan on eating here, stick to the wings. We had a party of 5 and each person ordered something different.  Only the people with the wing orders were satisfied. Stay away from the \"fall off the bone\" ribs....  they dont fall off anything and they are fatty and tough..  Cooked improperly OR a cheap cut of meat.  Cook also made 2 mistakes with our order and totally forgot about our appetizer"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to to grab quick wings and beer. There really aren't places with 100 different types of choices for wing flavours! (Tad bit exaggerated haha) They just hit that munchies urge of fried goodness. It isn't the best place for wings but I go every now and then to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Friendly servers with excellent service. Their potato wedges are pretty damn good. Thin and crispy!  We were a little hesitant to eat here since it's more of a sports bar but it was worth it!  Our waitress was very good with recommendations."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years now whenever I have a craving for an unhealthy amount of chicken wings (which is more often than I'd like to admit). With an abundance of flavours and other items such as burgers and ribs you can't go wrong here if you're craving some unhealthy, meaty goodness. Prices are pretty average however there is no regular all you can eat option but they do have daily deals. Their menu can be found online and they have a couple other locations as well.   The service is almost always fantastic. They're always attentive and very friendly. The food itself is consistently great. The wings itself have an adequate amount of meat and aren't too over/undercooked. The burgers are very filling and certainly give you bang for your buck. There is a lot of parking space and the place itself has good, comfortable seating capacity with a number of TVs you can watch from any seat. It does get pretty busy in here at times and I've had times where I had to wait a good 15 minutes to get seated but in the end, oh boy is it worth it.   Looking forward to stopping by again and again until I cause irreparable damage to my stomach/heart."}
{"text":"I ordered take out...BBQ wings were good no complaints at all. Better than average bar wings. Staff was very polite and fun. Good job overall."}
{"text":"Great wings and friendly service. There are a lot of flavours to choose from and every flavour we tried was really good.  Wing size is that of an actual chicken and not a chick, means you actually get a full drumstick instead of just a stick like some other wing places serve.  We got three flavours: Black mamba - the hottest flavour they have, it is actually very hot but not unbearably hot. Like you can have it with one piece+ sip of something sweet.  Dracula nightmare - best flavour out of the three. Perfect mixture of hot and cheese tasted very good.  Hot and honey - this was to balance out black mambas hotness. It was pretty good but I have better hot and honeys in other places.  Food took normal time to come, server checked on us a few times during our meal and was generally nice. Would definitely recommend this place for a wing night."}
{"text":"Having been to their other location a few times, this branch could use a little improvement.  Was there on Saturday night, the place was just a little busy but they only had one server doing the tables, the other was bartender sometimes taking care of the tables as well. Needless to say that the service was sooooper sloooww.  Two of the three wing flavours we got weren't that hot and and the same flavours are more spicier in their Vaughan location.  Fwiw, the wings and rib we had were still pretty good but if I'm given a choice, I'll probably go to Vaughan."}
{"text":"After reading all the different wing flavors they offered, I was really excited to try this place. The service was good, the staff was nice and it's a classic sports bar feel. They had a decent selection on tap, so my experience came down to the wings themselves.  The wings were massive for what you pay for however the wings were lacking in flavor. the sauces were bland and didn't have much of a stand out taste to them. Some of my wings weren't completely sauced up, and I prefer my wings to be covered in sauce.  I had the buffalo butter which was nice but had no heat to them at all, I was told they had quite a bit of heat to them but was disappointed.  The Cajun wings were just heavily salted, no taste of the cayenne came through.  Overall, the atmosphere was good but this isn't my go to wing place."}
{"text":"Decided to have a late lunch with my girlfriend at Wingporium, last time we came here around dinner time and couldnt get a seat for an hour! Luckily this time around there were a few empty tables in which you seat yourself.  The restaurants decoration is a typical bar with large booths and the crowd is filled with regulars. I decided to order two single pounds of wings; cajun and simply hot. In addition, we also ordered a side of potato wedges as my friend recommended me it was the best thing on the menu! The wedges came first and were super hot, the wedges had a crispy exterior and were perfect wth the dill ranch dip that accompanied it. We had to order an extra dip too!  On to the wing, the wings came out fresh and hot, the cajun had a super strong dry cajun flavour(perfect!) and the hot wings came out saucy. The wings overall were great but didnt blow my mind away, but the greatest part of the experience were the servers! We had attentive service despite the restaurant being almost full and our food arrived very quickly. Ill be coming back when im in the area again."}
{"text":"My favorite wings in Etobicoke. I love the Scorpion Kiss wings. They are very hot but tasty.  I rated this a 4 just because the inside is not as nice as I would like, but the wings are great."}
{"text":"When did wings become so expensive?  1990s?? even really good wings are still 'chicken wings '.  $32 for 3 lbs, that's a lot.    For 2 of us (1 drink, 1 fries, 3lbs) and tip  $57?$#!!!!    For 2 of us (1 drink, 1 fries, 3lbs) and tip  $57?$#!!!!    For 2 of us (1 drink, 1 fries. 3lbs) and tip  $57?$#!!!!    :("}
{"text":"Great wing spot! Friendly and welcoming atmosphere, too. The wings itself are well done and just delicious! Got the Hot All Dressed and did not disappoint! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Wing were very good on taste. Souse was not done right, because jalape√±os was just put on the top, but not mixed or mashed with the other ingredients. If they come with fries will be the best. I still recommend the place. Will different location next time."}
{"text":"Wings are fine, better from most of the places. Other locations-way better then this one. Just look like a fast food- not even a bar. Nice people working there, but service just not right - fun, but not right. One of the girls had a shot with customers on the next table. Not professional at all."}
{"text":"We went out to the good'ol wingporium today for their Monday special which is all you can eat wings. It was my first time coming here and because the weather wasn't bad we opted for a seat on the patio. Upon sitting down I realized that dogs were allowed which I thought was pretty cool. I wished that I had brought my pup along instead of leaving him at home but oh well, next time :) The all you could eat wings were something like 24.99 and required the purchase of a beverage. I am not that big of an eater so I decided I would just get the 1lb and take the rest home but I was informed that everyone at the table had to have the all you can eat special if someone was ordering. This makes sense but I wasn't very happy. I ended up taking one for the team and got the all you can eat so everyone else was able to eat till their hearts content and our waitress was great because after I barely finished the 1lb she let me wrap up the second 1lb which normally isn't allowed. I was really pleased with this as it wasn't a complete waste of my money. The wings were good very saucy but had a lot of flavour - I got the garlic Parmesan. The waitress also let us know that the potato wedges came in a pretty large portion so to of us shared the one portion which worked out nicely. We had a good night with good food :)"}
{"text":"With 88 flavours of wings, you really can't go wrong when you visit wingporium. This is my go-to place to get my wing fix. My favourite flavours are hot and honey, spicy stampede and carribean jerk. I'd also suggest that people try the garlic parmesan fries. While the food is what keeps me coming back to this bar, the staff there are also nice and friendly. A night out here is perfect for a group outing or even a low-key date night. It's a typical pub/bar setting."}
{"text":"We drive by this place everyday and finally decided to give it another try. First time was 2 years ago when we had just moved to Etobicoke and needed to eat. That was the day of the big snow storm so the place was empty and the service and food was so so.  But last night we ventured out and tried it again.   The place was packed and we had to share a large table. Didn't matter to us to us or them.  I ordered Hot wings - Snake bite - and wedges. The wings were meaty and quite tasty. Next time I will kick it up and go for Scorpion Kiss. The wedges were wonderful as well.   My wife decided on the fish and chips and the piece of fish was huge. She couldn't finish it all so I gave it a shot. Yummy.  The people kept coming and at any time there was a line up to get in.  The place is not large but very busy.   We were Wild Wing people before this, but we think we have found our new wing place!"}
{"text":"We just came home from Wingporium. We go here quite often and the service and food just keeps getting worse and worse. The service is horrible. We ordered and Marusia, our server, got my order wrong. She pretty much blamed it on the kitchen staff who was \"in training\". I had to wait 30 mins for a pound of wings. While waiting, she flirted with what we assumed was her boyfriend because by the end of the night she was making out with him. Also, while we were waiting, something happened to her mouth and she was going around the bar asking people if there was blood in her mouth with her hands touching her teeth/mouth. I'm hoping she washed her hands after that because I know that is not sanitary or professional. She gave us our bill saying her shift was ending, yet for another 15-20 mins she was talking to that guy, not paying any attention to her job or her customers. We finally paid and though we wanted to leave a big 0% tip, we we generous in giving her a 5% tip. (on a norm we tip 18-20%, so this was obviously that bad) Even though this is a \"bar\" type restaurant and they can be casual, we still expect service and sanitary, clean service for that matter.  There are many other wing places to go to, so if this is the standard then this business will not maintain customers."}
{"text":"A friend and I saw this on a Mississauga blog site, we decided we wanted more buck for our wings. So we checked it out, it's got a old school type of vibe with the customers. The wings are definitely worth it though, I will say that customer service could be improved but there was only one waitress working the afternoon we went, could just not have been a peak hour so the business saw there was no reason. Extremely friendly both times I've been. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"tried the hot jerk (like me haha) and it was pretty alright.. Wet jerk is always better than dry. CD had Interview with a Vampire which is garpar and something else I forgot but really good too - I may go for it next time.."}
{"text":"I'll keep this nice and short. Best wings i've ever had in my life. Seasoned and crisp to perfection. Pure consistency. Anytime I'm in Mississauga or Toronto, I race over here. I could be in Vancouver and id still find a way to come here. The honey garlic wings and seasoned potato wedges are to die for. The atmosphere is amazing as well (i've been there in the afternoon and in the evening). Very friendly and attentive waiters. One day im going to try the black mamba wings lol."}
{"text":"In on business and traffic was terrible.. looked up local food joints and saw this place.. has a st. Louis  wings vibe but way better wings.  Can't remember the exact name of the sause i had but it was rated suicide and had garlic parm in it. It was that hot so I got a side of scorpion something sause.. fuking eh!  If you are looking for great wings but ok it's not classy, this is the spot! I'll definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Great staff. Wings are really good. Good for family, friends or just take a beer. Even open to change channel for a specific events"}
{"text":"You want wings from Wingporium? You are better off going to the other location on Lakeshore, a few minutes drive away. These did not taste as fresh as the ones they serve at the Lakeshore location. Additionally, the place looks like a dive.   Regardless, I'll give it a 3 star because:  1. I've heard good things and I am literally basing my review off of one experience (which might have been a bad day)  2. They do have 88 odd flavors. Which is quite impressive."}
{"text":"Big Boys Cool Toys. Order that if you like a mix of slippery flavors. Sometimes, the chef gets it right... but I've been here once when the chef made it too dry. No worries. Just ask them nicely, and they'll take it back and sauce it up for you! My boyfriend loves All-Dressed, so there's another recommendation for ya. We don't eat spicy, but if you do, go right in for Suicide. I hear they are pretty damn suicidal.   Famous for it's Etobicoke location, comparitvely, this one's much smaller; located on Lakeshore, close to Port Credit. They have some good Tuesday and Wednesday specials; but I am not sure of how crowded it gets, having been there only on weekends. Sizable wings. Many flavors to choose from. I hear the wedges are to die for. Don't get the vegetable side - $5 for celery and carrots.   That's about all the advice I have, folks. Go in for the wings... they have other stuff on the menu that remains untried (by me atleast)."}
{"text":"Came here with my gf last night after checking the reviews for a couple of places and it didn't disappoint. I forgot the name of our server, but she was friendly and attentive.  We came on Thursday when they have their pint and pound of wings option, great deal. We both ordered that with hot wings and the honey garlic wings with ranch and jalapeno peppers. We got them unbreaded and they tasted great. We also ordered the large greek salad to share and it was actually large. Tasted great as well.  We're actually contemplating going back there tomorrow night. Looking forward to trying their other wing flavours."}
{"text":"A very decent wing place in Mississauga - hallelujah! I love wings, and I love nothing more than discovering the best spots for flavourful, crispy, delicious wings with a good portion size, variety to the wing menu (doesn't it make your heart skip a beat, reading the plethora of wing options, and contemplating getting them ALLL?), good amount of TVs to watch a game, and great service. All in all, this place is it.   Located just east of Hurontario and Lakeshore Road E, this place was busy on a Friday night we visited, but we were able to grab a table by the bar. We were greeted right away, informed of the specials, and given suggestions on wing flavours to order. The crowd was a mix of families, students, groups of friends, and some older gentlemen. The space isn't so big that it feels like Real Sports Bar - it's small enough that it feels semi-intimate, but big enough that it doesn't feel crowded.  We ordered two pounds of wings ($12.00 for one pound, or $22.00 for two pounds) - the Dry Tex Mex (crispy and tasty) and the Sweet Chili  (they didn't hold back on the sauce!). We also got an order of Onion Rings, and they were crispy and breaded well.  Overall, a delicious and satisfying meal in a bar with a very relaxed, casual atmosphere. We would definitely come back again. Plus, their staff is great. For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $39.00."}
{"text":"Great time in this joint. The place had tv on all locations and ample parking for everybody. We were seated rather quickly despite having a big group.  The menu had tons of flavour for wings, but opted for my favourite \"Dry Cajun\". It was not a disappointment either! It was huge pieces and so flavourful.  The prices were similar to competition. So nothing to brag about that in that area. But the service was great, quick and kind.  I'll definitely be back and try the other flavours.  The one downfall in this place was there was a customer that taunted us coming out. Drunk customer and was rude to others. I'm not sure if this happens everyday but I feel establishment like these should be able to limit a person drink depending on the customer state of mind. It's their responsibility for everyone safety."}
{"text":"Wingporium has the best wings and a large variety to chose from. It's not a crazy bar scene, just a great place to go with a few friends and enjoy some beers and wings."}
{"text":"We've ordered from Wingporium quite a few times over the years and it's always consistently good.  The wings are never raw(ish) like some chains but 100% crisp, cooked through and fresh tasting.  The suicide wings such as \"Serpent Venom\", \"Scorpion Kiss\" and \"Dracula's Nightmare\" seriously deliver on the heat and flavor.  If you decide to eat-in, it's a lot smaller than it looks from the outside - typical sports bar with wooden booths and a long bar.  Service is pretty good too; never experienced any rude servers or rude people answering the phone.  A couple of complaints (hopefully the owner/manager reads this): it's a bit of a turn-off to be charged $0.50 extra or so for a little bit blue cheese or ranch dip. We once ordered $100 worth of wings for a party and were still charged extra for dips. It's lost one full star from me because of that type of nickle-and-diming. It's dip (salad dressing), not truffle oil!  Also, I wish it offered something like $0.45 wing nights but, all in all, quite good."}
{"text":"Wings! Wings! Wings! Of course if anybody would want wings, they'd come to Wingporium! The name itself just screams wings! A great place to come watch the World Cup with the flat screens that they have here! A pound of wings and a pint of beer and you're off to go!   I started off with a fresh caeser salad, great portion btw. When we ordered our chicken wings, we knew why they are called wingporium. The lemon pepper wings we ordered were huge, with also a huge taste to go with them. You can tell they are fresh and oh so good. We also got potato wedges, they were tasty and had a chilli seasoning on them and also came with a dip to go with them. By the time we got our bill, the prices seemed very reasonable with the portions you are getting. Its a great value.   They also have a patio outside with a huge flat screen so you can also catch the games there too and also some sun!"}
{"text":"Sunday Movie Date Night for the 6 of us and we had to chow down before watching \"22 Jump Street\" at Queensway Cinemas.  This is my best friend Mark's go-to wing place.  It's close to the theatres and his house.  Oh yea, and the wings are delicious.    No reservations needed.  Dominika was our waitress and took care of us during our visit.  She had a nice smile and was pleasant when serving us.  I have been to this place a couple of times in the past but THIS time, I am a Yelper Elite so I gotta make sure I do it justice.  I ordered the 1 pound Spicy Horseradish for 10 bones... haha!  Get it?  10 bones?  I know, lame!  There are so many flavours to choose from but I stick to what worked.  When the wings came, I couldn't wait, down the hatch they went.  This flavour is not too spicy and it had a mild horseradish kick which I loved.  The wings itself are not too thin and not too thick, but just right.  There was extra sauce at the bottom of the plate so I dip the wing for more!    Most definitely try this place out if you're in the area.  Better than St Louis in my opinion.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped off on the way home from work and got two pounds of take out wings,  dry garlic garlic and spicy all dressed. It was my first time here and was happy but a bit skeptical that the order was ready in less than ten minutes. Tried a garlic wing on the drive home to check it's freshness and ended up finishing the pound before I even got home! Delicious! Loses a star only because the spicy all dressed weren't very spicy and they gave no dipping sauce (ranch or blue cheese). All dressed were also kind of soggy but that may have been because of how long they sat for.  Recommend sticking to dry wings for takeout! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food was great. This place specializes in wings, they have 88 flavors and the wings are huge. I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town. Dracula's nightmare is my favourite... Wings take a little long but worth the wait ... This place sets the bar ..."}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed wing addict and expert I frequent many wing joints around the city.  Overall I rate the wings at this place as the best around......although I would welcome a debate from other wing officienados on this subject.  The problem is the service.  There are a couple of girls that work the bar who are friendly and efficient, and know what bar tending is all about.  The rest are barely of age, slow as nails, and seem to have no bartending or service experience at all.  I understand the concept of hiring a young, hot bartender to attract customers but they need to be able to handle the needs of more than 3 customers at a time. On top of this, they don't open till noon.....complicated by the fact they usually open later than that because the waitresses are not ready in time.  It is not uncommon to have to wait outside 10 or 15 minutes while someone slowly takes the barstools down from the tables and preps the bar.  Honestly though ...... with the right staff and better lunch hours this place has 5 star potential and the crowd is good.  The trick for now is learning what day and time to go..."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 came here for a night out. It was busy so we sat on the patio. A tad rainy and we were told if a table opened up inside we would be moved, but we weren't. We had the burger, a poutine and wings. Guys, your gravy is horrible! It's sweet and curry like, it has to change. The poutine sat there. The burger was good and so were the wedges and dill sauce. The wings were ok :( I was really disappointed. They were fatty and had a weird meaty taste. We had 4 and that was it. I don't think we will come back."}
{"text":"Although I enjoy their wings the service at this place is atrocious!! I have been here too many times to count and gotten less then friendly service from some miserable server and the wings are not cheap especially considering ALL your getting is wings... no fries or even dip to go with the stick of carrot and celery you get with your order.. nothing but wings. They also force you to pay more for seperate flavors and again when you consider what your getting and who your getting it from it really is NOT worth it.  Once again I went back today cause there really is no substitute if you want a variety of wing flavors, ordered ahead to sit and watch  my food get cold as I stood there while 3 servers wandered aimlessly by me. Then after paying for my cold food I literally had to ask for it after the server finally handed me my receipt... I get home and find that the honey BBQ sauce I ordered is indeed Honey GARLIC. Perfect.  This will be the last time I bother with this ridiculous place, considering the prices and steady stream of new and horrible servers I will take my business else where even if it means settling for less options"}
{"text":"These wings were awesome! Really big, fried just right with a great buffalo sauce to boot! The veggie Quesadilla was just as good. The food was hot & the beer was cold. What more can you ask for outta life!?"}
{"text":"Hi my name is Sue and I am a wing addict! I will travel all over the city (or the world) to sample great wings and unique flavours. So when this place opened up down the street you might have heard my \"hoot n hollar\" of joy.  Like most places half the menu is dedicated to wings and sauces - a strong selection of dry rubs, mild, medium, hot, etc... Im not the \"hot\" girl so will trust the next reviewer but we did a decent amount of damage in the dry, mild and medium categories. My favorite on this visit was Karma Sutra - a mix of medium and ranch. A close second was the \"Ride Sally Ride\" - a mix of creole and honey mustard,  The honey garlic was drowning in sauce - but they had just the right balance of garlic (usually most places go too light on the garlic for our taste).   They have a great selection of potato wedges - spiced, plain, topped with stuff.... and they come in a giant basket. No skimping on portion sized here.  However they do charge extra for all dipping sauces ($.50) .  I was super impressed that their chicken comes from right here in Ontario and all their sauces are made in-house.  I fully support local food and farmers (and like to know there are no surprises in my food) so this won them an extra star in my books.  The menu boasts a ton of other food (giant beef ribs with choice of many sauces, pulled pork etc) but I will have to report on those at a future visit.  We were stuffed!  This place used to be the Rude Native so anyone familiar with that place will know they have a great side patio (with heaters - not that we need it right now) and a well stocked bar. Jaeger fans will love the machine at the end of the bar.  Parking in the strip mall is a problem so park on the side street and save yourself the hassle.  The servers are super nice - if still a bit new - they mentioned they are all eating their way through the menu to be able to talk about the different sauces - but havent quite made it yet.  Is it the best wing place I have ever visited? No Will it most likely become my \"go to \" place? Yup!"}
{"text":"My favourite wing place. Good specials. Rarely too busy to get a seat. Service is friendly and great. And the food is top-notch bar-type too."}
{"text":"Decent wing place with decent daily specials.  Wednesdays is Buy a Drink, Get 1.5lbs of wings for the price of 1lb = $10.  Since this was my first visit, I had to order the wings!  Some kinda Spicy Honey (saucy) was really good, followed by Spicy Senorita, then Spicy Lemon Pepper was last.  Flavours were good.  Patio is nice, sorta away from the traffic, but it did get quite smokey, with everyone surrounding us smoking.  Interior:  A bit dark.  I think since beer was cheaper before 5pm, it attracted all the old drunks in the area to congregate at the bar.  The young drunks were out on the patio.  Although waitress was sweet, we did wait a bit for her to finish her convo, with another patron, about tattoos, before she came over to take our order.  We were absolutely STARVING!  She was probably also inexperienced since she asked if we were ok like 5Xs during our wings."}
{"text":"I've been here thrice, and have had great wings and great service all times! The servers are quick, and all hot too! ;) Lots of TVs and lots of specials make this place a wingading winner!"}
{"text":"Wings here are the best and that would be the only reason Id go back.  Its unfortunate the staff is unfriendly.  I've been to this location twice and both times the staff were not friendly at all.  My first visit the waitress was even sitting at the bar drinking a glass of wine between serving customers.  My second experience the waitress came over and there was no greeting or introduction....her first words to our table were \"have you decided what you want?\""}
{"text":"As the name suggests, you come here for amazing wings. No lie. They're really good! Every time I come here I grab the Sweet and Spicy Blue Cheese wings and wedges which standard come covered in this flavorful Cajun seasoning. For those chasing hot wings, I definitely recommend you come try the Black Mamba Challenge. If you finish the pound you end up on the wall of flame and trust me, to anyone who has ever tried the black mamba sauce knows this is a big feat. The setup of this place makes it great for almost any sports event I can think of. Service is fast and friendly, and every time I come here I always leave satisfied. Definitely recommend to anyone hunting for exceptional wings!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but god was the service awful. We got a server who acted like she wanted us dead the entire time. My order came out wrong (Ordered 1.5 pounds and only got 1) and I was promptly ignored while trying to get her attention. She seemed to be more interested talking to some guy at the front, so I walked up and explained the situation to her. Before I had time to finish my sentence, she told me \"that's just how they are\". I explained myself again, and she reluctantly walked back into the kitchen to fix the order. The rest of the night was the same, was pretty much ignored, no refills, no service until I had to walk over again and get the bill.   Good food, but probably some of the worst service I've had at any place."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place once a week with my work buddies, and since i happen to live just down the street it's a frequent stop.  It's a good place to grab wings, i find it much better that Wild Wing (which has now opened just down the queenway from this place).  Over the last 6 months or so they must have changed their chef, as all the wings seem to be a little less spicy.  What used to be suicide now just seems hot, hot seems like medium, etc. etc.  I have a particular fondness for the Atomic Thai, Spicy Lemon Pepper, and Spicy Blue Cheese... but rarely have I found a type of wing on the menu that i didn't like.  For those of you that wish to test your limits and go above \"suicide\", they offer two selections Scorpion Kiss and Black Mamba.  I have tried Scorpion Kiss and the jump from suicide to scorpion kiss is ridiculous.  They are so hot they are not fun to eat, and have little to no flavour unless you count \"burning\" as a flavour.  I've had a couple of my friends try Black Mamba, and they only got through about 4 wings and said they couldn't taste anything the next day... so i don't recommend it.  As stated in many of the reviews below, the wedges with the dill sauce are great!  \"DILLicious\" even... but other than that i don't reccomend straying away on the menu from anything aside from wings + wedges.  I've tried the nachos, they're awful... lotsa chips, little toppings.  Service can be slow, for some reason i find the less busy they are the slower the service is... strange.  They also have nightly specials for wings + beer, which are pretty good.  Overall if you have a hankering for wings, this is one of Etobicoke's best spots."}
{"text":"Place is close to my work so ordered a lb each of the Black Mamba and their Spicy Sicilian dry wings for takeout.  One of the servers was eating her sandwich standing up behind the bar when she greeted me. She mumbles wings aren't ready yet when I said I'm there to pickup. But food was being packed and came out within a few seconds, well within their mentioned timeframe. Happy.   Bag felt really light, paid $27.xx and left hoping for the best.  Their saucy Mamba had maybe 1 tablespoon worth of sauce. I had read it was one of their top spicy offerings. My order definitely wasn't due the lack of proper dressing.   The spicy dry rub was decent and crispy.  But it left hints of sweetness every bite, and by the time I finished the whole 6pcs order, I was pretty sure they put sugar instead of salt.   So the 2lbs was 10 or 11 average size wings and 1 strip of carrot and celery per order. No dip or sauce extra.  A few other places open similar hours within this store radius. Will give the others a try next time.   Thanks Yelp ."}
{"text":"This place deserves to be at the top of the list among all wing places in Sauga!  Had a very good experience. Went on a Wednesday night. We were seated right away, and our server was really nice, and didnt forget to check up on us from time to time despite a quite busy night.  ALL of the wings that we ordered were VERY VERY flavourful! If you want no sauce on wings, I recommend getting FRENCH ONION.  And if you do want sauce on your wings, I suggest - GARLIC PARM, or ALL DRESSED.   They have different promotions for each day. Vibe in the place is great. Not so quiet, but not so loud as well. Just absolutely the best Wingpo experience!"}
{"text":"After the movies we were looking for a quick bite. There was a wild wing beside the theater but we opted to try a new place and since I'm a reg at planet organic i remembered this place next door . we decided to order over the phone and head home to eat. We ordered 2lbs of wings (honey bbq and garlic Parmesan ) w a poutine to share.  The wings were pretty big, bigger than any wing place I frequent. You get a fair amount but I think more at wild wings cause they're smaller. The honey bbq ones had a better flavor for sure. thoroughly cooked and great sauce. I didn't really like the garlic parm, that is the flavor i usually order when i get wings but for some reason I wasn't feeling these. They had no taste besides all the parm on the outside, were quite dry as well. Poutine was great made w potatoes wedges instead of french fries, quite salty but i mean its a poutine so i def enjoyed that. Over all 3/5 , I'll probably be back to dine in."}
{"text":"There was a time when wingporium was good and when 1LB of wings meant you were getting 9 or 10. At my recent visit to wingporium 1LB of wings means 7 wings... I repeat 7 wings!! Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend last night. This is a great little spot for those who appreciate wings.   Quality of wings -- 5 Stars  -- they say right on their menu that wings are never frozen and are all from local Ontario farmers. I 100% believe them, as far as wing quality this is the best I've ever had in Ontario.   Pricing -- 3 Stars This is one of those wing places that likes to nickle and dime for everything you get, 75 cents for a cup of a blue cheese, $8 for a basket of wedges (delicious btw), but still a little bit steep paying over $50 for wings beer and fries for 2."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Wingporium for a few years now and all I can say is that I'm a sucka for stores or restaurants that end with 'porium'.  It's a low key pub with wings being the main attraction.  I've only ever tried the wings here...why anyone would order a salad at a wing place is beyond me.  My go to flavor is the Dry Tex Mex but the Mesquite BBQ, Sweet Chilli, and Hot Hawaiian Honey being good choices as well.  A pound of wings will run $8.99 but there are usually specials on Tuedays ($6.50 for a pound with a purchase of a drink) and Wednesdays (pound and a half for the price of one pound with a purchase of a drink).  We usually get the potato wedges as a side ($5.50).  Draft choices are generic - Blue, Bud Light, 50, Stella, Keiths, Hoegaarden and new addition Rolling Rock  Pints are priced between $6-$8.  Service is friendly and efficient, even on hockey/baseball/soccer/basketball nights when the place is packed."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a few friends and I must say I was highly disappointed.   Our server was extremely unfriendly and had no motive to give us good customer service. She was more concerned about the people at the bar and whoever else that ordered alcohol.   I checked the online menu beforehand to see if there was a Tuesday deal and there was. $7.00 pound of wings with the purchase of a beverage. When we went in to order, the menu said $8.00 with a purchase of a beverage. At that point I should have walked out. I mean, it's only a buck but if they can't keep their website up to date then i can't expect much from them.   We ordered our wings and drinks. My boyfriend didn't get his drink until after the food was brought out, and they charge $2.75 for a soft drink. I would be fine with that, however there are no free refills.   The wings themselves were okay. They were big and well cooked. However they were very cheap on veggies and didn't even offer a dip.   When the bill came back we saw it was $27.00. Which isn't bad for a beer a pop and two pounds of wings. But I looked at my boyfriend and automatically said, well considering we could have gotten 3 pounds of wings, two refillable soft drinks, two orders of fries, a generous amount of veggies and a dip for $35.00 I would have rathered gone there. And I should have and so should you.   Terrible service and not a place I'll ever visit again. Spend the extra couple of bucks and go to wild wing or St Louis."}
{"text":"Craving some wings and wanted to try something new! Now hereeeee weee goooo!!!   It's beside a closed down gas station and walked inside was the same feeling of any sports bar... got to sit down anywhere we wanted and its $12 a pound and $22 for 2 pounds which isn't bad... I got the Karma Sutra (medium + ranch) wings were HUGE! Compared to anywhere else but the sauce wasn't saucy at all so it wasn't as messy as I thought I was going to be... you can probably where a white shirt since it's not saucy (bad joke)   The waitress was nice, she made sure she took care of us and we were well taken care of. The wings didn't come with a sauce which was different lol. In my honest opinion I like my wings saucy and found it really odd the wings were that huge lol made me feel like they were some giant ass chickens  Would I comeback? Probably not.   Ps the table felt dirty and tried to clean it but still felt dirty"}
{"text":"We usually go to the place in port credit but this one was closer to where we were at the time and we never been. The place is much nicer then the other much more modern. We got our usual vampire and spicy all dressed both were good but seems the other place was saucier. But still good, the girls here are much more chatty and friendly. We got Stella's for 7 which I think is a great deal don't think the other place had them. They also had some new things in there menu not sure if the other incorporated them or not. I've tried a lot of flavors these are the best."}
{"text":"I love this place, the wings may be the best i've ever had. They have 89 flavours to choose from and i've tried 6 of them so far. All great! The only down fall really is that the wait time for food is crazy expect 35min at least waiting for food, but it is great when you finally get it."}
{"text":"Your average neighbourhood pub with an extensive wing selection.  I've been here a few times and have enjoyed the many wing sauce flavours. There aren't many beers to choose from and the last time I ordered onion rings, they were swimming in fryer oil."}
{"text":"Amazing wings but slow service. This doesn't deter me as if I want really good wings this is the place to go!!!! Also great are the interview with the vampire potato wedges.   A good place to watch the game and they often have specials during the game as well. A great place to come with a small group of friends."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went this afternoon to get some wings, and more importantly to watch the Packers game. The service was good and they were kind enough to put our game on two of the TVs. I was excited to try wingporium because I love chicken wings and the reviews I read were very positive. I ordered 2 lbs of medium wings with a pitcher of beer, and my girlfriend got the chicken fingers in honey garlic, and wedges. The fingers and wedges were quite tasty. My wings were very middle of the road. I have an admittedly high standards for wings.  I would go back."}
{"text":"*DISREGARD ALL NEGITIVE COMMENTS*   Absolutely love this place. At first when I walked in, there were not many people other than some old  folks having some beer, they seemed to be regular customers. There was this distinctive smell that bothered me.    I took a seat and was given the menu card.  I was craving for wings so I ordered one pound of wings for 12$. I was advised that there are 7 pieces of wings per pound. I was a bit disappointed that only 7 pieces came with it. The waiter told me the wings were large but I wasn't satisfied. I ordered the Mamba flavor (the spicy-est one).   My order came and I truly was astonished by the size of the wings they literally were 3 times larger than the wings given at \"WILD WINGS\" & \"ALL STAR WINGS\".  The wings were extreme fresh well cooked and VERY VERY VERY SPICY!!  The food do not come with the wings so I ordered the garlic dill.  The carrot and celery bites were enormous.  The experience was awesome! I'm defiantly coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Lately it seems like they have been cutting back on the amount of wings you get in one pound. Before we would get 10 wings now we are lucky to get 7!  The only good time to go is all the can you eat Monday or the pound and half for the price of pound."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place after a few of our other friends recommend it. Initial reaction to this place is it's SMALL. Granted we went on a Saturday on which there was a football game, but the size is still tiny. Unlike our expectations, this place is more of a bar than a wing joint. Expect other patrons (especially during a game night) to be loud and obnoxious. Not a great place for kids due to others' profanity. Moving on, the wings are excellent great flavour, and there is plenty of choice with 88 wing flavours; really hot for those who like it, and the milder ones are full of flavour. For the DD, pop is charged by the cup (not refillable). All in all, food was great. Atmosphere is a little loud to have your own conversation. I'd gladly come back, but not on a game day."}
{"text":"It's sort of out of the way for me but sometimes it's worth it to come down and try some of the many flavours of wings. I like that parmasan sprinkled wings I cant remember the name now. The wings are a good size not small and not juiced up on steriods either. the prices are reasonable but not dirt cheap. i wish it was in a better location though i would be here more often."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely not the last. The wings are crispy and saucy. I got the sweet chili and loved it. The portions seem smaller, but I think it's the baskets they come in. Each pound comes with a celery and carrot stick - no dipping sauce. We also got the deep fried pickles and the poutine wedges. I really enjoyed the poutine wedges - I find that certain gravies don't do well for poutine, but theirs is perfect."}
{"text":"First off.. the service was bad, not horrible, just bad. Kind but far from attentive. I got my coke within 12 minutes. I got hot honey Bbq wing, pulled pork sandwich and sweet potatoe fries. The celery and carrots didn't have its own dipping sauce (odd). Wings were decent but I had better.. I would come back for the wings though, they aren't that bad they are decent as stated and comes saucy, exactly how I love them. I barely had any Bbq sauce on the pulled pork sandwich and I had to ask for more on the side. The sweet potatoe fries were ok, but burnt. I had to go up to the cashier to ask for the bill and again.. just like my drink, we got the bill within 10 minutes of asking for it. They need to step up and add burgers to the menu. What wings joint  doesn't have burgers? I don't know if I recommend them or not, your decision to make but I wouldn't go out of my way. If I were around the area and I was craving wings, maybe I'd stop by and that's a maybe. The End."}
{"text":"Best wings certainly in Port Credit, and I'd venture to say all of Mississauga. Every flavor you could imagine, which is nice... But, more importantly the wings are huge and always done perfectly.  The other food items are always well done, the service is friendly and unpretentious, and while it can get a bit chaotic when busy, the atmosphere is relaxed and fun."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night a little after work with a friend. The sign said seat yourself, so we found a spot and they immediately came by with menus. They were fairly busy, but service was super!   Wingporium has specials everyday, so you should take advantage of it! Wednesday's special was a pound and a half for $12 with a beverage purchase.   My friend and I both ordered a Wednesday's special. I got the dry garlic garlic and my friend got the interview with a vampire (spicy garlic parm). The taste compared to the other wingporium located on lakeshore lacked a bit. The dry garlic garlic was garlicy, but it could use a bit more taste! As per the spicy garlic parm, it was not saucy enough, it was very dry, with a hint of parm cheese and franks hot sauce, not much of the garlic - needed more sauce!!!   Other than the lack of sauciness, it was good!"}
{"text":"Loved the wings. They have daily specials which is awesome! A bit of a wait for the food, but it's totally worth it. The wings are cooked to order, aka, very fresh.  We ordered the garlic garlic (dry rub), if you love garlic, this would be an awesome choice. We also got the sweetheart, which was a mixture of plum and Thai sauce. Mildly spicy, it was great. The wings were HUGE (you'll see in my pictures).  Service was great, checked up on us a lot :)  Will come back if I'm ever at the area!"}
{"text":"Spicy spicy wings, you can't go wrong!   Medium is ok but hot and suicide is where you wanna go if you are craving the heat!  The wings are fresh and sauce is made when you order so there is no chance of being served stale wings. The place is always busy but the service is  excellent.  Even if you show up at 10 pm on a Friday you will get some awesome food !  Be  prepared to be impressed!"}
{"text":"If the entire night didn't have slow service I would've given at least 4 stars.   We decided to try a new wing place after frequenting many wing places before. The reviews were pretty good so we passed on All Star wings which is right by where we live. We had dinner there last Friday night and it wasn't busy when we arrived. We got a table at the front and our server was friendly and service started well. We ordered potato wedges and a pound of wings for each of us.  The potato wedges were really good! I would highly recommend them. We waited at least 20 minute until our wings arrived. The pound of wings only had about 8 wings. We weren't full after finishing them. Waiting for our server to get the bill was even longer. He never came so I had to ask another server for the bill. This was when he finally came by to give our bill. From start to finish we were waiting more than eating at Wingporium. We won't be returning after waiting for so long. There are many more closer wing joints that are closer to us."}
{"text":"best wing joint in toronto  home of the black mamba wings  the hottest wings in toronto...it legit makes people cry... the servers are an awesome bunch of people.  the other food is great as well"}
