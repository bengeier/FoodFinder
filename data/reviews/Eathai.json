{"text":"Attentive and friendly service from beginning to end. Ordered the fresh rolls (vegetarian), basil beef with fried egg, and pad kee mao (aka drunken noodles). The fresh rolls were a mix of veggies and mango served with tamarind and peanut dipping sauces. Not exceptional, but decent. The pad kee mao was quite good - slight hit of spice without being overwhelming, and the noodles weren't overly oily as other reviewers are complaining (maybe that's a pad thai problem?). The basil beef with egg was amazing. Not as spicy as it would have been in Thailand (most Canadians are spice wimps so I don't blame them for toning it down, although you can request spicier or mild) but excellent and authentic flavor. The egg was also a highlight - fried to airy crispiness on the edges but still with a runny yolk to break over the rice.  Portion sizes were just right, the prices were very reasonable (at the low end for Toronto Thai restaurants), and there's a discount for paying with cash. Glad to have another good Thai restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav new Thai restaurant in my neighbourhood. This place is legit authentic and its true no MSG  and not oily Asian food which is hard to come across. I am very picky with Asian food as I am myself from that region of ancestry. Bon appetite people!!  Plus very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was going to give this a 1 star review, but upped it to 2 for the service. First of all, most of the photos posted are by the restaurant and professionally taken. The food does not look like that. We were told that the Eathai Pad Thai was no longer available although it was highly recommended. The fresh rolls look nothing like the pictures - instead was \"dull\" containing ALOT of iceberg lettuce! No flavour. The staff however was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"So happy. Authentic Thai? Yep!  Finally, a real PadThai! I'd almost forgotten how it tasted. With a beautiful tamarind sauce with hints of lemongrass, fresh bean sprouts and a perfectly cooked egg wrap, what more could a man want?  I ordered the Thai iced tea and it was delicious.  The service was excellent and the place was clean and well decorated.   ** UPDATE: ordered the holy basil chicken and the cashew nut sauce and I was blown away. The absolute best Thai restaurant in Toronto hands down. Order anything, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered Pad Thai and Green curry. I love it ! I've been to Thailand and the taste is very close. My son love the calamari. Nice service and  atmosphere. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I'd eaten here, or eaten thai food at all and I had a craving to satisfy.  First disappointment: they don't offer papaya salad any longer. I order mango salad, shrimp pad thai, and mango with sticky rice for dessert. Mango salad was nice, just underripe enough to add texture, but still sweet, and the dressing was tasty. The pad thai was very disappointing considering my last experience with it: no more egg wrap thing, noodles were a little overcooked (they broke down to tiny noodle shreds), and the shrimp were pretty close to flavourless. All in all, the pad thai was rather bland.  The mango with the sticky rice is the same level of ripeness as the mango in the salad, and the sticky rice is just a little dry even with the coconut sauce.   All said, not sure that I will bother going back. Makes me sad that this place went from stellar to mediocre so quickly."}
{"text":"I was ordered Pad Thai chicken and Tom yum soup with shrimp. Awesome authentic food :) really like it. I would be back for sure. Nice atmosphere and pretty nice servers."}
{"text":"Had their takeout for the third time today--again surpassed our expectations. Most courteous service ever and the dishes were clearly prepared and packaged with care. Don't stick exclusively to the Thai-- the beef and Chinese broccoli was to die for. And the calamari appetizer is a must for the price."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices. The staff are always great. Neat little game when you ask for the bill and your paying cash. You can get up to 15% off.. Love this spot"}
{"text":"Very good pad Thai.  Friendly service.   Must try more of their food.  Glad to have them in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Same friendly faces from \"Thai To Go\" on Gerrard in Regent Park (now closed, staff are at this location, same owner). Same good Pad Thai.  A little bit out of the way but I can see myself coming here when I'm in the mood for the best Pad Thai I have had in the city to date.  I did try the green curry, wasn't impressed. I stick to the Pad Thai.  I have not tried any other dishes."}
{"text":"Had dinner last evening there and it was superb!  The service was great as well as the meal.  We ordered the appetizer platter that was on special and the spring rolls were AMAZING!  My husband and I ordered the red and green curry!  All we can say is wow!  I hope they stick around a while because we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Terrible food. I ordered pad Thai and holy basil chicken, and it was the most tasteless food I ever had. I'll never be going back there again. Awful!"}
{"text":"A small and cozy place with great food and pleasant service. I ordered the combo special cashew chicken with mango salad and a very delish veggie spring roll for  $8.00, it was well worth it. It was not hot and spicy which was great since I'm not into overly spicy food. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"One star for the phone order service (courteous) and one for the delivery (prompt).  IMHO, Pad Thai is the indicator of what one might expect from a Thai restaurant overall for taste and freshness.   Reviewers have gone on about the authenticity of this particular restaurants' offerings but really, what does authentic mean if your not sitting in Bangkok but East York, On? It means the same as the Canadian sitting in Bangkok ordering an \"authentic\" North American breakfast. (Girl is shaking her head whilst writing this review). Anyway the Pad Thai I recently sampled at Eathai didn't bring to mind any of the accolades attributed to it by the reviews written herewithin save for the few who mentioned the words tasteless and dull. Sadly, they were an accurate call or at least for our choices this evening.   The best part of tearing into the delivery bags is inhaling the glorious fusion of citrus-y spices while the mouth waters in anticipation but the absence of any detectable aroma upon opening our bags should have tipped me off instantly.   Spring rolls although a good size, were greasy and tasteless - an overused adjective for which I apologize but nonetheless on point. Both shrimp and the vegetarian versions of the managers recommended pad Thai wholly lacked any of the, ahem, authentic flavours synonymous with the Thai food experience. I detected nary a hint of lemon grass, tamarind, garlic or chili nor was there a slice of fresh lime or lemon to squeeze over the clump of sticky noodles. My brother's pad se ew chicken elicited a mournful eeew! As another reviewer has mentioned, this dish is overpowered by hot spice but little flavour. Finally, what better way to cool and refresh the palate between bites of the main dishes than a crisp mango salad? Consistent disappointment was the theme tonite when faced with a mound of too sweet, over ripe mango, a few limp slices of red pepper, onions .... and yet hadn't someone here written in her review that her boyfriend was \"obsessed with the mango salad\"?  The price point for this food is surprisingly low but then so was the experience.   I might be done so I'll sum it up with a shrug and yikes!"}
{"text":"Its authentic and tasty. I usually don't enjoy the odour of fish sauce, but that is what authentic thai pad thai smells like. It is yummy nonetheless. The people are nice and service is quick. Its a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot with great Thai food! Fresh spring rolls were delicious!! Pad Thai and holy basil chicken were good the Thai iced teas were good just not my personal fav.. Probably going to try another dish on the menu but the spring rolls are something I will continuously order"}
{"text":"the price is ok for the lunch special, I wouldn't pay regular price. Pad see ew was just spicy with no flavors besides soya sauce. If you're at the corner of o'connor and coxwell and need thai food immediately then give this a shot.  I'm not sure whether the other reviewers are shilling or just have never eaten good Thai food at all. There are much better options in the Toronto for roughly same price."}
{"text":"I did #FoodieFriday with Toronto Common recently. We were invited to Eathai, which is a quaint restaurant near Coxwell station. The first thing we got to try were their Thai iced teas. The drink has a chai taste to it and is simply delicious. I recommend you try it at least once if you are ever in a Thai restaurant that serves it.  Afterwards, we were given an array of appetizers and main dishes to taste. My favourites were the Spicy Green Curry Chicken and Pad Thai. We weren't able to finish everything so I took the rest back to my boyfriend's place. My boyfriend obsessed over the Mango Salad. If you are a fruit person, give this dish a try. The Cashew Nut Sauce Chicken ended up being quite popular with him and his family.  Eathai has a variety of dishes that would appeal to everyone's palate (I know because my boyfriend is so picky with his food!). If you are ever in East York or live nearby, I say you should drop by and try this homely restaurant out."}
