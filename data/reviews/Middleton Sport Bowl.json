{"text":"I'm not reviewing this place as a bowling alley, since I don't have the expertise to know what constitutes a good bowling experience.  If the shoes fit, the ball rolls down the lane, and the pins fall down, it's fine.  This review is all about the food.  Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.    When you think bar food, you think burgers.  And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful \"contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained\" feeling afterwards.    A quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The \"Philly\" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.  The best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.  But it will probably cost more than your entire meal here."}
{"text":"It's a small, old school bowling alley.  Lots of locals.  Reasonably priced.  Usually can get a lane.  Because it's small,  it's not overly loud and conversations are a little easier to have.  Kid friendly although there aren't a lot of the 6lb balls and Kids have to share.  It's my kids favorite alley in town."}
{"text":"The service here is beyond rude I honestly can't believe they get away with working here. The second we got here they made rude comments and when we went up to order food the guy working was on his phone and completely ignored us even after he knew we were there waiting to order. I wouldn't come here"}
{"text":"I have been saying for years that this is the place to go if you want a burger done right in and around Madison. Now that I have a Yelp account I want anybody that cares to know it!  I spent the better part of a year going to MSB with some gentlemen that I support in the community. I always had great service and always got a medium rare burger when I asked for one. Their gyros are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Tried to go bowling on a Saturday night.  Was fairly busy but not packed.  Was told it wouldn't be long.  Went to bar and waited.  2 Tito's vodka and Juice for $16.  Wow.  Ludicrous. After waiting about 1/2 hour I went to check back on our bowling reservation and was told someone messed up and put others ahead of us.  He'd let us know when something freed up. Promptly left, won't be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers, sad fish. We do a weekly managers meeting and everyone takes turns choosing the location. One of the guys choose the Madison Sports Bowl. I ordered the fish, when the food came to the table I saw beautiful hand pattied burgers, hand dipped onion rings, then came my fish. Sad flat, boring, breading right off the Sysco truck. What a disappointment. Today we made a second trip and I ordered the burger and onion rings. I'm very happy!"}
{"text":"Let's start this review at a 3-star (A-OK = not good/not bad) rating.  +1 star: They have a Badger Bus for home-game weekends. It costs $5, and includes a coupon for a free drink when you get back from the game.  +1 star: The bowling alley looks nice. It's a small space, but clean-looking. I don't know prices. I'll give them the +1 for appearances.  -2 stars: The food is terrible. TERRIBLE. After the WIS v UTEP game, the wife ordered boneless Buffalo chicken wings. They came out deep fried and hard, with almost no flavor -- there was NO BUFFALO SAUCE ON THE WINGS! (We think the B-sauce might have been fried onto the chicken, but, if so, the flavor was lost in frying).  -1 star: The service was lacking. Following the game, with all 50+ people who had just come back on the Badger Bus, there were only 2 servers, and they were also the bartenders! Service was slow, haphazard, and careless -- the guy never once asked how the food was, nor did he ever actually stop at the table except long enough to take our order. Drinks were dropped on the fly, the food was all but thrown as he whizzed by ...  Overall, 2 stars. I'll go back for the Badger Bus and the bowling, but I will NEVER eat there again."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for brunch on a Sunday morning.  It was busy, but not packed and our server asked for our drink order within a minute.  They had a prime rib special for twelve bucks which we couldn't pass up and it was outstanding--great tasting rub, cooked to order, and very tender. Oh, and it was about a 10 to 12oz slab too!  Really good--best I've had in quite awhile.  The rest of our breakfast was excellent as well and our server was attentive and friendly.     I can't comment on bowling or the bar experience, but their dining is unbeatable as are their prices."}
{"text":"We had our son's 4th birthday party here. The staff was very accommodating. The kids had a blast. We were able to use the upstairs party room for pizza, cake and ice cream. The pizza was good and gone quickly. The party room was a little outdated. But I would still recommend this place for a party. The price was affordable too."}
{"text":"Like to stop here on Fridays,as your first drink is free. That's right not 2 for 1, free! Had a burger on last visit which was quite possibly the best I have ever had! Fresh,hand patted,with a great bun. Craving another as we speak..Service OK."}
{"text":"This review is based on two visits in one week. The first visit was simply a visit to the upstairs bar for a Miller High life. Beer was cheap and the bartender didn't leave you hanging.   The 2nd visit was bowling three games and lunch. The food was awesome, my fiancee and I ordered Battered Mushrooms with a Club Sandwich which was huge and very appropriate for two people to share.   There is 10 lanes and we were there on a Saturday afternoon around noon. Only one other lanes was being used. The lanes are kept clean and the bowling was around 2.50 a person per games. We are planning on heading back soon as the prices are far better than Schwoeglers."}
{"text":"Cheap food, but everything fried on a Friday tastes like fish.  Probably not a big deal if you like fish taste, but I don't."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with my parents- first drink free! Our service was quite terrible, but drinks were large and food was okay. Pretty good onion rings and brat was juicy.  The bowling here is nice, they don't have a ton of lanes- probably around 10. Paid $5 for 1 round and shoe rental.   There's an upstairs that can be rented for parties. I've been to a couple there and it was a good space."}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times over the last 5 years, but recently we actually bowled and ate so I decided it was time to write a review.  Bowling:  pretty typical, maybe 10-12 lanes, plenty of house balls and shoes.  We bowled in a tournament so I can not speak to the cost.  It seemed like my husband and I were bowling really well but I hear that Middleton Sport Bowl is a \"high scoring venue\" so our scores weren't directly related to talent =)  I was surprised that they allowed food and beverage on the lanes - they have buzzers you can hit for service while you're playing.  We didn't use this feature but thought it was a neat idea. Food/Drink:  We sat in the last couple of spots at the bar and were greeted and served quickly.  They had a tournament going on so the alley was PACKED but they staffed themselves well.  We ordered the Turkey Avocado wrap with fries and the cowboy quesadilla, which arrived quickly.  I thought the wrap was delicious, full of fresh ingredients but my husband commented that there was too much turkey for him.  It was a sort of deli/shaved meat, not chunks.  The fries were good, nice batter and perfect amount.  The quesadilla was perfect, lots of filling and the tortilla was crispy.   Overall I think this is a solid choice for food, drinks or bowling. We thought our bill was a little high so maybe we'll stop in during a happy hour sometime."}
{"text":"Ever since their renovation, this place has knocked it out of the park.  This is THE place to go for a cold beer after a softball game.  Hungry?  No problem!  Their menu is extensive and everything that I've had has been excellent.  I especially recommend the pizza - you don't expect great pizza from a bowling alley, but they do a great job.  It's a favorite of ours.  Their burgers are top notch as well.  I haven't had the gyros, but a friend of mine raves about them.  The kids menu is great - my little guy destroyed their mini corn dogs.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The owners put a lot of hard work and time into this place, and it shows.  On a cool summer evening, you can't beat sitting out on the patio with a cold one."}
{"text":"We had ventured in for the first time during the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs hoping for a TV they could dedicate to airing the game. What we ending up receiving was bar-none exemplary service, most especially from long time employee Pete.  Pete was a superstar in every way, offering a private TV area so as to be able to turn the volume up, which otherwise would have been in competition with a Brewer game. He was wonderfully attentive, demonstrating skillful timing of his check-ups. He had been cheerfully accomodating regarding other nuance, and all in all, went out of his way to make our day. We were just a couple, albeit unbeknownst to him, celebrating our anniversary, who were looking for a place to hang, and although no one special, we were treated as though we were. We were lucky and blessed to run into him there, and Sports Bowl should be truly grateful to have him. Give this man a raise.   The food was good, the place was fun, and of course, the service was stellar. Good job, and a thumbs up on the cheese curds ;)  Thank you."}
{"text":"$5 beers and slow service during bowling league. Not a fan of that. The food is OK but gouging on beer is not."}
{"text":"Good:  friendly, attentive service Free popcorn Onion rings were tasty and fried to perfection Menu has small but interesting vegetarian section  Improvement opportunities: Curate music and TV programming to create atmosphere"}
{"text":"Middleton Sport Bowl is kind of a mixed bag.  I'll briefly break down how I gauge them (I've been many times, both before and after the renovation)  Facility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments.  Cost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it's around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes.  I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise.  Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option.  We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them.  Food:  It's typical bar food.  They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley.  Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong.  Service:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter.  There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there.  Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \"I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes\" etc, etc.  These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along.  It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that.  The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude.  Personally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out."}
