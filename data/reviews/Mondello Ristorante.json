{"text":"I'd say this review trends a bit higher towards the 4 than the 3, but I just couldn't give it the 4. 

We made reservations for a party of 4 on a Saturday night. Good thing too because the place was packed! I've actually tried to get in to this restaurant without reservations and been turned away because it's so busy. 

The restaurant itself is nicely appointed. We were seated in the back at a cute little booth, allowing us to look out at the whole of the restaurant. 

The service was friendly but a bit slow at times. It seemed that any time we wanted to order (drinks, entrees, and dessert), we had to wait for a fairly long time for our server to notice us. However cleaning up plates was very efficient. 

We also had problems with the restaurant running out of items we wanted. One person in the party ordered their ravioli and was told upon ordering that they were out of it. It really bothers me when restaurants don't tell you up front what they don't have in stock anymore. Otherwise you are happy with your choice and then need to make a split decision because the restaurant doesn't have it.  Two of us were also drinking Coke Zero and they ran out of that half way through the meal too. 

In terms of the food, I've been to this restaurant a few years ago and remember the food being better than this visit. I had the wild cheese tortellini and found it to be a bit bland. My husband had the bolognese which I also found to be a bit bland. The bruschetta was delicious and the tartufo was good as well so it was just the pasta sauces that could have used a bit more salt, or extra oomph. 

Comparing this restaurant to Michael's Back Door on Lakeshore, I'd prefer Michael's Back Door."}
{"text":"Very nice place and excellent food. This is for sure the best italian restaurant in Mississauga.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend."}
{"text":"Amazing service, fresh and delicious food, but rather dated and homely decor (which does not affect the rating). I enjoyed an amazing broccoli soup followed by Lobster Ravioli in a sun dried tomato and mushroom cream sauce. The pasta was lovely and fresh, and the cream sauce was as well, the only downfalls of the dish were an over abundance of sun dried tomatoes and the lobster filling was a little fishy tasting. My companion raved about the caesar salad and the lobster ravioli."}
{"text":"Amazing food here. The chef knows how to please. Whenever I come here everyone not only enjoys the food but the subtle atmosphere as well. The staff here are exceptional."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and attentive.  The food was generally above average for italian.  I did find it on the pricey side and expected that if anything, it would be more reasonable at a Streetsville restaurant, than it would be in nice neighbourhoods in midtown Toronto.  It wasn't though.  In fact, I'm familiar with a couple of places in Yorkville that would've been less pricey on the overall bill for two, which surprises me."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner because we wanted to try something different. My husband and I don't eat meat from outside unless it's halal but we still wanted to explore a different restaurant with some sea food or vegetarian option. All I can say is our anniversary dinner was perfect!! The staff was incredibly warm and welcoming right from when we entered till the last minute. We had quite a bit of sea food options and everything was quality. 
The food was excellent, so delicious. I'm really glad we came here!!"}
{"text":"We're always stuck for places to take my Mississauga-living Grandfather.  But my parents were recently told that Mondello was good, so we decided to all try it on Wednesday.  We will return!

The food was delicious!  

Unfortunately, on the night we went, there was also a wedding rehearsal taking place, and we got the last table in the restaurant.  Not an issue, except for the fact that there were only two servers that night, tending to the entire restaurant.  They also told us that there was only one chef (the owner) and one sous-chef.  Despite all this, the staff were VERY attentive.  And although the service was a little slower than is ideal, they handled it really well, maintaining smiles and a great attitude.

Everyone was happy with their meals.  I had the alfredo linguine, although I think I'd try something else next time.  The pasta was homemade, and tasty, but heavy.  2 people in our party had the veal parmiagiana, and 1 had eggplant parmigiana, and all 3 loved them.  Hubby had a pizza, and loved it....  until he tried to sprinkle some chili flakes on it, and the lid popped off, and all of a sudden he had an entire jar of chili flakes on 1/2 of his pizza.   Again, the server was quick to notice, and offered to cook him a new one while he worked on the undamaged half.  But he was happy to just have it shaken off and ate it as-is.  Good thing the man likes some spice in his life!

We all tried dessert too, and everyone was very happy with their selections. 

Oh, and the appetizers!!  I LOVED their bruschetta!   I have been thinking about it all week.

The chef/owner came out after dinner to greet the patrons.  Nice touch for a small independent restaurateur.  

Kudos to Mondello.  Now we know where to go next time we take my grandfather out for dinner!"}
{"text":"Went here for a bridal shower over the weekend and I was impressed.
The restaurant is very clean. The staff are great and very organized. Overall I was surprised how smoothly everything went considering the whole place was booked for the event.
They served bruschetta for sharing. It was delicious. the tomatoes were fresh and the bread was soft and fresh. The menu says it has basil, which I would have loved, but it was no where to be found. The salad was a no fuss garden salad. I didn't care much for it as there was far too much balsamic vinegar added. For my main, I had ordered the Penne alla Vodka and was really excited for it but ended up a little disappointed. The dish was really lacking in flavour. It was a little on the bland side and I felt the need to add salt and pepper through that didn't make much of a difference. One of the other guests I sat with had the eggplant parm which I tried a bite of.  I wish I had ordered that instead. It was light, not oily with just the right amount of breading. 
The food was just alright, but that might have been due to the fact that the restaurant was full for the event. I will definitely give this place another go."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner last week.   Atmosphere was pleasant and service was great.   Had the gnocchi which was perfect.   Would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"Mediocre visit at best. First time here. Looked nice from the outside and had high hopes for this restaurant. 

First impression: Walked in and was greeted with a nice décor and dim lighting...unfortunately, this ambiance was accompanied by a strong stench that smelled like the old trough urinals at Maple Leaf Gardens. This filled the entire restaurant for our entire meal.

Ordered the calamari and arancini for appetizers. Taste was okay but calamari was lukewarm at best and the arancini was cold inside.

Entrée consisted of spaghetti carbonara and pasta with ala vodka sauce. Entrees came out piping hot, which was nice, but the carbonara was on the bland side and the sauce lacked that smoothy, creamy texture which a carbonara should be. Instead, it was actually clumpy, like a bad mac and cheese. The ala vodka sauce, on the other hand, was overly salty and almost overpowering.

Dessert was the only pleasant surprise. Mango sorbet was served in a frozen mango skin, and the made-in-house crème brulee was actually very good. But who knows, maybe only the dessert experience was good because the urine stench had faded a bit.

Don't think I'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Just visited for a date to celebrate my marriage anniversary .. and the place is worth it. The staff is very friendly and gives special treatment. Though the price was little high compared to the quantity, but quality was very good. The ambiance was good as well. No issues for parking too.

PS: Do call and make reservations since the place is mostly occupied and check timings since they vary in different seasons"}
{"text":"The server kept touching my wife's back. It was kind of weird. Server then forgot us on the patio and we had to go track her down to place an order (the platter). The platter was bush league - salad drenched in oil, bruscheta that was essentially sliced tomato on un-toasted bread. We ordered the chicken marsala as a main with mashed potatoes. Apparently they were sold out of mashed potatoes, so without consulting us they decided gnocchi in tomato sauce was going to be the substitute. And they sent us veal instead of chicken (??). We sent the veal and gnocchi back and left unsatisfied. Not going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here and were extremely impressed by the genuine quality of both food and service. Our waitress Sarah provided excellent service and ensured we were attended to. We started off with the baked brie which was acompanied by candied walnuts, sliced pear, homemade jam and crostini...I have to admit it was to die for, all thanks to Sarah for the great recommendation. My wife had the cheese tortilini in white truffle sauce while I had the mushroom risotto, both were authentic and well balanced in flavour. We ended off with a surprise complimentary ice cream dessert for my wife which had a decorative greeting that  came at my request through Mondello's online reservation tool. The indoor atmosphere has the right level of ambience for a special occasion - we were delighted to be seated in the candle lit private booth.

This is how high quality service is delivered. Needless to say, I highly recommend dining here. Thank you Sarah and staff at Mondello for making our anniversary special. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, the two ladies were very attentive to our needs and food was very good. Loved the Penne alla Vodka and the Spaghetti Incazzato. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago for the first time.  Really quaint little Italian restaurant in Streetsville. Although the menu is not extensive, the food is delicious.  It's one of the better restaurants in Mississauga. The price fairs well with the quality of the food and services you receive.  The ambience is good for dates.  Make sure you make a reservation as spacing is limited.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Really great food and top notch service! Love the pizza here its pretty fab and the salads are great too. This is authentic Italian which I appreciate. I am always struck by the level of service here, they seem to be really well trained and really seem to care about your experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful staff. Love the seafood here. Very beautiful dining atmosphere. Would be good for a date or a family dinner."}
{"text":"The fried calamari with jalapeño alioli really set this experience to a GREAT start. The mushroom primavera was pretty delicious and it definitely has a slight kick even for people of colour ;). We ordered the chocolate mousse cake with vanilla ice cream to share. It was pretty good! Better than most I've had in Canada but definitely not top tier. And how come every dessert had gelato but this one had vanilla ice cream instead of gelato? 

I love the hot sauce at mondello's. I always judge a restaurant by it's in house hot sauce and I will definitely be back to this one to try more entrees because of the impression the hot sauce has made on me. 

Service was really slow on Thursday! Had to wait for water, bread, hot sauce (when we asked for more:)), the dessert menu, the dessert to come, the bill to come. Just slow."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best pizza place I have ever been to! If you are looking to eat an authentic Italian Pizza, then this is the place to  go! Their pizzas are wholesome made fresh. Their menu is very short but it makes up for the quality of great tasting food! I had the Harvest Pizza which had gorgon zola cream, prosciutto, spinach, sautéed mushroom, honey, grilled fig and balsamic reduction. It had a sweet and salty taste to it, which was very unique. The cool thing about this place is that their menu keeps changing and they try to incorporate different recipes to keep things interesting! I would definitely recommend this to a pizza lover!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great ingredients! Fresh veggies makes the food oh so tasty! I loved this place. Had a beautiful evening with great service. This restaurant matches or exceeds a food connoisseurs expectations!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant in Streetsville! Me and my boyfriend eat here every once in a while when we're having a craving for Italian food. 

The mains here are all good! Only complaint being the portions are a little small. Service is amazing and the staff is very knowledgeable.

The creme brulee here is amazing and I order it Everytime I'm here!

Overall great place, staple of the Streetsville area."}
{"text":"We have been there twice for special occasions and both times the food was very good. The service was great and very friendly staff. Everyone's food came to the table at the same time and was the right temperature. The only thing I had an issue with both times was it was very loud in there and it was very difficult and tiring to have a conversation.
4.5 stars"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful restaurant with some amazing staff. The food is prepared fresh and they make most of their pasta from what I can remember. 

But it's just ok. The risotto fungi was ok. A little bland. The ravioli were ok. Too al dente.  Spaghetti with meat sauce was ok. Nothing memorable. 

Go to Andiamo three doors down, much better and more flavour."}
{"text":"Romantic ambience but I'd say it's a little small in terms of space per person.

Food was pretty good but the portions itself were small from what I remember and probably wouldn't go again.

Service was nice."}
{"text":"4.5 solid stars!! I have never experienced such awesome service. It was so good, it felt intrusive.. Lol 0.5 deduction. Food was great, portion was decent and some very fine lady staff there. All were very nice and accommodating.

Total awesome! Make sure you get the meat balls.. Either the appetizer or with spaghetti (extra $5). Meatball awesomeness.."}
{"text":"Execellent service and food! They were accommodating to our sitting requirements. The seafood pasta was fresh and delicious. The fried calamari was crispy and nicely season despite being a bit too greasy. The veal parmigiana, which was plain, and the pizza need some improvement. The pizza was particularly salty and could use some sauce. We will be back to try another things on the menu and the specials too."}
{"text":"Went here on date night on a Saturday night. The ambiance was amazing as was the food. We got a bottle of wine, appetizer to share and dinner and they were all amazing. We had the bruschetta and it was very unique tasting. Our server was just the right amount of attentive. We had an amazing time here and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good meal on New Year's Eve and gave this restaurant a call on you guessed it on the 30th. We weren't looking for an all nighter with all the party favors, just dinner with the kids. We were not disappointed. The food was top notch, special requests were respected etc... The calamari was awesome as a starter. Make sure you leave room for dessert! 

The topper for us was the service, EXCELLENT! Even the chef popped out to say a quick hello. Highly recommended for a sit down Italian meal in Mississauga.

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious!   Food is always amazing - I always order something different and have not been disappointed yet.    I have had the gnocchi in past, and was tempted to have it again, but instead had the carbonara.  Portion was big enough that I got a small take home package, so I get to have it again (good thing, because I want more of it!).  Fresh bread is always served to the table, with the most amazing balsamic (and oil, but with balsamic that rich, who noticed!)   Hubby had the feature pizza:  love it.  Kids had great pics as well.  Although the food is excellent, the service is even better.   Our waiter was a pro at our table for 8 - kids and adults alike.  He was so polite, quick to smile, thorough, attentive, and professional.  One of the guests made a comment about how well spoken he was.  Our wager amongst each other was \"hold old is he\" - guesses were all 25, 26, 27 years old.  I asked him when he came back to the table - answer was....19!  (we were even more impressed at that point!)  Management is doing something right:  such a great team.   
The desserts are a bit wonky - don't seem in keeping with the main menu.   I'd like to see more classic items on the dessert menu and much less \"over the top\" efforts.  All in all - excellent.  Such a great spot to have close by."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. Wait staff very knowledgeable. Probably the best place in Streetsville for a business meal."}
{"text":"I loved the food the ambience and the service! We got the platter for 2 and the risotto fried balls where awesome and the calamari was awesome. We got the lasagna for dinner which I loved too. I'm usually not this happy about food but they made my night!"}
{"text":"Re-visitation. Must use newly-developed pizza rating system!

Crust Texture: Cracker-thin crust that still manages to be chewy.

Crust Flavor: Salty and chewy-yummy. Great.

Sauce Flavor: Sweet and tangy and herbal - AUTHENTICO!

Sauce Amount: Perfection. Light so the crust isn't affected by the moisture.

Cheese Flavour: FRESH and mild - quality cheese = subtle but beautiful flavour.

Cheese Amount : Again, light-handed: classic Italian way of cheesing a 'za!

Topping Quality: Fresh fresh fresh tomato sauce, top-quality mozzarella with minimal herbs. Gorgeous. 

Topping Amount: Applied with the lightest hand - beautiful.

Presentation: Fine - you can tell it's not a top-notch TO Italian resto, but I think it's good for Mississauga. Is that terrible to say?

Overall Taste: YUM. Full four stars."}
{"text":"So...after all the rave reviews I keep hearing about Mondellos...I decided to have date night there...As you can tell by my rating, I really was not impressed by them. MAYBE I came on a bad night or something but i was thoroughly underwhelmed..Ill give you a quick run down why:
1. Mondello platter - arancini balls tasted stale specifically the texture of the crumb coating was completely off.
2. Wild mushroom tortellini with truffle cream sauce- absolutely bland in taste and presentation. Cream sauce was way too heavy and looked like it was breaking. The chicken in the pasta was extremely tough and also tasteless.
3. Boyfriend had the lamb loin- for some reason the whole plate was cold. The lamb was cold, mashed potatoes cold, veggies cold. Our waiter first offered to microwave it? And after a 2nd hesitant offer , we got a new piping hot plate only to find out that the lamb was over cooked. But we were way too tired and sleepy to complain again. The waiter also said the lamb was on the house cuz it was their fault. But close to when we decided to get dessert he said he meant that dessert would be on the house not the lamb lol.
4. Profiteroles- only becuz their creme brulee was all finished :-( as someone who makes profiteroles many times and has eaten them various places in the world I can definitely say those were the worse profiteroles ever. 

I feel absolutely terrible writing bad reviews becuz maybe it just wasnt their night....cuz everyone else seems to have loved their experience. I will probably not go again unless someone drags me there but ...thats just my opinion."}
{"text":"Living in Mississauga there arent many authentic Italian restaurants out there so once my craving for REAL pasta hits Mondello is my go to place !! 

The atmosphere of the place makes your meal perfect everything from the interior to the servers who provide you with excellent customer service. My family and i ordered the Arancini al Tartufo for our appetizer , its basically mushroom risotto balls with a truffle rose sauce. I have to say , this was delicious. Being a huge fan of mushrooms and truffle made this dish perfect !! I do recall however that the last time we ordered this they were a bit bigger. 

For my main dish i opted for the Il Pescatore which is a mixed seafood fettuccine pasta in a white wine tomato sauce. The plate was presented beautifully and the seafood contents consisted of mussels , shrimp , scallops and crab legs. The scallops and mussels were probably the most tasty thing to eat and the tomato sauce was a perfect and was not too sweet from the tomatoes."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday eve with my parents since they live in the area. Reservations were made online. Free parking adjacent to the restaurant. Dark and dim decor, black table cloths, white napkins, black ceiling, dinner tea light candle. We skipped the appies and went straight for the entrées. The special tonight was full rack of ribs w/ seasonal vegetables... But by the time we ordered.. They only had one order left. So we had the full rack of baby back ribs, veal parm, Tuscan pizza, and Zuppa di mare. I did not try the ribs but it looked pale and boiled and had spices rubbed on. Mom said the vegetables were overcooked. The veal parm was generous with their portion of protein, w a small side of spaghetti in tomatoe sauce.. Tasted fresh. Pizza looked like pizza. But the Zuppa di mare which was an array of seafood cooked in a white wine tomatoe sauce with a side of bread to dip in.. The sauce was extremely tasty. This was prob the best of the 4 dishes. We also got complimentary bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to start. Overall, we weren't blown away by the flavours. The food was ok despite being more on the expensive side. Good service. It was $130 for the 4 of us for entrées only after taxes. My experience was not memorable enough for me to come back or recommend to others."}
{"text":"One of the quaint restaurants that you'll miss if you are not in the Streetsville area often - but even then, I wouldn't have known to come to this restaurant if it wasn't for reviews like Yelp to help guide me into trying out new places! 

As normal, they served a plate of bread and oil but if I remember correctly, it wasn't anything particularly special.

I had their linguine pescatore dish and you can tell just by the taste and quality that the pastas were prepared fresh. This is an ideal place to go to if you're thinking of having a candelit dinner as something romantic to add to your date, or even if you want to hang out in a group of 4 is also nice. The environment has an elegant atmosphere that sets the mood as well.

It is recommended to make reservations as they fill up very quickly, usually also do to reservations as well being made.

Overall I feel for the price you pay and you want to have Italian in a quaint village like Streetsville, not a bad place to show a date around."}
{"text":"We have been going for the braised beef ravioli. It used to be in a truffle sauce!  Incredible!  Now they soak it in butter, not so good.   Bring back the truffle sauce, please!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food in a relaxed environment

Mondello is an Italian Restaurant in Streetsville on Queen Street. The menu is pretty basic and the food we had was good. But wait, is that a hair in our soup? Or is that two hairs? Or was that the ginger in the carrot puree soup? We'll never know because we didn't want to ask, however it did put a damper on our eagerness to finish our meals.But for now we'll go with ginger that looked very close to hairs.

The Italian Salad was wonderful and the service very friendly. We didn't try much else on the menu but I would give it another chance. They have a full menu with Pizzas, Pastas, Meat and Fish dishes. They do provide good value and in all fairness to the restaurant, we really should have found out what that was in an otherwise tasty soup."}
{"text":"We came out here for my sister's birthday. The service was attentive, if a little much with their \"bella\"s and \"honey\"s for all the ladies at the table. When we asked for recommendations, we were told that \"everything was good.\" Well, I don't disagree but surely an educated server can indicate differences that would play to various palates, no?
In case, we went with the calamari fritti for the appetizer to go with our rather strong drinks (kudos to their bartender who barely looked old enough to shave). Their Sriracha mayo aioli thing was great but I found the calamari to be a little on the greasy side. Not the fast food resto kind of greasy but a little bit oilier than I would have liked. 
Our entrees were an amazing Chianti braised beef ravioli- good portion and great meat filling. Good ratio of meat to pasta as well. I was rather jealous of my sister for ordering it. My mother got the chicken piccata and while it was tasty, the chicken breast was rather small. Unfortunately for my mother, she dislikes broccoli which meant she could eat only her tiny chicken and potato scoop. 
Now I had the seafood risotto. Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations. In fact, the risotto severely lacked an element of fat, was a bit too heavy on the acid (all those tomatoes...), and the squid was a TAD overcooked. I felt the need to balance out the taste by eating some bread dipped in olive oil (which by the way, we had to ask for. We didn't just get it brought to us like every other table did). 
Then since it was my sis' bday, we informed the waitress so she brought out a scoop of gelato for her. Now, the table next to us also had a birthday that day and all four of them got a round of shots brought to the table courtesy of the chef. What did we do differently? Fine, whatever. You don't want to have consistency in your customer service, I guess that's your prerogative. 
Overall, for what we had, I think we could have driven out a bit further and found comparable food for a better price. 
I'm not a fan overall but it's more to do with service which is obviously largely an individual experience. The food was good but I would take it with a grain of salt (and some bread and oil)!"}
{"text":"classy but not super upscale italian spot in streetsville.  warm interior consisting of various brown hues.  our waitress heather was very friendly and polite.

- fried calamari: shockingly tender, and served atop a generous streak of mild jalapeno chimichurri.  amazing
- mussels: in a sweet cream sauce.  solid
- duck confit: white wine cream sauce fettuccini.  mushroom and kale.  incredibly soft duck went well with all the ingredients
- veal parmigiana: lightly breaded & nicely cooked veal cuts served with spaghetti in tomato sauce.  pretty standard, but good
- swordfish (special): grilled steak topped with tomato confit and eggplant, with a side of lemon risotto and vegetables.  the fish cooked well-done and tasty.  i prefer risottos to stay cheesy and/or creamy though -- this one was really zippy
- braised beef ravioli: probably the stand-out dish of the night.  really simple in theory, but once you bite into the ravioli, it explodes with rich, tender beef that's full of flavour
- creme brulee: nothing extravagant but always a good dessert to order

generous portions and overall delicious food made this well worth the rather large amount of money spent.  recommended!"}
{"text":"I went there early on a weekday for dinner and I was the only one for a while until two more parties arrived. The staff gave lots of attention and the atmosphere was lovely. The food was fresh and delicious but I thought most dishes needed a bit more seasoning. For my main I had the braised beef ravioli. The ravioli filling was suberb but the butter sauce wasn't very flavourful."}
{"text":"We started with the bruschetta which was different (tomatoes were roasted ) but delicious.  Their bread at the table was good as well. I had the braised beef ravioli which was good (not too saucy so flavour of meat came out) and my husband had the mushroom risotto which he liked but found too buttery for his taste. The atmosphere is great. We were here with another couple and did not need to yell our conversation. The food was good and it is on the pricier end.  I liked their wine options especially excited that they carried Niagara's Big Head winery. It was nice to see them carry little known wineries that are so much better than the giants. I would come back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice, both for special occasions, and both experiences were an excellent example of how a perfect dining example should be.  This is a review my most recent experience.

My wife had chosen this restaurant for my birthday.  We had a group of roughly 15 people.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Andrew was looking after us that evening and was the perfect host.  I can understand how frustrating it may be to look after a table party goers as people tend to get lost in conversation and not pay attention to the menu and drinks forcing the waiter to come back forth, but he handled it with extreme class and patience.  

The atmosphere was nice- friendly but classy.  Staff was knowledgeable about the menue and greatrecommendations were made.

The food here is top notch.  I ordered the lobster risotto, my wife ordered the braised beef ravioli, and appetizers of meatballs, arancini  and calamari were passed around.  Every item I tried on the menu was delicious and cooked perfectly.  Not one detail was overlooked.

Every one of my guests commended the choice of restaurant and expressed intention to return.  

Excellent experience.  Management, if you are reading this, thank you for your hospitality on my birthday.  Your restaurant is truly a benchmark in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Definitely a great spot for Italian food, but just on the pricer side of things.  However you do get what you pay for, great food, awesome service and beautiful decor.  Still thinking about the pizza and riceballs...hummm so good."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant.  Jessica and Nick are awesome owners, and know how to run a successful business.  Food is yum yum delicious!  It does feel slightly pretentious in here though.  Good place to bring the parents and a date, but definitely no kids/loud people!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, came out very quick. Our server Sarah was great. She was quick and to the point. 10/10 would come here again. I recommend the ravioli."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with a bunch of friends. Took a little bit longer to get seated at our table (even though we had reservations) as the restaurant was packed. Regardless, we Had a great time here. The restaurant has a very nice ambience- small, cozy, and nicely decorated for the holiday season! The food was delicious too. For appetizers I ordered the bruschetta which was so-so. For mains, couple of my friends and I tried the gnocchi in gorgonzola sauce. It was perfectly made-the sauce was cheesy and the pasta was cooked to perfection. Just loved it. For dessert, we tried the Tiramisu which came in a really cute cup with some hot Cappucino to drink. Overall a very good experience at this restaurant. Will definitely return for a date night here"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, service, and Italian food.  Great wine list selections also. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went here for a random Saturday night dinner. The atmosphere is awesome, quite classy and the food was even better! Being a vegetarian it is always welcoming when you open a menu and see a vegetarian entree! I ordered the eggplant parmigiana caniloni as a main (entree); extremely flavourful, well thought out and a great presentation! My girlfriend had ordered the Risotto, again extremely flavourful and perfectly seasoned! 

The reason for the 4/5 and not 5/5 was the service. We had to ask twice for water, and asked for extra bread which never arrived. 

Other then that I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and will be making a return visit!"}
{"text":"Mondello I love you!
My first 5 star rating.
Exceptional food from apps to dessert.
You know a place is credible (also, amazing) when the chefs are able to improvise to the client's wishes.
Service was impeccable, timely, professional, attentive and genuine. Thank you Luis? I'm sorry if I butchered that.
The place is clean and not overly pretentious and THEY LET THEIR FOOD DO THE TALKING.
We came in sweatpants from a long day at work and at the gym and the patrons made us feel so welcome. We're here for the food dammit and they gave us what we wanted. 
Our favourite Italian restaurant has since closed down but I think we've found an amazing contender.

Appetizers Ordered:
Bruschetta - The tomatoes were gorgeously seasoned, the cheese and balsamic ratio were harmonious. The middle of the baguette was a bit soggy and was falling apart but no complaints because we destroyed it in seconds anyway. 

Calamari - The squid were cooked perfectly. These guys know how to cook their seafood (see fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp) Most restaurants overcook them and get too gummy. The breading was great. My boyfriend who prefers heavier breading wanted more but I thought it was great.

Entrees Ordered:
Fettuccine Alfredo with Shrimp - I have never had more succulent and juicy shrimp in my entire life. I dreamt about this shrimp days after I had it. I wish I had more. The Alfredo was divine, creamy and the portion was great for $15? $17? I don't remember. It's heavy and you get your money's worth. 


Veal Parmigiana substituted mashed potatoes with penne and tomato sauce - my boyfriend loved the Alfredo I got and will probably try and order that instead of the penne. He barely paid attention to it as he was looking at my Alfredo the entire night. The substituted pasta was a small serving, that was his only gripe. Minute, because he seemed to have enjoyed the veal. He loved the Alfredo though.

Desserts Ordered: (all desserts are $9)
Profiteroles - cream puffs coated in a coffee flavoured icing? DELICIOUS! I wish I could've had more but I was stuffed from the Alfredo. 

Torte de la Nonna - lemon custard with almond slivers. I was hoping for more tangy lemon zest, because I have a love affair with lemon flavours but understandably so. I am unfamiliar with this dish but I was happy to try it. The texture was amazingly soft and warm. Wish I got gelato on the side to have the perfect duo. 

Looking forward to trying new items here Mondello!
I can't wait to review your pizzas!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for Valentine's Day after reading some recommendations.  They did a set menu for the evening and perhaps it's something they do every year in order to exploit the shit out of Valentine's Day prices.  I'm not against spending money if the value is there but the meal we had definitely felt like it was made just to exploit the shit out of Valentine's Day.

Keep in mind, everything was of small proportions.  Think going to a wedding proportions.  We visited during a quieter part of the evening.

Set menu: 

1) Some take on sushi...2 very small pieces of \"sushi\". You shouldn't call it sushi if the rice isn't vinegared.  I'm not even sure if it was even rice because it tasted very mushy.  That's like going to a Japanese restaurant and ordering spaghetti served with ramen. 

2) A basic penne pasta with tomato sauce.  Pasta slightly overcooked but still, nothing to get excited about.

3) Main dish: Beef tenderloin with bacon and some vegetables and drenched with some sauce and a side of mashed potatoes (?).  The beef was good, definitely tender. Was the saving grace of the meal but definitely there is better steak at these prices.

4) Raspberry chocolate orange Tartufo (similar to ice cream/gelato).  This was very good.  The chocolate flavour worked very well to balance the tanginess of the other two flavours.

Add in ONE beer and our bill came out to be north of $230!!

Last month we visited Barberians Steakhouse downtown and had KILLER steak, a good portion appetizer, a BOTTLE of wine ($40 bottle which is comparable to what this restaurant offered on their wine list), TWO pints of beer and one dessert and the bill was about $20 more.   

Some things to consider: service was okay, nothing wowed us.  When we had finished our main dish and they cleared our plates, we sat there for about 10 minutes waiting for our server to come take our dessert order - even tried making eye contact, played with our phones, etc..visual cues for him, you know?  Eventually, we had to call him over since he could not pick up on the cues.

I want to like this place - I really do.  Maybe one day I'll revisit when it's not Valentine's Day but honestly, these preset menu things don't work when it seems like all you're doing is EXPLOITING THE SHIT out of Valentine's Day.  You might be thinking, \"Oh, it's Valentine's Day, everyone does that.\"  No, everyone doesn't do that.  And if you are going to do that, ADD VALUE to the exploiting part so people like me will want to try your restaurant again under normal terms."}
{"text":"The service was friendly, efficient, and prompt, but the place was unbelieveably noisy.  To be fair, this was Saturday night and there were 3 groups there (and we've only been there once), but I don't remember ever being in a restaurant where I had to yell across a small table.

The grilled calamari (an option in place of fried) was excellent, but the seafood pasta, while generously porportioned, was not very flavourfull, and had a mild fishy taste (not the type you want).

The lamb was good, but the sauce was insufficient.

Can't help coming back to the noise.  When it's that loud, it's hard to enjoy yourself enless your comfortable holding your conversations at a yell."}
