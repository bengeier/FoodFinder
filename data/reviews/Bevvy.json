{"text":"Shoutout to Logan for always cleaning up the place. My gf and I are always here on the weekends and he is always hustling. You do a thankless job, but I appreciate the work man."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food was great and Graham was incredible!  Great service, delicious drinks, superb atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here again this past on Sunday to watch some playoff games with my hubby. I love Bevvy. Hubby can get a burger and I can get something on the lighter side. They make an amazing chicken salad and I loved the Salty Sister. Thank you Bevvy for offering some healthier options to what can be expected from most bars in old town."}
{"text":"Super tasty food!!!  The fish and chips are fantastic and the Bevvy salads are amazing!  I've stopped in several times and the staff is always friendly and fun. Happy Hour is long and totally worth checking out! I've turned many friends on to this cool spot and they've all raved about it too!"}
{"text":"Tylor was amazing! So nice and attentive and of course U of A bar so it's gonna have that Tucson charm. Love this bar"}
{"text":"Visiting AZ for work and a friend took me to this gem. Great location, great drinks and great food. Highly recommend it for a game or just a beer. Great kick off place."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today....I recommend it. Food and service was exceptional. My bartender Maegan was great. She was busy but still took the time to give me attentive attention with a smile. She also recommended my new favorite menu item the Baja Burritto. Yum! Thanks Maegan!!!"}
{"text":"Was in there on Tuesday and received awesome service from the bar tender (I believe it was Avry???sorry if I miss spelled). I recommend it to anyone looking for a good time in a amazing environment!"}
{"text":"One of the best bars in Old Town in my opinion.  I live in the neighborhood, and find myself going back to Bevvy more than anywhere else.  The HH deals are by far the best deals in Scottsdale.  $3 for any draft and a great selection!  The half price salads are amazing.  I absolutely love the steak salad, and it's $7 during HH.  Unbelievable price for great quality food.  Everything about this place is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon, 20 people in the bar and it took us 20 minutes before we tracked down a server to order a drink. Maybe it's BYO? Quality has gone down since the change from Derby

Quick update. After complaining we couldn't get service the server was lovely but served terribly weak drinks. Ate an average nachos and then they scooped up my phone with the plates and THREW IT OUT! They \"let\" me go through all the trash in the kitchen up to my elbows, then had to go through the trash compactor out the back while some guy shoveled in food (literally). I found it, cleaned it up and received a full bill. Good times."}
{"text":"We had the best time tonight! Mostly due to the fun times and conversations had by chris! He was attentive and made our drink orders swiftly. We are kind of picky when it comes to drinks.. he made a vodka soda which didn't taste quite right and he remade it for us to perfection! Thanks Chris for making bevvy our go to in old town!-CB"}
{"text":"Jack coke fail, but jack and ginger was good. Patty melt with old bay fries, legit. Comp'd the bev. Appreciated! Good place, Old town, with all the trimmings. Give em a shot."}
{"text":"Bevvy is my Sunday Funday spot!! They offer a Bloody Mary Bar for brunch, so delicious! The staff is always super friendly and take great care of you! :)  See you Sunday...."}
{"text":"Fun change from the typical Scottsdale nightclub scene.  Bevvy adds class and lounge flair while maintaining a light and fun atmosphere..  I could actually hold a conversation.  Great music, great energy and cool international vibe.  

Bevvy's bartenders / waitresses are both good looking and interested in holding a conversation - unlike most of old town.. 

Food was great!  Had the half chicken / half salmon, teriyaki / sweet chili rice bowl. My girlfriend had the Steak Salad and was impressed all round. They have everything from typical bar food (chicken fingers and steak fries) to chef inspired dishes. 

This place is so well rounded. You get a little bit of everything. Great place to hang out for hours and play one of many games including, (Darts, Jenga, Skee Ball, Shuffle-Board).
Bevvy interacts with its guests offering discounts and prizes when we reach high scores on their games. Super Fun!

They even have horse race betting, I believe they call it Off Track Betting... 

I'll definitely be back. Finally a place in the heart of the Entertainment District that offers it all!


While holding a conversation with bartender, Aubree, I was informed that they have live music on thursdays, and also a phenomenal brunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"So much fun! Greatly enjoyed the bar and music. No cover charge was a plus! Definitely recommend this place on a night out."}
{"text":"Great service with a fun atmosphere in a great location. Great change of pace from the rowdy neighboring bars, this place has an elegant feel with a casual inviting personality. The staff are so attentive and friendly I never felt like I had to wait on service. Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a nice place to grab a drink with friends. Thank you for the good times!"}
{"text":"Tyler was the best server. She was very attentive and one of the best servers we've had in such a long time. There a was a difficult table next to us while still providing excellent service. Awesome job Tyler!"}
{"text":"First time here on a Saturday night about 9:20 pm.  We got a table and ordered food. The music was so loud, especially the bass that we couldn't even talk to each other.   Burger was good other than the strange choice of greens on top, had a strange flavor not like lettuce. As someone else stated, the steak fries came out barely warm and soggy.  The part that really pissed of my girlfriend is when they started stacking bottles and ice buckets right in the middle of our table to prepare for some \"bottle service\"  as if we weren't even there.  It's not like they even asked or said anything, they just used the table we were eating and drinking at as a work station.  It seemed a little rude so we didn't stick around.

Yeah sorry but no....we were not informed of anything by anyone when we sat down.  Taking away one star for lying on the reply.....how pathetic."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere/food/drinks/service all reasonably priced much better than the place next door, I hate comparing establishments but when the difference is so noticeable it's hard not to recognize where your money should be sent. Better whiskey selection than dierks whiskey row and they have whiskey in their name? Should be ashamed...."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time traveling from Colorado. 

Food was great, beers were cold despite 118 degree heat, and only thing hotter than the weather was our bartender Jessica!

She was fantastic along with the rest of the staff so we will be making this a required stop for every trip!"}
{"text":"We came into Bevvy 12 deep for a Bachelorette party looking for a good time and Bevvy definitely delivered. The vibe was just what we had in mind, the d√©cor was fun and the service was ON POINT. This post is definitely for our girl Bronny, she was nothing short of exceptional! She was so fun to have serving our loud table. Our drinks were always full and she can basically double as a photographer/server. Thanks for the laughs and hugs and fun Bronny! We will definitely be back. 

Beside the great service, our bill was crazy reasonable. I can't imagine getting that type of deal anywhere else with the amount of food and booze we consumed. 

Thanks Bevvy!"}
{"text":"Bevvy is a great new addition to old town! I'm not one to go to any of the local bars to eat (because honestly, why go to a bar to eat?) but Bevvy is the spot!!! I went here for brunch and was treated to pretzels and beer cheese (house made) with the Bevvy Benny (eggs Benedict). To say the least, my taste buds were on ecstasy. The bar staff was friendly and attentive. Bevvy has a great night scene as well. I stopped by a few nights before and loved the low key vibe it produces. I can come here in business casual attire and fit in. I mean really, sometimes the skin tight dresses and heels is too much. If that floats your boat, you will still find the young, skin tight, high heeled young ladies roaming around. It was good mix of people and the drinks were strong. None of that watered down, 2-count vodka drinks. I would recommend this spot to my girlfriends and even my boss. It hosts an atmosphere that anyone can enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bevvy is my favorite bar in Old Town by faaar! The atmosphere is amazing and my number one go to guarantee a fun time. Also, if you need the best drink in Scottsdale, Graham is your guy! He's the best!!!"}
{"text":"If there was zero stars that's what I would choose. Service was terrible and uncooperative. Server blamed others for bad service instead of taking responsibility. Kitchen got every order wrong. Had to search for server in order to get check. Everything was awful. When server asked why tip was low, which she didn't even deserve, she said that's just how it is around here. Awful. Never going back."}
{"text":"Claire kills the game - ask for her and she won't steer you wrong!!  Have popped bottles many a times in here, their spelling bee nights are great, every time you pass a class you take a shot, and the food is really good!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Quick and attentive staff with exceptional food! Try the house poppers appetizer and house margaritas (invented by awesome bartender who is now manager, Eric).

Chicken sandwich I ordered for lunch was tasty and served piping hot.

Avery our server understands that she's in the service business (as do her coworkers) unlike some other places where they're supposedly in the modeling business (sheesh). 

Hop in your Chevy and come to the Bevvy.."}
{"text":"Came in to watch the Pats playoff game and they were charging $300-$400 min for a table. For what? Bar food and some balloons? If someone could explain the business need to do this? I might as well fly to New England. Plus there were plenty of empty tables within a half Hour of kick off. Walked to Boondocks instead and sat down no problem, plenty of other Pats fans. You just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Fun night at the Bevvy.  Great music, great energy with classy lounge vibe. 
Food and drinks were surprisingly good.  Friendly staff.

Update -- Went back last night....heard that it was a U of A game hot spot....and it was!  This place rocked!"}
{"text":"For some reason this is a New England Patriots bar but that did not stop me from watching what could have been the worst football game of the day... jets versus browns. They were happy to switch the TV over to the game wherever I was sitting. The atomic wings really were atomic. Normally hot wings are only mildly hot, but these bad boys are really on fire. Megan made me amazing Bloody Mary's... Added a shrimp and crispy big piece of bacon... Perfect. Definitely go again next time in town."}
{"text":"Was feeling sleepy manager comes and tells me i have to leave as i was falling asleep.  Told him friend was restroom. So we hustled our way out. Terrible.  Rude manager."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I met a couple friends here on Memorial Day...great spot and great time!! The Bevvy has a great Happy Hour...can't beat the 22 oz. beers and my burger was excellent...and the shoestring fries are the bomb
We split a couple orders of the Poppers and Buffalo Drummies...can't beat it with a cold brew!!

I also have to give a shout out on the TVs...nothing worse (well maybe there are some things worse) than a sports bar where you can't see the TVs!! Bevvy is definitely one of the best in downtown Scottsdale for watching the games....a lot of large well placed tv's to see all the games!  (also the scenery is pretty good...I'm just saying)

All in all, great spot with a great vibe!  Next up, we're going to go back for the Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Bevvy is a great hang place. A bar atmosphere with healthy fare on the menu that was not just an after thought, like most bars.   We ordered a salad and it was so fresh and loaded with ingredients. I usually don't prefer field greens because many times they come out wilted, but these tasted fresh picked. The bacon popcorn is a great starter and the hummus was tasty.  The place was packed,  and the service was great.  Lauren, the Owner, was so nice and accommodating. I am hoping they open one in South Tempe soon. A great place after the gym!!"}
{"text":"I will start with the food was excellent. I had the chicken sandwich and my husband had the fish and chips. The 2 star rating is for the service that was horrible and slow. They were understaffed (obvious). Our first table we sat at no one acknowledged us so we moved to the bar which was still very slow. We sat with empty drinks at the bar and waited for someone to acknowledge us so we could get our check and leave which took an additional 30 min. There was no official bartender as wait staff was serving tables as well. This is official Spring Training season so staff appropriately please."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do, but I'm baffled and frustrated by their skeeball policy. I've been here twice and both times I've been told I'm \"not allowed to win\" that many drinks. First of all, the skeeball machines don't produce tickets so you have to take photos to prove when you win. That isn't a big deal, just a little annoying. The first time we came here, the owner stopped giving us the prizes we won after 5 duck shots citing that the reason is the rubber ducks are expensive. So even though we won and earned the prizes (and we're not drunk or over served) we're \"not allowed\" to win any more. I explained to them that I can understand them needing to protect their bottom line, but that they should just up the minimum points to win or change the low level prize to something less expensive if they don't want people to win too much. Also, the amount of money we were putting in playing skeeball evens out the amount we won. All that aside, we decided to give it a second chance. I figured I knew their policy and I planned to play only up to 5 rubber duck shots and then I would stop. This time the owner told her bartender to stop giving us prizes after 4 ducks! We had even won 6 Jameson shots and only claimed 3 of them. I keep leaving this place super disappointed. Just fix your skeeball machine rules and you'll be fine - it's seriously not that hard."}
{"text":"This place is dope. Claire seated me in a section right next to the game. Friendly and efficient"}
{"text":"Bevvy has a great happy hour, good service even when they are slammed, and their Moscow Mule pitchers are amazing. Upon first glance, the crowd can seem super fratty...but there are usually people from all walks of life present. Great place to meet up with friends for drinks and a good time!"}
{"text":"Wow just wow.. this is most definitely on the top 1000 stops to hit in Old Town Scottsdale. They have a great DJ that bumps songs like my go too Miley Cyrus and Maroon 6 you can just groove to all night, instead of the other clubs that just blast Chainsmokers - Closer to the point that you can't even talk to anyone because u just love that song..

I also love the crowd that Bevvy draws in, very one-night-standish. Usually girls don't even give me the time of day, but I've had a perfect week going here every night!! It will continue to be the spot for me and the boyzzz. #whosthathotgirlthatworksthere?"}
{"text":"Always a good time! The menu continues to surprise me...  everything is so good! And the staff is always really kind and good energy. Especially the bartender Graham! Always a fun spot to hit in Scottsdale. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Such a cool vibe!  This is a perfect place for a group happy hour or night out.  There's plenty of room, plenty of seating, plenty good beers on tap and really good drinks.  I don't remember the name of the Tequila/Margarita drink that's on the Happy Hour menu, but it was super sour.  I mean really sour.  2 people in my party of 8 had to send it back and get something else.  Everyone else enjoyed their happy hour drinks thoroughly.  We also enjoy everything we ordered to eat.  

Between the 8 of us we shared the following items:
Queso + Tortilla = Quesadilla, Soft Pretzels & Fondue, House made Hummus, Grass fed Bevvy Burger, Baja Burrito, Old Bay Steak Fries and Bevvy Signature Tater Tots.  Out of everything we ate my absolutely favorite items were: The Chicken Quesadilla, Soft Pretzels & Fondue and the Old Bay Steak Fries.  EVERYONE loved the Old Bay Steak Fries.  I highly recommend them.  

Aside from the awesome drinks and food, the Bevvy also has a cool ass DJ and DJ Booth, Shuffle Boards, Skeeball, Darts and Jenga ... Giant Jenga (Hell Yeah). Trust me ... it's such a cool place for an after-work drink or hanging out on a Saturday night with friends."}
{"text":"Bevvy is our go to spot for great drinks, food and sports. It also has the best late 90's early 2000's music. We look forward to our favorite bartender every Monday, Chris has exceptional customer service and never lets the glass get dry."}
{"text":"Great spot for watching a game. Lots of tv's. Variety of ages in bar was also very nice.  Staff was quick to help. The music however was so loud that I could not hear anything"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale last weekend for fun. I do not think I had ever been to Bevvy before but I went b/c my friend recommended it. I have to say, this place is pretty great. The drinks were solid. The scenery was very good. And I was served by a gentleman with a beard by the name of Matt. He was spot-on with his food recommendations. I could not have asked for better service. He must be a staple at Bevvy. I will definitely make it back in next time I come to Scottsdale. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to grab a drink in town. The atmosphere is unmatched for the area. The bartenders are great. Last time I was there Haley went out of her way to make sure we had a great experience. I could go on all day about the great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Ok, so we usually head over to Bevvy to get our drink on, but this time we got both our drink AND our eat on. 

Honestly, we didn't even know they offered food. We got the wing platter that was absolutely amazing. Cameron the manager hooked us blondes up with the cheeseburger that was also so incredible. 

This place is a definite must try!!!

xoxo @blondeswhoeat"}
{"text":"I visited Bevvy for the first time last weekend. I am also in the industry so headed out to grab drinks with friends after work. It was Saturday night around 12:30am & old town was crowded as expected. Nonetheless, I am appalled by the bar service here! The bartenders served me 3 margaritas that were basically 100% mixer. When you're paying $8 per drink + tipping reasonably... I don't need to say more lol I'm spending money to be served what I ordered. I didn't want to complain because it was extremely loud & they wouldn't have heard anyhow, but I feel a need to put this out there! The bartender made a snarky comment at my decision to order a margarita then proceeded to serve me some concoction of pineapple juice & lime mixer. Pretty sure there was NO tequila in that one! Needless to say I walked out of Bevvy with 3 drinks in me but sober. I had fun dancing with my friends so there's an extra star for that, but I left irritated at the bartenders and asshole security guards who spoke to me like I was 3 when leaving from the restroom. It was 2:04am... I won't be returning to this shitty embarrassing establishment."}
{"text":"I have been to Bevvy a few times now but I have never been impressed. I usually only go because my boyfriend like the OTB. Its exactly DERBY HOUSE only with a new name.

I did go for the Kentucky Derby and got a drink that had absolutely no alcohol. I was not happy but I put it towards them being busy and completely forgetting. I ordered an  shot of Gin and they charged me $10 for one shot. I used my card and I still tipped because I know way too many bartenders that get cheated out of tips for prices that they do not set. This was May 2nd. 

Just this week (JUNE) they processed the charge. A month later. Its complete irresponsibility for the management to allow something like this to happen. 

If I return its only because my boyfriend wants to go but guarantee I will NEVER use my card there again."}
{"text":"Literally, one of the worst experiences at the establishment since it was Derby. I got in relatively easy. They weren't busy by any means. I with no exaggeration waited 10 minutes and 3 other patrons that came right next to me got served b4 I got any attention. In fact, I had to slam my wallet on the bar causing a mini scene. The bar tenders are totally inadequate. The one in particular was wearing more eye liner than I had ever seen in my life, so much that diner waitresses in NY would be jealous. They are losing a ton of money with employing 19 and 20 yr olds that are clueless and not efficient whatsoever. This bar needs a GM and manager that care about the P&L. Unless I have no choice because I'm with a group, I will be never returning to this joke of a bar.... They should change personnel and get bar tenders that can actually poor drinks in an efficient way."}
{"text":"Server today kind of made me depressed. It was the kind of contact depression that is contracted from someone expressing a fundamental longing die. I couldn't imagine a person who hated their job more, I didn't have to. 

Soggy french fries were okay, any bar that is designed for indiscriminate midnight humping is going to have fries that reflect their nature."}
{"text":"Came in last night for a quick bite, got the Chic Sandwich and it was delicious. They also have a great Strawberry and a Lemon Walk in a Bar drink that is perfect for the AZ weather. The only  negative things i would have to comment on is the 3% service charge for using your Credit Card to pay. Not that it was much, but enough to feel like you are getting nickled and dimed at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"Bevvy is one of my favorite places to go in old town. The bouncers at most bars in old town are rude and on their high horse however at Bevvy they are extremely friendly and quick to help when someone is getting out of hand. I would highly recommend getting Maddy as a server, she's great! Food and drinks are always awesome and not too over priced like most places in old town. If you want a fun place to go with your friends where you won't be sandwiched in between people and will have good service from the start this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch and really enjoyed it.

Their patio is dog-friendly, our pup loved their couches, and it was a very nice touch that they brought us some dog treats as we were leaving.

Our server was very kind.  The ambiance was very relaxing.  Plus, you can't really beat playing with a giant Connect Four set while you wait for your food.

As for the food, I really enjoyed the Patty Melt, and my wife liked her Chicken Sandwich.  They forgot Bacon on her sandwich, but immediately brought some out when that was pointed out.  

We are already excited to return and try their Happy Hour deals.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot on the weekends, ended up getting the quinoa egg white protein bowl which was light and delicious.  Saved the right amount of appetite for the $15 bottles of champagne.  Nice deal! Great vibe and crowd!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a bachelorette brunch. The food was delicious and the drink specials were irresistible (seriously, I tried, but it was too good of a deal to pass up). Our server, Bronny, and all the other staff made the experience fun and memorable. I would highly recommended Bevvy to anyone looking for a fun place to enjoy some drinks (or a casual personal bottle of prosecco) with friends."}
{"text":"Awesome spot, great happy hour and amazing staff. My favorite place in old town as you can go there any day at any time and you'll have fun. Solid food too!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Mostly because it's an Arizona bar and I'm a die hard wildcat fan, but also it stays true to being a bar where every other spot on the square turns into a nightclub. The food is good, the service is good and the bar is filled with smokes most of the time so what else could you ask for. They also have reverse happy hour on Saturday nights. NO ONE in Scottsdale does that. Keep on Keepin on Bevvy! You're crushing it."}
{"text":"Bevvy is one of the best hot spots in Old Town Scottsdale!! Not only do they have an amazing brunch, but it's one of my favorite places to hit up for a fun night out. The atmosphere is amazing, the servers/bartenders are on point and the manager Cam is the bomb! Not to mention his beard is ridiculously awesome! If your looking for a good time and good people, this is the place to go! #TeamBevvy"}
{"text":"We were in from out of town staying at The W. Decided to go to the cowgirl bar next door to Bevy to see cowgirls. Sat at their bar for at least 5 minutes in the middle of the day, and no one so much as said, \"Hi\", or \"Hi there, we'll be with you in a few minutes.\" Nothing. So after about 10 minutes we had to leave on principal alone. So next-door to Bevy we went. Sat down at their bar and prayed for something better. Not only did we get something better, but something rare and stellar. Quick greeting and quick to get us a drink. Thank you. And then . . . what you almost never see, the bartender extends his arm across the bar and says, \"Hi, I'm Steve. How are you guys?\" Great service. Healthy food options at a bar - also awesome. Needless to say we returned more times during our vacation there."}
{"text":"I was here last night for the U of A vs. ASU game. As a Wildcat alumn, I had the best time even with a large crowd. The drinks are fairly priced, and the bartenders were fun and prompt. I'll definitely be going to Bevvy for all the games! One of my favorite places in old town by far."}
{"text":"Love this bar!  The decor is very inviting and the music was at the perfect level.  But the staff was phenomenal.  Chris is one of the nicest bartenders I have ever experienced.  The food was very good and large portions.  Will definitely go there again!!!!!"}
{"text":"New home away from home for football games. Moved to the valley from Boston and am glad I found this place. Love being with likeminded people to watch the Patriots. Got here around 9:30am on Sunday for a 10am game. It was crowded, but not overly so. Ended up coming back later in the day to eat after watching a couple other games elsewhere. Food wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either... and I was starving. I'll definitely be back for the East coast game day ambiance if nothing else."}
{"text":"Quick update to say that the pretzels are now at top notch level. It is only $5 for two hot pretzels with two dipping sauces. This is a much better version that the old style they served which was cut-up. These are a must try and the happy hour beer prices are also still excellent. Always a friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Terrible service from 3 out of the 6 behind the bar. Practically have to beg for their attention, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices.  Their Bevvy burger is delish and during happy hour it comes with fries or tots for only 5 bucks.  I also loved the HH deal if $3 beers and well drinks.  

The only challenge I had was the volume the music was turned to at 7 pm.  I suppose it may be that I'm older, but if you don't have dancing, then let me have a conversation with my table mates without using my cheerleader voice.  I know in that area, loud music helps draw people in, but I literally couldn't hear anything anyone was saying unless they were yelling.  It was a good time to end our evening. 

Overall, I would recommend it for a great night starter. Or even for lunch to kick off some day drinking."}
{"text":"Bevvy is like this... mystical place where you're genuinely greeted after a long, terrible day at work and everyone there knows what you need before you even ask. The staff are such caring and tentative people. This place holds a special place in my heart. My previous boss/friend Joe loved bringing everyone to Bevvy after work to get drinks, unwind,vent about our day, whatever we needed. He's no longer with us so we come to Bevvy to remember him and have a good time in his honor and simply have fun. 

The food is always hot, really well prepared and priced perfectly. (to anyone reading this, get some wings!)

The superstar staff is one of many reasons I keep coming back. I had a conversation with Graham one weekend about a few of the rules and regulations that are followed by some members of the weekend staff and he addressed all of my concerns in detail (as much as possible) and it made me feel so much better. The company that I work for has office Happy Hours here often, which can be about 100-150 people. Never have we felt ignored or forgotten. Bronwyn is by far the best server I've had at any restaurant. So personable and kind. I had actually ran into her a week after the first time she served my friend an I and she remembered me, came up to me and my friends to warmly greet us and ask how our week was. Then, even knowing that we weren't in her section she immediately went to let our server know we were sat down. That leads me to talk about Jessie, who is just magical. Always smiling, jocular, tentative. I'm telling you, you've got 10's across the board. 

Companies/Businesses that REALLY value their people and value their customers will ALWAYS have regulars and will ALWAYS be around. 

Thank you for what you've created here in little ol' Old Town."}
{"text":"First time here was on a Wednesday evening during happy hour.  I was lucky to find parking close by which was a great start to the evening.  Upon entering you cant help but notice the sunken bar and the great light fixtures, which made it bright but not in a bad way.  They have tvs everywhere and when you are sitting in a booth you always have a great view.  The patio is large and dog friendly and with tvs so you can watch the big game.  

The Happy Hour is really quite amazing for an Old Town Scottsdale location.  $5 Burger and a side, 1/2 off all appetizers AND salads, $3 beer and well drinks from 4-7!!!

The menu has a great variety of bar food and also healthier options which I really appreciate.  We tried the popcorn which is made with bacon fat and has crisp bacon pieces throughout, OMG so good.  The house made red pepper hummus and veggies was delicious, slightly chunky and really fresh veggies.  The wings looked good but I didnt try them.  I had a Bevvy Salad which had chicken, goat cheese dates and the freshest pieces of avocado I have ever had at a restaurant.  It was large enough to share and at $7 a real bargain and very yummy.  They offer weekend brunch with mimosas and bloody marys and a variety of dishes for $10 each, I am looking forward to trying it out.

There are 2 large Jenga games, a large Connect Four, a mini shuffleboard and a photo booth in the back of the restaurant as well.

The owner, Lauren, is very kind and you can just tell she loves her restaurant and cares what each patron thinks good or bad, so say hi when you go in!

Looking forward to coming back many more times and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Love the food and the environment and My favorite place to watch football games and the UFC. Different than the rest of the block, fun and always a good time. ~B~"}
{"text":"Update 9/23/17
So I was surprised to see a response from a Bevvy manager or owner?  Either way I am appreciative they read and responded.  For that I will give them another go as we've had a great time here in the past.  

We've been here before and nothing out of the ordinary.  We know coming here on a Friday or Saturday night you will be dealing with crowds and you have to be strategic in getting your drinks.  Any of the bars in the area we can have a good time and Bevvy has been fun in the past.  But this place stuck out for one reason this past weekend.  We attended the \"I love the 90's beer crawl\" and Bevvy was one of the participating bars.  Each bar had their own drink specials and times.  Some went from 2pm - 10 pm, some from 2pm -3pm and after 7pm.  So we were spending at every place and we came back around to Bevvy.  I admittedly got drink specials mixed up and ordered a Green Tea shot.  Never had one but figured we'd try all the drink specials from each participating bar.  After finally getting the bartenders attention I announced \"2 green tea shots\". Blonde Bartender with attitude looks at me, mutters something, turns and makes drinks.  As I was getting mixed up with other bars that had $5.00 green tea shots, I fork out a $20.00 and hand to Blonde Attitude when she presents drinks.  She slams them down, snatches $20.00 and disappears.  So I'm now standing their waiting for change.  She reappears, no eye contact nothing just refuses to acknowledge I'm trying to get her attention.  Finally she storms over \"What!\"  I calmly ask if she's getting my change.  She immediately fires back \"wrong bar, wrong drink hunny!\"  No big deal but she knew full well with her immediate and explosive remark I was wrong.  Could of simply said \"Sir, we don't have that special\".  Was there all afternoon with the typical crowds and Blonde Attitude was the nastiest bartender we encountered.  I tried one more time to get clarification and she goes on another rant \"listen hunny, it's f-ng loud in here, I know what the fk I'm doing hunny, blah blah blah, and by the way this shizz ended at 7:00pm hunny.\"  (Event ended at 10:00pm, was 8:00 pm at that time). My wife had just walked up before BA's rant and even though she is a business professional, sweet and has common courtesy this did not set well with her.  I had to restrain her from jumping over the bar and giving sassy mouth a old fashioned whooping.  

So my advice to Bevvy bartender.  
1.  If you don't like crowds, noise or stress, you probably aren't in the right profession or location.
2.  Customer service for you equates tips.  We actually tip well.  Not for you of course.
3.  Don't call patrons hunny if you don't know them.  It's disrespectful.
4.  Your language was uncalled for and hope you went home and washed your mouth out with soap.

Other than Blonde Attitude, Bevvy has been fun in the past, but this was also our second time having issues with a rude employee at this location.  So we won't be back.  Plenty other places to go to."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Always receive phenomenal service!!  Obviously a very well run establishment."}
{"text":"Despite this place being a U of A bar, (I went to ASU), I have to give them 5 stars. The food is delicious, the drinks are great ant not super expensive and the staff has always been friendly. I've been there for happy hours during the week, on party times at night, to watch sports games (soccer, football, basketball, baseball) and they never fail to show everyone a good time.

My go-to for lunch: Bevvy classic with a coke. It's good, it's cheap and it's healthy. Drink-wise...so many options! Whatever you like to drink, they have it.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Staff was great and food was excellent! Nothing but good things to say about this place. It has a great overall design and really welcoming staff that made you feel excited to be there! I will be returning soon :)"}
{"text":"Let me clear on a couple things. 

1. I came here to watch a football game as this was listed as the Alumnus Bar for the University of Michigan and not to start my evening before touring Old Town. 
2. We were sequestered outside, which between the occasional cluster of party-goers, as opposed to Michigan (or Iowa) fans, meant we were exposed to a litany of smells (horse manure on the sidewalk, just beyond the railing) and the occasional customer who insisted on standing behind us (depsite there being hardly any room).
3. The service was pretty consistent, even when we stuck to water in lieu of alcohol. 
4. The game in question was during the evening. So it's unclear if a DJ would be present, which might mitigate some of the observations listed below.

Pros:
Menu. The menu is everything you'd expect from a bar, as it relates to 'pub' food. Albeit the Wedge was drowning in Bleu Cheese dressing, while the Pretzel appetizer had the right amount of sauce.
Beer. The draft selection was your usual Budweiser / Guinness list, with a smattering of 'craft'.  Independents included Deschutes (Fresh Squeezed), Huss (Scottsdale Blonde). Eventually, I switched to PBR as drinking pints of craft beer was getting expensive.

Cons:
Volume. As we were outside and under the speakers, this removed a star from the overall rating, as the bar insisted on giving the DJ airtime, during the commercial breaks. Imagine watching a football game, the roar of the crowd, and then wham! dubstep or Kid Rock blaring into your skull. 
Crowds. If you're looking for a comfortable seating experience, don't go here. On several occasions, the table to our left continued to accommodate more of their fans while leaving little room for my spouse to move. Needless to say, the staff who were walking around took no interest in ensuring proper seating per table.

Overall.
As a visiting alum, who only wished to be around like-minded alums, I will more than likely not returning, unless one of them can assure me that morning/afternoon games are nothing like what I experienced that evening. 

If on the other hand, you enjoy loud music, attendance so dense that a fire marshall would squeal with glee, then you'll fit right in. 

-Re-visit to be determined."}
{"text":"Bevvy blows my socks off. Wildcat bar, giant jenga, and I can win free drinks all night by killing it on skee-ball. Brunch is bomb and the mimosas keep coming into the late afternoon. Hell, even the bathroom attendant is a chill guy. But let me tell you the real reason to go to this old town fountain, manager Cam Byram and his glorious beard. I've known this cat for years and he consistently works hard, smiles big, and always makes sure that you and your crew are having the greatest time possible. Honestly, I would come see him wherever he works, but the Byram/Bevvy combo is a beautiful thing and should be on the list of must-see's for anyone looking to enjoy themselves in old town Scottsdale. Trust me. Just do it."}
{"text":"We popped in here to meet friends last Friday night and had an absolute blast! The drinks were inexpensive for Old Town prices and the music was fantastic. Not to mention, the guys were happy because they had sports on the TVs! Bevvy is the perfect bar to bring friends and I can assure you that everyone will have a blast! It has a more casual, laid back vibe than other bars in the area. We'll be back soon! Next Wednesday, to be exact. :)"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that Bevvy is my FAVORITE bar in Old Town. The friendliest staff, great music, 10/10 service, and THE BEST FOOD! There's healthy options for those of you that hate the typical burger and fry's bar food. Speaking of friendly staff, my favorite bartender would have to be Graham, he's the best! 
10/10 recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"They have oversized games like Jenga and connect four. It's designed very neat, there is a dart board, which is fun. I understand bars are loud but I could barely hear myself think. I love the American flag couch! My friend tried a blueberry Moscow mule and loved it!"}
{"text":"Horrible service visiting from down town place. I would never recommend this place to my worst enemies. Please do not visit this establishment unless you want to be harassed by over bearing security that creates there life goal to be bullies. Do not go here! Tip from a Las Vegas resident visiting."}
{"text":"Definitely worth your time. Great food, friendly people and good times! Watched U of M Football there and really enjoyed the experience. Go Bevvy... Go Blue!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot, bartenders greet you with a smile and are pleasent to interact with. I always get my drinks quickly and they are fairly consistent.  DJ there is also really good, always a great time here."}
{"text":"Really cool place to watch sports, play games, or enjoy food. Would definitely go back especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Scottsdale and can't believe how much this area has changed over the years. Bevvy is in the heart of the downtown entertainment district. They are a neighborhood gastropub run by Evening Entertainment Group (RnR, HiFi Kitchen + Cocktails) and one of the only licensed off-track horse racing betting pubs in AZ. I really like their spacious patio area, leather booths, wood-paneled walls and the variety of TV screens and yard games throughout the bar. They have killer happy hour prices and a food menu that includes a variety of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, salads and bowls. I've only been here for drinks but love coming here to watch sports highlights. Try one of their mules - they are delicious. If you want to channel your inner Tom Hanks and see your future, they have one of those Zoltar machines on hand (they still creep me out). Their patio area is pretty spacious and dog friendly. Only bummer for me is that they are the headquarters for the New England Patriots and that Tucson team during football season. Check out their second location in uptown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Came to Bevvy for business lunch. The bartender named Aubrey, I think, was very friendly, entertaining  and took great care of us. Food great, service great, and she's not bad to look at either. I highly recommend it, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I visited Bevvy during happy hour with co-workers and absolutely love their sriracha honey BBQ wings for $10! They were perfectly cooked and the flavor of the sauce was on point. Not too spicy which was a okay with me. The bar itself is just the right amount of divey where you can feel comfortable taking a date or hanging out with friends. They've got a bunch of fun games such as skee ball, giant connect four, jenga and kitschy decor that adds lots of character. Although I don't drink alcohol I felt right at home and really enjoyed the hour we spent there together hanging out!"}
{"text":"The staff are unreasonable rude discriminatory people. Would never go back and never recommend anyone to go there. Truly not worth any price of the drink or the awful staff. This is my first negative review on yelp and feel it necessary to share."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Tuesday from work. I got the fish and chips. The chips were yum - shoe string pepper fries.. The fried fish was alright. I think it was too dark brown because of the extra frying.

My colleagues ordered a salad, tater tots, and hummus with veggies.

Paid a total of $40 before gratuity."}
{"text":"Not bad food or service. I came here a few times to watch hockey playoffs. It was usually empty during the week so it WAS fun to go. They might have hired a new guy bartender/bar back (super short guy with brownish hair) ? Was the rudest human I've ever met. Although we were being served by a really really nice girl, this bartender went out of his way to make rude comments because of the jersey I was wearing at the restaurant. He continued to make comments about the team I came to THEIR restaurant to watch. Pens still won the Stanley cup :) so thanks jerk!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks in addition to a great staff. Always an amazing experience when I go here!"}
{"text":"I genuinely love this sports bar. Bevvy was the first real classy bar I went to when I moved out to Scottsdale back in August. I went late night with a friend and the atmosphere was what sold me. All the employees worked really well together, drinks came fast & tasted great, the photo booth is a thoughtful touch, & the HD mirrors in the bathrooms are the best place to take a selfie - or group shot with your bestie :) I also really appreciated the DJ. I love to dance & I couldn't help but feel the music all night! Idk if it was the drinks or the DJ - probs a combo of both lol. 

I later came back to dine there & Bevvy has a great menu - they offer a protein bowl and a ton of other healthy options. and just a side note - I'm extremely picky when it comes to eggs at a restaurant & their eggs are phenomenal, for being a sports bar I was shocked. I just really like Bevvy & I will keep going back :) thanks guys - seriously keep it up :)"}
{"text":"Great location, extensive drink menu and amazing pretzels with a cheese and mustard dip!  We came in when it was the former bar and loved it, so decided to try out the new iteration of Bevvy and enjoyed it just as much.  Great atmosphere, lots of TV's to watch sports, extensive drink menu and attentive bar service too."}
{"text":"I've been here three times ...  once Friday during happy hour, once Friday after happy hour {which ends at 7} and to watch the super bowl. 

Compared to its neighbors, the crowd here is a bit more mature, relaxed and down to just have a good time rather than the goal to get s^*% faced. 

Personally I appreciate the sports on TV and awesome music overhead all the while being able to play connect 4 or Jenga (huge boards) 

The food is delicious (burgers all the way) and the servers do their best to keep up with the table service. 

//cheers//"}
{"text":"I was only in town for a really brief period, so having been to bevvy three separate times must be saying something. Especially in this district of Scottsdale with bars lining the streets. Proceed reading with this knowledge, though: I'm a teetotaler, so I can't say a dang thing about the drinks.

What I can report on, though, is that the place is totally chill. The check-in offer alone is worth the trip: when we visited the check-in offer on Yelp was a free mustache ride. There's a mechanical horse out front named \"Mustache\" and you get token to take a ride. If that wasn't enough, it's all set to the tune of \"Pony\" by Ginuwine. Well played.

Inside, it's a spacious place that rides that fine line between upscale hipster precious, and dive bar. It's definitely not either of those things. But you don't pay a premium for weird muddled things served up by dudes in suspenders. Yet you're not exactly in Bud Light territory either. Hard to explain, but you can get a simple well drink here and spread out among the tables with a group of pals and feel right at home. Or sit at the bar and hang out like we did the first night. Your call.

No scene, no hype, no presh. Drinks. Maybe catch a happy hour for some light snacks and easy drinks."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying our waitress did a good job, she was friendly and attentive. The food was also pretty good but based off of our experience, I would never come back. First off, our booth was covered in crumbs when we went to sit down. Then, I ordered a beer and they either had the wrong tap label or the keg was bad because it was definitely not what I ordered. Our server immediately got me another one and it was the same taste. She didn't charge me for the beer, but I was still disappointed I couldn't get the right beer at a bar. Then, as we were waiting for our food (we sat right by the food window) we watched the manager (I assume) eat a French fry off one of our plates before they got served to us. I have never witnessed something so blatantly unprofessional and disgusting in any restaurant. To top it all off there were flies everywhere when we were trying to eat, we had to keep shooing them off our food. When we paid our bill, we made sure to let our waitress know what happened with the guy eating our food. He overheard us telling her and tried to say there's a side plate sitting in the window for employees to eat off of. Even if that were the case, it is still completely unprofessional and not to mention a health violation to eat and then serve food without washing your hands."}
{"text":"I love their weekday special here. The $5 burger is definitely more than worth it. Then you tack on some $1 sides, what a deal! There are two reasons it falls short of five stars. The happy hour beer special is set up so that you actually pay more per ounce if you get the bigger beer. I'm sure a lot of people just go bigger because that usually means they're getting more for less, if the management is aware of this then they're exploiting people's expectations. The second reason is the guy tending bar when I popped in here one Friday night around 9 was rude. We were the only customers and he acted like we were an inconvenience. All that said, I'll be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place Is like the Chuck Norris of restaurants it always hits the spot and never lets you down. As I went there for my goodbye lunch today(My people love me). My buddy William (White Hat) was joking with the group how he had ordered the healthiest thing on the menu (because he's a professional CrossFit athlete)When the server brought his meal to the table he made a joke as well and said \"who ordered the healthiest thing on the menu\". Little things like that make this more the just your typical Scottsdale bar. The food is like a cornucopia of bursting goodness into your mouth. With juicy flavor in over the top presentation it's like the Bobby Flay of bar food. Almost everyone at the table had the rice bowl with added chicken. One person which will remain nameless Kelsey got no chicken(she doesn't care about them gainz). Every time I have gone there it's like watching ASU lose. It doesn't matter how many times it happens it's always a great experience. Also this place has a great ceiling. The one tip I would give anybody going here on Lunch.  Make sure you let your staff know how much time you have some times their turnaround time is long."}
{"text":"Some of the best food on the block  they offer a range of delish to healthy options...the jalape√±o poppers are a personal fav ;) Also, the green tea shots come in cute little tea cups!"}
{"text":"Today's version of Cheers. This prime time, centrally located establishment offers all the entertainment you need for a great night out. From near full meal dining to late bites like gourmet popcorn, Bevvy will get you ready."}
{"text":"Chris is honestly the best bartender I have ever met. I was not sure what I wanted to drink and he made me the most delicious drink. I recommend that everyone stop here and ask for chris when in Scottsdale! Love this bar!"}
{"text":"Ioana is the best.. Rice bowl with Salmon on point. Mixed Berry cobbler for the finish line."}
{"text":"Very nice looking bar/restaurant , nice lighting and music . Drinks were $8 each , pretty affordable for a place like Scottsdale , even though the bartender (Chris) was dealing with some difficult guests he took care of us well , he got me a juice for free . 

Ladies : the bathroom here is the best photoshoot place ! I took a few good 
  
5 stars not only but my review but because one of my friends forgot his credit card there and he just got it back . ;)"}
{"text":"First of all, I hate writing bad reviews. Alright here it goes... This has been a long time coming since I've been to Bevvy multiple times and have ALWAYS had BAD service so I figured my review was due. I know what you're thinking \"well why does she keep going back,\" well the answer is my FRIENDS! We went on a SLOW Saturday afternoon, sat on the patio with literally 5 other people besides our party of 3. Everything started fine until we received our food. All 3 food orders were wrong! We then waited 10 minutes until I finally got up to find our waitress to tell her that our food orders were wrong. She then blamed it on the cooks (it's always a team effort, take some responsibility.) Then she refused to come to our table after our encounter. My friend had to get up again and find her to get our check after waiting 30 minutes after initially requesting it. It gets better... After we paid, she rushed to see how much we tipped her. As I was walking out the door she asked if we had bad service (probably because she saw her tip, which I still tipped her 18%, which is really low for me since I also work in the industry), I admittedly said YES! She then says \"You obviously don't come around here cuz that's how it is.\" (WHAT?!!) My question is, why do these servers in that area of Old Town think they deserve even 18% if they know that they aren't doing their job? You're a server who gets paid off of tips so if you want a big tip, DO your job! It's simple! Thanks for reading! I hope this place improves because it definitely has potential and the food WAS pretty good."}
{"text":"On the rare occasion that I decide to venture beyond Wasted Grain and into Old Town, Bevvy is usually my go-to. While it's in \"the circle\" of the entertainment district, it tends to be moderately more chill than it's neighbors (Bottled, District, Hefe, Etc.) My favorite thing about this place used to be the check-in offer for a rubber ducky shot, but I think they've changed it to be a ride on some kid's toy that they keep on the sidewalk outside of the bar. (Bummer.)

As to the atmosphere, it's pretty crazy on the weekends, and on Thursday nights, they do trivia, which is actually pretty entertaining, chill and fun! I've never consumed anything solid here, so I can't speak to their food, but the drinks are pretty standard. Service is better here than at a lot of the places in Old Town, and they've got a few fun bar games. If the rubber duckies make a comeback, I probably will too. As silly as it was, it was my favorite thing about this place because everyone was surprised by and loved it!"}
{"text":"This place was an absolute disaster tonight.  If the Fire Marshall knew about the amount of people that were in this place, he probably would have shut it down.  In addition to it exceeding maximum capacity, the patrons were classless.  People were slamming their empty beer bottles down on the table where I was eating my dinner and asking to use my chair to hang their purses and hats.  The music was also so loud you had to scream at the person seated next to you.  Never again Bevvy."}
{"text":"I have never in my life been discriminated against from using a bathroom. I walked in to this establishment with my African American friends. Dude comes up to me saying there's no public restrooms and that I had to leave unless I'm buying drinks. I had every intention of buying a drink but not now. Fuck this place! Insulting and tried to raise his voice talking to me like a little kid. I'm a well educated woman."}
{"text":"Come for the Mustache rides, stay for the skee-ball! 

Seriously, the check in offer here gets you a coin to ride the mechanical horse Mustache that plays Ginuwine's Pony. You don't need too much additional information about Bevvy to determine whether or not it's your type of place. It's not like \"Free Mustache rides...hmmm, maybe, but it depends on what wines they carry.\" 

If you're looking for a quite or intimate spot you probably want to keep searching. But for happy hour, a night out with single friends, or just fun place to catch a game, Bevvy is awesome. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and the service is actually super attentive. 

I'll definitely be back for pre-season baseball. I just hope the mustache rides are still free by then."}
{"text":"If it was any one of these, I would not care, but all of this together suggests the management here is lack.  

To get my beer it took 15 minutes.  The waitress passed my drink a number of times as it sat alone on the bar.  I eventually asked someone else to grab it.  

My food order, chicken fingers and fries, took about 45 minutes.  People who ordered well after me got their food before I.  

I was at a table of 3.  The lady at my table received the wrong order all together and the other guy had a burger that was 50% well done and 50% raw.  Not sure how that happenes, but it did.  

They did give us a free shot and I a beer.   The manager never stopped by.  You'd think he'd want to show his face, but maybe that is why all the issues took place as he may be too distant to help solution issues. 

I won't return."}
{"text":"I came here for a football Sunday. We got the $15 champagne bucket. Great atmosphere and staff. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is always one of my favorite spots. Love the bartenders and servers, especially today! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Walked into this place a week ago.  $3 wells for HH. Sweet.  Music ....... Live for HH.  Today had the $5 burger ..... Very very good.  Great place so nice inside.  Staff very friendly.  Music awesome.  So cool and just down to earth. Am I really in Old Town ????"}
{"text":"Amazing spot for Saturday or Sunday brunch, usually pretty busy so keep that in mind! $15 bottles of champagne from 10-3 and reverse happy hour from 7-close! They also have a great variety of week day food & beverage specials! Fun spot in a trendy area."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. 

Where do I start? 
1. Sunday Funday- 2pm, few table, very slow. (I think perfect, let's get some lunch)
2. We order 3 bottles of champagne 5 glasses and water .. server brings 3 glasses no water 
3. 10 min later she returns with one more glass, no water 
4. 10 min later she brings another glass, no water ... we order and remind her of the water. 
5. Our food arrives 20 min later, WRONG. I ordered the \"The Chick\" she wrote down \"chicken strips\" so they return all the food .. what? 
6. 15 min later my order is corrected and brought out with everyone else food, now there's is cold. still NO WATER
7. We have no silverware, and still no water. 
8. We ask for more orange juice for our champagne .. she literally brings a cup for 5 people. 
9. Again, we've been here for over an hour and I ask politely again, \"can we please get some water....\"
10. Water finally arrives ... YAY
11. Bus boy comes over to pick up plates and knocked my mimosa over - ALL OVER ME
12. He returns and dumps a stack of cocktail napkins in front of me, barely made eye contact .. barley an apology 
13. Our server is MIA .. oh wait, she's taking pics and hugging on some dude , no worries, we'll wait. 14. We wait for our check, try to pay and spend another 30 min waiting for her to figure out her \"New POS SYSTEM\" 
15. It's now 5:30 pm. 3.5 hours later .. SHIT SERVICE, decent food. Will never ever return."}
{"text":"Best place in the valley for watching Michigan football!  

The staff is always very friendly and not pushy. They let you watch the game and enjoy the atmosphere. 

Prices are ok and I wish they had a larger selection of craft beers but the Mazie and Blue fans throughout the bar make up for that short coming."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale for the first time and came to the Entertainment District blindly for a night out. Honestly, we came to Bevvy because it was the only place that didn't have a long ass line at midnight. BUT we ended up staying until closing and coming back the next night even after visiting other bars. If you're looking for a place to dress casual but want to dance and have a good time, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO! The DJ plays a good mix of songs from a variety of genres and everyone ends up singing along to pretty much every song. Seriously, shout out to the DJ."}
{"text":"Truthfully, I have only been here once on a Sunday to join up with a friend for my sisters Bday. 

It was verrry slow and nearly empty while we were there.  This place seems chill though - it's essentially just your standard bar - no hype, no dance floor, what you see is what you get...

The music seemed alright ... I heard the food is decent.  

I am giving it two stars because they have skee-ball ... How flippin' cool is that!?!?  They do have darts, but it's lame when you have to pay to play darts @ a bar :( 

I will update this review if I ever return... But I really didn't see anything super fun nor do I know a lot of people that come here..."}
{"text":"Our server Camille on a Monday was amazing! Fantastic service and delicious drinks. The only bar that will actually be busy on a Monday"}
{"text":"Big fan of the Sunday brunch here, especially the sangria bar. It's a great way to finish off the weekend. The burgers are good too, my personal favorite is the hangover burger with a fried egg (actual hangover not required thankfully)"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. This place is REALLY loud, full of drunken bro-brahs, and totally not my style; but I can't begrudge them for that. If that's your cup of tea, it's a good choice."}
{"text":"Okay Lauren if that is what you guys are saying and if that makes you feel better about your place and lets you sleep at night. There was no need for him to do what YOU claim he did. He had and has money, if you considered it theft, hmmm why didn't you call the police? Just excuses, they warned us about that place, should have listened. Just by you saying that I should sue you with defamation. But like I said no need for the money."}
{"text":"I previously gave this place very high rating.  I admit that most of the bartenders I've had here are amazing. The food is rather good, the prices are high compared to most other parts of the valley but not too bad for Scottsdale.  I recently found that some of the bartenders are much, much nicer than others. There is a particular bartender I have in mind that I will not point out that's been less nice to me for reasons I am unaware of. The other bartenders are still absolutely sweet to me which leaves me baffled as to what this one persons issue is with me. It's because of my repeated bad experiences and I have to drop the points for my review. It's gotten to the point where I am seriously not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service, sat here for 35 minutes before we got 4 beverages, completely ignored when we asked to speak to the manager, server was rude and non-responsive. We just came from Bottled Blonde who was packed and still had great service. This place wasn't busy at all and still had terrible service and then  when we asked to be compensated for free foe the wait, they ignored our request. Will not come back."}
{"text":"I came here to dine and the food and service was pretty good. I came here at night and the bouncer was very rude. Not only did I give him three forms of ID but he made me pull up my Facebook and check my birthday too. After it was all said and done and proved my age in multiple ways he still stared at me rudely and was hesitant to let me in. I understand that people can sneak in with fake IDs sometimes but after I proved my age in multiple ways, I think an apology would have been nice. I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"You want a drunk palace to turn up with friends? This is your place. Great service and always the best music."}
{"text":"Bevvy is the best bar in old town. Great staff and great environment. Meagan is the best server! Rubber ducky shots are the bees knees. BLACK OUT"}
{"text":"RACIST ESTABLISHMENT!!!!! IF YOU ARE BLACK BE PREPARED TO GE TREATED LIKE A THREAT!!!! I will be fair and say that not all employees racially profile. Actually a lot of them are nice in the day time... once it gets party time in the evening good luck black folks!! I went last night and I'm in total shock STILL. I live in the Stetsons and have spent a lot of money at Bevvys. Last night I went with a friend to the bar and when the blonde came to our side after I'd patiently been waiting and helped a guy who pushed up in front of me I said \"awh no fair dude\" to the guy... she then turns to me and goes completely off telling me I'm yelling at her (I wasn't even talking to her) and literally leaves and comes back to talk shit to me several times. It was unreal. Every time she came to me I calmly said to her \"I'm not yelling at you I can barely hear you\"... I'm talking to my friend embarrassed at this point like \"I don't know what's up with her she's like trying to start a problem with me\". I am then out of nowhere being approached by SECURITY who aggressively puts his hands on me as if I'm being belligerent and I have to ask him to stop touching me. He continues on until I am outside and threatens me with the police to which I respond \"I literally haven't done a single thing I'd LOVE for the police to come\" in fact thank god there was an officer observing me being calm and the security being insane and the office politely taps me and says \"just come over here sweetheart\".... as I'm being KICKED out for NO reason my friend was still at the bar super confused and the same blonde ask him if he's leaving too and that I was being attitudey with her which he thought was insane. BEING A BLACK WOMAN DOES NOT MAKE ME INTIMIDATING AND ATTITUDEY!! How dare she!? BEVVYS IS NOT WELCOMING TO BLACKS!!!!! If I seen that bartender right now I would literally ask her calmly what was the problem & she'd have no reason!! I never raised my voice (besides being in a loud ass bar) I never cursed at her I never called her out her name I never bothered her once... THEN TO TOP IT OFF ONE OF THE PROMOTER ASSHOLES TOOK PICTURES OF ME ON HIS PHONE! What the entire hell? I will absolutely pursue this further. I'm still so shocked I was treated this way. I'm
Mortified."}

Well first off we decided to come to Bevvy for Preakness after first coming for the Kentucky Derby. We thought hey this is a super cool place looks like it has changed a lot from the previous owners. But oh boy were we proven wrong by the servers and the \"managing partner\".

The story is we had arrived at Bevvy today at around 11am, the races didn't start for a few hours. We had reserved a table which we were well aware was going to be $300 when we had reserved it, that's not the issue. When we arrived everyone was scrambling to figure out what table we belonged at. So we finally get a table and sit down, once we get that table, sit and order our food and drinks, we're moved within 20 minutes. Lovely. This is just the beginning of a wonderful experience.. At this point I can tell. 

So after this we get out unlimited mimosas, and we order a second round of food for the other half of the table. At this point we are an hour in and the bottle of premium liquor that we were promised still has not shown up..So we wait patiently and the second half of the table gets there food within minutes, the first half has been waiting for about an hour now. No one knows that we have been waiting, and the waitress does not care. It took another waitress coming up to us asking if we needed anything to figure out that we were missing half a table of food. This is still after several people tried to walk up and serve us the wrong plates. 

Once we had gotten that all was fine, it started getting busy, we are full and just getting drinks. So 3pm rolls around and we are told the unlimited mimosas are done. That's fine, the races are going to start and we are ready to head out. That's when the server walks up and says, \"So there is a $300 minimum on a table...\" Oh... Okay.. we didn't realize that and this was because the \"managing partner\" did not communicate that.. Probably because it was so formal and mostly over text message (sarcasm). So at this point we have not received $300 worth of food or service and we refuse to pay this. At this point the server is so rude and short with us (although we disclosed that we would take care of her because it wasn't her fault.). 

We ended up leaving a $65 dollar tab on a $100 dollar bill. She told us we had to immediately leave because we didn't pay for the table. As I walk away I look around and see other tables paying their $30 tabs between 6 different cards and apparently that is just fine. Well that's wonderful, I'll let 
everyone know not to head over to Bevvy because apparently table minimum is $300.. Well for us I guess.. We were the lucky ones that were the exception because we had chosen to reserve a table. Like I said $300, not a big deal.. But I expect $300 worth of service and to be told that my table did not have a bottle. In the end we had gotten the minimum waived, and to be greeted, moving forward, by the snarkiest, most rude server. 

All-in-all I see that although this place has changed ownership it has not changed it's employees or management which was about %85 of the previous problem and why derby no longer stands to exist. I hope that something is done about your rude, ignorant, and predatory staff because I for one will not be back and I will be sure to let anyone I know going to old town to avoid this place like the plague. 

You have minimal reviews on this place and it is going to look like derby did in a few months if it continues. Good concept, could be amazing if the management actually cared. 

Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I stopped by Bevvy for the first time this evening for a Yelp event, and I was delighted to learn how much fun the place is!  Bevvy is \"an English Gastropub with a few modern American twists\".  From Mustache Rides (tip: check in on Yelp!) to games outside on the tape (Connect Four, anyone?) to television after television, there's something fun for everyone.  I think I even saw some board games sitting by the front door.  I look forward to coming back to Bevvy now that we're in the heat of college basketball season, especially as March Madness gets closer.  Plus, this is a great location next to other clubs, bars, and restaurants in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  

The food and drinks are delicious!  Plus, the service is superb.  Over the evening, those I was with and I were asked if we needed anything time after time.  At other places, it could be a challenge to have someone check on us more than once.  I highly recommend the Loaded Popped Corn (applewood smoked bacon fat popcorn with parmesan cheese).  In addition to a full menu, there is a nice brunch menu and a happy hour menu with lots of special deals!  While it's out of my price range, they do have a Bevvy Champagne Breakfast with two applewood smoked bacon wrapped corn dogs and a bottle of Dom Perignon Vintage 2004 for $250!  

There are also some great special events that take place.  If I would have made it to 8 PM this evening (Wednesday), I could have taken part in Game Night!  Happy Hours are weekdays from 4-7 PM, and Saturday is Adult Power Hour from 7-9 PM.  Reservations can easily be made on their website (http://bevvyaz.com) or on Open Table.  

So if you're up for a fun time at a gastropub, this is your place!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Bevvy several times during the brunch and night life hours. I have never had an issue until my last trip there, and because of that I will not be returning. I am appalled at how I was treated by our server Marcie. 

My friend ordered the 60/40 burger and received a Bevvy burger instead. When he mentioned to the waitress that he had gotten the wrong burger, she stated that he did not in fact order the 60/40 and he ordered the Bevvy. She informed us that the manager said he could not get a new patty, but that she could bring him bacon and avocado. As for the items he did not like, he could \"scrape them off of the burger\". I have never heard of something like that being said to a customer before. When I asked her if I could speak to the manager, she said \"why are you so upset? This isn't your problem\". Considering the fact that I was paying for the items ordered, it was my problem. She also lied to my face saying that she never said he could not have a new burger when I was present for the entire interaction. Wow! I have never been treated that way by a server before, nor was I rude in any way when asking to see the manager. I simply wanted the problem to be corrected. She then proceeded to walk over to the hostess table, tell the hostess the issue, and I sat there while both of them discussed it and stared at our table. I do not think that bringing a new burger to a table who were spending a lot of money there should be that much of an issue. In my eyes, the customer should always be right. Regardless, the way we were treated was unacceptable and completely uncalled for. If you don't know how to treat customers, don't work in customer service.

In the end, they did replace the burger. That is why I am giving two stars."}
{"text":"I came here as part of a bachelorette celebration and we all had a great time! It was on a Thursday night and there was still a good amount of people there. The atmosphere was fun.They had skee ball that we all played. The bartenders were nice and attentive. It was a great place to go out with some friends.

Also, thank you for showing us a good time, Scottsdale! Whenever people saw my friend's bacholerette sash, they treated us to drinks the whole night!"}
{"text":"We ubered 10 miles to get to this part of town to have a fun night. 
We were turned away at the door because my daughter's fiance was wearing camo shorts. We consider this to be anti american!!! Very disappointed to be discriminated against"}
{"text":"Came from houston....8 Guys...asked one of the bartenders to turn on TNT for conf finals on 2 TV close to us ...GS vs Hou...shouldn't t be big thing ..but he said \"I cant turn all the TV on for that game ...yea kinda bitchy I'm guessing for a dude ...everything else was ok ...bill 244 ..gave 300 total ...so still tip her well"}
{"text":"Ioana has exceptional guest awareness I was in for my friends bachelor party, immediately she took great care of us being in the business it's great to know that people still cared for and needs are anticipated.. Thank you"}
{"text":"Bevvy is awesome! Great food, fair prices, fun atmosphere. I love going for trivia on Wednesday nights, brunch, and U of A basketball games. It's also a great spot to take an out of town visitor to really get a feel for the best side of Old Town Scottsdale. Definitely 5 star worthy!"}
{"text":"Bevvy is my go-to place in Old Town! (Mostly to see my favorite bartender Graham Engdall). Usually I go out mostly to get my drank on, but this place has awesome food too and the music never disappoints! I love the 90's and 2000's Hip-Hop vibes. Gotta check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Bevvy for years and it is by far one of my favorite bars in the area. The servers are great, the bar tenders are fast, and security does their job right yet they are really nice and personable. Everyone really makes you feel welcome. What I like most about the bar is that it doesn't matter what time of day I go or for what social or sporting event I always have a blast. Oh, and the music is good too. Keep it up Bevvy!"}
{"text":"Fun, happening larger bar on a party strip of Scottsdale.

Highlights:
- Decor: super random from US and UK flag sofas to the infamous fragile leg lamp from a Christmas Story
- Photo booth: fun during a night out 
- Long bar: wasn't too hard to get a drink even when it was crowded
- Music and video screens
- Across the street from late night tacos

Lowlights:
- Not for those who want a quiet cocktail 

I'd come back with a group of friends for a night out or to watch a game."}
{"text":"Had my birthday bash here with my gal pals.   I had actually gone to the Uptown Bevvy location prior, and liked it.   Since a couple of my gal pals come from the North Scottsdale area, thought I'd hold it here.

I can't remember the name of our server, but she was a very charming, professional, efficient young lady.   She said she wanted to be like us when she is our age.   Really??   Yes, it's true, we do have a lot of fun!!

We perused the happy hour cocktail list to get our drinks.  We all agreed the drinks were the best.   Therefore, had to have at least one more!

For our HH food we had the poppers, pretzel, quesadilla, and chip trio.   Plenty of food, that is for sure!   I liked all of it.   If I was to say which ones I liked the best, I'd say the quesadilla, poppers, pretzel and chips, in that order.   The quesadilla had the right amount of cheese and guac that one couldn't possibly go wrong.   The poppers were a tiny bit hot but not much.   The pretzel with its accompanying cheese dip was, well, yes, nothing out of the ordinary.   Same with the chips and the three dips.

Since we were celebrating my birthday, we asked what was on the dessert menu.   Now, that was a disappointment.   I guess desserts aren't high on the list of importance by any means.   We decided on the ice cream sandwich.   I was not impressed.   There wasn't much to it, and the top and bottom cookies were harder than a rock.   Oh, well.   I guess it wasn't supposed to be the highlight of the evening. ...

I would definitely return.   The menus at the Scottsdale and Uptowne locations aren't the same.   I think the Uptowne location has a more \"mature\" clientele, therefore, fits the area."}
{"text":"This place was packed and fun.... however we made reservations one week ago for 12 people and when we got here they had a table for 6.... not pleased the hostess was rude and acted put out...disappointed in the service at the front door... waitress JAMIE was awesome!!! AND THE FOOD WAS AMAZING... but the lack of welcome at the front messed up the overall experience!!!"}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend for ladies night. Great music and affordable drinks. Not to mention the bouncer was so amazingly nice. Definitely recommend for anyone looking to dance the night away."}
{"text":"Ashley was the best server ever! We came here with a big group for a birthday party and we had a great time. Super attentive staff, fun atmosphere, strong drinks, and good food! Can't wait to come back next time we're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bevvy a handful of times, a few months ago I made the switch to becoming a vegetarian. Prior to making the switch Ive had bevvy's lunch/dinner , which was always super yummy. Now that I am a vegetarian I wasn't really sure what to order on the menu, that's when I asked a worker what he suggested. David introduced himself and took a few minutes to explain what they had to offer that would fit my needs. I ended up choosing the rice bowl with extra veggies (one of Davids choices) and it was unbelievably good. Not only was I happy with my experience, but it amazed me that even though David was busy handling his own tasks (which did not include being my server) he still took a few minutes to make my experience a special one. This is exactly what makes normal customers become loyal customers. Safe to say, I will be around more thanks to my encounter with David! & the great rice bowl with extra veggies ;)"}
{"text":"Cool place to order some different drinks and spend a Sunday afternoon. I ordered something with candy in it, and it was very tasty (the name of the drink escapes me now). The service was on point, friendly and attentive for our party of 4. The high point was watching a raucous group play life-sized Jenga. It really was all about crowd participation that day."}
{"text":"Awesome place me and my husband went there on a Friday night about 9:30 to get a some drinks and appetizers. We don't really hang out in this area since it's all a young crowd , and we are old , but we saw a few our age. But got seated on patio. Which is front row seat to entertainment , yes people walking, the drunks , the drama. Well back to review. Food was amazing. Husband had spinach steak salad ,me the chicken strips with fries , price was awesome mix drinks a little week . But the only down fall and I'll have to check on the code for this.  We sat at a table was and ordered food was se served food , but people all around us where smoking.  That's the fucken worse , thank god some people that where close smoking moved when our food came.   But other then that food was awesome. Watching people was the best"}
{"text":"Accidentally found this bar because I saw UMichigan flags hanging outside. It's an indoor-outdoor bar with drinks are about $8-10 each. They had life-size games such as Jenga and Connect Four. Great place for everyone, especially if you have someone in your party that doesn't drink. I went on a Friday night, and they played all of the hip-hop and pop songs from 2000s. Always fun to have a throwback night.

Only wish the heaters would have been on because the temperature significantly dropped in a one-hour span.

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Bevvy is an excellent place to watch the FIFA  or any sport games. The rubber ducky shot that is offered on yelp is a must try, very strong alchkky lol"}
{"text":"Bevvy is always a great time with greats drinks, food, and the best bartenders. I always Sunday funday here with their $15 bottle of champagne deal  #champagnecampaign"}
{"text":"Not great for a weekday lunch. Took more than 40 minutes and had to get our food to go. They said they weren't prepared for 7 tables to come in at noon, so they gave us a 20% discount for the trouble.  The food is always good and servers are nice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Old Town. It gets busy on the weekends, but never overly crowded like some other bars. You can actually talk to and enjoy the people you are with. I usually just get drinks, but the food I've had here is awesome. Great staff. Great vibe."}
{"text":"Bevvy is such a fun spot in old town! My favorite bar to either watch a game or go out with all my friends! The staff is amazing and the food is soooo good!"}
{"text":"Bevvy is my go to place in old town. It has such a different feel than the surrounding bars. The crowd is always fun, and the service is great. Also, the best place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Scottsdale for work, I end up at the Bevvy for lunch or dinner.  Every dining experience has been terrific -- great burgers, sandwiches, soups, and appetizers.  The staff, too, has been perfect -- welcoming, attentive, and just the right amount of thoughtful interruption in the middle of business meals (...a challenging diplomatic move to master!).  I also enjoyed the background sports on the large screens throughout the restaurant -- not distracting or loud -- just the right amount of background entertainment while having business meals (...a tough interior design element to master...but the Bevvy does it right!)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great service and great drinks! Right in the middle of everything in old town so the location isn't too shabby as well!"}
{"text":"Been searching for a swanky dive? The Bevvy is all that and more! The space is decked out with ornate wooden panels, stained glass windows and chandeliers...that's the swanky part. There are plenty of games-from giant Jenga to giant connect four and skee ball, a photo booth and a mini mechanical horse at the entrance...that's the funky divey part. Flat screen TVs surround the entire bar, so sports fans can enjoy this spot too. Appetizers are half off during happy hour, 4pm-7pm. The Bevvy definitely has some character..it's fun addition to the Old Town scene."}
{"text":"This place is legit. One of the better places in Old Town for a drink. The food here is really good too. The bartenders are awesome, especially Aubree and Graham."}
{"text":"Really cool building, and a really energetic if not space-invading crowd for the Patriots game. Having never been here before, we were excited about the Power Hour special, but found out after we were rung up that the special hadn't been applied. When I asked the server about it, she said that she forgot to tell us that it wasn't happening that night. Weren't expecting to pay $40+ on a few drinks since we were expecting there to be a special, so not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"Came into town this weekend for my girls Bachelorette party and had an INCREDIBLE time!!! This place is amazingly fun...Megan and Chris are the best EVER :) truly cared about our whole group, and you can tell they love their job, and the people that come in. Can't say enough about how much I recommend this place (not just another Scottdale bar)."}
{"text":"I was so surprised to find out that Bevvy had some healthy options on the menu. A bar in this area would typically only serve bar food. The salmon bowl was delicious and extremely filling. During my time here, Haley was extremely accommodating!! She's the one who pointed out the healthier options. The service was quick and friendly, and the manager had no problem changing the TV to a game I wanted to see. I strongly suggest anyone in the Scottsdale area to check this place out. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bevvy is one of the better bars in Scottsdale! Great music, food and drinks.  Would say best place for happy hour in Old Town.  The vibe of Bevvy is a lot better than some of the bars in OT. Friday nights the DJ is fantastic! Service is 10/10."}
{"text":"My experience here was very much a positive one.
I went on a crisp Friday evening specifically to get some food and a few Ducky shots for me and my guest. This place is seated in the Scottsdale horseshoe off camelback in the heart of the entertainment district.
When we arrived we seated ourselves at one of the two lounge couches they provide (with a giant Connect Four game to play). 
They were currently out of ducks for the ducky shots but they stated that a shipment would be arriving shortly so we knew we'd be hanging out for a bit so we started with an appetizer and a couple drinks.
We tried the house poppers (bacon wrapped fresno chilies) and a soft pretzel.
I was greatly surprised by the poppers as I normally am not a fan of those types of snacks (hence ordering the second app) but the one I tried was really good and I would order them again in the future so that I could sample more than one.
I also had a pint of the house beer and one of their Skittles Sangrias. Man I have to tell you, after having that I want skittles in all of my sangrias from now on. What a great idea!

For the meal we shared the Patty Melt. They add a sriracha aioli to their melts which I think is a great twist on a standard patty melt and I loved the fact they use Texas Toast for the melts. That was a huge flavor changer for me!

Once the Duckies arrived we picked up a couple of them. My guest had the ducky shot and I had the Duck in a Pond (The liquor filled rubber ducky floats on a pint of beer). Well worth the wait let me tell you. Being able to keep the duck to take home after the shot was one of my favorite parts.
Overall my experience was fun and relaxing. The staff is appropriately attentive, the service was prompt and always cheerful and friendly and at one point our regular server had to go home and she personally introduced us to the new server which made the transition very easy. We also had a chance to speak with one of the owners a little bit and she was incredibly friendly and welcoming. I have added The Bevvy to one of my new personal favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Lol the bouncer made us log into our Facebook to check the date of births just to decline us like get a proper system to check ids rather then two douche bags deciding if your good enough to get in hahah place is a joke I'm happy we didn't spend any money here"}
{"text":"Service is always great and the manager Cam is on point, always takes care of my friends and I. Quality place to go"}
{"text":"Great place and awesome time! Special shout out to Spencer for being so cool with our bachelor party and scavenger hunt!"}
{"text":"Best Sunday funday in old town! Great food and you cant beat the champagne, perseco, or rose for $15 a bottle! They are always bumpin great tunes and packed. Super fun environment!"}
{"text":"Meagan is always on point here! Love coming here for lunch! The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is warm and casual. If you haven't been here for lunch you should!"}
{"text":"WOW. Absolutely the most accommodating bar! Bartenders are friendly and fast, the bouncers Sawyer and Paul were friendly and professional!!! There was a ros√© all day festival and 90s bar crawl and they were amazing and made everything run very smoothly. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service that I have ever received during my time in Scottsdale. The bartender was HORRIBLE and disrespectful to my friends and I. She insulted our choice of tequila saying that \"we shouldn't order it if we couldn't pronounce it.\" My friends and I are from New Mexico, let's just say we know our tequila and how to pronounce it. She then proceed to tell me that \"I don't give you salt unless you ask for it.\" The worst part of this experience was that the manager was standing RIGHT BEHIND ME the entire time. When I asked him why he didn't intervene, he told me that \"he had no idea this was going on.\" Needless to say, we will never come back here and I have told the Scottsdale party bike tour to never recommend this bar to anyone. It's sad to know that places like this treat customers this way."}
{"text":"Food was ok. They forgot our appetizers. Service wasn't very good. Very slow. Very small menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in old town! Whether it's a Sunday during the day or Saturday night. They play the best tunes on Saturdays! Drinks are reasonable and just a great time! It can get super crowded but the music makes it worth it for me!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to meet friends for drinks and good food in old town. The bartenders are awesome too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in old town! I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for service whether it be seated or at the bar even though the place is always packed. upbeat atmosphere, great music, fun people. Graham in particular is the best in the business, super friendly guy, makes great drinks and always goes out of his way to accommodate."}
{"text":"I believe this is my first 1-star review. Tired from a long week at work, I begin drinking my second beer at the bar... enjoying the establishment's high energy and loud music. I was beginning to relax, and closed my eyes for what I imagine was about 20-30 seconds. The next thing I know a bouncer grabs my shoulder and tells me I need to leave. I laughed, thinking he was joking, but he physically pulled the chair back in an attempt to eject me from the establishment. Realizing he was serious, I complied and was led out a back entrance. I calmly protested on the way out the door and was met with taunts and vague threats of violence.

I understand removing unruly or problematic patrons. But any establishment that treats gentle,  otherwise compliant paying customers so poorly should not remain in business. AVOID."}
{"text":"Bartender Matt was incredible! Amazing customer service - they were out of Ginger Beer and he went next door to get more!! He was personal, professional and has earned customers for life! Bevvy atmosphere was laid back and fun -- but hands down Matt made our night with going the extra mile!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service both during happy hour and on a random weekend daytime stop in. They're food is pretty good as are the drinks. Half off appetizers and $5 wines make it a perfect weekday happy hour spot. I also love that the patio allows for excellent people watching."}
{"text":"I'm looking at these reviews and I'm a little baffled. I've gone to bevvy a few times and I've never seen the security go out of line. The guys I've talked to are all pretty nice friendly people. Not even just security but the entire staff is really friendly and welcoming. I have an out of state license and the security guys out front made some pretty funny jokes then I was in! The bartenders are pretty dope too and will recommend you a good drink. I will continue to go here every time I go out to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Dope bar!! one of my favorites bars in old town. Great staff, good music, awesome service!  Great place to watch the games or for Sunday Funday."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in Old Town! Slightly less rowdy crowd than the other bars in the area. The avocado toast is my favorite! I recommend asking for the eggs to be scrambled instead of poached. On the weekends they have $15 bottles of champagne. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love Camille she is the best server I've ever had. She knows our group order before we even ask for it. Great place. Great service."}
{"text":"Bevvy is such a fun environment! It's so refreshing especially for a crowd that doesn't want to listen to EDM all night. The drinks are great, especially the rubber ducky roulette and the servers/bartenders make sure that you have a great time all night long :)"}
{"text":"I love Bevvy. It's a beautiful space with comfortable seating inside and out. Their Happy Hour specials are awesome and their crafted cocktails are, while a bit pricey, worth the cost. I tend to go after work so I can't speak for the evening crowds or service, but I've never had a bad experience during the week. The servers are really sociable, friendly, and very welcoming of canine visitors :)

Check out their burger, apps, & salad specials on Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for their Sunday Funday specials. They have really great champagne and sangria drink specials along with an excellent brunch menu. I love that their menu is healthy! There's TV so you can watch sports and there's also a DJ on the weekends during brunch. I definitely recommend their protein bowls."}
{"text":"I came to this place the other night for a quick bite to eat. It was not very busy and our waitress had told us that the kitchen was not busy so it would not take long to get our food. After 45 minutes of ordering she had told us that it would still be about 20 more minutes. When I asked why it was going to take so long she said it was because she did not put the ticket in until about 15 minutes before. As a waitress myself that is unacceptable. The next time she came around she changed her story as told me it was because I got a well done burger. I know that a well done burger does not take a full hour to cook. By the time we got our food my friends food was very cold and the manager said he would take off her food and my drink. I just checked my credit card statement after remembering it was only $17. They ended up charging me the full price of the bill. I'm not even sure if that's legal. Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"I love this place and the staff !! Always a great vibe and great drinks! Zach is the man! The Dj always plays the hits! This is the best bar in Arizona hands down"}
{"text":"Best spot in Old Town hands down. Great service, heavy pours and bomb food. I've been in old town for years and Bevvy takes the lead by a mile. The drinks aren't overpriced like 90% of them in old town, the cute servers and bartenders are always on the ball. Tons of TVs for game day! Seating selection is huge, table tables to booths. Overall favorite old town spot for food, drinks and entertainment!"}
{"text":"Nom nom! Bevvy doesn't disappoint. I had the pleasure of coming here Memorial Day Weekend. This was my first time in Scottsdale and it was recommended by several locals to eat here. As busy as it was for a Sunday, I was quite impressed with how attentive and well attended our server was to our table. This place has ample seating, a plethora of tv's, a place to sit outdoors and a dj! The brunch was a great choice especially for those who are into Mimosas. My group of girls was able to split a bottle for $15.00 and there was plenty to go around. It's within walking distance of several bars/clubs so you'll be in good shape wherever you decide to go next."}
{"text":"This place is totally crap. They have an OTB but you can't access it unless you're willing to pay a cover charge.
Then you should not be allowed to have an OTB. I will file a complaint with the Arizona gambling Commission. You are simply profiteering because it was Cinco de Mayo."}
{"text":"I peak heavily at Bevvy! Aubrey the bartender is the balls. The staff is amazing and everyone needs to get there asses here for happy hour on Fridays. POL"}
{"text":"By far the best bar in Arizona. Great management and excellent staff. Great bar food with healthy options."}
{"text":"Stopped by Bevvy for a quick brunch and was pleasantly surprised at how welcoming the staff was. Haley was particularly outgoing and helpful. I'm not in the area much, but I would definitely recommend this place! (and the breakfast burrito!) 

Staff friendliness - 5 stars
Cleanliness - 5 stars 
Quality of food - 5 stars"}
{"text":"I want to give this local Michigan bar (Go Blue!!) more stars, but we had terrible service. The food was good. Beer was cold. It's pretty loud. I'd add sound baffles if it were my bar. But, that doesn't warrant so few stars. No, our server is fully responsible for the missing stars.

We saw our server when she took our order. Someone else brought the food. Someone else cleared the table. Then we sat for what felt like an eternity. In fact, I'm writing this review while we wait to see her again. TWO different servers keep walking by but have NEVER made eye contact with either of us. The guys at the table next to us are angry. The people behind my wife are visibly upset. This is inexcusable.

I won't give up on this place because I want to have a place near home to watch Michigan Football with fellow fans. I'll report back at the next visit, which will probably be a Michigan game."}
{"text":"I work near by so I order takeout quite a bit, the food is really good! its a great place for lunch and happy hour."}
{"text":"Went for HH and early dinner on Tuesday 2/9/16. Upon crossing the threshold of the open front doors you are met with an overpowering, almost debilitating perfume scent. It permeated the entire establishment even though the entire east wall was open to the patio. It created headaches for all of us. It is absolutely disgusting and we've never encountered something like it. It was so powerful I'm guessing it's a scent they add thru the air handler. It must be stopped.

The drinks are served in plastic glasses.

Happy hour offers good discounts on drinks and food. The burger and side for $5 on HH is a bargain and tasty, however the \"red relish\" is sweet and doesn't jive - had to remove the top bun to finish. 

The chicken salad was the highlight and the citrus dressing is great.  It came out well before the other items however.

The steak salad was terrible. The steak was extremely tough/chewy and almost uneatable. Asked for steak knife...\"sorry, we don't have them.\"  Menu says it comes with \"roasted tomatoes.\"  Wrong. Try halved grape tomatoes. Also, there was no \"Texas toast crouton.\"  Just a couple small bits of avocado too. The blue cheese dressing was good.  Anyone paying full price for this ($14) should be ashamed of themselves.

The $2.5 loaded popcorn was a bargain and tasty.

One skeeball machine was out of order.

Female bartender finished her shift/passed us off to next bartender without so much as a word. New server was very unobservant, though the place was mostly empty.

Overall, between the perfumey air pollution and less than acceptable food/service, I left disappointed and smelly."}
{"text":"I would have given 6 stars, but the bartender (nice guy) forgot a beverage napkin... Would come back."}
{"text":"Great music, great games, lots of activity going on here on a Sunday!
Great drinks, and service.
Will definitely bring our friends back when in Az again from Cali"}
{"text":"Never knew this place before, very cozy for hangout, great location, cozy, and outstanding setting indoor with open outdoor patio. 

The services were great by the way they checked on me or us in certain times to make sure we all had a good time (we did). 

Unique appetizers such as popcorn with bacon crunch, quasadila, and hummus (good healthy snacks' choices). 

Thanks to Bevvy and YES I would love to recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The interior is nice, a good mix of people too, especially during the day.  The staff is your typical snotty old town staff \"ditz\" to describe the server is an understatement.  Word of advise, review your bill!  We were charged full prices during happy hour.  They also charged a separate charge for a mixer, when you order a mix drink.  The manager  corrected the bill but only when things became heated.  Go to Bottle Blonde instead."}
{"text":"This place deserves a solid 4.5 stars so I am giving it five.  The place is nice and roomy with an open air patio so you can people watch.  They have lots of comfy seating, tables, booths and couches.  They have a big jenga game you can play and maybe other games, I can't remember.  TV's showing various games.  We were here on a Friday evening about 9 or 10 and they had a fun selection of music with videos playing.  The beer price was average.  $5.00 for a bud light.  Not the cheapest around but doable.  This part of Scottsdale is hopping!  Great place to see or be seen.  We would stop in again."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best on the food! Almost as tho they don't care what you think about it. portions for the price very small and the quality is not that good just ok! Fries served warm not hot! Very much not impressed!!! And service was very inattentive.
I waited to see if anyone cared enough to see if my meal was ok? No one cares!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in here after a long day at work for happy hour and was welcomed by the bubbly and ever so happy Ciara.  She made me a blueberry mule called Blue Balls.  Delicious and refreshing!  Great drinks and very kind staff.  Thank you Bevvy!!!"}
{"text":"Bree and Zack at the front are the most friendly and welcoming folks. They are beckoning people to come in with their friendly personalities and welcoming personas. Their recommendations of tator tots was also spot on. They know their customers wants and are able to deliver on promises."}
{"text":"Such a great place to go!  There's something for everyone to be entertained:-). I love going here as much as possible!"}
{"text":"Flew in from SF and was looking for a bumpin' place for the Super Bowl. The hospitality is unmatched, especially for the bottle service we got. They really take care of you...no one from the group had to lift a finger. Their apps are amazing...we literally got everything from the menu and not one item disappointed. Call and ask to talk to Eric. He will hook it up."}
{"text":"Stopped in after the Phoenix Open, and boy did we have fun! The atmosphere was perfect for the situation we were in after the Open. The food was pretty good, we took the servers suggestion about finishing the wings off on the grill, p.s. the ranch was bomb.org. We had this newer guy Matt P. as the bartender and he was quite fun and informative about food/drink suggestions.. all and all I was satisfied coming to old town after such a large event AND to experience such excellent customer service while in the Gauntlet of Old Town, Scottsdale was the cherry on top of a great day! We will be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by Bevvy when we were in the area visiting a friend. It turned out to be one of our favorite places we visited in Scottsdale. We went on a Sunday and immediately knew we'd be spending our day there. Their throwback playlists were awesome & we were able to watch the football games we wanted. The foot was good & the drinks were even better. When we make it out to Scottsdale again, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"originally gave them 5 stars but on a recent trip Friday afternoon with a group of friends I had the worst experience I've ever had. our food took over an hour and a half to come out and when it did it was cold. no one even apologize for the food taking so long to come out. There was no reason for the food to come out an hour and a half after we ordered it it was not busy we even saw three other tables take their food to go once it came out because there's took so long. we finally get the bill and and a total amazement my boyfriend and I spent $80 between the two of us for lunch we each had two drinks and a meal that was ridiculous. one of our drinks that we had was The Angry Orchard on tap with a shot of Fireball and it. the shot of Fireball cost us $9 and some change that is insane any other bar I've been to his only charged $5 for a shot but when it's mixed in with the Angry Orchard beer were usually charged $9 for the beer with the shot combined in. but these guys charge just almost $17 for the drink. I will never ever come back to this place again it was absolutely horrible. total disappointment expecially after raving about it to my friends and then going through such horrible service."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend & we were really impressed with the friendly service! I'm a big fan of Moscow mules so I really enjoyed the variety of mules I could choose from. We shared a pretzel while watching football and it tasted great! I would definitely return next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and atmosphere! I wouldn't order the chicken salad again but I should have known better.The hummus and chicken wings were very good!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend!
Food was just okay, service was poor. I had to send the tomatoe bisque back because it tasted like straight prego sauce and got attitude from our waitress which made the rest our dining experience very awkward.  Not a daytime place maybe would be better at night, for drinks only"}
{"text":"Stopped in to bet Kentucky derby, Lauren came over and was super helpful , we ended up staying to eat and would stop back everyone was so nice . Will go back."}
{"text":"Bevvy is my favorite spot in old town. Regardless of the occasion. If you're looking to eat, drink, hangout, bet - this is your spot. The food is amazing! And the service is incredible. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there last week and had the honey siracha wings and a few margaritas during happy hour. The wings were good, nice and crispy and margaritas were good. Just a little pricey even during happy hour but next time I'll skip the shots maybe lol"}
{"text":"Had a great time, some unique drinks and great food. Personally liked the Baja Taco and their signature long Island  iced tea. Jamie knows how to mix a great drink with a smile!"}
{"text":"Solid place for a fun night out with the family. 

They have giant games that make it fun for everyone (jenga, 4 connect)

The salads are amazing. Add steak... Trust me. 

Hamburgers were perfectly cooked.

Happy hours are awesome, but not on weekends."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is part of \"EEG corporation\" who does not allow you to wear camouflage... or is it that my friend is African American ? Not too sure about this one. Let's see what the folks at Bevvy have to say about this. Bottled Blonde let us in...."}
{"text":"Bevvy is probably my favorite bar in Old Town Scottsdale, primarily due to its status as the place to be for University of Michigan football games.  The atmosphere is always electric on Saturday game days, and it has the food and drink to match.

I usually go with a group of fellow Michigan enthusiasts and aim for a high top near the outside patio, which provides a good watching location.  They have awesome specials on mimosas (you can get a whole bottle of champagne at a great price) and the beer list is decent, although not exhaustive.  Food is your typical pub fare, I've found the Bevvy burger to be very good, and it's usually my go-to item.

During the Michigan games they usually have a solid DJ that will really amp you up during the commercials.  Combined with the excitement of the game many times I can hardly stay seated!

If you're planning on going for one of the big games of the year (see: Michigan State or Ohio State), plan on being there hours (at least two) in advance.  You'd be surprised how many Michigan fans there are in the valley that come out for these games."}
{"text":"Bevvy is one of my favorite stops in old town! They have delicious food, cocktails, and some of the nicest staff. Last time my girlfriends and I visited for happy hour, we were helped by this girl named Claire. She was the BEST! Very helpful and knowledgeable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came for dinner around five o'clock. The service was slow and the music was so loud we couldn't talk. It felt as though we walked into a frat house but I guess what more can you expect in Scottsdale's entertainment district."}
{"text":"Staff was kind and courteous. The food here is also really tasty. I came here for a Yelp event and was very impressed. I can see myself coming back. Location is desirable. 60/40 burger is a must get for bacon burger lovers."}
{"text":"Bevvy is one of the more unique bar/restaurants in the Old Town scene because of it's affiliation with UM and (ugh) the Patriots. I've been during UM games and during off-season times. The games are uber fun because there is a DJ playing during the breaks, and the crowd is normally amped up. 
Big-time Wolverine fan Jeff P advises that to guarantee a seat during bball/football season, you should expect to arrive fairly early - the UMAA board already has a few booths reserved during the games. 
I really dig their drinks, chicken fingers and Bevvy burgers, but the fries are lacking and inconsistent - either over- or under-seasoned. If they could address that and the reasoning behind having the fries take up way more space than the chicken fingers, I could be a fan. It's like a plate of fries with a side of chicken fingers :( Service can also be spotty during games and non-games time alike which is disappointing, especially if you give ample time in-between what you order."}
{"text":"The worst place to go in old town the security isn't even that they have no idea what different states IDs look like so they will only let certain people in and not others it's absolutely ridiculous they are rude and pushy towards girls and the place should be shut down"}
{"text":"Bevvy presented as open, airy, and relaxing.  Loved the ambience it presents.  They offer a great selection of music, at a comfortable loudness. Our servers were friendly and provided above average attention to our wants/needs.  The chicken quesadillas that we ordered were reasonably priced, delicious, & generous enough for 3-4 people to eat as an appetizer. We ordered the house Chardonnay and were pleasantly surprised as it was of good quality.  It's a great place to socialize with your significant other or friends.  A definite return for us is a must!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and vibes. Often go for game days because that's where it's at! Also shout out to the two servers Marcie and Jessie, who are always getting after it and keep their customer service at the highest level."}
{"text":"This place is great! The drinks are fabulous. I also like how they have healthy choices on the menu. The bartenders were great and didn't ignore you. The people around you were very friendly. This place just had a positive, fun vibe!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and eclectic mix of music. I like how they have the turntables on top of the piano. Ioana is super nice and helpful and Eric is cool too even though he's a Packer fan. Go Bears. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Every time we come here the staff is excellent. The food is yummy and the drinks are great! Definitely try the pretzel sticks and the hummus plate. I usually stuck to beer or a vodka soda but my friends say the Moscow Mule is great. Definitely a great place to watch football in old town!"}
{"text":"BEST bar in old town hands down! Awesome crowd and great service! If you go during the day, they have really good food too with a few really healthy options. They play a variety of music and have a really eclectic crowd. The weekend DJ is the best!"}
{"text":"I understand this is a bar, but I ordered a salad waited a half hour and they never put it in. I Was finally able to flag a server down and they asked if I still wanted it. Disappointed food menu looked good."}
{"text":"Cute bar, great atmosphere and awesome staff ! Happy hour prices can't be beat and their speciality cocktails are  Kenzie is the best bartender ever"}
{"text":"I went here to have dinner and drinks alone on Tuesday night after my work! I sat on the bar. The bartender was very nice! I enjoyed my meal (chicken finger and string fries) and beers. The place was empty around 7-9 pm on Tuesday night."}
{"text":"I love this place! Quesadillas are delicious and the service is impeccable! Will return soon"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, drinks and service. Brought a few out of town guests there for happy hour and a good time was had by all. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Blonde big Boobed bartender has a serious attitude problem. No reason to put the palm of her hand in my face when i asked for a water.  I remember why i don't like old town."}
{"text":"Pretty good classic bro bar. The cool bar games is a great touch. 1 star down for a completely dumb name. Everything else seems standard ... It's a higher end drunkard funhouse in a great location. A bit loud on the music though. Ppl go to bars to socialize not to go deaf."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. I have been here for lunch, happy hour, and rage city; it never lets me down. Get the tots on any order because they are like a magical unicorn providing you with the tastiest of strawberry shortcakes from a parallel universe. Since they are a UofA bar, they only get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday to watch the games because there is for sure not a better spot on the west coast to watch some football.  Food is awesome, staff is on point, and the drink selection is huge. I was in for brunch and hit up their $15 champagne bottles, I think my group drank a dozen of them.  For sure get the breakfast nachos - I was very happy with those.  I plan on making this my go to for any sports game or after work drinks."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Now I don't have to go to turf paradise to bet on the horses. LOL  Oh, yes the food is good and reasonable. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped by the Bevvy with a friend while out in Old Town. We were drawn in by the extended happy hour (until 7). Unfortunately, they don't have many drink specials on HH... just wells (for 3$ but still). I wish bars would recognize that people want to try their signature cocktails, not some vodka and cranberry on special... Regardless, they do have discounted apps, which is awesome. We tried the pretzels with beer cheese and mustard.... this was a large plate of perfectly salted soft pretzels with a small container of cheese and mustard (could give a little bit more, but you know...). In addition to happy hour, they offered a few different types of alcohol on special for 5$, which was nice. My friend had some kind of honey southern comfort and cranberry.... yikes....not awesome. At least it was cheap. Further, a waitress came around giving out free drinks (green tea whiskey or something...) . You can't argue with free! The atmosphere and service in the bar was great. I would stop in again, but I would urge this bar to consider adding their signature drinks to the hh menu."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday funday one weekend. There was no wait for a table for the three of us. This is a great place to start your Sunday funday at.  We got a bottle of champagne for $15. We also ordered their ducky shots. These were dangerous!! For $9 you definitely get your money's worth and you get to keep the ducky. It tasted like a very strong sex on the beach. I also ordered this nachos. They were a pretty big size and good. 

They also have a photobooth, giant jenga, skee ball, and some games in the back to keep the fun going. You can do the \"mustache ride\" for free when you check in. Lol"}
{"text":"This places get too crowded!! Props to Christina for always working so hard! She was able to take our order so fast while the bar was so packed with people. Got our drinks and food with a blink of an eye! 

5/5 for our server Christina.

2/5 for the place ): too hot and crowded in the summer. They ran out of jameson's and they didn't have hennessy! At least they should have hennessy VS..."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Bevvy! The patio is dog friendly, so we can come hang out with our pups and watch the game! They have great local beers on tap and the  food is delicious, my favorite is the grilled chicken pita with a side of tots! The staff is always attentive and friendly. We highly recommend Bevvy! :)"}
{"text":"The night scene is great here, which is what allowed me to give this place two stars... however, the day scene is repulsive. Staff is incredibly rude during the day (which is surprising considering money flows in at night but you have to actually be a decent human being during the day to get tips, but apparently Megan, the server/bartender, didn't get this message). They won't be getting my business again for a long while because of her. If I do ever decide to come back, it will be strictly for the night scene but never again for a daytime meal.

Edit: someone else in my party reached out to the MOD, Cameron, and he was very nice and considerate."}
{"text":"Bevvys Sunday funday game days are my favorite place to be on a Sunday! Chris's bar sangria is delicious and there's always a scene to see here. Great atmosphere & big menu as well."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend have been going here basically every other day. Service is always hit or miss, but the service today was a hit and a home run. We love Tyler! She was on top of everything. We weren't the easiest table to deal with because of our party showing up at sporadic times, but she dealt with it with ease. Ask for her next time you come in!"}
{"text":"Went for the michigan game.  This is a great michigan bar.  Great crowd.  Fair prices.  Awesome service"}
{"text":"Always a good experience coming here. Bartender Graham is my favorite ever!! I love him the most out of the whole staff. This is my favorite spot in old town to go out and bring my girlfriends :)"}
{"text":"Came in around 8 on a Friday night for drinks. Great atmosphere & bartenders. Can't wait to come in for food next time !"}
{"text":"There are not enough good things to say about this place! I absolutely love it and the DUCKY SHOTS are to die for!! They're both delicious and cute! The food is also amazing! We had the jalapeno poppers (which are one of my now must have all the time items), a patty melt with the shoestring pepper fries and the pretzels with fondue! It was all really delicious, besides shoe string fries you have have Steak Fries, Tater Tots, a Side Salad, or Soup. I really wanted to eat more food but was stuffed.  I had a Melancholy Mule which is indeed served in a copper mug! It was delicious, light and refreshing! I also had 2 ducky shots, because they're just sooo adorable! They definitely pack a punch though. ADDED BONUS YOU GET TO KEEP THE DUCK!!! You can have the ducky shot 4 ways, as a shot, as a duck in a pond (the duck floats in a pint of beer), a duck in a lake (the duck floats in a larger glass of beer), or you can play ducky roulette :D which is great for a group! Happy Hour is excellent $3 wells and beers, 1/2 off appetizers and there's even a $5 burger with fries! There's plenty of seating that can suit everyone, there's high tops, booths, couches and a sizeable patio!  I really can't wait to go back! The servers are also amazing, very attentive without smothering and they are knowledgeable about everything on the menu, from the beers to the foods!"}
{"text":"Just left this place with a smile on my face. Food was delicious, TVs everywhere, great place to watch football. Marcie made sure we had a great experience. Will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"U OF A bar in Scottsdale! Finally, I have been searching and searching for one! Everyone and I mean everyone here is amazing! Friday night, packed house and still on top of everything. The dj was playing all the awesome jams, shuffle board and comfy couches all for a big win! I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Take the XICHIGAN logo off your menu and I'll give you a different rating, but until then 1 star it is. ;)"}
{"text":"This new bar in Old Town is actually more of a minor reboot of was originally called The Derby Public House. The primary change being the addition of faux lowered ceiling covering the main, center bar area. Hopefully this new bar can find it's spot amongst the Old Town bar scene. 

The general look and feel of the place is an upscale American take on a British pub.

I went during the week of the Super Bowl. The crowd was busy, but far from packed as the currently more popular HiFi, El Hefe and Dierks Bentley Whiskey Row bars.
It is a good place to go for a slightly more intimate upscale feel when wanting to be out in Old Town, but not shouting when talking to friends over the thumping DJ sounds of those other clubs.

I was there only for the nightlife and did not try the food."}
{"text":"Now that I've been several times, I think Bevvy is my favorite Old Town spot. Let me start by saying I am a little biased because I am a Wolverine Fan, and this is the official U of M bar -- so I frequent Bevvy to watch U of M football games. That being said, I LOVE the music, especially because it's often old school hip hop/r&b mixed with a little new school - which is totally my thing. 

The bar is in the center of the establishment. There is high top and booth seating inside and hightop seating outside. I almost always choose to sit outside so I can people watch. The only downside of outdoor seating is smoke. They have several fun, yard games for entertainment too. 

Food is good and depending on when you go they have brunch, appetizers/snacks, and other sandwich and bar menu options. One of my favorite items is the popcorn served with bits of BACON...yum. How can you ever go wrong with bacon?! Service is usually pretty good although depending on the crowd or event you'll definitely have a wait for food/drinks. Seating is first come first serve but I always seem to be able to find a nice place to sit comfortably. 

What I love most about Bevvy is the chill atmosphere and great music."}
{"text":"Bevvy has been the lift off pad for many nights in Scottsdale. You can't go wrong with this place, only right. I feel like every night you have a bar in mind to either start with or to hit it up for the duration of that night, and Bevvy can be either.

I typically go to Bottled when I want to hit up a faux Zedd concert; District if I am too far gone but still wanna have  a good time; and Bevvy if I want the option of doing both. 

It really doesn't matter what time of day you go. If you go during the hour of wolf, you will most likely have to push and shove to get a drink. But most of the time you can get a drink in a timely manner, and also play some of the games. They got Jenga and Connect Four. (Kick down all Jenga's, but only if you're cool with the peeps.)

It's got some bomb ass food too. You can also hit this place up for lunch too. 

Bevvy is that person in your life that keeps you grounded. Bevvy is the one you can always come
back to and it's like nothing changed. Bevvy is the bae of bars."}
