{"text":"Mixed experience with this one - probably won't be returning.  Perhaps we arrived at a busy time but wednesday night - one would expect to meet your server and get a glass of water in the first 15min once seated.  Anyway, at least we had menus and made use of the wait to decide what we wanted to order. We then waited another 15min for the drinks to arrive - though we could see them on the bar waiting to be delivered for at least 5 min.   The watermelon sake sangria was fresh and refreshing. However, they probably ran out of watermelon juice for the mint melon thyme - could taste non of the above mentioned ingredients because my mouth was overwhelmed by almost pure lime juice. The tartest, sourest drink I've ever had.  So how about the food? Generally disappointing. The cerviche, instead of being light and refreshing, was soaked (marinated) in soy sauce and overpoweringly salty. We had two rolls - truffle albacore and an unagi banana tempura. They sounded a lot better than they tasted. Firstly the rice was overcooked and gluggy. The unagi roll was also soaked in an unagi (salty) sauce which overwhelmed it. The truffle oil was a nice touch but the prawn inside the roll had little taste - probably because it wasn't fresh.   The miso black cod, though also very salty, was cooked to perfection with slightly crispy skin and melt in your mouth buttery meat. At this point, halfway into our 4th dish - we were informed that our 5th dish was unavailable.  The saving grace for the meal was the miso caramel cheesecake. This is only thing I ate here that I would consider ordering again ... if I ever return ... which is unlikely. The service picked up later in the evening and I think they were genuinely apologetic about the delay in drinks and food. Yes this place is hip and cool, but the food needs to be same and unfortunately, in our experience, was sadly lacking."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went out for a date night and didn't make a reszo but we got a table within 20 minutes, which we thought was great! The costume service plummeted after that waiting to even see a waiter to take our order for over 30mins... It seemed like we were invisible... Then the manager came over and took our order and we thought things were turning up but service was horrible and we left feeling neglected and that we had just spent a lot  for ordinary sushi. Overall I would not recommend this restaurant and the idea of what it once was is just that an idea."}
{"text":"Seriously way overpriced!!! People who think this place is anything over one star is crazy! I've been to a lot of different sushi restaurants and this is the worst I have ever been! The sushi is small and tasteless and the deep fried tofu was disgusting the outside didn't even stay on the tofu! I've had better dee fried tofu in a food court! For god sakes I rather eat sushi at su N shi at Yorkdale! Which comparison is 5 plus star. This place should be shut down!!!! Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why everyone raves about this \"sushi\" place. The ONLY reason I came here was because most reviews loved it! Ugh, such a bad choice. This was the worst sushi place I've ever been to, yes the decor was modern and server was great but the food... Totally not worth it. Waste of money and waste of time. The food we got was crap, nothing special . Any other sushi place can beat this place. To top it off, we both felt sick to our stomachs after. Ew. If you want to waste your money, not get full, have crappy food and want a stomach ache after this is the right place for you! Will not be coming here. Yuck"}
{"text":"This place isn't about food... it's about status. Everyone working there has a little attitude (some even a little more LOL), and the patrons of the restaurant think they're cool because they are eating there. Truth is, the food is nothing special... but I bet your bill will be. Typical over-rated Toronto \"hot spot\" with very little substance or interest. The best part of my dinner was the Sapporo beer and my conversation with friends. If you have money to waste why not donate to a local charity for women or children?"}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night for my birthday. My boyfriend booked the venue for me and it was a reservation for 12 people. Absolutely will never come back to this place.  We arrive and were seated, server takes our drink orders and it took over 20 minutes for us to get any drinks at all, even water. From when the dinner order was taken, it took over an hour for the food to come and what she told me would have been an entree size came out smaller than an appetizer. The rolls were so tiny and just mediocre. I would say this place is def for someone who doesn't know how to eat real japanese food. They don't even serve Uni (sea urchin).  There were bowls on chips that were on the table before our meals came which the busser took away when it was still half full. Not to mention he kept kicking my chair the whole night every time he came by. I'm a small asian girl by the way.   As if all this isn't enough, the server knocked over one of my friend's martini's into her water and on the table and didn't offer her another one. When we brought up the issue in a very polite manner, she reluctantly offered to bring a shot so we can just pour it in instead of making us another one. We told her to forget it.  The birthday cake was a custom designed Tiffany & Co cake that my boyfriend bought for over $500 and brought it to the restaurant to serve after. The cake was warm and was half melted when it came out which leads me to believe that it wasn't put into the fridge.   Needless to say, I much rather go to Guu Izakaya or Sushi on Bloor. 0/10 for Blowfish."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto on business and a friend suggested we try this restaurant. Food was good, fresh and interesting. Drinks were expensive. Our waiter was nice. When we arrived the \"maitre 'd or host guy\" looked annoyed that we had arrived without a reservation, but did ponder his list for a few moments then gave us a table. The restaurant was almost empty(4 tables). During our dinner experience he circulated as a few more tables came in and spent his time obviously making sure a few key tables had the right dining experience??? Would be appropriate if he is going to constantly stroll the restaurant that he check with each table once during their dining experience....or not stroll and stroke the dining egos. Just seemed strange? When we left 2 hours later the restaurant was about 1/3 full, so he shouldn't have stressed about the fact that we did not have reservations:) So enjoyed the food, but greeter guy needs to brush up on his etiquette."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend had called to make a reservation, they asked if we were okay with sitting on the patio since there were no tables available inside. However, when we arrived the inside of the restaurant wasn't very busy, nor was it busy when we had left... so I wasn't quite sure why they forced us to sit on the patio.  Anyways, to start I ordered the mango punch - belvedere vodka, mango rum, fresh passion fruit juice, fresh mango juice, fresh pomegranate juice ($12). It was a great cocktail. Very fruity and refreshing!  We ordered 2 rolls; the red hot curry salmon - \"hot smoked atlantic salmon, mango, cucumber, lettuce, pine nuts, tobiko, sesame seed, japanese 7-spice, curry drizzle\" ($13) and the hotate tuna - \"scallop, tuna, avocado, sesame seed, tobiko, bonito flakes, kewpie\" ($16). They were both pretty good, but the portions were extremely small, especially the red hot curry salmon roll (which wasn't very spicy). Although they were good, I don't feel the price was justified.  We also ordered the blowfish giant ebi shooter - \"tiger prawn, mango, avocado, cucumber, lettuce, daikon sprout, tempura bits, spicy kewpie, tobiko; wrapped with soy paper\" ($14). Now, be warned. The $14 price is for ONE shooter only (the shooters were really cones, as shown in the picture). When I ordered it, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, and since there were 2 of us, they brought us two. When my boyfriend noticed another table had ordered it and noticed it came with only one shooter, that's when he realized it was $14 each. As for the taste, the first few bites were just okay. Once you got to the middle of them they tasted pretty good, but definitely not worth the price. I wouldn't recommend this. You could definitely get a much better tasting and higher quality hand roll for a much better price.  The last thing we ordered was the one-bite kobe gyozas - \"pan-seared dumpling stuffed with kobe beef, black fungus, ginger and preserved spicy vegetable; served with balsamic basil dip\" ($15). This came with 5 bite-sized gyozas with a dipping sauce. Although they were tasty, they were nothing special.  Overall?  - decent food but very overpriced  - small portions - trendy atmosphere - good cocktails"}
{"text":"The food here is terrible. Would never recommend or come again. Disguised as a classy high end restaurant and cocktail bar. Expensive and gross. The nigiri wasn't cut right, there was no wasabi between the (cold) rice. They pour the soy sauce for you and take it away from the table. The sushi rolls are pretty much dessert. No flavor at all, can only taste coconut and banana... Avoid and save your money."}
{"text":"For the service:  The worst experience I ever had. I never seem a manager like that rude. The first restaurant I had that terrible  experience. Because I can't explain very well. English is my second language. I just wanted to order the food I had before. I wanted to order more food. But he make me really upset. I don't mind to pay more. Please don't act like I made the mistake.  For the food: Jo bistro  and  miku  are much better than blowfish."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with girlfriends last night.  We made an 8:30 reservation and got there about 15 minutes early, seated right away.  Great service and free coat check.  The building is an old bank, and as you peer inside, the decor is inviting.  It's got a trendy lounge feel, with good music.  As it gets later in the evening, the music also evolves with its transition into a lounge. Washrooms are a bit confusing because they are individual stalls and remind of the ones on the airplane.  The sinks are just like...\"what?\" Hard to explain, but you'll see what I mean.  There are lots of rolls to try, but some of the names are fancier than what they are. The blue snow roll was really just a rainbow roll and the argula beet roll is a vegetarian roll with some fancy dipping sauce.  The spicy tuna with rock shrimp was delicious.   Loved the wasabi sweet potato chips, maguro carpaccio and the ebi roll.  The ebi roll was suggested by everyone - it's expensive, but worth trying once.  It's actually quite big for a hand roll.  Had green tea ice cream for dessert, with lots of berries included.  I'm not much of a drinker, so I can't comment on the cocktails, other than...they looked expensive.  We left by 11ish, since we aren't into the bar scene, but easy to see who was there for food and who was there for...picking up.   I'm a bit conflicted for how to rate.  The food is good, although the pricing is confusing, because some things are reasonable and some are overpriced. I was focusing on the food and not so much the loungy aspect of the place. Good for night out on the town."}
{"text":"This places deserves a 3.5 if I we could half stars on this site! I agree with a lot of the other comments on this site that the sushi is incredibly overpriced for what you get, and I'm not talking size wise, I'm mean quality wise. I'll forgo size for quality ;) .... when it comes to sushi. But that's where this place let me down a little, the fish and combo fillers like mango and banana were okay, but far from amazing, especially for $18 a roll. I also tried the tempura sweet potato and almond crusted calamari which were both good options, but again, nothing to drool over.   The sake selection is extensive and I have to admit I think my ginger grapefruit saketini was the best part of the night, that and it was my best friend's birthday, so the sake was flowing :) I'll probably come back for some drinks, and to enjoy the crowd and chandeliers, but probably not for the sushi."}
{"text":"Meh.  Blowfish just seems to be trying too hard. Don't get me wrong; the food is pretty good albeit a little on the expensive side. The clientele is the typical chic hot-spot crowd... think \"unnatural\" and you'll be getting close. As you might expect, the people watching is quite a \"treat\". The music isn't club-loud, but it definitely is louder then your usual sit-down eating experience. As for the service, pretty good. The main host looks like a 70's version of Shigeru Miyamoto. Rad."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am from Los Angeles and we have great sushi there.  Perhaps as a result, I am snobbish and making a comparison that I shouldn't be but here goes......  The vibe was nice.  The service was ok.  The food was not very good.    I found this place fashioned itself as a high end/high prices sushi establishment and was excited upon my entry.  The menu looked good and there were some interesting rolls which we ordered.    While I don't mind paying a premium for good sushi, I felt we way overpaid for what we got.  The rolls were smaller than they should be for the prices they are charging and in one particular instance I couldn't tell if there was any salmon in the roll I ordered at all (granted it was spicy salmon I could hardly taste \"salmon\").  The spicy tuna I believe consisted of not very much actual tuna or any fish for that matter.  The shrimp on the spicy tuna roll likely came out of a freezer.  The rice on the spicy tuna crispy rice was in fact cooked well and the edamame was good.  I don't mean any disrespect to those who love this restaurant or think its something special because it's not.  I've eaten at hundreds of sushi restaurants over a nearly 20 year period of time and consider myself a connoisseur of sorts and this place just doesn't cut it.    I personally would not eat there again (and I won't because I don't live here but I do visit) and if I did, drinks is about the only thing I think I would order before heading out somewhere else to eat food.  I would not recommend.  There has got to be better sushi in Toronto??????"}
{"text":"3 out of 5! Overpriced sushi! Recommend spicy tuna with rock shrimp! Better and cheaper sushi available in Toronto! $$$"}
{"text":"I moved to Toronto from Vancouver, BC a few months ago, and this is THE only place in Toronto that has sushi that is comparable to the BC.  I am a sushi fanatic and I've tried all the recommended sushi places here and so far, Blow Fish is still number 1 in my books.  The ambiance is great, the cocktails are delish (try the wasabi caesar, yum!)  service is excellent and the food well, scrumptious!  Try the hot oil hamachi and the black truffle tuna maki roll. Mmmm!"}
{"text":"The sushi tastes amazing, is unique, and expensive. This is my 3rd time going and have yet to be let down on the quality of rolls & sashimi.   If you like a sweet salty taste get the orange & black roll with mango. Its fresh sweet fruit with the semi-salty taste of soy sauce. It goes really well together.   Make a reservation and wear something a bit nicer than sweatpants and your alma-mater hoody the scene here is well dressed beautiful people."}
{"text":"Blowfish has reopened after their fire, and I learned, under a different business arrangement (the previous business partners split, so the Bay Street location is no longer Blowfish).  I was glad to see a number of their popular dishes remaining on their menu, despite a make-over and a new chef.  The new decor is very lush and there is a warm calm vibe when you enter.  But a little later on into the night, the music gets turned up loud, and you can barely hear each other speak.  They have also tried to put in more tables into the dining space, making it a tight squeeze to leave our table, and also when heading to/from the restrooms.  Having frequented Blowfish often before, there were a lot of must-have dishes that we wanted  after such a long absence.  Still on the menu are:  the giant ebi shooter (they have also introduced a baby size but we went for the giant, of course), spicy rock shrimp, hot oil hamachi and lobster and shrimp dumpling appetizers all met the high standards that we had in our memories.  But unfortunately, where things have faltered is the sushi.  The appearance and the \"tightness\" of the makimonos were terrible - they were lopsided and they collapsed the minute you try to pick up an individual piece.  We had a lot of rice drop off into our soy sauce dishes because they were falling apart at even the most careful and lightest touch.  For the prices they charge, this is not acceptable, and we gave feedback to the server, who said he'd pass it onto the kitchen.   Fortunately, they all tasted very good, and we tried our old favourites - such as the red hot curry roll, the spicy tuna with rock shrimp, and they even made the black & blue for us even though it was not on the menu.  Additionally, we tried a couple of new dishes:  the pyramid sashimi and the jalapeño hamachi.  The jalapeño hamachi is definitely a welcomed addition, but the sashimi didn't blow us away.  Tak is still the manager of this location and he was his usual charming self, mixing and mingling with the guests.  He also comped a couple of desserts as it was a birthday celebration, so that was very generous.  One of them was a new mocha trio that was fun and delicious.  We would return again if only for the bi shooter and spicy rock shrimp - we often talked about how we missed having these dishes during their reno!  And I'm willing to give another chance to see if their makimono quality control was just \"off\" on the night we visited."}
{"text":"The best dishes here are NOT rolls. They're the cold dishes...the jalapeño tuna, hamachi yellow tail are terrific. Tuna Tacos were not impressive at all bland. Sweet potato chips are a must order. Mains were Mizo glazed cod, which was delicious, and spicy rock shimp, which was meh according to my wife. Dessert was the miso caramel cheesecake was nice with green tea. 4 glasses of Riesling and bill was $250 including generous tip. I would go back but would skip tacos and maybe try a roll. Really expensive though."}
{"text":"really nice atmosphere and super friendly staff. Great patio in the summertime as well!  the gian eby shooter is to die for, as well as some of their fun rolls and hot oil hamachi - delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Everything in this restaurant is perfect. The environment, music, service, and the food. You can't go wrong with this place. People are so nice ..I have been to this restaurant a few times and tried pretty much everything."}
{"text":"The Spicy Tuna and Spicy Rock Shrimp are my fav. Hot Oil Hamachi & Japanese A3 Wagyu Striploin on Hot Stone toped off our dinner and the Mochi Ice Cream Trio was a great way to top it off.  We always sit at the bar, just our thing.  The place can get pretty busy so we make our way to the one on Bay St on busier nights."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and very friendly service, but docking 2 stars b/c the prices are just way to high!  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, great even--we especially enjoyed the spicy tuna roll and rock shrimp appetizer, but the $16 a glass watermelon-sake-sangria,was a little excessive. If you go here just know that you will be spending $$$$, but at least you can rest assured that the food is good.  But, you can skip the miso soup for $5, not flavorful & very watery."}
{"text":"Ambience: Scene. Prices: Obscene.  Best experienced when on the corporate tab. Otherwise the overhead-inflated prices will fillet your wallet. A tip to all professed \"sushi lovers\" - If there's no resident master sushi chef, there's no justification for premium prices. However, if eating with your eyes is the depth of your culinary and social requirements, you will find Blowfish particularly presenting."}
{"text":"It's sad to say but this was the first restaurant I had dinner at when I first moved to Toronto. They try very hard to be trendy and hip, just think 40 somethings trying to be 20 again. The decor is cool and the people are beautiful but I wish I could say the same about the food. To be honest their sushi is at best at par with some of the sushi joint's on queen or Bloor street and they charge you an arm and a leg for it. If you like good sushi, stay away, if you're there to be seen or to impress someone then it's the place to be."}
{"text":"So I am just another big fan of this place... I was there yesterday with my wife, and as the place was FULL at 930pm... and we couldnt get a table (we didnt make a reservation in advance.. big mistake..) we were sitting on the Sushi bar...  The Sushi bar has only 4 seats... and it is not in the center of the place.. but god... it was a great experiance...  Food: try the EBI shooter... it is really good. i love the special rolls like the spicy Tuna with the shrips and the kiwi lobster roll. anyway, come to experiance new stuff, and dont just eat the regular stuff that you already know.   the billl was 100$ for 2, and we couldnt eat anymore... so this is what you should expect... (my wife didnt drink anything, i drank a beer)..  and with 20% service... we were in 120$... for a wonderful saturday night dinner...  the music is great.. and washrooms are nice... and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"I passed by this place on my way home with my boyfriend while debating on what we should have for dinner. The place looked nice so we thought we'd try it out, since we're both sushi lovers. I ordered a few rolls and the giant ebi shooter - I thought the rolls were all very mediocre, but the ebi shooter was pretty darn delicious. However, overall, I didn't think the food was worth the price, but the food was nowhere near as bad as our rude waitress. I don't think I'll ever return to give it a second shot."}
{"text":"I thought the sushi was good - but avoid ordering meat - stick to what they do best.  The red meat we ordered was not good.  However, the sushi was great and the cocktails were amazing - try the watermelon mint!  Good service.  It's expensive but it's very good - worth a try."}
{"text":"Trendy bar at a convenient location and relaxing atmosphere. ALWAYS do pre-book and reserve if you do not wish to be disappointed as the place is small. Service is great and very friendly, due to the location and the atmosphere it is mostly young crowd in their thirties. If you are a steak lover or would like a good meal this is not a place for you as $200 later you will find yourself still hungry. Items their menu consists of are tasty and unique, great for entertaining a social event, but are not very suitable for someone who is looking to get a good meal and the place is way too loud for discussing anything more important than \"where to party next weekend\""}
{"text":"Place was beautiful and service was great too. Unfortunatly Shusi was really  nothing special. Very disappointed. Highly priced but not very tasty and just ok. Drinks were extremely pricy. Glass of sake $18+ !!! Skip if you can."}
{"text":"One the best Japanese Fusion restaurant in T.O.  Five of us ordered more than half of the menu and some standouts where the Spicy curried salmon,  the spicy tuna with rock shrimp and the coconut shrimp.  Bar prices are steep and the food isn't far behind.  5 of us had a bill of $800 with tip.  We visited on a fine, mid week evening.  The service was very good and the staff friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I went into this place after leaving my gym which is located across the street. Since I am a low-carb girl, I thought I'd go for sashimi and soup.  I have been to the Blowfish on Adelaide before and the service there is INCREDIBLE.  Unfortunately, it is not the same at this location.   I was greeted by an Indian waiter who took ten minutes and had to ask someone where I could be seated even though there were 0 people sitting in the dining area.  It took another ten minutes to get some water.  I ordered the albacore, salmon and shrimp with a lobster soup. Food in my opinion was delicious.  My bill was nothing to complain about but the only problem I had was that my waitress didn't inform me that she takes the tip out of what I get back. I was sitting there confused and she didn't inform me and I thought she had made a mistake. I asked another girl and she said yes she probably took the tip out.  Like? Not a problem at all but inform me so I'm not thinking otherwise.  And if this place wants to look more high-end, the waiters and waitresses should look their upmost best! These servers looked dumpy and just bizarre styling!  I will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Been here twice a month since they opened. By farrrrrrrrrrrrrr my fave sushi bar. Great atmosphere. Love the sakitinis"}
{"text":"In short: Worse than death. I wish I had rather amputated my own leg than went to this \"sushi\" place. Anyone who dares to compare this \"restaurant\" to any of even the cheapest Vancouver sushi joints must be...em...ergh...freaking insane! You wanna try some of the worst sushi in Toronto, come and visit us at Blowfish. Both I and my girlfriend ended up throwing up upon coming back home. All in all, highly recommended...NOT!"}
{"text":"I feel that this restaurant does a lot of things right, except for one.  It has great atmosphere, very tasteful decors and great waitstaff. The drink menu looked great too. I wasn't in the mood for drinks and it seemed intriguing.  The presentations of the food were pretty decent as well. Their chef should definitely get high score for creativity. They made a lot of effort to put new flavours into traditional items. It is to be commended.  These would have been enough to make a good restaurant in many cases. Unfortunately though not for a sushi restaurant. The cornerstone of good sushi is quality ingredient served fresh, which was sorely missed here. The seaweed in my miso soup had different textures, some good, some dry and some sinewy. Their hotate sashimi was slight seared, which was interesting, but didn't have the fresh sweetness that should have been there. We also tried their king crab taco, hoping it's un-japanese enough for them to get right, which ended up to be some pretty good tacos with no discernible amount of crab to be found. The one item I have enjoyed, curiously, was a side plate of Brussels sprout, which oddly was a lot of food comparing to everything else.  Don't get me wrong, their food are in no way intolerable or even bad. It's just that for similar kind of vibe and flare, they pale in comparison to the likes of Ja Bistro.  Still, I would offer words of encouragement to the restaurant. I feel there could be potential here. Either actually sweating the details and make good sushi, or maybe changing the menu to be more of a Izakaya style could work. At the current state though, it will only attract the kind of clientele who look for exoticism but find authentic cuisines too exotic. Of course, someone has to serve those people too. So if that is the restaurant's actual strategy then they have succeeded and don't need to change a thing."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC food, one of the best sushi places in town. The menu items are delicious and the presentation is creative. The cocktails are a must. Had a mango passion saketini and it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Blowfish restaurant is a very sophisticated restaurant, perfect for a date night in their romantic setting or a business dinner. The seatings along the sushi counter allows guests to watch their dinner being made by sushi chefs as well. On the other hand, BarFish provides a energetic and sexy vibe, perfect for a drink or two.  You can expect the service to be welcoming and unpretentious and very friendly! Servers were knowledgeable and eager to make our experience a great one.  What we ate: Blowfish Giant Ebi Shooter ($14.00) Spicy Tuna on Crispy Sushi Rice ($17.00) Hot Oil Hamachi ($18.00) Jalapeño Hamachi ($17.00) Orange & Black ($13.00) Spicy Rock Shrimp ($10.00) Roasted Miso-Marinated Black Cod ($19.00) Japanese A3 Wagyu Striploin on Hot Stone ($40.00) Mochi Ice Cream Trio ($8.00)  The highlights of the night for us were the Black Cod, Wagyu on Hot Stone and of course, the greentea mochi. I do prefer the redbean flavour ice cream, however the texture was harder and a bit grainy (I think it was just out of the freezer) compared to the green tea mochi, which was perfect.  Blowfish would be a good choice when grabbing dinner and drinks with friends or even just for the latter after a long day at work!"}
{"text":"I went to Blowfish last night for a friend's birthday dinner.  I had heard about how swanky the restaurant is.  It is a cross of a fancy restaurant meets lounge.  The atmosphere was club-like walking in, which added to the whole restaurant appeal.  Food wise, except small plates.  I was not excepting to spend $16 on two scallops but they were very tasty.  The drinks menu is extensive but also on the pricey side.  We opted for Sapparo beer which was $9 a can - probably the best bang for your buck in this type of restaurant.  My friend enjoyed the birthday dinner as did everyone else.    Would I return, likely not due to the small portions and high prices.  Though I would recommend it if you are looking for a loungey sort of feel as a dining experience."}
{"text":"Better late than never.  I regret not having visited Blowfish until now, a week before it closes up for good. It's too bad, because this is a fantastic and classy space that knows exactly what it's good at and capitalizes on said elements extremely well.  I was extremely fortunate to get a reservation on the Saturday before the restaurant closed, and was a bit surprised with how small the space was (an opinion that was backed up by our server, who told us that there are apparently plans to do something with the space, including knocking out a side wall, though exactly what wasn't clear to them).  There is no doubt that this is (or was) a great venue for a classy dinner or a date. I just wish I'd known about it sooner - might have visited more times.  It is true that you don't really visit Blowfish for the sushi, as absurd as it sounds. This is a place where you pay for the ambiance and the views. We were actually able to switch our table to the windowed booth overlooking King Street, and watched as people getting off busses stared at us awkwardly as we ate dinner. The service was fast and friendly, and definitely set this place apart from other restaurants in the area (though I see how they were all rocking those short skirts - like I said, ambiance and the views).  Half of my group settled for the tuna tartare cold plate ($20) and sweet potato tempura ($4), while the others settled for a different mix of the torched sushi ($15) and shrimp tempura. I have to say that Blowfish is not a place to visit if you're hungry. You pay quite the amount for small portions (most of the time - there are exceptions to this rule, like the ebi shooter others have mentioned).  The tempura was easily my favorite part of the meal. Greasy as hell, but the batter was surprisingly light and came with a generous dish of soy sauce - and if you know me, you know that I like my soy sauce like I do Chalet Sauce: as a post-course drink. This was also the first time I tried the tartare, and it was bursting with flavour in every bite.  That being said, I didn't just come here for the food. My main objective was to try the signature Ginger Grapefruit Saketini that they had on offer, and it didn't disappoint. (Though for $15, it better not have.) It packs a punch in every sip - my palate could definitely taste the ginger and a light grapefruit note cutting through the heavy alcohol, but it's a stylish and unique drink that's easily the centerpiece of the table. My group was going to try some of the Japanese whiskey, but ended up settling for another venue - I'm not sure we would have been able to handle it anyway.  Blowfish is (was) one of the hippest spots in King West, and I'm sorry to see it go. The combination of the mood, service and food was fantastic, and it really was a memorable experience. I hope the owner reopens the space as something else (but please don't open another steakhouse - there's already enough in the immediate area).  If you can, visit before the restaurant closes. It's well worth the trek."}
{"text":"The design of the place is nice. It's honestly an excellent spot to meet for drinks but I wouldn't go for the food. It's more of a fusion spot with gimmicky sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi here is very average, you are paying for the location and atmosphere. Tuna rolls were mediocre, felt there could have been a higher quality of ingredients however the presentation of the food was crafty. I would go back as it's a very trendy sushi place."}
{"text":"Where people go to enjoy bottles of California Cabernet and some good sushi.  I was going to give them one star because this place officially has the worst wine list in Toronto to accompany their food but some of the dishes were impressive so 2 stars you go.   A place like this does a disservice to society by having the most nonsensical wines to accompany some well thought out dishes. Why? They are catering to Bay Street. The wine and food should pair together to create a harmonious taste but after our 3rd bottle of Shiraz I couldn't bloody taste the food.   Such a shame. Let the food sing.   For your whites please put on a variety of dry and off dry Rieslings, Pinot Blanc, Muscadet, Pinot Gris, Chenin Blanc, lighter Sauv Blancs like from Sancerre, feature cooler regions like Alsace, Loire, Germany, Northern Italy and shocking Ontario. Acidity is needed and some lightly off dry wines.   For reds how about some County or Niagara Pinot and where's the Gamay? Or Northern Syrah? Or Syrah from Ontario? Even cooler climate Malbec could work.   Steve Jobs said \" A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.\"   Show them how to enjoy your food with delicious wines that will enhance the evening not murder their palates. Oh yes it's okay to have 1-2 options of the bigger styles of wines like a Sauv Blanc or Chardonnay for whites or 1-2 Cabernets and perhaps a Malbec so you can offer different price points but show them the way."}
{"text":"Went to Barfish for an event this week. Considering the group organizing the event, I thought this place was going to be a lot more impressive. Everything from the overly sweet signature drinks to the tight hallway of a bar next to the restaurant, to the drugstore brand of sticky soap in the restroom, left me hanging. Will continue to explore the neighborhood but hope it outperforms this place."}
{"text":"For the life of me I can't figure out why this place doesn't have higher ratings! I've had sushi all over the world and this place is one of the best! I wanted to lick most of my plates!   Location: Perfect! Right on King st. I took the trolley car and it was super easy! not sure about parking if you drive. It's the middle of downtown so I can't imagine it would be easy.   Service: Very appropriate. We went on a Saturday night around 6 (which I know is early) but even when we were leaving around 8, it wasn't like we weren't getting attention from the servers. And, our server came around pretty frequently, to clear plates and pour us more sake. But it wasn't in an annoying way where she was interrupting all the time.   Food: Like I said, I wanted to lick my plates! Is the food expensive? Yes! But good sushi is! You should expect to spend a pretty penny. If you're not prepared to, then go somewhere else.  Here is what we got... Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice - This started in Los Angeles (where I live) and I've had it at countless places. This one is the best! I love that they crisp the rice perfectly. Their spicy tuna is also so perfectly creamy! jalapeño hamachi - I just wish I had more! The sauce was so good we saved it to dip our other dishes in spicy tuna with rock shrimp - While it was good, it wasn't anything fantastic or fancy. But I'm glad we got it because it was a good mouthful.  lobster + shrimp shumai - this is small (three spoons with the yumminess in it), but really good. I needed some more salt on it, but I'm learning americans just like more salt on things than Canadians.  arroz con setas - perfect ending! really flavorful (didn't need salt on this one) I think there was more, but I can't remember  Drinks: by far the best thing here was the drink we had! caribou crossing. It was so yummy!"}
{"text":"The seating is quite tight here and the tables seem to be almost communal which is unfortunate.  The space is dark, sexy and the place draws people in for a couple bites or dinner prior to hitting up the nightlife scene on King West.  The Hamachi roll wad the highlight of the night, light complex, fresh, and textural interesting it's a must have if your there.  Everything else is good but not remarkable.  They have quite an extensive sake list and a selection of white and red wines and craft cocktails.    Shout out to Diana she was a wonderful waitress very attentive had a great personality."}
{"text":"Visited Blowfish for the first time last week anticipating it to be amazing but it blew! The quality of the food was on par with what you could find at any sushi restaurant. Service was meh. This place exploits its location to try too hard to be something it's not. Turning down the loud club music, offering authentic Japanese rolls, using higher quality ingredients, getting rid of the incompetent matre'di/manager (who ever that old guy with the glasses is) and this place *might* be deserving of a 4.5 rating.  Food ordered: Nigiri Toro, salmon  Rolls spicy tuna with rock shrimp  Hot plate hot stone-seared wagyu striploin slices"}
{"text":"I had been here many years ago and a friend suggested I try it again since it had gone through renovations since I had last been there. The lychee martini was delicious. Between the 2 of us, we ordered 7 different dishes. The black cod was the best out of all of them. It was a small portion, but very tasty. The 3 different types of sushi that we ordered were all okay. Unless you dipped them into the accompanying sauce and soy sauce, they were just okay. The chefs were a bit inventive though, adding a piece of orange on top for example. The bok choy was good too. The ambiance was nice and you could tell it is the place where people want to be seen. I found it annoying that the couple next to us were talking very loudly, I think more for us to hear their conversation about what they do, etc. The music was great and I noticed that I started bobbing to to beat towards the end of the meal. The service was alright too."}
{"text":"I came here as one of the prizes I won through Much and it has to honestly be the best sushi restaurant I've ever eaten at. The service was amazing and the one bartender with the cool top hat was super nice serving us drinks! He even made me a one-of-a-kind drink when I didn't know what to get. He was the one I interacted with the most and had the friendliest attitude and made me laugh which usually never happens with me when I go out for dinner. I absolutely love their truffle albacore roll (spicy albacore tuna paste, tiger shrimp and avocado; topped with a garlic chip and truffle oil drizzle), I've had three of those just because it was so good. Overall all their sushi, sashimi, rolls, desserts, and drinks were phenomenal and excellent quality. It is on the pricey side but it was definitely worth it. I believe our bill was over $200 there... anyways definitely would go back again for special occasions or just for a nice dinner.  :)"}
{"text":"Great food, really expensive for what you get however. Been 3-4 times now and the service has been good about 50% of the time, terrible the other 50%.  It's super loud in there, almost night club loud, which is kind of cool if you're drinking but if you want to talk to the people you're with it's literally impossible as the night gets later and the place starts getting going.   GREAT people watching, lot's of trendy folks who are out to be seen.   I will likely go back but it's certainly not an every week kind of place."}
{"text":"I love Blow fish! This restaurant is consistently good. I went on Friday night for the first time in a while. The recent renovation looks amazing and I was really happy to see the restrooms no longer have a communal sink.   Blow Fish gets very busy, so I suggest making a reservation.   My friends and I shared several dishes and rolls : The shooter with the prawn (can't think of name) is a must have! The orange and black is my favourite roll - salmon and mango The dish with the shrimps on the hot stone is flavourful and yummy All the sashimi was buttery and fresh The spicy yellow tail appetizer is delightful  The service is excellent and there is a great, energetic vibe.   I highly recommend Blow Fish!"}
{"text":"Come here for the drinks and the scene, not for the food!  For drinks, I recommend the Wasabi Seaweed Caeser but it is incredibly spicy so if you can't handle the hot stuff, you will not be able to finish this drink. The Pineapple Express was also very good.  Unfortunately, the food here is way overpriced. The portions are extremely small and the fish didn't seem very fresh, particularly the Hiramasa Jalepeno which was chewy and tough in texture.  And beware of what seemed like chilled tap water that they are peddling here as bottled because they put it in some martini shaker looking thing. When I noticed the charge on my bill (I can't remember if it was $9 or $14), I asked the waitress what brand of water it was and she couldn't answer that question but she did remove the charge from my bill. I'm willing to bet they have a Brita filter in the back that they are pouring filtered water into bottles that they reuse. Charging that much money for water that isn't Acqua Panna or Voss or something equally as nice is a complete scam but thankfully they took care of it when I said something."}
{"text":"Went to blowfish with a friend for lunch and were seated in the bar area. The waitress was extremely attentive and suggested some great stuff. We started with junmai nigori genshu and mango passion lychee saketini both were delicious. I couldn't be happier with my selection of sake! Then we ordered two rolls of sushi, coconut bay and spicy tuna with rock shrimp which were both suggested by our waitress. Spicy tuna rock shrimp was incredibly tasty and so packed with flavor. I think its safe to say that I've not had better roll anywhere else! The coconut bay was really good too but fell flat in comparison to the spicy rock shrimp! We ended with flourless chocolate torte, which was not that great in my opinion, my friend seemed to really enjoy it. But i'm not a huge fan of flourless cakes and such. The ambiance was great and so was the service. Loved the atmosphere and can't wait to go back there again!"}
{"text":"Went back to see the new space. Gorgeous  ! Staff was still polished and on the ball. Food was unique and delicious. Staff especially Nishan the bartender and Krista our waitress rocked !!!"}
{"text":"Good, inventive food, impeccable service.  Full disclosure, we got a gift certificate to this place, otherwise there is no way we would be able to afford the amount of food and drink we ordered. I've decided that having someone else pay is the absolute best way to enjoy fine dining.  The thing that stuck out the most about this place was the service. It was incredible. Our server was very nice and attentive, without being too intrusive (though she did ask us if we enjoyed every single plate we got). My water glass never went down below  an inch before being filled up again and we never had to wait for anything.  The food was very good, what I enjoyed the most was the Soft Shell Crab Tartar (not really tartar, it was deep fried) roll and the Black Cod, both of which were spectacular. Everything else we ordered was pretty good, but didn't really blow me away.   I actually liked the idea of ordering small plates and trying a ton of stuff, but the price point was a little high for the quality and quantity in my opinion.   Quick tip: when going to the airplane style bathrooms (pretty cool!), you need to push the doors REALLY HARD to get in. It took me 5 full minutes of pawing at the door like a cat before I figured that out."}
{"text":"Very average food to be considered an upscale sushi restaurant. I ordered two aburi rolls, a nigiri set, a blowfish roll and their yuzu hamachi. The aburi rolls were the most disappointing as I was comparing the quality taste and presentation to jabistro and miku and blowfish couldn't even compare. The nigiri set was fine but I can't say it had the fresh sashimi taste that I craved. The blowfish roll was alright, we got the tuna on the rocks roll and the fried shrimp was nice but it just didn't feel like a sushi roll anymore. Yuzu hamachi was probably the best  The ambience was dimly lit and quite nice minus the fact that loud rap and hip hop music was playing. Made the environment seem like the restaurant is more for the hype than actual good Japanese food.   Overall very average."}
{"text":"My fav sushi spot in the city - great on a Thursday after work. Be sure to make a reservation on the weekend. We had a 9pm reservation and still managed to wait around (mind you, it was fashion week). The saketinis are amazing and there's no such thing as a bad choice on their menu."}
{"text":"The ebi shooters are the best asian fusion appetizers I have ever tried. Overall the food never disappoints.  However I must say that i much preferred previous set up where the bar was part of the restaurant. The service was excellent. It is pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Tasty food, moderately priced, although because we had a group of people we had to use a set menu, and the 3rd courses came out too slow, since these were the larger portioned 'sharing' dish.  I would not recommend it for a group, however possibly for a date.  And--- the serving staff is superb!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing overwhelming, ambience was pretty nice, service was awesome. But the food is totally over priced. You can get even better quality food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Continues to be one of the best Asian fusion places anywhere.  No other place has anything that compares to the taste and presentation of the giant ebi shooter.  They have a good selection of sushi and tasty and imaginative Makimono's.  Also tried the black cod which was very tasty.  Given their menu they could offer more white wine by the glass.  Service was great!  Our server was very knowledgeable and able to offer good advice while navigating the menu. The overall rating would be higher except for the ambiance.  Although the decor is nice the restaurant was empty during a night and time when you would expect otherwise."}
{"text":"My waitress was nice, but the food was mediocre. I have eaten here before, last year, and it was soooo good. Pretty disappointed in the experience tonight. And the girls at the door were completely snotty. I asked for a table or seat for one, and the looks they have me were awful. If the owner knew how they treat people, I'm sure he would be super mad. Not ever going back."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype of this place. The only thing I liked about it was the music, otherwise it sucked. If you're looking for overpriced mediocre food and shit service, maybe this is the place for you. I won't be back anytime soon lol.   Sushi rolls- overpriced and tiny. Sashimi wasn't fresh Miso soup- salty otherwise ok Green tea- strong and bitter Service- the worst. Some Indian guy in a fedora who looked impatient and flustered most if the time."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here.  Our waitress was fun and just great.   it was hard to decide what to order since it all read great.  I had a great pomegranate and berries saki cocktail, which was fantastic.   The green tea was also great and served in a unique way.  I absolutely loved the crispy rice with spicy tuna.  It was great and had a jalapeño for a kick and it was a nice portion.   The sushi was fresh and great.  I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are such bad reviews here, but we had a great time.    Great service, all very timely.  We had the Australian Sauvignon Blanc as our wine which was excellent, not as fruity as the Marlboroughs, but dry and light.  The higher end Sauv Blanc is Cloudy Bay, and I think it's overrated.    We ordered; Lobster and shrimp dumplings, excellent Shrimp tempura, very light batter, excellent  Salmon Sashimi, some of the best we have had, buttery Red Curry Roll, nice blend of tastes, very unique.  All,in all, a great experience.  Ambiance and music were just right.  We struck up a conversation with a couple at the next table.  Music was not overpowering at all.  Fun and trendy spot"}
{"text":"was pretty stoked to try after hearing so much about it  overall experience was good, space is beautiful, fish was fresh, wine was good and cooked food was good. but nothing really jumped out and was somewhat disappointed because of the lack of wow factor  i wouldn't go back anytime soon.. i prefer YUZU for sushi  just saying.."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday & it was a huge success. The decor is very modern, dark lit and cozy. The food was absolutely amazing, a lot of variety, would recommend the Orange + black! The service was pretty good but could use some improvement. A little on the pricier side when it comes to sushi but well worth it for a nice meal out."}
{"text":"I recently went to a Japanese whiskey tasting event at this venue and it was amazing. There were some samples of food and whiskey throughout the night. The staff was super friendly as they work for the venue and not the event host. When I arrived with my friends early, they were setting up and we quickly grabbed a table. Food samples were served throughout the night including unagi nigiri, chicken skewers, friend chicken, fried peppers, duck and cheesecake.  The bar was a bit tight for the event and the two bartenders were working hard all night.  There was one bartender doing some fancy tricks with the cocktail making. I thought he was part of the vendor team promoting the whiskey but turns out he works at Blowfish.  The promoter was there and explained their whiskey. You can order it neat, on the rocks, and 2 different cocktail choices. The expert was also coming around to guests with the bottle and pouted shots for us. They also brought in some Taiko drummers to perform twice for the group.  Overall, it was a great night and would return to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Came here a short while ago with friends. I would rate it 2.5 stars; 5 for the service, 0.5 for atmosphere and -3 for my disappointment in the food.   Good points: Service was very good. Waiter was friendly and engaged us in genial genuine conversation. Definite plus there.  Atmosphere and decor is very chic, good for a romantic night out.  Most dishes were good, and had some creativity in terms of putting ingredients together.   Bad points: Portions are very very small for the price point, which is not unexpected for a place like this so I can let that go. However, having spent a little over $100/person including drinks, we were actually still hungry afterwards and ended up going to McDonald's.  Not impressed with the sushi because they did not use the proper short grain rice, instead cheating out with long grain one more commonly found with Chinese dishes. In fact, it was pretty much the same rice used in T&T sushi platters, which I paid $10 for. I found the rice was not flavourful either.  The fish itself was good quality, but about the same if you were to go to any other moderately priced restaurant.  Lighting is very very dark. Difficult to see the food or the person across the table. The hallway to the washrooms was completely unlit, which made it very difficult to see the unmarked black doors.   I definitely would not return to this place in case you can't tell."}
{"text":"What a wonderful night ... left all the decisions to the chef and my guests and I could not have been happier. Waitstaff were attentive but not intrusive."}
{"text":"This place is so bipolar. It is a sushi restaurant wanting desperately to be a trendy lounge. The people watching is very entertaining. Women who were past their due date but proudly display the silicone and gingerly step in 6 inch heels supported by matchstick stems. Men who were overtly comfortable with showing of their fashion palate. Couples who owned the room next to ones who seem more timid than bambi in a forest fire.   Anyways, still just an exciting atmosphere. The place is split into a long bar, backlit pink and a long set of dining tables seating 2-4. The sakitini menu is impressive and worth a try despite the obvious mark-up.  Foodwise, you're really expecting much? Okay. As for the famed ebi shooter that EVERYONE seems to rave about? OVERRATED. I can see it being novel for some people who don't dine much but seriously, it is an oversized hand-roll with shrimp, tempura bits and a soy wrap shell. If this is their signature piece, they need a new gimmick. Bottomline, avoid it and if you really want, lie and tell people you had it.  Their food is bipolar as well. The hot plates were extremely mediocre. Everything is salted to the hilt. Perhaps the top fell off the shaker? We tried the black cod which was very tender, but nearly salt-infused. The egglant shrimp plate was even worse. Not edible.  Ahh.....but the good stuff. Their nigri is fresh and their maki ($13/roll) are well constructed and flavorful. Especially their orange and black and hotate tuna rolls. Very nice...saved the night.  Overall, this place has its warts. But then again, the atmosphere is definitely impressive, people watch, knock back some overpriced sake and order the maki.  Three stars this time, but I could make it four next time."}
{"text":"You know you're in a sake bar when they offer 22 sake martinis and a 2 page sake list. My review is strictly from sitting at the bar with the cool- vibe-tender and actually ordering a cucumber inspired sake off -the-menu martini. Definitely ask for it.  I did sample a mango-on-the-menu one and it was delicious. Just wanting a snack we ordered the cook on a hot stone Kobe beef entree which was fun. They present a platter with a VERY hot stone and slices of uncooked Kobe beef and chopstick and all sorts of sauces and you get to play cook. The unmarked door. The I don't look like a bar/restaurant from the outside. Then you walk in and feel utterly chic."}
{"text":"Blowfish can blow their own horn!  This was a welcome treat during our May 2014 visit to Toronto.  The spicy edamame was something I hadn't tried before and really liked.  The drinks were an excellent accompaniment to the meal.  The calamari and korean beef apps we had really set the stage for some terrific sushi rolls. I didn't care for the orange and black salmon roll, but I'm not a fan of salmon to begin with so no surprise there, I just don't like fishy fishes, but wifey felt it was good.  The Ebi Shooter was simply awesome and the flavors seemed to change as you made your way from top to bottom, or bottom to top depending on your preference.  Even the non-sushi fans in the group enjoyed their meals here which gave them confidence to try things that they normally wouldn't - white people, go figure ;-)  All in all, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a moderately priced sushi, Asian restaurant and if I ever make it back to the great white north, I'll stop in again!"}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant is giving me a come hither look with it's seductive decor and mood lighting.  This is actually a large place that has PLENTY of seating inside, including being able to sit at the sushi bar.  Yes it's overpriced but it's on King W so you expect it going in.  I have to say I loved the decor - the tables were gorgeous and I actually wanted to bring one home with me!  Great place for a date because the lighting makes you look FABULOUS!  My friend and I ordered a few dishes to share - the Asian salad which was a nice refreshing salad with pears, walnuts and croutons and a nice tart dressing.  We also had the hot curry salmon roll, which is pretty spicy without being overbearing for the salmon.  The orange and blank roll that had mango which was also pretty good.  We tried the mushroom dumplings (sorry forgot the actual name of this dish) and while yum you only got 4 tiny pieces which was disappointing.    Their drinks menu consists of sakes and some wine and cocktails but be prepared to shell out $$$$.    Not quite full we decided to get a dessert to share but I think this is where the restaurant lost me.  The dessert menu has about 5-6 choices with a few being ice cream dishes.  We tried the trioice cream - chocolate, strawberry and green tea.  I thought it was weird that the ice cream came with a fork???  But then we knew why - the ice cream was encased in some soft shell....something...marshmellow kind of texture.  You had to cut through it.  The chocolate and athe strawberry were unimpressive - my friend commented she thought it tasted like Chapmans ice cream.  The green tea I will admit had a nice strong flavour to it.    Service was ok - nothing great but no complaints really.  I wouldn't mind coming back here again to try a few other items on the list but I don't think this will be my place to go....but then again...that lighting did make me look...fabulous...."}
{"text":"My fav sushi place in Toronto.. What is the deal with all these 2-3 stars. Seriously, the sushi is AWESOME! Creative rolls, Ebi handroll in rice paper is a MUSTTTTT! Cocktails, delish...  ok it's expensive, but you get what you pay for: Trendy atmosphere, great sushi, good service, fab cocktails.. I'd pay more for that combo!"}
{"text":"I've never felt like a piece of meat  in sushi bar but this place is a scene, filled with beautiful Toronto people out for a good time. Solid sushi and cocktails too.   Make sure that you have the Giant Ebi Shooter (we ordered a few back-ups of these) they are large and delicious. The lobster dumplings are cleverly served on a Japanese soup spoon and had us all in a revered silence while eating them.  The space is pretty and full of people after 10. Make reservations."}
{"text":"I've been to Blowfish twice now.  It's a nice space, the service is great, and the food is good.  The problem is, neither the food, service, or space warrant the amount of money you need to drop for dinner. There are better places to get sushi or Japanese food in the city -- much better places.   That said, Blowfish may be the only Japanese restaurant of its kind in the city -- a trendy lounge that happens to serve food.   If that's what you're looking for, it's well worth checking out.     The Saketini's are great.   (I'm just not sure they are worth almost 20 dollars a pop.)  I'm not adverse to spending a lot of money on dinner, but I like to feel like i'm getting my money's worth.  With Blowfish I feel like you are paying to be seen there more than anything else.  The place feels like a hang out for 30 year olds with too much money to spend.  Blowfish is good.  It's just not _that_ good."}
{"text":"Cool spot, sexy interior, on-point Japanese cuisine.  My reco's:  Ebi shooter - a must. Inventive and delicious melange of tiger prawn, mango, avocado, veg, tempura bits and tobiko, wrapped in soy paper. (Tip: they'll happily split this \"giant shooter\" into 2 or three smaller shooters...just ask.)  Spicy tuna with rock shrimp roll - yumsers  Roasted miso-marinated black cod - melt in your mouth  Spicy edamame - because: spicy edamame (hello?)"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a sushi restaurant that scores on both quality of food and vibe: Blowfish is one of those.   This place stands out for both the creativity of dishes, hip vibe, and extensive sake menu. I'd recommend Blowfish to anyone that wants to fuse a night a sushi with great people watching as well.  Rumor has it that this place is frequented by celebrities during the Toronto International Film Festival."}
{"text":"Blowfish took me by surprise! It was our first visit every dish wowed us except for the scallops with white soy foam (at least for me). It was just me. I personally don't find foams attractive at all but everything else was just fantastic. I'm looking forward to go again!"}
{"text":"Was given terrible service from the start to the finish.  Wrong coat given at coat check and when my waitress who didn't care for us at all (we were not drinking so she assumed it would be a bad tip) didn't come back after waiting over 20 minutes I went over to the coats myself to find it.  Only then was I approached by a server and asked what I was doing.  Mistakes in my drink order, attitude when asking questions, etc. Food was subpar for the price they are charging.  Had the curry sushi and thought it was awful.  Spicy tuna tasted like it was canned tuna.   I wouldn't return or recommend."}
{"text":"We went here over the weekend for dinner. The sushi is excellent and above average. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting/ romantic. It can get crowded around dinner time. Try the green tea with rice and cake for dessert, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I came to this place for the last time (measured in years). Literally because I did not remember the name but I did remember the place looks. I happened to ask around and someone said, oh, yes, that's BlowFish... well, I came back with no expectations. It has been a while and may be the place (or sushi masters) has changed. The first thing I noticed was how quiet it was. I remember this place being vibrant, eclectic and crowded from open to close. It was a Tuesday night and I happened to be alone in the bar till some other 2 guys sat down close to me. Couple of tables, here and there and that was it. I have to point, it is still the same quality and creativity I remember from the old days. Unfortunately the service is also the same than the old days; seem not to improve at all. I really suggest you to stay away from Nigiri/Sashimi and go to the rolls. Really creative and fresh. Only one thing. A roll there, comes cut in 6 small pieces, not 8. That means, the roll is kind of small compared to other restaurants. I will suggest to get a little 'something else' to complement. Yes, I know, it is on the overprice size, but it is really worth it. One extra tip, stay in the wine and beer side. Liquor is really over price and this is really not worth the money. Ah, and please... check the washrooms (that's the way they call the restrooms in Canada)... talking about creativity? You will not be disappointed. Now that I rediscovered Blowfish back, I will stop by, next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"Blowfish is the best Japanese fusion restaurant in the city by far!  The salmon belly with truffles oil is out of this world and so is the ebi shooter! (You need to order both items!)  The duck tataki is apparently extremely well prepared and the steak is also delicious. I do not eat meat but my friends absolutely loved it !  The rice is extremely well prepared and the sushi rolls are amazing, especially the albacore tuna roll !"}
{"text":"As much as my friends rant and rave about Blowfish being their fav destination to grab some sushi, drinks and have a fun night out I would personally have to disagree. Its not that I didn`t enjoy my visits but I would have to say that nothing much stands out in such an impressive way as to make this worth the bill at the end.  The owner I have personally met before and he is a wonderful gentleman with a fantastic personality and way of doing business and the staff is pleasant and very helpful. They know the menu well, which is a plus for me because I am not the biggest sushi fan and they were able to navigate me through the confusing choices making sure I enjoyed the dishes I received.   I found the plating and presentation of the food very impressive, in fact its almost a work of art displayed to you on a plate, sometimes almost a shame to eat.  However the food itself is worth ruining the aesthetic display of it as it is tasty... the coconut shrimp truly was to die for. Light, crispy and sweet with just the right amount of coconut flavor. I find the majority of the dishes I tried had a good balance of flavors and some unique combinations.  Although I was shocked by the tastiness of their Mojito, the cost of drinks here is what can really get you. Much of the other drinks I had tried were no better then anywhere else, they seem to have few unique drink recipes and the tabs at the end were quite ridiculous at times.   The location itself I am not entirely thrilled with, I find it very awkward for anything other then foot traffic;  there is very little parking around that is affordable and convenient and having a cab drop you off at this very busy and congested corner can be awful. Once you get inside I find the layout awful, there is a long bar that takes up the majority of the small space available and the seats are incredibly close. It sort of reminds me of a stall layout, not my favorite design technique.   Now the ambiance of the place itself is not terrible but for what it is and claims to be I feel it has a rather dated look and needs to be revamped, especially the floor plan. Tables seem to be cramped as well no matter where you sit and although it is a sushi bar and lounge I find it loud at times do to the small cramped quarters.  Again I will reiterate that this place is certainly not a bad place to grab a bite or a few drinks however for all the hype I don`t really feel it lives up to it or the rather high bill you will likely be ringing up"}
{"text":"Friend took me here for a birthday dinner. Walked in around 7pm and it was a nice place, very trendy with nice decor. Place had a bar and dining area that were separated.  Ordered ALOT of food - best things off the top of my head were the Ebi Shooters (big shrimp and really filling) the Lobster Seafood Miso soup (generous servings of seafood - lobster claw, scallops, calamari..DELISH!) and the tuna and spicy rock shrimp roll (tuna roll with rock shrimp tossed in spicy mayo on top..yum)   Also had dessert, the chocolate torte was amazing and melt in your mouth! Miso cheesecake was good also.   As it got later, they opened up the barrier between the bar and dining area. Music also got very loud so if you're looking to have a nice quiet dinner, wrong place to be.   Overall awesome place to hang out with friends and throw back a couple of drinks after a long week. Food is expensive but worth a visit on special occasions!"}
{"text":"Saturday night at Blowfish is as good as it gets. Trendy, romantic and TASTY are only a few of the words to describe this HOT Toronto Resturant. Upon arrival I was greeted by friendly staff who had our reservations ready and table set ready to go. We were lucky enough to snag  reservation on a Saturday night at short notice, granted it was at 9pm but this place is hard to get into.   This place is not for a picky eater or someone who wont try new dishes. All the dishes are bursting with flavour and the freshness of the fish (salmon, tuna, shrimp etc) are divine. A simple roll like spicy salmon tastes 10x better than any sushi joint. Of course this place is NOT cheap..it is very pricey and I would say for special occasions or a great date night.   I loved how the dishes are small and tapas style so you get to share and try everything.   The only complain I have is when my waiter asked if I wanted 3 or 4 shrimp/crab dumplings I said 3 when she came to the table she gave me 4..and charged me for 4. That was a piss off.   Regardless,  ending on a positive note... the staff were attentive and the ambiance is lovely."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant though I only have three issues.  First, it was a little pricey, even for a sushi restaurant.  Second, there just is not enough cooked options on the menu.  I went to the restaurant with a non sushi lover and they just do not have the options like Ki has.  Third, it is really tough to find from the concourse (no signage)."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Best sushi place in down town.  Great service and atmosphere. Highly recommend that place."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is the best way to describe it. Their drinks are good, but the rest of their good isn't good enough to justify the price. To be honest, I'm never sure how this place is always so full."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Now it's mediocre and overpriced. They closed for renovations and apparently that involved creating a Jumanji ambiance with Dollarama plastic plants behind the chef's bar.  The food used to be incredible and now I had to stop myself from ordering more because EVERYTHING was disappointing. The ebi shooters, the hamachi, the spicy tuna on fried rice. Fried rice?? I've had crackers less bland and with a better texture. You've lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Good food but way overpriced. Lunch today was an orange and black roll and two ebi hand rolls and a tiny $6 glass of weak \"thyme\" lemonade. Final cost: $43.   I organized a farewell lunch for a colleague and made a reservation for 6 people. Fail: was not informed that a lunchtime group of six would be auto-grat at 18%. The service was mediocre at best and certainly didn't warrant the tip she received.   I have had two great, albeit expensive, dinners here and this my first lunch. The sushi menu for lunch is a fraction of the size if the dinner menu and greatly disappointing. I'd rather spend my lunch $ at the Acko in the path for a quarter if the price, thank you."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Everything we ate as a party of four people was wonderful. The only item I would advise against in the Red Hot Curry Salmon roll.... while I somewhat enjoyed it, it is certainly a non traditional roll.  Tasted strongly of a tandoori dish... which is ok at an Indian restaurant or a fusion Indian restaurant.... Equivalent would be a Philadelphia Roll with Philadelphia cream cheese.... at this price point, I expect more authenticity to Japanese cuisine than this, even with some flair of fusion.   The rock shrimp on spicy tuna roll was utterly amazing.  Everything else was utterly flawless.   Price for cocktails was steep considering the margins on alcohol.  I had two Tequila Dreamers, which did have Tromba tequila (love Tromba) but at $20 a pop, an extra ounce of spirits would have made the price more reasonable.... even considering the high rent area.   Four people with one bottle on wine was $600.... aside from the Red Hot Curry roll (which I was scolded for ordering) and the pricey cocktails, I have no regrets.  Blowfish is a definite go to !!"}
{"text":"Great location, nice décor but for me it was missing the 'wow factor'. Service was just o.k, and a little on the slow side. The food (we had several sashimi dishes, and some spicy rolls) was good but definitely overpriced. Portions are small and the presentation is nothing special. I came here at the insistence of  my friend and actually wish we had gone somewhere else. If you are going to charge a premium, at least justify it with larger portions or spectacular service. If you are looking for a great sushi restaurant, sadly, you won't find it here..."}
{"text":"Just went to Blowfish again for dinner last night. Food is generally good. They have the usual Japanese dishes but just revamped adding a little twist. Rolls are decent, but should have more fish, more variety of fish, and larger in size.   Items to try: shooter, rock shrimp, enoki beef rolls, hot oil Hamachi I just alright,  We basically ordered half of that menu and it was just alright.   Calamari doesn't need the almonds although the wasabi mayo was great. Green goddess roll good for the wasabi pea toppings.   Wine list extensive but quality of drinks can be better, especially in the moderate price range for bottles.   Would visit again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a 2.5 rating **'  Unfortunately, my experience echoes much of what other reviewers have already expressed. I found Blowfish's fusion offerings to be very much lost in translation. Dimly-(mood?)-lit with a very modern feel, with wooden tables beautifully burned/carved depicting koi fish, with a very distracting instrumental music blaring in the background. Service and staff seemed very nice. The same cannot be said for much of the food. The \"special\" rolls, that we thought we'd order to try something that cannot be had elsewhere, were a bizarre application of spice that only served to obscure the flavour of the main protein of the sushi (such is the case with the Red Hot Curry Salmon roll)---I guess to be fair, we weren't sure what to expect (deaddovedonoteat.gif). The nigiri were average at best and uninteresting overall. The only exception was the foie gras tuna for which is probably their saving grace. An interesting decadent bite of rich, fatty, and savoury, the foie gras tuna was worth ordering a second. For me, Blowfish comes across as a sushi-avant-garde-wannabe with a selection that seems to be a collection of ideas that sound good on paper, but should remain on paper. The disparity between the quality of their food and their overall aesthetic is only exacerbated by the accompanying price tag. At this range, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent! A unique spin on japasian fusion."}
{"text":"Typical fusion place that offers overpriced white-washed \"asian\" dishes.   Portions small, prices high, typical only pretty waitresses in tight dresses with lots of makeup. Atmosphere isn't bad, but a bit too uppity for my taste. Their quality of food isn't good enough to justify the pretentious vibe.   Our reaction after each tiny dish was the same. \"Meh\".  If you want good + real asian food, spend a fraction and go to Markham or Scarbs. If you just want sushi, go to Ichiban or Sushi Moto, and although not the best sushi out there, it's definitely better and way cheaper. Or if you're looking for a nice sushi meal downtown, you can eat at Ja Bistro for the same price but wayyy better food.   Save your money. There are numerous better options in the DT core for the same price."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that Blowfish only has 3.5 stars! I was visiting family in TO over the weekend, and we decided to get dinner here on a Saturday night. The service was great, the ambiance wonderful, the food and drinks - fantastic. The only drawback is that it's quite expensive. The servings are really small, and so you're forced to order a number of dishes (which is good, because they have so many good dishes, but bad because each dish is over $10-$12). The drinks are unique, and delicious, but again, all between $10-$15 each.So, if you're in the mood for some goood sushi, and if you're willing to splurge a lil bit, Blowfish is a good option! :)"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and you can sometimes spot local \"celebrities\". The food is pricey but it is worth it for the Ebi Rolls and Spicy Tuna. I haven't had anything like them anywhere else. The rest of the menu is okay but those items are spectacular. I save this place for a special occasion and when I have a little money to splurge.  I heard they had to close due to a fire and have since reopened.  We will be checking the menu to ensure the standout dishes are still there for a return visit."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in two years, both on work related business. My colleagues are huge fans of this place.  The orange and black roll is always a big hit as was the tempura rock shrimp roll, this time around.  The sashimi is always very good here. The service this go around was a bit weak, and it wasn't even busy. This is a solid place"}
{"text":"Worst service in the city. Our group of four -- two couples, dressed nicely -- was looking for a drink at around 12:30 on Saturday night. The front door was open and there were people seated at the bar and at tables, so we entered. We looked around for a host/hostess or waiter, and were suddenly accosted by an elderly Asian man -- owner? manager? -- who shouted \"We're closed, we're closed!\" and placed a hand on my back and my friend's back, literally PUSHING us out the front door.   I have never been treated like that anywhere else and neither had she. (BTW, we're both professional, polite women in our twenties, not exactly scene-causing ruffians.) I've worked at nightclubs in T.O. and I know that some people need to be physically shown the door, however you should never, ever touch a stranger -- let alone a customer! -- unless it is well and truly necessary.   We simply stood there waiting for someone to greet us, and instead of saying something like, \"Oh, sorry, we're just shutting down, please come back another time,\" this rude man put his hands on us and pushed us out the door. To top it off, we heard the bartender thank this older man for kicking us out. Yes, thank you for acting so rudely so that I didn't have to serve these people? Amazing. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Great service!  Good vibe!   Food  was horrible and over priced.   Felt like I took one too many shots puked in my mouth and swallowed it!   You know that's happened to you before :D"}
{"text":"An electrical fire happened at Blowfish just around the holidays, which has closed down the restaurant and probably won't be another month until the building is fixed.  One of my favourite sushi restaurants in King West will be missed until they reopen, maybe with a freshened interior?"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Thompson Hotel which is next door to the Blowfish, located right on King Street.  We walked over for dinner on a Friday night, with reservations.  The group of us ( 6 ) Had a cocktail at the small side bar. Not a lively bar, but it had quite an extensive & adventurous cocktail menu.  Our food was all Delicious !  The rolls, the sashimi, the appetizers. We were pleased with each dish.  They surprised us with dessert and a sparkler candle, as it was my bachelorette weekend.  Keep walking down King Street and you will find some fun bars !"}
{"text":"In town for a few days and meeting some new friends who suggested this place! What a great experience!  As a vegetarian sushi can sometimes be a challenge however Blowfish had a great selection of options (veggie sushi, tempura vegetables, hot dishes).  I got the two veggie rolls and the one with banana was GREAT! I would never think to add banana but with the avocado and crunch it was delicious! The tempura mushrooms were also so so good and not greasy at all!  While I didn't drink my table had wine and cocktails and they raved about how good they were!   The ambiance is also nice in that its perfect for date night (low lighting etc) but great for a group of friends too!  The service was prompt and friendly and very knowledgable about the menu! Will definitely come back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"This was the most overrated sushi I've ever had. The staff there think that they work at Nobu. We were told that the muscles were their specialty for the evening and that it had a Brazilian/Japanese fusion flavor. They were described as baked muscles. They came served to us filled to the brim with uncooked onions and were iced. They tasted like cold salty pussies. The manager who brought it out stood OVER our table and watched us try it. And then DEMANDED we eat the garnish too (wet seaweed). Apparently salmon belly sashimi is a rare cut to find in the city so we tried it...tasted like regular ass salmon sashimi with lemon zest on top. The crowd there was also a JOKE!! I once heard that it was a trendy restaurant. However we ACTUALLY saw a couple make a fuss demanding a booth, the man dressed in a Canadian tuxedo (denim on denim) and then pull out a flashlight (ok maybe the flashlight app on his phone) to read the menu. SAVAGES!!! Who are you catering to Blowfish??? Further more, it was my bday and my husband had called ahead to make reservations..they told him they would bring out a special cake for us. They never did!! He wanted to mention to the staff when they brought the bill, but I told him not to bother. We spent $100 and went home and ordered a full size fucking pizza from Regino's! Pizza was delicious and we had leftover the next day. 5 out of 5 for Regino's!!"}
{"text":"This was recommended to us and we decided to try it while on our vacation. What you hear is all true. This place is hip, modern, cool and expensive but worth every penny.  Be prepared to see and be seen, everyone was dressed to the nines but being from Miami we are used to that. Most places like that usually dissappoint but Blowfish delivered every step of the way. It is one of the best sushi/ sashimis experiences i have ever had.   Everything was fresh. The sashimi was amazing!!. We also had a roll that was heavenly , as you bite you experience an explosion of flavors into your mouth. Food-gasm!.  We also order the rib eye rolls which were very well prepared and seasoned into amazing flavors. We had the miso cod that was just to die for. I could eat cod every day of my life.  The sake was smooth and delicious and went down too easily. HA!  Here you can do some pretty people watching as well as having a great meal. And you get what you pay for. That is always a plus in my book.  Try it for yourself. Thank me later."}
{"text":"We went here for a work dinner and I have to say it was quite the treat. First of all, the staff was extremely attentive and professional. Next I would say the decor is pretty cool and it has that hip vibe. Lastly I'd say nearly all of the food was top knot and I tried a ton of dishes.  The only thing I would change is the bar area because it's extremely narrow"}
{"text":"Came in for drinks... Friday at 7... nobody in bar/resto... got seated right away but NO service for 15 minutes. Had to go searching for waitress to place order. Everything took 2x as long and again.., place was dead empty!"}
