{"text":"I have been a regular to Bethel Deli for years now, the hoagies are truly amazing.  The only bad thing about it is that it sets the bar way too high for other places, it's hard for me to enjoy hoagies from other places.  It's mainly a take-out place as there are only 2 tables and 3 chairs in the place, although I eat there often but it's hard to rely on having a seat available when it's lunchtime."}
{"text":"The regular Italian hoagie is spectacular. Order it as it comes - with everything. When we're craving a hoagie, this is the place we choose every time, and we rarely deviate from the Italian, even though the others on the menu sound just as great.  The owner is no-nonsense but pleasant enough. There's a good selection of chips, pop, and pasta salads, as well."}
{"text":"Best hoagies I've had. However, the customer service is not good. Staff is short and kind of rude."}
{"text":"Awesome hoagies!  The wife and I usually split a regular size with 2 of the fresh sides.  The softly toasted bread does not cut your mouth :)"}
{"text":"Love the subs here.  This place is a much better alternative to the nearby restaurant and fast food chains.  If you like spicy I would go with the widow maker.  Its filled to the brim with various hot peppers."}
{"text":"Just had another spicy hoagie from here, it was awesome! Their cole slaw is one of the best I've had, finely shredded and actually seasoned! It is very hard to find good cole slaw, and I will get this every time I visit."}
{"text":"Dude... I was reading about hoagies because I saw a six foot sub for sale at DeCarlo's and that made me think of the battleship from the triangle bar, and when I searched it online I saw a post about the best subs in Pittsburgh and the winner was... neither. Instead, it was Bethel Deli. I was shocked, having driven past it so many times and yet never experiencing \"the best\". So I looked them up. I'd give them six stars if I could, the bonus star for the fact that like Mineo's pizza, they carry Blennd, and also because they claim to always stock Cherikee Red.   So I've only had one sub... \"The Real Italian Hoagie\". It was real. Really freaking awesome. Toasted, loaded with delicious meats, cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and sweet onions, that hoagie was oozing with the perfect texture and ratio of those fixings to the delicious bun. I rode my bike down to Bethel Deli, hoping to boost my metabolism and I'm glad I did, the owner and I chatted it up about biking around here, and whew, we made quick work of that hoagie, gobbling it down mere minutes after I removed it from my backpack. I want to go back and soon. I'm a little afraid of the ridiculously hot things on the menu like ghost pepper jack cheese, but it's worth mentioning that you can buy that sort of thing there.  I was a wee bit skeptical when I saw nothing but 5-star reviews here, but now I know what the fuss is about, and I fully agree with it."}
{"text":"They have the best Italian hoagies, hands down! If you doubt me try them and you will thank me later! The guy who runs this place is very nice and very helpful if you are a first timer. I have been here 4 times and each is consistent."}
{"text":"I've lived in bethel park for over 10 years now and this was my first time trying the bethel deli. I've had good hoagies before, but not as good as these! I had the real Italian and the turkey and cheese. They were both excellent. The 13\" is 10.99 and well worth it. Made fresh right in front of you and from the meats to the bread everything is fresh and delicious.  I can't wait to try the others!"}
{"text":"I don't eat a hoagie unless it's here. Fresh, fresh and bomb diggity. Always warm and delicious. Best Hoagies here."}
{"text":"Bethel Deli has been one of my favorite places in the South Hills for the last 5-6 years.  Their italian hoagie isnt just the best in Pittsburgh, it might be the best in the USA.  What separates Bethel Deli from the rest of the pack is the sauce they have crafted for their italian hoagies. The sauce is simply sublime.  Another reason to love the place is their friendly family atmosphere.  They are courteous and respectful to their customers.  I once even had the man behind the counter throw my hoagie out because it didnt pass \"inspection\" and he promptly made me a new one.  That  is the type of care they put into the food they serve.  Everyone should support this mom-and-pop type eatery, because these are the types of places that make Pittsburgh such a great place to live."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients they make a nice oven baked Italian sub nine or 13 inches more than enough for a hungry fella"}
{"text":"The Bethel Deli recently won \"Best Hoagie in Pittsburgh\" from some news channel (congratulations to them!), and in doing so they beat out what I consider to be the best sandwich on the planet (second-place winner The Real McCoy Original from the south side). Obviously, the 40 minute trek needed to occur so that I could see what creation might de-throne the greatest sandwich ever made.  This place is truly a hidden gem - I drove right by it, fully knowing where it was and what it looked like from Google-mapping beforehand - and once I found it there wasn't a whole lot to it. The man working the place seemed to be the owner - real nice guy, you could tell he is really passionate about his store and his food. I went for a whole Italian hoagie, which was one of the winning sandwiches, and a pound of the rotini pasta salad.  The hoagie was quite delicious. The meat was fresh and fully loaded, the onions and tomatoes were crisp and juicy, the mayo was slathered on in the correct amount. The part that really made this hoagie stand out was the bread and cheese. I'm not sure what process he used to toast the sandwich, but by golly was that one perfectly toasted delight! Even after the 40 minute drive back to Pittsburgh, the bread was crisp, not soggy in any area, and had a perfect texture and flavor. The cheese was what really made this sandwich different - the edges were caramelized, chewy, and so flavorful that for a moment I thought I'd died and gone to the cheese castle in Wisconsin. That cheese made the sandwich the satisfying nourishment it is.   I would venture as far to proclaim this hoagie \"The Hoagie with the Best Toasting and Cheese in Pittsburgh\" but the actual best hoagie still belongs to the folks at Real McCoy Sandwich Shop. Having eaten both sandwiches roughly 40 minutes past their birth, the Real McCoy has so much flavor that it beats out any competing sandwich I've ever enjoyed. However, if there is ever a \"Best Pasta Salad in Pittsburgh\" competition, Bethel Deli might be the hands down champion - the mixture of noodles, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, carrots, tomatoes, and oil that the gentlemen proclaimed to have made himself was phenomenal and certainly tasted homemade - if the place wasn't 40 minutes away I would drive back, pick up enough of the pasta salad to eat with lunch for the rest of the week, and rub it in all of my coworkers faces that they aren't awesome enough have found it themselves. Yes, having a pasta salad that good does bring out the worst in men."}
{"text":"The hoagies are absolutely perfect. If you want a great hoagie this is the place. Just one complaint: the owner can be a little insufferable at times. Some requests are met with displeasure. Asking for extra mayo, for instance, got me scowled at. On one occasion while I was eating there another customer grabbing sandwiches for his children asked for the hoagies to be quartered. The owner (with a bit of attitude) refused to do it!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area and needed several sub's for an event. I googled \"Best sub sandwiches Pittsburgh \".  Bethyl Deli was listed as number 1. I ordered the sub's and they were delicious.  They have truly earned the top rating!"}
{"text":"I didn't find them any better than Danny's or even Subway, just more expensive.  I guess if you're really into subs, you should check it out since a lot of other folks seem to like it. Just not worth the money to me."}
{"text":"REAL Italian hoagie and the hot pepper salad are my go to when I'm out in the area. Awesome place to eat"}
{"text":"Finally tried it out after reading all these amazing reviews... I mean its OK for a little sub shop.. I was expecting this place to live up to its reputation. Got the Italian, it was fine... I didnt expect a hot sub.. I want to go back and try another one.. Good bread, good mayo, flimsy lettuce( lettuce is real important to me). Pricing was fair, i will be going back again.. See how the cold variety is..."}
