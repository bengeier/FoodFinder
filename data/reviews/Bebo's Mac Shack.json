{"text":"I seen Bebo's around been didn't have a chance to try until now.. Took the cousins to the Amaize Maze Farm for them to do the corn maze. But realized some didn't eat.. so for the kids, we opted for the good ole classic Mac and cheese. Very creamy and definitely a hit. Then the adult had the Mac and cheese with steak and bacon.. creamy and overly savory. I didn't care for the bbq sauce. Taste like one of the sauce I have in my frig with a tint of A1 Steak sauce added to it.  All in all. Bebo's is a good comfort food. The type of food where you eat, have a beer, sit in front of a campfire and chill. Not the food you eat and run around in the corn maze. The kids all gased out pretty quick!"}
{"text":"The straight Mac n cheese is way too dry and plain for my expectation of gourmet Mac n cheese. Otherwise great service for a food truck!"}
{"text":"I think my expectations were a little too high for this spot. But, I mean, if you tell me gourmet mac and cheese, my mouth is going to start watering... We ordered 'The Best Seller' with pork and bacon and the 'Smoked Chicken' with, well, smoked chicken and gouda. Both were pretty one note -- lots of bland meat piled on top of lukewarm elbow noodles, doused with overly sweet BBQ sauce and swimming in watery cheese sauce. To add insult to injury, it took about 15-minutes to prepare that.   Did it cure my Sunday morning hangover? Sure! Would I seek them out or even order from them again? Probably not."}
