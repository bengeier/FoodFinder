{"text":"Midtown is a small dive bar in Millville I stop there to meet a friend and it happened to be $.50 taco night very good you can have soft or hard tacos and beer prices are reasonable I enjoyed it so much I went back for wing night 50 Cent wings they were cooked perfectly garlic Parm is my favorite"}
{"text":"I've been to Midtown Tavern about 7 or 8 times now, primarily for their taco or wing specials on Monday/Tuesday, but I've also stopped in on the weekend. The food is really good (for bar food IMO), I've ordered a handful of different things here, and I have yet to be disappointed. I really like the layout and the look of the bar (very open, lots of wood), the bartenders have always been friendly and chatty, and their jukebox has a fairly updated selection.   Now, that being said, I have never seen more than 10 people in this bar at any given time, even on a Saturday night. This absolutely has to do with the crowd that frequents this bar. To be fair, I have nothing against the neighborhood at all. I spend a lot of time in Millvale and have many friends that live there, but I have yet to feel 100% comfortable at Midtown. There always seems to be someone in there that glares at you like you don't belong around here or a wasted/ opinionated local without a verbal filter.  Definitely check this place out, but bring a friend and watch your back. If this bar was in another location, no doubt it'd be packed every night."}
