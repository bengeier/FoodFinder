{"text":"Crust is good and tastes fresh.  I like the sauce.  However, ordered Italian calzone, the only meat in it was ham."}
{"text":"My family has eaten here a few times.  We usually get takeout or ask them to deliver. Really good pizza!"}
{"text":"This is the second time ordering from this pizza place and absoutely love their food! Friendly people answering the phones, relatively accurate delivery times, and the pizza is great. You can tell the dough is fresh and made in house. They are very consistent with cooking times because the cheese on the crust is always golden brown which gives it that extra crunch. Overall great pizza and awesome customer experience. Oopa!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Philly cheese steak wedgies, one was good.. oddly the other tasted like some sort of cleaning supply. Called and talked to the manager who laughed about it, then said he'd send another so we changed it to italian. It came very half-assed complete with unmelted cheese and soggy veggies. Yum."}
{"text":"Really good little pizza shop. My mom just moved into the South Park area and after unpacking boxes we decided to order in. We had never tried this place before but figured why not give it a try??? It was really yummy. The pizza has great sauce! Also they did not skimp on any toppings. The veggie hoagie was delicious, a great option for those who don't want to eat meat. The veggies on it were very fresh and plentiful. It had lots of mushrooms, green peppers, onions, spinach, etc. My mom also got a buffalo chicken salad that she enjoyed. Delivery was prompt and polite. Will definitely be ordering again now that she's in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very greasy! Bland sauce. Will not be ordering here again. Pepperoni is very greasy. Not good pizza at all."}
{"text":"Great pizza place in Library, PA.  My daughter loves this pizza place and although we live in Oregon I said we're ordering pizza and she says \"Ya Ya's Pizza?\".  We always get pizza here when we visit."}

{"text":"I've coming here for 3 years now .. officially my new favorite pizza place. Simply amazing and great customer service! 5 stars for this place yum!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is superb. It is consistently good time after time and the prices are reasonable.  Ingredients are piled on and fresh. You can't go wrong with the pizza. It's so good I have yet to try other menu items. Great pizza, great prices and above all else great folks who care about quality"}
{"text":"Always go here when I am in town. The pizza crust is awesome. The sauce is a little on the sweet side, but I don't mind."}
