{"text":"Our first time at Buster's Fish House and we'll definitely come back! Great menu (needs more veggie options), fresh and very tasty mains, fast and very attentive service, family-friendly.. Next time will order more wine :)"}
{"text":"This may be a fish house, but it served up the best bbq wings I have ever eaten in a lifetime of chicken wing eating. The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the casual atmosphere a pleasure.  Stop in...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great family run business, the cod sandwich is great! Portions are huge, presentation is cute! The coleslaw is simple, with a bit of color! The bun was dark, and flavorful :) Definitely our place for fish, and chips!"}
{"text":"Delicious quality food for a fair price.
The restaurant is new and clean.
The staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Ordered the tiger shrimp with salad, coconut shrimp and chicken wings and they were all amazing. Customer service top notch. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone and I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"This place was great!! 
The fish was fresh, tasted great and was well priced. 

Also, the interior is really nice for a sit down casual dinner as well.
I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We just moved in around the corner and my five stars reflects my experience ordering for pick-up - we haven't sat down for a meal here yet. Especially on a busy day, a fish sandwich, coleslaw and fries (or sweet potato fries) really hits the spot. Chicken fingers for non-fish lovers ensure we can always order from here. For a healthier option, I like the grilled calamari. Happy to have this place at the end of the street! Good food for a fair price."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I H-A-T-E fish. So going to Buster's was not on my to do list. But WOW am I surprised - this place is so much more than just fish - On a date with a fish lover, I ordered sweet potato fries to tide me over, and was talked into trying the ribs special by the very friendly and attentive bartender - OK I thought, No need to be hungry, give it a try. Then she told me they make home made bbq sauce (!!!) and slowly cook the ribs in house - ummm hellllllo, I can get behind that. Separate friers for fries & fish. Craft brews a plenty (six!). Trendy interior and awesome staff. 

Every stereotype about a fish place was BUSTERED tonight - I have a new entry into the handful of amazing restaurants that we frequent in Alderwood/LongBranch, and I'm now excited to go to a fish house weekly. Weird for a fish hater, but the GF is happy now. 

Thanks for the great service, I'll be enjoying the home made burgers & chicken tender while the girl gets her fish fix on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The food tasted fresh, and it was all well cooked. The fries were excellent and nothing was greasy. I don't typically like grilled fish, but the piece of trout I had tasted great and my partner described it as \"bomb\". The waitress was friendly & had great timing."}
{"text":"This little place really packs a lot of fresh flavors! We called ahead to see if they were busy, they said  that they weren't, but when we showed up it was busy. We were able to get a table because the nice waitress asked people who were done eating to leave. We ordered:
Coconut shrimp-crisp fresh shrimp with refreshing coconut flavor. 
Poutine-my first time to eat this so I have nothing to compare it to but it was pretty good. 
Calamari-my favorite! Perfect in texture and flavor...drizzled in yummy sauce.  I should have asked for more sauce on the side because I really liked it. 
Burger and grilled cheese-my boys cleared their plate! 
Rack of ribs-my husband says...pretty darn good.
Friendly service and fresh food!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight - and this place is AMAZING!!!  Super friendly and attentive service, cute and cozy decor, and the food is just perfect!!  We ordered the haddock and cod fish and chips - and they were deep fried to perfection!  Light, crisp and juicy!  Fries and onion rings were delish as well, and a decent selection of craft beers on tap!  And best of all - super large portions at great prices!!  

Will definitely come back.!!  

Apparently they will be expanding their menus in the coming weeks - but fan favourites like the fish and chips will still be there (whew!!). Can't wait to see what else they will serve!!"}
{"text":"3 stars. Had high expectations for this place but it fell short. 

We ordered the sea smelts, lobster bisque, Atlantic salmon and grilled trout. The sea smelts were really good, everything else was terrible. For starters (no pun intended haha), the lobster bisque was something that tasted straight out of the can. Both fish dishes were of terrible quality. If you're going to come here, I suggest maybe trying out the fried seafood entrees. The grilled fish is just not worth coming down here for.

Good location though! And the server was really sweet."}
{"text":"I have never written a review with more disparity than this one.

Food: 5/5
Service: 1/5

I'll start off by saying I most definitely will be back. The fish was probably the best I have ever had. It was a nicely sized, thick piece of halibut, perfectly cooked with a crispy, non-doughy batter coating that was exquisitely seasoned. The fries were nicely cooked and the tartar seemed homemade with a great taste! (I don't normally even like tartar).

I am very hopeful that my next visit will have us served by someone other than the waitress we had though (or that she's in a better mood next time). The only words that she said to us the entire time we were there were \"do you want anything else\" prior to me asking for the bill. I said \"thank you\" every time she brought an item to the table and when she brought the bill. She said nothing in reply. My 3 year old daughter said \"hi\" to her, again without a reply. My kid even said \"That lady no talking to me\"!

Anyways, I'm VERY hopeful that I will have a more pleasant visit next time because the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"One would not expect a gem like this in this area. The food was good. I had the seafood chowder which was a good surprise and tasty. My main dish was served with a smiling face. If you're in the area this is probably one of the better places to go to. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ordered the halibut and chips came with coleslaw and homemade tartar sauce (delicious) also gravy was very tasty only 12$ for halibut and chips!! Great portion size . Waitress was very friendly and efficient will definitely be coming back and spreading the word!"}
{"text":"Meh...I was less than impressed with my meal today. My halibut was dry and the corner of it slightly tough (freezer burn perhaps?).  When I was paying the bill, I was asked how the meal was, I said the halibut was dry. The response was that \" halibut is a dry fish\" to which I replied that there were other places down the street where the halibut was not dry. (They lost a star for the way they dealt with my honest response to their question.) As well, the restaurant was cold inside, so we had to keep our winter coats on. On the positive side, their sweet potato fries were good & I like the 2 sauces which accompanied the food. The fish and chips weren't greasy & if the halibut had been better, the meal would have been better. I live nearby and I won't be returning because of the fish."}
{"text":"A true gem.!!! Cute small , modern clean place. Nice bar. Glad we found this place. We had the oysters, calamari , fish and chips and a burger. The food was excellent . Great friendly service . Our thanks to the chef , we'll be back !!! Everything including the oysters were reasonable .  We were sick of Joeys , the Keg and big box restaurants. If you love oysters , calamari or looking for a great place to have fish and chips with the option of a great burger, this is the place.  They had a rib special and grilled fish too.  A great find!"}
{"text":"Found due to being stuck in traffic and searched yelp for a reco. Reviews are on point, what a find! Kids gobbled up everything and said 'this is the best place ever!' Fish and chips, ribs, wings, chicken club sandwich and Philly cheesesteak sandwich....all yum!
Only complaint is the icky washrooms...yergg!"}
{"text":"Very Good food, and nice clean place .. halibut was spot on .. glacier bay oysters were very fresh .. fried calamari and tiger prawns were perfect .. soup of the day was halibut and clam chowder was good, but could have been better. Creme brulee at the end was superb. And when they got to know that we observe halal, they told us that their chicken is halal too. Further, the chef also mentioned that they have separate grills to do grilled seafood exclusively .. by the way their home made tarter sauce shouldn't be missed. A star less for the soup and the quantity of calamari."}
{"text":"Came in for valentines day today and the food here is amazing! Located in long branch right on the lakeshore. Very easy to find and directly across from the no frills on lakeshore. 

When we came in they were not busy at all for vday. We were glad thats the case since everywhere else on the lakeshore seems packed. I guess lovers dont like seafood?! Haha anyways.. on tuesdays they have half price apps with the purchase of a drink. We opted for the deep fried calamari and the shrimp ceviche.

The calamari batter here resembles popeyes chicken batter and it is soooo delicious!!!! Not overly batter either but crisp to perfection. The calamari also taste very real compared to other places that have a chewy texture to it. The shrimp ceviche is made as ordered and they soak their ceviche in lime juice for like 20minutes to get the citrus taste to it prior to serving.. it was delicious and a good size to share between two.

For mains we opted for their halibut fish and chips subing a poutine in instead of fries and also got the grilled calamari with greek salad. Both were great in portion size and tasted so fresh and tasty! The halibut was not battered thick and had a good amount of fish meat as well! The grilled calamari is charred to perfection. Its buttery and also has a great zest flavour to it as well. The fish was also served with tartar sauce and the calamari came with taizakai sauce! Sides were also really good and great in portion size.

I cannot wait to come back here and try other stuff on their menu.

Minus one star because the service was slow.. especially since there was only 3 tables in there. But the food really trumps the service here!"}
{"text":"I got take out here twice and it was excellent. I got two grilled items. Calamari (half fries and half salad on the side) and then the salmon. I loved the Calamari and the Salmon was good too.

The owner's GF is really sweet. She takes peoples orders. 

I definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Charming low key spot that serves up tasty food and excellent service.  We have dined here several times and not been disappointed.  On our last visit we had the calamari, fish & chips and trout.  The trout was seared perfectly crispy edges and a soft moist fillet. I tried the greek fries as a side..they were interesting and worth a try.  The calamari was fresh and the batter nice and crispy a bit less salt in the batter would make them 10/10. Also, I would ask for the sauce on the side.  Presentation was pretty though.  Fish and chip portion was generous and the fish was flaky and flavorful.  Our meals with two glasses of wine each was reasonably priced.  Service was excellent we were well looked after."}
{"text":"Fish & chips and white wine, that's my idea of comfort food. 
Busters' Fish & Chips is very flavourful, the portion is enormous, so make sure to wear pants with a string/elastic waistband.
Service is always personable and fast, we love bringing the kids here, everyone is always well taken care of."}
{"text":"First time going and last time. Their menu consists of burgers ,fish and chips and salads and they had none of the above \"SHUT IT DOWN!\" Chef Ramsey would say. 

After spending close to an hour waiting for coffee, water and our food. Which we ordered only two vegan bowls and one burger. The waitress informed us that they had no vegan bowls , fish and chips and no burgers left. They had nothing left to serve. 

You would think since we spent almost an hour there and did not receive coffee and water only one beer and one pop. That the bill would be complementary. But it was not. After telling us the news she handed over the bill. I was in shock. We only paid for the beer and we left. 

I was looking forward to eating here. And now I will say I will not be returning. I have never been more disappointed with a restaurant experience in my life."}
{"text":"Tried it on a whim and was pleasantly surprised- great service, interesting menu items and a killer Caesar with onion rings to top!! Great for brunch or a lazy Saturday lunch in!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! What a hidden gem!!!! New spot to try out everything!! Spicey ceasar is bomb."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic fish joint!  The tilapia and sardines were delicious. So much food. So tasty!  Also, since we ordered for a second day in a row - tried the home made burger as well and it was incredible. Service was superb!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were there today for lunch had the halibut fish and chips very large portions great fries and a nice sized portion of fish reasonably priced and excellent service. We're definitely going back and recommend this place to anyone. Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"This local place is very quaint + lovely, however (sadly) the food wasn't very good. Our server was more than excellent and gave us suggestions, however that doesnt make up for sub-par food.  

My friend ordered haddock + chips, and his fish had way too much batter.  I had clam chowder, which tasted like it came from a can, and I also had halibut + coleslaw.  I like traditional coleslaw, either creamy or oil & vinegar based, so i wasn't a fan of green onions grated in the coleslaw.  My fish was so greasy, it took pressing on 3 napkins to rid some of the fryer oil from my fish. I've tasted my fair share of fish + chips, and I was so disappointed in Buster's as I really wanted to like it here!  *sigh*   Still in my quest to find the best fish 'n' chips in Toronto!

Food = 2 stars
Service = 4 stars"}
{"text":"I had the halibut and chips dinner. Good value for $12, it comes with delicious colourful coleslaw and tartar sauce. The fish itself was honestly maybe the best fried halibut I've ever had! Unfortunately the fries were not so great, they weren't quite crisp enough. I thought the dining space itself was awesome, spacious, relaxed. Service was very friendly and very attentive. I would definitely go back! And it's open on Sundays, which is great since many fish and chips places are not. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had dinner for the first time and busters tonight and it was fantastic! The food was 5/5 and the service was 5/5!!
My wife ordered for tacos and I had the halibut fish and chips. The fish was a greasy at all and perfectly cooked as well as great portion size.
We're both looking forward to going back to try something else on our next visit."}
{"text":"One of my favorite among the casual dining scene. I have been there many times.

Things I have tried:
Grilled Calamari - fantastic - soo tender!!
Steak: Great
Caesar Salad: Great
Fries: Great
Soup (Seafood chowder): Good
Oysters: Great

You can pretty much try anything you want in this place - everything they do tastes & looks great."}
{"text":"My favourite place to go on Saturday night! Half price Cesars and great fish and chips. I'm partial to the halibut. Will be back!"}
{"text":"If there was a way I could give it more stars than five, I would, because other five star restaurants couldn't possibly compare. 
A true gem in the Long Branch neighbourhood, Busters does an amazing burger, calamari, barbeque ribs, fried chicken sandwich, and of course, world-class fish and chips.  Just about everything is made from scratch and there's an obsessive level of commitment to quality that lands way above expectations. They have daily specials, all of which are fantastic, and the prices are super-reasonable!  
The new desserts are incredible as well and should not be missed!
We went for dinner this evening, and a neighbouring table asked what we were having because they were having trouble deciding, and no fewer than three nearby tables all resoundingly replied that EVERYTHING was amazing! You don't get that kind of love by just being OK - Busters knocks it right out of the park!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times: service was great, variety is good, and the food is amazing! The Buster's Platter is a must- an easy choice since all of the appetizers are so good- the platter includes most of them!

I always get either the grilled fish (salmon or tilapia) or the grilled shrimp. It comes on a mountain of fries (or salad, if you're looking for a healthier option) and coleslaw on the side.

I highly recommend Buster's!"}
{"text":"I have probably ordered everything on the menu here. I like ribs, burgers and fish and chips. Appetizer calamari or crab cakes. Have been back here several times. And have recommended to friends and family. I will continue to go, however I have noted a salty over seasoning in their batter. This is the only thing that is stopping me from giving a FIVE star rating. Atmosphere is relaxed and it is an easy place to feel comfortable in.

Check it out."}
{"text":"Wow, I loved this place.
A friend of mine is a connoisseur of great food and kept RAVING about this place and how amazing it was.
They even went so far as to include a monetary value for this place for a christmas present.

Onto the restaurant.
Doesn't look like much from the outside, but when you come in, it's such a cute little restaurant. Nice decor, warm and welcoming.
Plenty of seating, cute menus, and the drinks presented in mason jars was very unique and trendy.
Both my husband and I ordered the Halibut with chips and we had the fried shrimp as an appetizer.
The food was DELICIOUS... omg so savory and fresh.
The sweet/spicy sauce for dipping was incredible.
The portions are huge, and I could not finish my plate.
I'm going to have to say this is probably the best fish and chips i've had in a long time.
A+++"}
{"text":"Food was good, small pieces of fish but it was cooked well and plated nicely. Restaurant is very nice, was not very busy. Service was kinda slow. Food came out quickly but it took a while to get menus and to receive the bill."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Atlantic salmon on Caesar salad.
Take out was quick and easy.
Unfortunately at almost 16 Bucks with tax, I might only return a couple of times a year.  Expensive."}
{"text":"Super casual cool place to grab fish and chips, great for couples and families. 
The calamari was super crunchy but as mentioned on other Yelp reviews, a bit salty. 
Caesar salad was excellent. Fried haddock also excellent, crunchy on the outside and flaky on the inside. Grilled calamari was okay, feel like it was a bit undercooked as there were some super soft bits. Overall would come back but just stick to the fried fish."}
{"text":"Food is great! Love try fresh cut curly fries and coleslaw that come along with the Halibut fish I typically order. Staff are also warm and welcoming. A nice quaint spot to sit down and have comfort food."}
{"text":"Went here the other night for the first time. Really comfortable atmosphere and you can eat there rather than your car and house getting fishy!I had clams and my friend had the halibut. Very reasonably priced and you can have a pint with your food. Everything perfectly cooked and no sogginess. Great food and service. Their chips were much better than New Toronto F & S (which I also like)"}
{"text":"Been here over a dozen times and every time is delicious. I love that you can get a variety of fish grilled and can sub in salads. Lots of healthy options! On the other side the Mac daddy burger is ah-ma-zing. One of my absolute favourite local places."}
{"text":"Super fresh fish. Great variety. I've never been disappointed and I've gone a few times. Grilled salmon is amazing as is the sardines. Fries are to die for. 

AND they'll split your order so you get 1/2 salad and 1/2 fries and enough to take home for another meal. Good sized portions and really friendly staff. 

It's the best local neighbourhood fish & chip place! Good wine at a great price. It does not break the bank to eat quality food here!"}
{"text":"TOP NOTCH. TWO THUMBS UP.  The other reviewers have said it all! This place is a true hidden gem along the shore of Etobicoke. 

But please be advised.. If you're looking through the photos trying to get a better idea of the food like I was before visiting, you should know a lot of these photos are old. The outside of the restaurant looks different and they've updated their menu as well. Ive posted a photo of the new menu.

The cook puts so much love and effort into the food, you can taste it. The prices are great!! They have a full bar, as well as daily specials on both food and drinks. 

It doesn't look like much on the inside but don't judge it by the outside because what's inside is soooo good."}
{"text":"We were in this area on Sunday and decided to give this place a try. Fairly easy to locate, we were surprised to discover that we had the place to ourselves (to be fair, when we arrived, another couple were on their way out, but the whole time we were there, the only other person who came in was a staff member for a shift change).
Anyways, first impressions were good....barn wood bar, warm earth tone colour on the wall, comfortable inviting chairs....
Our waitress was at our table within a minute of being seated, with menus in hand. She took our drink order and off she went. I opted for a Diet Coke, my dining companion opted for coffee (Mexican our waitress advised us). The presentation of the coffee was fantastic...the full mug came on its own tray with a small porcelain container concealing cubed sugar, and also had a small container of cream. Who does that type of presentation anymore? My Diet Coke was served in a mason jar.
We both opted for Halibut and chips.
Our food arrived about 10 minutes later...a fairly large piece of halibut, generous amount of fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce.
The halibut was cooked perfectly. Only small complaint was that I found the batter to be a bit salty, while my dining companion said he couldn't taste any at all. Fries were a bit overcooked, but I somehow managed to eat them all. Coleslaw was standard fare.
Female staff member who replaced our waitress (who left mid shift) was as equally friendly and efficient.
Would I go back? If in the area...most definitely....its just that it's a good 30-40 minute drive from where I live. Damn.
Lunch as described above, with coffee and Diet Coke, tax and tip in, came to $35. Reasonably priced for Halibut."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, I would come back. We ordered the jumbo tiger shrimps and it was delicious. Their fish and chips was nothing special but their sweet potato fries was a little bit over cooked. I would recommend choosing a side of house salad instead."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I had oyster app and cod fish and chips. The fish was fresh and hot and perfect batter. Chips fresh and delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've driven by Busters many times and many times have said to the wife that we gotta try that place. It wasn't until she recently got back from a trip from California and told me all about the great seafood she ate that my seafood cravings kicked into overdrive. I scrambled to Yelp to find somewhere to fulfil these desires and sure enough Busters popped up at the top of the list. With 50 plus fantastic reviews it was a no brainer.

We arrived on a Tuesday night and saw a sign on the door that they had buck a shuck oysters and live music on Thursdays. I immediate thought I hope this place is great so we have a reason to come back, they did not disappoint.

We ordered fish tacos, grilled calamari and the coconut shrimp. We wanted to try the crab cakes but they had unfortunately run out already.

Prices were more than fair with apps under $10 and mains around $14 or so and portion sizes did not hold back either. 

For the food....

Tacos: Fantastic. Lots of great flavour, huge pieces of fish and good textures.

Calamari: Tasted really fresh. Came with a Caesar salad for the entree which was very delicious.

Shrimp: The chef added an extra since my wife and I were splitting. They kinda reminded me of the frozen coconut shrimp, but hell I'm a sucker for those at parties so loved them also.

Service was very attentive and they had a nice selection of craft beers.

My only complaint is they should do something with the decor more. It looks a little plain which I think takes away from how delicious the food was but not really a big deal and who really cares at the end of the day if food and service are good."}
{"text":"Loved their caesars topped with onion rings, bacon, and a pickle spear!!! I'd go back just for the caesars alone but the food was also really good."}
{"text":"We have been with our 2 year old a couple of times now.  Great seafood with nice portions, good quality and great service.  Beer choice is excellent also (Beaus and Mill St).   One of my favourite spots in Long Branch!"}
{"text":"Really good spot for some solid fish & chips! Friendly staff and nice beer selection."}
{"text":"Solid shop for fish and chips.  Unassuming from the outside this place has a lot if great charm inside.  Local beers on tap, nice tv, and all around clean.

We ordered 2 haddock combos to go and they were ready in minutes.  Typically with fish and chips you need to have it right out of the dryer but after a 10 mins walk home they still tastes great!  Great fries and decent portions.

We'll be back again."}
{"text":"I was at Fairgrounds, STARVING, and found this place on Yelp.  It was bookmarked and guess what?  I really liked it!  

Due to the area, I was expecting a rundown fish 'n chip shoppe, but it appeared to be a recently reno'd joint, dimly lit (actually looked closed if you were just to walk by), with a full-on bar area, nice light fixtures, and enough tables to have a proper, nice sitdown meal.

Menu consisted of more than just fish 'n chips, but also a grilled fish section (accompanied with 2 sides), sandwiches (there was a burger, chicken strips, & also shrimp options), plus various beers, not to mention goodies and coffee from Fairgrounds.

Since I *love* meaty fish, I ordered the Halibut fish 'n chips ($12) that came with a side of coleslaw.  Fries are handcut, tartar sauce isn't from a bottle, and the coleslaw is also not store bought.  All very good signs!  And surprisingly, even though both fish + chips were deep fried, I never left with that UH heavy feeling in my stomach.  Fries were soo good!!!

I had a bit of the grilled Tilapia that came with a bed of salad of your choice - I believe there were 3 choices.  The salad looked very fresh and the I liked the seasoning for the fish which was nice and tender.  Not dry or overcooked.

The initial waitress was meh (not the friendliest), but the waitress that came in later was much friendlier.  I asked her how long the place has been open and she said 5 YEARS!!!

There was a couple who just finished up dining in on a Saturday night, another lone gent came to dine-in, and there was 1 takeout.  Otherwise, the place was dead which was a shame.  :S  Area isn't that conducive to diners.  Very quiet."}
{"text":"This is the best place for grilled fish. Service is amazing. Had to leave a review because it's that good."}
{"text":"Have been here about half a dozen times and the food is great. The coconut shrimp appetizer is delicious and comes with a tasty dipping sauce. The halibut fish and chips is fresh and not greasy.  I've also ordered the grilled salmon with the Caesar salad and it was very good. 

The wait staff is very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is casual. 

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My favourite spot in long branch.   Wow what a burger, perfect sear and crunch on the flat top and awesome awesome bun!    It's a lot of meat, you could do with a single patty as opposed to the double but so good and great friendly service.


I agree with another post; batter on the onion rings was salty and the reason this spot is not a 5 stars.

Enjoy!


Update: Sweet potato fries is definitely the way to go.    Fried chicken sandwich was big and crunchy and messy and overall extremely solid"}
{"text":"You gotta try the fish and chips at this place.    Nice sized portions   and great eats"}
{"text":"I was there on Friday with my bf we got the platter since people were saying it was a good choice. It was good, it was small just enough for two people. Could of had at least one more piece of everything since there was two of us and three pieces of most things in there. Next I ordered the salmon with chips and my bf ordered the trout but tasty but We both got a tiny piece a fish and huge plate of chips...not what we were expecting with all these great reviews below. My bf is a big eater and he was not satisfied. The girls working there are cute and really nice. She offered red velvet dessert I couldn't say no but then I wish I had... It tasted like jo Louis but red.... Disappointed we probably won't come back unless it's for their special ribs on Friday a guy was eating them by the bar and it was a huge plate ...lucky"}
{"text":"Raspberry point oysters were very sweet.  I will have to be back Thursday night for buck a shuck. 

Unfortunately, they had pieces of shell throughout.  And I got none to replace them.  I definitely wasn't happy with that at $14 for 6!

The halibut was great, and a very large portion.  I had it with the Greek fries, covered by feta, tatziki, onions, cucumber and tomatoes.... Extremely yummy."}
{"text":"That was AMAZING!!!  I live around the corner and never went in as I thought it was just a Halibut and Fries kind of place.  Wow was I wrong.  We had everything but that and loved every morsel.  My husband was blown away and said he hadn't had that good a meal ever.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips! Not super greasy! Place is nice and clean not sticky and good drink specials."}
{"text":"I've returned to Buster's a few times since my first visit back in March - specially for the $1 oysters on Thursdays - they always nail it! Great service and excellent food. 
I highly recommend the mussels, fried shrimp, grilled calamari, and the cod fish and chips. 
They always have local beer on tap and I hear there's live music on Thursdays now, I will definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place, we drive all the way from scarborough. The staff are friendly and accommodating. The food is amazing. 
Went today and had the grilled calamari over Greek salad, perfect for a hot day. They carry a good variety of craft beers. Great place for good quality casual dinning"}
{"text":"trying to find a \"decent\" fish and chips place in my neighbourhood...so we used yelp to our advantage. 
i agree with some other yelp'ers that this place looks like nothing on the outside, but on the inside is fantastic, lots of seating and options available on the menu. 
we ordered our food to go, which was made in less then ten minutes. 
the flavors are amazing, the quality is definatly in the food, from how fresh to the wonderful blend of seasonings on the food. 
fish was spot on
fries were good(bigger portion!) 
coleslaw was amazing (i hate veggies!) 
the poutine was good, for a chip place
my only, only, ONLY gripe is i wish the poritions were just a bit bigger, so far as the amount of fries and such. 
other then that, i think we may have found our \"local joint\" 
and as a bit of a *bonus* points...they have cherry coke to drink!"}
