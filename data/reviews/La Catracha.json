{"text":"If you want authentic Honduran food, this is the place. I have tried the fried chicken with Pupusas-delicious. I have tried the Carne Asada with rice and refried beans-delicious. And the Baleadas are the best!!! The service is great and you can tell the owner puts pride in his cooking. I will be back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Fast. Cheap. You can have it all! Do bring some Espa√±ol or you'll have a tough time. But everyone was super nice. Felt like I was back in Queens. 

Love it!

Carne Asada con platanos maduros."}
{"text":"As a first timer Honduran cuisine eater, I thought food was good. If I've to categorize this cuisine then it would be more like Puerto Rican or Caribbean food because they do lots of fried stuffs, plantains, beans etc. loved their fried fish along with spicy sauce."}
{"text":"I was looking for something quick, cheap, and not BBQ and decided to check this place out. These types of places are my favorites; hole in the wall, don't speak very much English, authentic cooking unchanged for American taste.
I'm used to good Latin/Hispanic food and this place is on par. It's not Mexican, first clue is they have pupusas. And the pupusas are good!
Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Totally addictive. 
This is one of my favorite restaurants no one seems to know about. 
I've seen it incorrectly listed as a Mexican spot in a few places. 
It's actually Honduran.   

Great baleadas and awesome plantains.
Some of the best beans in town + real handmade tortillas. 
How many places can say that?

I crave it several times a month."}
