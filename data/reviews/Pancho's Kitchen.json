{"text":"This is my first time here and I'll start by saying that I saw the reviews so I already expected it to be great. I am vegan. I came here for my birthday with my cousin who isn't vegan. We both really enjoyed ourself. I got the loaded nachos. He got a chicken quesadilla. We ordered guacamole as a starter. It was really good, I just wish there was more avocado. The flavor was delicious though. My nachos were really good. I liked the veggie mix. We also ordered dessert. I got the dessert nachos and my cousin got the churros. We both got ice cream with them. The chocolate ice cream is a must! All of this for only $48! Great buy, good atmosphere. We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Two words: CHICHARRON EMPANADAS  Your'e welcome. I would drive here again (it is really out of my way) just for those. And they weren't even on the menu. The nice woman in the kitchen overheard what I wanted to order and she totally made them as a special order!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just finished our first meal here.  After recently deciding to move towards a plant based diet, we are always on the lookout for a restaurant with good vegetarian/vegan options.  We were in the neighborhood and found it on Yelp.  And it DID NOT disappoint!  They have a good size meat based menu, and another separate vegan menu. I had the taco plate, with an avocado and one a mushroom one.  My husband had the burrito with potatoes.  Both were delectable.  Honestly, one of the best Mexican meals we have ever had (and we eat Mexican so much it's kinda embarrassing).  We will be making the trek from Mountains Edge here again!  Do not hesitate to eat here!  Meat or vegetable based diets will be happy with their menus.  So good!"}
{"text":"Very informal and OK service but delicious meal.  Great vegan menu but also a great regular menu too... very \"down home\"... owners are the servers."}
{"text":"VEGANS  I've only been here once.. But one time was enough to convince me that when I'm craving vegan Mexican food, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO! I started out with the nachos and they were so good and filling that I had to see what else they had to offer. Well I figured I would try the breakfast burrito and the tamales as well. Let me tell you this.. THIS PLACE KNOWS HOW TO COOK SOME AMAZING FOOD! I still am shocked I ate that much food, but when it tastes that good, it is much easier to eat :)"}
{"text":"Vegan menu is AWESOME! We had the tacos- beer battered avocado and potato, and the loaded veggie asada fries. Delish! Great inviting atmosphere at the new location. Lilly is a wonderful hostess.  Cool hang out for game watching nights and a bucket of beer. (If you drink beer LOL)  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely delicious and had the best pozole I have had in my life! Extremely authentic with excellent customer service! I am so thankful we live close as we will be visiting this restaurant often!"}
{"text":"Great tasting & freshly made food, with the best ingredient...LOVE, just like mom & grandma use to use!!! You can really taste the difference in their food. They use freshly prepared ingredients, nothing fake or prepackaged. And best of all the juices are all freshly squeezed when ordered & the Orchata  is  the best I've had, freshly made too. You can see the love & passion she (the owner) puts into preparing your food. And she's very sweet & nice as is her staff. Being latino it truly feels like I'm visiting a relative & she's so excited to prepare a meal for me!  And that to me is priceless, luv this place!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best vegan tacos I've ever had! I got the beer battered avocado taco and the crispy potato! Sooooo good! Great service too!"}
{"text":"New location is great, decor is appealing and the inside is spotless. Owners are great people and great cooks! Food is authentic, great quality and always presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Vegan menu is a must try!"}
{"text":"They had been severing a Mexican rice to vegans that was never vegan. That is the reason they changed there rice to a white rice style( they used a meat broth instead of a vegetable one). Very upset with them, what else isn't vegan ? Being told something is vegan or is on the \"vegan\" menu that is not vegan is extremely wrong. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Had the Vegan taco combo with the BB Avocado & the Poblano/Zucchini tacos, outstanding!!! They were very sweet with great service. Bummer I live in Henderson!!! I'll be back though."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at Pancho's Kitchen this evening. Jocelyn, our waitress, provided great service and the tacos are tasty."}
{"text":"The potato tacos were so good! My friends and I are definitely coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Omg! Their food is soooooo good! Who knew authentic VEGAN mexican food could be so good! I had the Vegan Tomale and tried the corn and ploblano pepper taco... my boyfriend had the Vegan Nachos and the Vegan Tamale as well. Let me just say that if you get the tamale be prepared for a lot of really good food. We ordered a variety of things off their vegan menu because we had never been there and wanted to try it all. The vegetables were cooked perfectly and tasted incredible! We left there feeling so unbelievably full cause we couldn't stop eating! It was that good.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! If I could eat here everyday i definitely would! The best vegan tacos I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Are here once and it was okay. Picked up 4 burritos yesterday, service was slow. Flavor was not that good, and I think I bit into a piece of raw pork in my burrito. Grossed me out and I ended up throwing the rest away freling sick. Will never go back. Good luck eating here."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely beautiful but the food was very bland and expensive. I guess they have to pay for all the beautiful tile work. The salsa and chips were pretty good but the margarita was weak. Save yourself time and money and try another Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"A mexican taco shop with a vegan menu! We found our mexican food fix when we're in vegas. Very super friendly staff. Elena helped us out and explained the food items. Our first time experience was awesome. Definitely will be here when we visit my parents here every month! A must go for some great foods unique food as well."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican restaurant on the west side of town hands down everything is delicious, another must try are the Micheladas give it a try you won't regret it"}
{"text":"For my fellow vegans out there, they have a small vegan menu (for now) but what they have is sooo delicious! Definitely recommend eating here. They are very nice and make things fresh!"}
{"text":"Great spot. This is small, 6 tables, but not a hole in the wall. Clean. Bright. Quesadilla with carne asana for $9.75 was excellent. Will come again."}
{"text":"Great place to eat while in Vegas! Not to far from the Vegas stip. Food is authentic, salsa are great and most importantly the people there are attentive. Will be back"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in Las Vegas! Their vegan options are great! I love that they not only have a separate vegan menu but also that they don't use meat replacements! Their food is wonderfully flavored and the restaurant itself is adorably decorated! Absolutely love going here! First found them at the tivoli farmers market and fell in love with their avocado salsa and vegan nachos. I love kinda far from them but definitely make a trip at least once a month to get my horchata and nacho fix"}
{"text":"I Highly Recommend This Place.!! The Most Authentic I've Had In Vegas So Far Since Coming From Mexico. To The Owner,  Cooks & Staff : Don't Change A Thing. Its Awesome.  The Food Is Outstanding.  The Service Is Top Notch.  The Decor Is Simple & Beautiful.  I Cannot Wait To Try Everything Else On The Menu. Yes, It's That Good. 5 Stars All Around. I Am Telling All My Friends & Coworkers  To Go There. I Love It.  May Pancho's Kitchen Stay The Same Forever. !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried Mexican food all over Las Vegas and the northeast and Pancho's is the most incredible we have ever had. They have a delightful vegan menu and make their own tortillas and gordita batter. I would recommend this to anyone. This was probably the best food I've ever had in general. The owner was absolutely wonderful as well. Support them! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Most likely the worse Mexican food I've ate in for ever  The tacos were bland the vegan veggie fries were garbage with carrots,cauliflower,green beans,canned corn   Salsa was water with a slight hint of canned tomato sauce   Kids quesadilla was about the best thing on the menu    Don't waste the time or money"}
{"text":"It was just ok.... maybe it was what I ordered.  I had the beer battered avocado in a burrito (vegan).  I have decided avocado should not be be fried and it definitely shouldn't be stuffed in a burrito.  It was so disrespectful to beautiful avocado.  The whole thing was a mushy tasteless mess.    On a positive note, the guacamole was very good.  You just don't get enough for the price.    Overall, I'd go back and try another vegan filler."}
{"text":"Went there really happy and excited to try \"authentic Mexican food \" I order a menudo  , husband order carne asada nachos , corn on the cob , in laws chicken salad    Our service took at list 1hr to get out half of our order  Then the asada from the nachos was really chewy and cartilage fat everywhere - we didn't eat them and we didn't want to ask for something different because it will take for ever   My toddler was so excited about corn on the cob - guess what ??? I couldn't even bite into it because it was so hard and over cooked and try to cut in grains and it was just smooshed ( almost like mash potatoes consistency ) .   Time for my menudo -  don't know if meat was undercooked because it was a Saturday and usually places only serve menudo on Sunday's but menu said sat and Sunday's ? I know menudo es chewy already but this was like bitting into raw cow stomach literally , disgusting    We got out conplementary chips and salsa for like 7 people and that complimentary was like for 2 person (the portion was so small ) we asked for more since we were all paying separate  and said we had to pay for extra , we did  then the salads were just old lettuce  - the only good thing was the potatoe tacos .  I will definitely not come back and was really surprised by such good reviews , maybe was just the cook ?"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food place in Vegas. The restaurant is always clean and staff is friendly. They have a full vegan menu. Their potato tacos are the best in town that I have found."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out after finding it on yelp. We were really happy to find an authentic Mexican restaurant that offered a vegan menu. Yay! It's a small restaurant in a nice area. It's also family owned. Elena was very sweet and had great customer service.  Our food didn't take long at all but they gave us chips and salsa while we waited. We ordered a lot because everything looked so good lol. The beer battered avocado tacos, potato tacos, and mushroom tacos are all a must have! We also got the vegan enchiladas, nachos, and a tamale. I have never tried a vegan tamale before and it was so good! I honestly really liked everything we ordered. Everything had great flavor! Not too expensive either. Elena even told us they plan on expanding their vegan menu soon. We will definitely be back to try more items on the menu. We would recommend this restaurant to anyone! Can't wait to go back (:"}
{"text":"Most amazing food and nicest people working. If you are visiting or in Las Vegas this is a MUST. Best meal I ever had."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. I have had there vegan tacos , carne asada burrito, carne asada nachos ...not in one sitting hehe. There salsa is fresh and spicy . Everything is fresh. Certainly the owners take pride in preparing the food made to order. Everyone is super friendly . I work in the same shopping center and sometimes I cannot get away to get my lunch so they bring it to me :)"}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food.  However, after eating here, I'm a fan, at least of Pancho's Kitchen.  We don't get to eat out much because we are vegan and prefer organic food so when I saw Pancho's offered both, we decided to give them a try.  OH MY GOSH, THE BEST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD WE'VE EVER TASTED!! My daughter in particular is a bit picky and she LOVED the beer battered avocado vegan tacos, rice and beans. The owners are friendly and welcoming.  We're so excited to have found this place, we plan on having them cater for us.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo happy to see panchos kitchen back open! Their food is amazing. The food is truly authentic and I love that they offer such a beautiful menu of vegan food lol. Their potato tacos are my favorite. The staff is also so friendly. So happy for their new restaurant too, it's such a lovely set up."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely Amazing! !  The owner is making me freshly squeezed lemonade!! The employees are super nice, the place is always clean. They have Vegan food too!! The food is always on point, superb. Check them out!!"}
{"text":"10/10 would recommend! I recently found out I have celiac disease and it's tough finding a place to eat with many different options and still taste amazing! I saw they had so many 5 stars I though I'd give it a try, and they were right! Pancho's has a WHOLE separate menu for VEGAN only! How cool?? And all their corn tortillas are GLUTEN-FREE!! Not to mention the ladies up front we're really nice and patient! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone I know trying to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend live less than 5 minutes away from here and love it when we want to go. Plus it's probably the best tacos we've ever had. We learned that calling ahead is a lot easier because it takes 15-20 minutes for them to cook your order sometimes, which is fine with us since they make everything fresh! And you can definitely taste the freshness in all of their food, we've eaten here over 10 times now and it never disappoints. My boyfriend usually goes for the chicken tacos or the carne asada burrito and I usually go for the vegan tacos or vegan nachos. My fav tacos are the crispy avocado and potato taco. I also had their vegan tamale for the first time recently and all I can say is WOW. It's a must try (even my boyfriend loved it). I'm not a big fan of pinto beans (even though theirs are actually very good) so I sub them with the black beans and they are literally the best I've ever had! Also, the ladies behind the counter are so sweet every time we get our order and give the place such a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Passed by here the other day and said I need to yelp them and check out their reviews. After reading the review and seeing that they have potato tacos, yum!! One of my favorite homemade dishes that I never have time to make, I decided to try theirs out today.   Wow! Let me tell you...freaking bomb! Everything was so fresh and tastefully packed with amazing flavor.  I got mine to-go and the service was fast and friendly. It was clean and the decor was very nice. I will be returning very soon. I've been wanting to go vegan and with this not far away from home, I'll definitely be trying more items off their vegan menu.   Oh and the beans and rice were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Just missed breakfast! I so wanted a vegan breakfast from here. The options look great. But it's over at noon... and I just missed it. But I wanted to not that Pancho's respects the vegan lifestyle and has a partitioned or separate so no need to worry about cross contamination happening.   Back again for the Assad's fire for Veganuary is over. It's on the menu so it won't go away I don't think. But better safe than sorry!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, it's hard to find good restaurants in town and even harder to find Mexican restaurants that know whether their dishes are vegetarian or not (i.e., \"Are your refried beans made with beef or vegetable broth\"). Pancho's solves the problem by clearly identifying their regular and vegan menu options. The vegan menu is wide and varied.  The food is good and the service is okay (we had to regularly ask for drink refills), but the prices were too high so I probably won't go again. We received few chips with our meal, but they gladly refilled them when requested."}
{"text":"Love this place and I'm super happy for the owners, they deserve all the success!  Moons ago Pancho's kitchen had a little place on Durango with zero ambiance... Now they have it going on!   Smiling faces, EXCELLENT service and flavorful food.  And the best part?!?! No Daiya! Thats right NO DAIYA! (maybe Follow Your Heart?)  I never order sweet but I had to try the horchata (its vegan!) and its made with almond milk. It was good but too sweet for my taste.  The loaded nachos (vegan) are amaze...halfway through I realized I was eating all the veggies, like green beans and colorful carrots! Who said nachos can't have nutritional value ;)   The burrito (vegan) was packed with yumminess not even sure what because I could only sat one bite.  The potato tacos (vegan) were best best I have ever tasted. I wanted more but only ate a few bites because I eat oil free and didn't want to push my tummy.  I'll be back to study their beans and rice.....why are they soo good?!?! Why?!?! I have tried for years to slow cook my beans and theirs......are truly amazing.  A tried a tiny tasting of three items and I'm sold. I need to go back and try their breakfast and mushroom tacos!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today! Pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious and fresh and tasted authentic to me. (I have eaten in Mexico City, but I'm definitely no expert.) The restaurant was clean and the folks working were friendly and prompt. They have their own sauces, which is always a plus. It's a restaurant in a strip mall with an ordering counter, so it's nothing fancy, but I plan to come here again, and it has some of the better Mexican food I've ever eaten in the states. I'm giving 5 stars because it's definitely in the 5 star range for restaurants of its kind."}
{"text":"Great little Mom and Pop with Mom running the front and Pop doing the cooking. I've had the Tacos and Red Asada Enchiladas (not on the menu but they accommodated my request for Asada as my meat). My daughter had the Red Chicken Enchiladas. Everything was fresh and tasted great. Everything, including the tortillas, is homemade and you can tell.   The interior is very basic, order at the counter and sit at a formica table but, for fresh authentic inexpensive Mexican this is a great place!"}
{"text":"Killer breakfast burrito! A little on the expensive side but I would definitely pay again. They are open at 0700 now too."}
{"text":"Really good food but SO INCONSISTENT. It's great the have vegan and veggie options but sometimes there's a side salad sometimes not. I have asked for the salad with the pickled onions because it's so good and I never know when they are going to include it as side or not. But even then half the time it doesn't come with the onions or it's a different dressing. It's hard to explain what you want on the phone if you have modifications if you don't speak Spanish. The mushroom is well marinated and the fried avocado is great for a cheat meal for vegans. I just wish it was more consistent and better customer service. I called for 30 min yesterday and they didn't answer. Had to go in to place my order and then had to wait and they still didn't remember what I ordered."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!!! I recommend it to all of my nail clients!! It's one place I can order for my entire family since I'm the only Vegan in the House. The staff is so nice and helpful. The food is cooked with love."}
{"text":"Great tasting authentic Mexican food! Their beans taste as if hey were cooked in an authentic Mexican pot. I had te vegan pozole which has a tangy flavor to it making it taste delicious. Will be coming back for more great tasting food and try other dishes. Their service was great and friendly ."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here with my girlfriend. She had the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them very much. I had the huevo ranchero plate. Their beans tasted really good. My plate didn't come with rice but that's ok. The first round of chips and salsa were free, second order we were charged. That's ok. Chips were homemade and the salsa was fresh."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS !!!! This is my first review. I've never felt the need to write one before but this place is something else. Both my boyfriend and I have changed to a vegan lifestyle. I'm Mexican and I dislike going to Mexican restaurants just because they always disappoint but this place was amazing. I had the red enchiladas, they were better than my MOM's!"}
{"text":"Ah my new Vegan Mexican fix! First time and we feasted like savages! This place is fantastic with true Vegan options! Try the gorditas! You won't be sorry! We be back many times! Yummy!"}
{"text":"NOTE: This business listing carries over past reviews that apply only to their previous menu/location. Disregard any reviews prior to March 2017.  That said, I'm thrilled this place is back! Their new location is super convenient, and being able to walk to a vegan restaurant from my house rocks. The interior is totally transformed from the previous deli spot, and food and service have improved too!  VEGAN MENU: Good variety, breakfast served all day plus entrees. Enchiladas are solid, but the taco sampler plate is what I come back for (the cilantro-lime mushrooms are awesome). Molletes make a great breakfast dish. I like how they use quality non-dairy sour cream and cheese products and not Daiya. I'm looking forward to trying their nachos! If you're inching into vegan cuisine, try the potato tacos, they're a crowd-pleaser.  REGULAR MENU: Their best work is in the vegan items, but they also offer regular Mexican food so as not to limit their patrons. Their carne asada is really good, and I recommend their burritos, fideo, and enchiladas. Breakfast menu looks great, will be trying those dishes soon.   PRICING: Vegan menu is priced appropriately for a niche product with a limited target audience. People will come here for their great specialty vegan food. $13 for a taco sampler with sides is fair, and the $10 burrito packed with your choice of vegan fillings isn't unreasonable. Non-vegan menu prices are on the high side (think $12 wet burrito, $8 for chips and salsa?!), and need to come down a buck or two per item to be reasonable for the area. This isn't downtown Summerlin.   I really like the food here and I'm grateful to have a nearby vegan option when I'm too lazy to try to stick to it. I'm hoping they do well in this location!"}
{"text":"Best Vegan  horchata  and vegan huevos rancheros , friendly service , I will definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is so good!!! We ordered off the vegan menu and were told there was going to be about a thirty minute wait but they comped us chips and salsa (which were exceptional!). We ordered the loaded nachos and two tacos, one fried avocado (really tasty breading) and one lime cilantro mushroom (SO good!) Everything was insanely flavorful right down to rice and beans. Also, excellent tortillas. the mixed veggies they put on their loaded nachos were amazing! Pancho's is pretty far out of our way but we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Heard around the way that this hole in the wall was serving up good authentic Mexican food so we decided to give it a shot. The menu had a couple of my favorite authentic items ( i.e posole and blue corn ) I thought I'd try both. They don't have the blue corn so I just went with the posole hoping it would be as good as moms. Well unfortunately it wasn't, not even close. It was extremely bland and didn't come with the traditional garnish. I know that sounds petty but without the cabbage, onion cilantro and radish posole is incomplete! Kinda like pancakes with syrup. Bean and cheese burrito was ok and the gordita was ok as well. Now..... Let's talk about how long the food takes to be prepared. Mind you this is a Roberto type of taco shop! It took them 45mins! I'm ok with waiting on good food at a normal restaurant but this is a taqueria! And they forgot my bean and cheese burrito. I called and was told she forgot and would refund me my money on the burrito and being I stay right around the corner I went back for my burrito but wasn't refunded my money instead was given a complimentary side of chips and rice pudding. Ok no biggie I thought as I'd like to give this place a second shot. So we came back here 5 days later to give it another chance at redemption and sad to say they couldn't deliver  This time I ordered 3 asada tacos thinking they cant mess this up. My wife order the green chicken enchiladas and again my boys order bean and cheese burritos I tried to order the blue corn again and still they had no blue corn. The tacos failed miserably! The burrito came with black beans this time instead of pinto but was slightly better this time. The enchiladas were actually really good! But again almost 1 hour for food coming from a taqueria. Let me stress to you that the first time I was the only customer they had. The 2nd time there was 1 lady that ordered ahead of me. I might come back for the enchiladas alone! I suggest you look at the menu online and order 30 to 40 mins before arriving and please do not attempt this place on your lunch break unless your the boss or the boss really likes you and doesn't mind you taking well over 1 hour breaks. P.S don't bother asking for the blue corn as I think it's on the menu for show"}
{"text":"Impressed with everything ! The restaurant is clean, the waitress was fabulous, and the food was delicious. It also doesn't hurt that they have options for both vegetarians and those who aren't vegetarian. This place was added to one of my favorites in Vegas, we will be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful tacos,  homemade everything,  great for vegans,  vegan horchata, and my meat loving husband loves the food here too.  We take the granbabies and they eat the potato tacos. I really love the poblano mushroom tacos and the lime and mushroom tacos. Family run business so we like giving them our business. My husband has Carne Asada burrito and beef tacos,  he's picky and he said they were all delicious. Great beans and rice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Being vegan it's hard finding places that have authentic vegan Mexican food.  Not only is it vegan, it's almost all raw. Love it!  I was just here for their taco Tuesday's and had their:  Lime-cilantro mushroom *my favorite Poblano-zucchini *my favorite  Beer battered avocado Crunchy potato   It was all deeeelish I even had their elote...haven't had one of those since I turned vegan!! Amazing!!! I'm so glad they use follow your heart cheese rather than that nasty daiya! It's sooooo delicious!!! On top of that, they have vegan micheladas!!!   To all you vegans or curious non vegans out there you've got to try this place!  It's amazingly delicious!!!!!!  **excuse all the exclamations and amazings...I'm just so excited I found this place!!! LOL ;-D"}
{"text":"It was first time here.. been looking for good Mexican food in LV for a decade. I found it here. I want to eat everything on their menu. It's worth the drive from wherever you are in town."}
{"text":"I originally enjoyed their tacos at the Tivoli farmer's market on Saturdays. They were sampling some various salsas for sale & their cucumber lemonade that was amazing! I bought both. Unfortunately they were out of the lemonade on the day I went to their restaurant & they don't have all of their various salsas in store. However, she offered to make me some regular lemonade which was nice & the red & green hot sauces they provide are good. I like that they give you a whole squeeze bottle to use so you can put on as much as you like. The carnitas & asada tacos are solid. They seem a bit pricey at $2.50 ea or $9 for a plate w/rice & beans but they are tasty. They don't skimp on the cilantro like most places & the queso is a nice touch. They also give you a few chips if you eat there so that makes it worth it, for sure! I never order beverages w/my meals but I'll definitely be back for that cucumber lemonade also!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing.  I'm obsessed with the chicken nachos and the tamales!!! You NEED to try the lemonades!  And their chicken bowl is soooooo good!!  Definitely a great find. The food is made to order by the owners. They are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the burrito and chicken nachos on a different visit. before were good. The food was hot and ready on time. The host was friendly and great."}
{"text":"Never thought I would find a vegan Mexican restaurant it was delicious & they have a large vegan menu.  A must try"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is delicious! It's so hard to find good vegan places, and I'm so glad I found this restaurant! My mom is vegan and she absolutely loved it! Not only is it vegan, but the food has an authentic Mexican flavor! Food looked so delicious that we dug in right away and I forgot to take a picture lol. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"The food is good, very good, however the price(s) of their food is terrible.  I purchased a three taco meal with double beans, a drink and cheese on my tacos; my food came out to be $17.59.  The tacos are street size tacos (small), and my double beans looked like on scoop spread over half the plate.  Sorry I forgot to take pictures.  If you want to over pay for a taco plate this is your  place."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican vegan food I've had. On the menu it says they even use a separate kitchen for vegan food. Husband got the nachos with veggies and I got the chilequilles with potatoes. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Looking for vegan Mexican cuisine? Check out Pancho's Kitchen. They have a full vegan menu.  Walking in here for the first time I noticed the lovely decor, cute paper flowers hanging from the ceiling, the large comfy booths and the word vegan listed on the wall with all the other things they offer.   Our waitress was an effecient, sweet young woman. We ordered quite a bit of food since there was 5 of us, 4 of us vegan. There was a little mix up with our drinks but it was resolved quickly.   They offer so much for vegans including enchiladas, burritos and other traditional Mexican cuisine. They also have a taco Tuesday that you can get veganized as well.   The food came out quickly as well. I ordered the loaded french fries with beer battered avocado. Omg it was so good!   The prices are a bit higher here but they give you good portions and awesome food."}
{"text":"Only been once but big fan. The vegan menu is awesome the green chilaquiles was amazing and the server was knowledgeable.  Loved the beans.  Rice is not vegetarian (chicken stock)?  Only problem was hours are not what is on yelp.  Despite being a breakfast spot they don't open until 1030."}
{"text":"really good reasonably priced.  shrimp tacos great flavor with a nice portion of shrimp."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Their vegan menu has a ton of variety. What I especially love is that instead of meat substitutes or tofu, they have a few veggie options to choose from to add to your food. Definitely try the zucchini. The sauce was perfect. We also had beer battered avocado tacos which were as great as they sound. Everyone was friendly. Interior is cute. It's nice to have another restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Was in town from California celebrating my moms birthday. Last day in town before heading out and I didn't want to eat off a place on the strip.  Had a bit of a hangover and I was craving Mexican food. Quickly searched for a place and we decided on Panchos kitchen.  As we walked in we were greeted with a warm welcoming by the waitress. She informed us we may take a seat wherever we'd like. This is what really got my attention.. she asked if we wanted a regular menu, vegan menu or both? I was amazed that a Mexican restaurant has such an option! On a totally separate menu. Very cool! Big plus for the vegan customers. We opted for regular.  She took our orders and brought out the chips and salsa complementary.  I ordered posole with a pineapple drink, mom got the asada sopes.  Posole - flavorful and the meat was so tender! I did not have to ask for anything on the side as the waitress brought it all. A side of all the needed ingredients and the posole comes with a side of tortillas or crunchy potato tacos. So delicious!   My mothers sopes came nicely plated, the tortilla is nice and crunchy not too doughy! each sope was overly stuffed!  The waitress checked on us throughout the whole meal. She asked how the food was and if anything else was needed. We felt very comfortable dining here and I'm really glad we chose this place. I'd definitely come back the next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal, so many great items on the menu. They have their own Vegan Menu. Service was pretty quick but I guess I came in at a down time where no other customer were there. Even though the ladies who served me was at lunch, they were still pretty attentive. I was very hungry, so I wish there were a little more chips and salsa to snack on.   The only reason I give them 4 stars was because the food is a little colder than expected."}
{"text":"I am vegan and this food is amazing. Authentic Mexican food hold the dairy. You wil love it!!"}
{"text":"100% YES!!  VEGAN MENU! :) I was asked immediately upon entering if I would prefer a regular or a vegan menu, which to me spoke volumes. They are totally accommodating of vegans and encourage the menu! I've never been anywhere that actually asked if you wanted a vegan menu. Not to mention .. the people who came in after us was also asked the same question and they said .. \"Hmm why not one of each\" Cool to hear that people consider eating vegan when they have the option to do so! :)   Elias was such a great server! He was super sweet - brought food out promptly and we were never without water refills! Thank you Elias!! :)  Food was OUTSTANDING. Such great flavors and huge variety of veggies in both meals we ordered.  The atmosphere was great - quick service - great food with great prices!! I will ABSOLUTELY be back!   **THANK YOU PANCHOS!! Love to know I have another amazing Vegan friendly restaurant!"}
{"text":"I got the loaded vegan nachos $15 it was pretty good but definitely not worth it for the Amount that they give you."}
{"text":"Traveling and found this place off the beaten path. Well worth the hunt. Great service, amazing food, great prices and an entire Vegan menu in addition to their traditional menu! LOVED IT!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, Super Fresh and lots of delicious flavors. I had the vegan burrito with beer-battered avocado, vegan cheese, vegan sour cream and it was to die for. The ambience was great, very clean and the service was spot on. I would highly recommend this place to any vegan and non vegan eaters who love Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!!! Don't pass on Happy Hr though. Appetizers are fantastic and quite reasonable!!!!! Their Combo platter is to die for. All for $8.50. Plenty enough for two."}
{"text":"This is a great place with great service and food. The people here are always very attentive and food is done fresh. I love the fact that they have vegan options. Best Mexican food in town."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is great! We went with a group of 6 people and the staff was very accommodating. Everyone ordered separately and thoroughly enjoyed their food orders. The nachos were actually very great!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would, this place is NASTY!!!!  They served me SPOILED BEANS AND MEAT!!!  The fucked up part is that I could smell it was spoiled as soon I smelled it I payed $18 for a carne Assad plate that was SPOILED and not even a lot of food on the plate FUCK THIS REATURANT I am sending health department over there ASAP"}
{"text":"We're in Vegas for a family trip. This restaurant is literally 3 minutes from our Airbnb so we thought it'll be a convenient stop for brunch. We learned based of other Yelp reviews there was a vegan option! I got the crunchy taco plate and the almond milk Horchata. It was nice and tasty. Nothing heavy. The sauce was nice and light. I especially love their green salsa! My son got the Huevos Rqncheros which was nicely done compared to others I had it the past. The salsa / pico de gallo made it so yum!   Service was really nice. They were very accommodating. The new owner told me they're going to have a bigger Vegan menu with Cuban inspired dishes! Exciting! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been to Pancho's twice now and will definitely go again.  The food is divine.  All vegan meat and cheese.  I felt like I had died and gone to vegan heaven.  It's a small place with a small staff but they are super nice and fast.  The place can get kind of busy but you know, of course when there are not that many vegan places to eat that has decent much less great food!!!  I cannot recommend this place enough!! My hub who is an omni, had their vegan burger and said it was far superior to any real meat burger he has ever had.  So shut up and take my money!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Went in on a Friday afternoon, ordered a pork burrito lunch special, for $8 I got a huge burrito, chips and salsa, and a canned soda. Was so excited when I heard they had a standalone shop, as I would normally frequent them at the local farmer's markets. Hope they're here to stay since their food is delicious and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"The food is to prices and carne asada is very tuff taste was ok the menudo hominy was very tuff  service was Great"}
{"text":"Most their food good!!!! I don't like what order today bowl salad . Wet lettuce and mini salad they charged 12 dls. don't orders salads"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Mexican restaurant, with great service. It's a very relaxing clean environment.  Jocelyn did a wonderful job as our server. We had the Carne Asada taco combination. It's presented very well, and excellent. Try it you'll like it!  I've also heard that the Green enchiladas are great too.  Next time"}
{"text":"\"Opportunities are like sunrises. If you wait too long, you miss them.\" - William Arthur Ward  Vegan tacos!!! I don't ever look for vegan tacos on a menu, but when in Rome you have to right? I was hanging out with one of my favorite teenagers one afternoon when Mexican food was requested. We were close to Pancho's Kitchen and stopped in.  She felt like a Carne Asada Burrito, so I ventured back a few years to a time when I put down a lot more Carne Asada burritos than otoro and shared a burrito with her so that we could both have a few of the famous tacos that Pancho's is serving up. The burrito was fine...you can order it here if that's your preference and you probably won't be disappointing, but the tacos...the tacos stole the show! Since it was a Tuesday and all, we opted to try the Vegan Potato Taco, Vegan Avacado Taco, Vegan Mushroom Taco, and (kicking the vegan pattern) a Shrimp Taco. The Vegan tacos were bomb! The avocado is beer battered but, while tasty, may have been my least favorite since it's a little heavy from being fried. The Mushroom comes full of lime-cilantro flavors and our favorite was the potato--simple and perfectly savory.  I wouldn't hesitate to stop back in...and the next time I'm looking for vegan tacos, I'll know exactly where to go!"}
{"text":"I came to this little place today on my way to the DMV, I was short on time and I heard great things about it. Don't ever come here if you are in a rush. I nearly had a heart attack watching them make my meal, I asked them to put it in a to go box because it was taking so long.  I figured I would just eat it on the way to the DMV. I don't remember what I had ordered but it was Vegan. Blah Blah Blah. Is this the best Vegan food in Las Vegas? YES IT IS. Why? Because in Mexico people don't eat what we think of Mexican food here. People in Mexico actually eat what we call vegan all the time and no one is watching over their shoulders keeping tabs on when they ate meat or dairy. Mexican food in Mexico just happens to be vegan a lot of the times. And this little place in Las Vegas does just that. Real authentic Mexican food that just happens to be Vegan (with the exception of the Vegan sour cream but you can do without just fine.) So that's my review. If you went there and didn't like it then you just didn't get it. The way you probably didn't get that Jackson Pollock at the Modern. Your loss."}
{"text":"I was recently in Las Vegas for the weekend and was looking for a vegan restaurant to try. Luckily, I found Pancho's Kitchen and was blown away by their amazing vegan menu. I have been searching for an authentic Vegan Mexican food restaurant for so so so long and who would have known I would stumble into one in Las Vegas! THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!!! I had to go back for seconds before the drive back home. Definitely recommend their chillaquiles and mollete from their vegan menu.    I personally thought the prices were fairly priced because the food is very filling. Definitely worth every penny!!   Everyone who works there is extremely nice and accommodates to your every needs.   Can't wait to go back to their restaurant and try more of their dishes.    Please bring Pancho's Kitchen to Los Angeles. We need some vegan authentic Mexican food over here!! There's nothing like it in LA."}
{"text":"Talk about delicious and extremely fresh food! Holy smokes everything was so tasty and you could really tell it was fresh! Our loaded nachos came with a mix of veggies and at first I figured it was going to be the basic fajita mix....wrong! There was asparagus, cauliflower, mixed heirloom carrots and other fresh veggies. We were very impressed! The enchiladas curbed my craving and will definitely be something I crave. The only thing that was surprising was the prices, It was much more expensive than what I was expecting. That was tad of a bummer to spend so much but the food was good. I recommend it to everyone! May not be a weekly thing for us cause of $$ but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely heading back soon to check out a few other items from the vegan menu. I shared the vegan nachos and tamale for lunch today. Would order both items again but not until I've had the mushroom tacos and the chile poblano green enchilada.  The tamale was good, especially if you're a fan of swiss chard which was a really nice addition. I ordered it with salsa, beans and rice, $8.50. Good beans. Not Frank and Fina's good, but close and better than most I've tried in Vegas. Their spicy salsa that comes with it is pretty good and decently hot.  Pancho's is not fancy by any stretch of the imagination. It's small and quaint with only a handful of tables and walk-up ordering at the counter. The service is great, food is made fresh and they showed us lots of hospitality."}
{"text":"This was my favorite vegan place while visiting vegas, most flavorful and fresh Mexican food."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan food as well as the omnivore dishes. Will definitely be returning. EXCELLENT customer service- they texted us an updated menu so we could order while we were on the road from Anthem. Really want to stop in for breakfast & beers in the next few weeks!  Happy bellies all around :)"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Husband got carne asada nachos and i got chicken enchiladas to go for lunch. This place is very close to us and a cute hole in the wall kind of place. Prices were great and so was the service.  Definitely returning when i get that Hispanic food crave."}
{"text":"Beer battered avocado tacos will be in my dreams for the next few months. Vegan menu is awesome, meat eater approved as well. Will come back anytime I'm in Vegas. $2 Taco Tuesday's is an added perk, and excellent service! Also recommend the chip trio appetizer.. avocado sauce, spicy tomatillo, and roasted green chili were what we chose, all were delicious."}
{"text":"This was seriously the best Mexican food I've had in years. Me and my partner went around 4 on a Saturday and the service was great and food came out very quickly. I got the vegan loaded nachos and I don't think I've ever been more satisfied with nachos. The vegan elotes was amazing. Gonna bring everyone I know here to shame the other Mexican places they've dragged me too"}
{"text":"The food is Sooooo good. Mom got chicken fajitas and HOMEMADE flour tortillas. It was like abuela was in the back making them and serving them as soon as they were ready. Dad got the beef fajitas. He loved them. I got the veggie asada fries. I would recommend getting them. I had 4 refills on the horchata and mom had 3 of the agua frescas watermelon. Those are awesome. Very few people, but good atmosphere and great service. I usually don't eat much, but I couldn't help myself! Definitely coming back again! If you find yourself in the area, definitely come. Best vegan mexican food ever! Peace out."}
{"text":"Great food stopped in for pozole and it was delicious also had an elote chips are freshly made great salsa and wonderful service nice family owned treasure will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place opened near me not too long ago, and I couldn't be happier! The food is excellent and this place is great if you're eating with vegans or vegetarians. They have a normal menu and a dedicated vegan menu; I've had food from both and have been pleased every time. The ambiance is nice for a smaller restaurant, and the servers are very pleasant. I recommend the vegan burrito with beer-battered avocados. They have a decent beer selection with multiple beers on tap. They also have vegan horchata. All in all this is a place that can satisfy those who want to eat light and those who are looking for some good hangover food. Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"If you are not vegan and looking for good Mexican food I do not recommend this place. The food is overpriced and poor quality.  Go to Lindo for authentic Mexican food!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, the service was on point. I was greeted with a smile and guided through the menu to make the best selection for me. We landed on the vegan huevos rancheros and it was delicious. Lots of flavor and a savory taste that meat eaters would even appreciate. I left feeling satisfied and knowing I'll be back for more.  I highly recommend this place for vegans and omnivores alike."}
{"text":"Great fresh guac and chips. Super friendly and polite staff. Nice sit down atmosphere.  The fajitas were amazing. Chicken was cooked perfectly, veggies were tasty. They didn't come with cheese, guac or sour cream which was a bit odd but they honestly didn't need it. The flavor was perfect.  I will be back. You should check it out. If you like good grub that is. If you don't then you should just hit Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I have to agree with this guy below. With the amount of Mexican food available in this city you'd think this place would step up their game. I had the same experience. Got barely enough chips and salsa to snack on and yeah, only the first basket is complimentary. In addition, tried to order different types of tacos for the 3 taco combo meal and was told there is a $2 charge to mix and match. Really!? Come on bro, stop nickel and diming people. Your taco combo is $12.50 and comes with 3 tacos. Now to give credit where credit is due, the food is good but with so many Mexican restaurants in the valley to choose from I would take a pass at Pancho's Kitchen. Head over to Bomb Tacos, Me Gusta Tacos, Los Tacos or Tacos El Gordo and you will get a much better meal without hurting your wallet."}
{"text":"Well. I tried. This is my second order from Panchos. My first order I got the Vegan Pozole. It was green which I was not warned of. And it had a strong lemon flavor. I ate it as I cost almost $20 bucks on Uber Eats. Then today. It was Nacho Daddy or Panchos.  Well for Mexican Nacho Daddy's Vegan Menu is incredible. But well I ordered that so many times. I thought I give Panchos a try again. Well I got the Potato Crunchy Tacos and a side of Fideo soup. The Tacos were ok. You get three. But why bother putting rice and beans if there are almost invisible. And the Fideo came in the tiniest tiniest cup. At best this was a sample. I'm so disappointed. It was mushy and odd flavor. So back to Nacho Daddy's. I'm still hungry so a Cup of Noodle is in order as I spent $20.00 on this."}
{"text":"Incredible vegan tamales! They had a few other vegan meals that I can't wait to try!! The green salsa(mild) is the best salsa I've ever had before. I haven't tried the hot yet but she gave me a generous sample and I can't wait to try it out. I'll be recommending this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"The food was great. My boyfriend ordered the vegan posole and I had the vegan chilaquiles. I was excited to try this place out, because Vegas doesn't have many Mexican restaurants that cater to vegans. The service was great also. The owner is such a sweet and funny lady. I can't wait to go back and try the vegan nachos and the tamales."}
{"text":"I liked the chilequiles. Probably shouldn't have taken then to go though, since they got a little soggy.  Taste was delicious nonetheless!"}
{"text":"We have been going to panchos for a few years now. We always went to the Durango location with our grandkids, who are vegan. The newer location is closer to my house and I was so excited to finally make it over there yesterday. I ordered the potato taco dinner that comes with 3 tacos, beans and rice and a watermelon Fresca. I got it to go. So here's why I do not give them 5 stars. The drink and food were put into Styrofoam containers, which was a huge turn off for me.  The food was delicious as usual. I just couldn't get past the fact that the yummy food came in earth destroying, never biodegrades Styrofoam. I will eat there again but only if we sit down in the restaurant and I won't be able to take my leftovers home. Please, I beg of you Pancho s, please find more eco friendly to go containers. Thank you, in advance, for being good stewards of mother earth."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I came here with a few buddies of mine two weeks ago. One buddy was vegan, like myself, the other wasn't.   Yet, they had something for all of us to enjoy.   It was really a breath of fresh air that they had a complete, real, multiple choice (very dramatic I know) menu to choose from that was completely vegan.   Since my vegan introduction I have come to appreciate how many Mexican dishes you can make vegan. This place took my appreciation to a new level.   I ordered two potato enchiladas and one fried avocado enchilada. They were toppled with vegan cheese and sour cream. Everything tasted fresh and really complemented one another. The rice and beans were good as well, oh and before I forget, make sure you get their fresh guacamole as well!  For dessert I had some wonderful concoction of ice cream and fried chips, I forgot what it was called, but its a must try. And yes, that was vegan too.   Their customer service didn't lack either.   If you want some vegan mexican food while in vegas, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great options for vegans, as well as non-vegans! Took my boyfriend here the other day and he had the loaded nachos, while I had the vegan molletes. Will definitely be coming back to try the vegan desserts and other items on the menu! Prices were moderate and we also had a great, accommodating waitress."}
{"text":"Their vegan menu was a lot larger than expected and their food was so damn good! I had the red enchiladas with beer battered avocado and my boyfriend had the beer battered avocado burrito. Chips and salsa was really good also! I've already been back once and expect to go here many more times!! I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"This is the best vegan Mexican food I've ever had in my life!! Seriously it does not disappoint. The restaurant is not located on the strip in Vegas but for a short drive you can have the most authentic tasting vegan Mexican dishes ever! My husband and I started with their vegan horchata, the guacamole and chips, and the loaded nachos as an appetizer. I ordered crunchy potato tacos, and my husband ordered the vegan burrito with potatoes inside. We ended up sharing our dishes and everything was just perfectly seasoned and so delightful. \"So good you would never know it's vegan!\"  They have an entire separate menu for vegan/vegetarian options but they also serve all the regular meat based dishes as well.  Our server was so friendly and helpful, my husband and I couldn't believe how lucky we were to have found this place and their deliciousness!  This will always be our go to food when we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I got off work this morning and decided to stop in. I ordered the pastor nachos with hot sauce to go. The chip were freshly made, the protein were cooked perfectly, the hot sauce was on the side just in case it was too much, every topping mended so well. I'd suggest the nachos to everyone!"}
{"text":"This was the best food I've had in months. I ordered the crunchy potato tacos and my partner got the loaded vegan nachos.everyone was so very kind, service was amazing and the food came out almost instantly. We also had the vegan elote, which was on point. So thankful to have a new vegan place."}
{"text":"This the best Mexican food so far. Clean and so delicious. The lady is so sweet. Food takes a while to bring out, but soon is you eat it, you can taste fresh fresh fresh."}
{"text":"Yummy! My new favorite place! I tried a few things off their vegan menu and it was all delicious. The green salsas enchiladas, avocado taco, mushroom taco,and potato taco. My friend and I shared and tried these dishes together and we are wanting to go back today after having gone yesterday.  The price was fair I don't know why some people are complaining about it really. It's in good portions and made when you order. The staff were nice and overall good experience. I will definitely be coming back and ordering more."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is so good. ya e were out for girls day and my birthday, one of our group is vegan so I let her choose the restaurant. It was close and convenient. It was clean and the staff was friendly. My friend was so happy they had a whole vegan menu tons of choices. The food was delicious and everyone was happy with their order in fact 2 of us have already been back good place good food"}
{"text":"This freaking place. The food, sure, it's good, but man it's overpriced! I was bummed out to see that it was going to cost me $12.50 for 3 tacos. Oh, and they all had to have the SAME meat. Getting different meat in each taco was an additional charge. Also, what kind of Mexican joint these days doesn't have bottomless chips and salsa? I asked for some more chips and salsa once we made it way through our first serving and our waiter told me that only the first serving is on the house. The rest costs extra. No thanks. I walked out of there having paid $18 for tacos a drink and a minimal tip. So, yeah, the food is fine, but there are better choices elsewhere that are much more affordable."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Definitely try all the salsas they have to offer. So fresh & Yummy! Panchos kitchen is also VEGAN!!! :)  Staff is so nice! Thank you"}
{"text":"This place is vegan heaven! Such outstanding service. We got the vegan chile relleno and vegan asada fries. TO. DIE. FOR."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food.. had the vegan pozole it was delicious!!! Great customer service as well. My daughter loved the vegan burrito and vegan horchata!!! Will def be back to try more vegan options from menu"}
{"text":"Omg !!!! The vegan menu is amazing!!! Not only did Liz give us outstanding customer service, the food met our expectations and more !! The food is so good I'm bringing my friends here possibly on Monday!"}
{"text":"My new favorite taco place!! Everything is fresh and yummy.  Elaina the owner is very nice.  Very casual. All the comments about coupons are weird to me, the pricing is totally affordable, not sure how they can go any lower. Tacos are 2.50, sodas are 1.50, come on people, they gotta make some money to stay open.  Support this taco place and the family who runs it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. Don't go here. The owner is a complete douche. Service is terrible. Food is terrible. If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore the entire team here and the food is amazing. Guys, they are now open early!!!"}
{"text":"Being from Southern California, we do two things well: Vegan food and Mexican food. Yet, there are surprisingly very few Mexican restaurants that offer vegan options. Pancho's Kitchen has a full menu devoted to just vegan dishes. After being greeted by the friendly young lady at the counter, I opted for the #1 (vegan tamal with rice and beans) and my boyfriend ordered three different tacos with rice and beans.   Because they were out of avocados for the avocado taco, my boyfriend was trying to choose between the bean taco or the poblano and zucchini taco. She kindly suggested that they could combine the two for him, which was a really nice gesture and just a small taste of the great customer service they displayed.   As the food came out, everything was hot and meticulously prepared. They put a little bit of vegan pepper jack cheese (Daiya, I believe) on my beans, which is the way I would do it at home as well. The masa encasing my tamal was the most delicious and flavorful I've ever tasted. It was a good size as well and left me feeling content after I finished my plate rather than heavy and sluggish. The young lady helping us said they were her favorite and she wasn't lying, it was the best vegan tamal I've ever had and that's considering my grandma's homemade non-vegan ones I ate back in the day.   My boyfriend was so pleased with all of his tacos. I gave preference to the potato taco due to the crispness and the amount of cabbage and salsa amassed on top of it, however the other two were just as delicious (especially in regards to the homemade tortillas).   Too bad this place is not in Southern California. We really lost a good one to Las Vegas' authentic Mexican (and vegan) food scene."}
{"text":"I was in dire need to nurse my hangover and what better way than with Mexican food? Got the pozole, fideo, guacamole, and a delicious horchata to drink. The pozole was very good, but it is a tad spicy. No one makes fideo like my mom. Pancho's was okay, I don't see myself ordering it again. Their horchata is the best I've had, not too sweet, just perfect."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant, food made fresh to order and most important!! VEGAN options!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! That's how I felt after leaving this place in a good way. I honestly didn't wanna try this place but my husband insisted on it so we did. We walked in and the place was small but it's cute.   We were greeted by a friendly hostess that was also our waitress she was very nice and attentive. I feel like she went above and beyond to serves us. Her name is Lilly make sure you ask for her.   We decided to order from the vegan menu ( they also have a regular menu) I ordered the vegan chilaquiles and OMG they were very delicious the sauce was perfect! It came with beans and they were also very good by the time I finished my plate I was very full but I couldn't stop eating that's how good everything was lol. My husband ordered the huevos rancheros also from the vegan menu they also came with beans. He said everything was very good we both left very satisfied.   I will definitely be back! If you been wanting to stop by you should you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Long Beach, Ca and I came across this amazing vegan Mexican restaurant. First of, let me share that the owners r genuinely kind and inviting. They explained how their menus work, one is solely ALL VEGAN and the other is regular. We were also explained how the vegan food is cooked on separate sides of the grill. Overall, great food, fresh made salsas and welcoming staff. It was so darn delicious I had to buy 1/2 dozen of vegan tamales in order to bring them over to my home and share them with my family for these holidays :)  Try it you will not be discontent :)"}
{"text":"An entire vegan menu!!! Absolutely delicious food! Fresh and flavorful salsas.  Service is always good and friendly.  It has become our office favorite lunch place, can't believe we didn't know this place was here.  You must try the vegan burrito woth beer battered avocado! Even the non-vegans in our group love that burrito!  Keeping this short, just give the place a try, you'll taste what I mean!"}
{"text":"This is the best vegan food I have had. Awesome food and service. I had the enchiladas vedes and a vegan michelada  Definitely coming back for breakfast"}
{"text":"Wow. I am seriously so amazed at this place! Everything is seriously THE BEST quality from the creamers, salsa, salsa chips seriously AMAZINGG. The aguas frescas are also delicious! I got the pineapple one and it taste perfect!  Super authentic place. You can tell they know exactly what they're doing bc everything you place in your mouth is like fireworks! Lily was our server but her and her team made sure we were well taken care of and got anything we needed as soon as we needed it. I'm visiting from Cali but will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food.  REALLY high price for what you get.  $20 for three street tacos and a coke in a strip mall- not including tip."}
{"text":"One year we suffered through the thunder and lightning at Vegfest here in Las Vegas in order to try the vegan fare. Pancho's was a bit of a let down, it could have been the moment. Nonetheless we were hoping to give them a new try...The pics don't truly capture the yumm!!!! We went for Mother's Day and could not be happier! The food was absolutely amazing and Armando deserved all of the 23% he received in gratuity. Modelo was ice cold and the drinks were topped off regularly... The new management/owners are truly doing it right... Sorry NACHO DADDY... you've been replaced!!!!!"}
{"text":"I guess looks really are deceiving sometimes. Pancho's is hidden away in a small shopping center, and put together as if the decoration process was abandoned before opening. Don't let any of that scare you away though, this place stands out where it matters most: the food.  Everything seems very fresh here, the corn and flour tortillas are all hand made and delicious.  They don't seem to advertise this, but they should because their tortillas are better than most tortilla factory restaurants I've been to. Fresh tortillas being the key to a great Mexican dish, it's no surprise that the food is quite exceptional. It's not the best I've had anywhere, but it's certainly the freshest and best tasting taqueria style food I've had in Las Vegas.   My only real gripe is the chips and salsa. The tortillas are good, but when fried, they make chips that are thick and kinda hard. The three salsas that were served tasted pretty bland. About half way through our meal we asked if there was a hotter salsa available and they brought us a really good molcajete style sauce that was spicy and full of flavor. I definitely can recommend this sauce, but you have to request it.  So far, I've tried the chicken chilaquiles, tacos, and burritos and all were great. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but when we saw this place had an entire vegan menu? We decided to give it a a go!  Amazing food!  Amazing friendly staff!  Clean and tidy!   Definitely highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. The food was just okay. Very overpriced for a Mexican restaurant. Waiter took a long time to come take our order. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!   The vegan menu items are so tasty (and not greasy or oily). The nachos were incredible (the diced and grilled zucchini on top was our favorite). It took a few minutes to receive our order, but everything is made fresh and is well worth the wait. The customer service was great. We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Finally a place that boyh my husband and I can be happy with authentic mexican food. The vegan menu is insanley good and he really enjoyed the regular menu as well. They are so friendly and the service is great! We are both excited to come back again."}
{"text":"I had the chili relleno first time here will not be my last it was awesome the gravy that it came with was great all the stuff was fresh the manager or owner was very pleasant I like the location also"}
{"text":"AMAZING find! They have an entire vegan menu AND they use a separate kitchen for the vegan preparations. Yay! No cross contamination!! Everything is made from scratch all the way down to the tortillas. As if this couldn't get any better our server was the nicest, friendliest person ever! Can't say enough good things about this place. Hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"The pork burrito that I had was really good. I ordered the nachos and the chips were stale. They act like they have a shortage of salsa. We asked for salsa for our burrito and they brought us out about 2 ounces. They also brought out about 2 ounces of salsa to go with their complimentary chips and dip. Which by the way, the chips were stale. I rated them 3 stars because of the stale chips and shortage of salsa."}
{"text":"It has been tough to find good Mexican food by my office. I saw this place pop up and tried it. Wow!  The first time I went there I had the chicken fajitas. They had great flavor and there was plenty of food. The second time I went, I took my staff with me. I had the chicken enchiladas. Great red sauce!  They also have a vegan menu for those who lean that direction  As Arnold says, \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"The food here was really good. I had vegetarian tacos and they were tasty and fresh. Service was friendly and timely."}
{"text":"Pancho's Kitchen is definitely killing with the flavor  I'll start by saying the pozole is a must try!  So good and it's served with 2 mashed potato tacos which or my favorite kind of tacos!  This was my first visit here and the place clean and wasn't too busy. Staff was friendly and helpful.  I also ordered the potato rolled tacos with rice and beans. My only complaint was there wasn't that much potato filling in the tacos only half the taco the rest was just crispy tortilla.  The food is delicious though and I will come back again."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite vegan place for Mexican food. The high quality ingredients and the flavors make the food addictive.  I love that my family can come together to enjoy a great meal with all the eating preferences covered. Both veggie eaters and meat eaters come in hungry and leave stuffed. The service is great, smiles and friendly atmosphere.  If you love Mexican food, vegan or other, go here!"}
{"text":"Tasty and as authentic as it gets! I had the Carne Asada Burrito, which was hot, fresh and packed with all the right ingredients including rice, pico, guacamole, sour cream, and beans. We also ordered the Chicken Enchilada's, which was fairly spicy but incredibly delicious.  Don't expect a lot of Chips and Salsa, however. At PK's that might be a good thing. Load up on Taco's and Tamales instead. :)  A mom and pop operation, they're located right next door to Norm's Eggs Cafe on Durango, just south of Spring Mountain. Limited indoor seating. The inside could use a bit of sprucing up, but if all you care about is ambiance and not the meal itself, then head over to Pancho's in Downtown Summerlin instead for their rendition of bland and overpriced Mexican Food (ya, $18 burritos? No thanks.). At Pancho's Kitchen you get flavor for half the price. Great vegan options as well. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"One of my fave Mexican places! Its really hard to find good Mexican food in Vegas. This is a small little restaraunt in a busy strip mall. The staff is always super friendly! My go to item are the potato tacos. Three deep fried corn tortillas stuffed with flavorful potatoes. It comes with refried beans which are amazing and fluffy yellow rice.  The wet burritos are huge and filled to the max. I had the pastor that was melt in your mouth tender! The red sauce just put it over the top. The salsa and chips are great and pico on point. All of their aguas frescas are really good too, they actually have chunks of fruit in them- Yum! Reasonably priced for great home made food!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on 4/13/16 with my boyfriend because of the amazing reviews from the vegan community. We saw them at Vegas VegFest but I got so drenched during the hail/torrential rain bit that we had to leave early thus not sampling Pancho's. While not solely vegan, Pancho's is extremely vegan friendly and even has a separate vegan menu!  I have to say I was a little confused when we arrived because it was a lot smaller and less charming than I thought. Many other Yelpers have accidentally posted pictures intended for the Pancho's in Downtown Summerlin. This is a completely different restaurant. I reported those pictures and hopefully they will be taken down as it's quite misleading. This restaurant is really small and probably best for takeout though there's plenty of tables to dine in, which is what we did for our first time.  I ordered the vegan Tamal ($8.50) which is a tamale wrapped in swiss chard and my boyfriend ordered the vegan Breakfast Burrito ($9) without the tofu scramble that's usually included in the burrito (they were out). I picked the Tamal because it was the only gluten free vegan item and I have a sensitivity which can make me sick if I have too much. However, it seems they are pretty accommodating and can make other dishes gluten free. The man and the woman that were working when we were there were very nice people.  We sat down to wait and we were brought over some chips and salsa. Chips were yummy.. and both vegan and gluten free.. but there weren't many at all, maybe just a handful. Additionally, the salsa is in squirt bottles, which is handy when you receive your entree but kind of weird when you're eating your chips because you can't dip them. That salsa verde is delicious though! Our entrees came out moments later and we thoroughly enjoyed them. My boyfriend and I both agreed the Tamal kind of had a weird aftertaste which I attribute to the swiss chard which can sometimes be bitter. Don't get me wrong, this was one deliciously vegan tamale and I will be ordering it again! And you can't expect vegan food to taste the same as non-vegan food. This is a wonderful substitute! However, they were a little skimpy on the rice and beans as well (well honestly I eat a lot!) and I ended up ordering an additional side of rice ($1.50) to go with the second half of my tamale. I also squirted a bunch of salsa verde on the rice to give it some more flavor. My boyfriend demolished his burrito. His only complaint was that it was too starchy which he says would probably be fixed by adding the tofu scramble (hopefully they'll have it next time!). I tried one of the potatoes in his burrito and it was seasoned to perfection. We also tried their horchata which was pretty good.  I'll be back and I'm excited to try the rest of the vegan dishes. Maybe even tonight for dinner :) Thanks to Pancho's for including vegan and gluten free items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, made fresh!! Authentic, small, quiet, place. Had the vegan tamale at a farmers market and it was amazing. Today chilaquiles with a green sauce. Muy Bueno!!!! The mango lemonade also amazing. Service is great and will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"When  I arrived to Pancho kitchen, I was happy someone ask me if I wanted the normal menu or the Vegan menu. Was very impress to see so may things on the menu. Order the avocado to start, the 3 vegan tacos, and another dish, coffee with milk , no cream... coffee was served in a mug and come with cream, asked for milk and never get it. My avocado guacamole never came either. The tacos were good and the other dish was good as well. Nothing were memorable. The restaurant had 27 customer for 1 server and no busier. No wonder why service is bad, not because of the server, but because of the lack of server in the room for Sunday brunch. A second server arrived at 11am when everybody start to leave. Food average and bad service is a no come back for me...sorry."}
{"text":"An entire Vegan menu is always refreshing to find, especially at a Mexican restaurant. Everything was affordable and delicious, this will definitely be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time and it was great. We ordered the Vegan Potato taquitos, Vegan elote and Vegan Horchata. Everything had so much flavor. Absolutely loved the green sauce that went with the taquitos. This is a must have. Will be coming back to try other foods on there menu."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. Clean and great services. Super good vegan friendly menu !! The owner and daughter are the best. Great staff!! . Fyi winter hours already in place check their Facebook page..  Next event super excited is  www.panchoskitchenposadas.eventbrite.com  Check it out  I will be there.   and  also on their menu"}
{"text":"This place - which is DIFFERENT from Panchos Tacos on Pecos - is definitely in the top 3 vegan restaurants in Vegas.  Everything is fresh and prepared to order so guacamole here is the best in town because it hasn't been sitting around.  Battered avocado is a welcome alternative to faux vegan meats. And if you want vegan meat you can get tofu, which is the healthiest vegan meat there is because it is a lot less processed than soy meats.  I like that they have some unique vegan items such as fideo soup and I especially like that I can add soup to my meal for a couple dollars. It sucks to go to a place like The Modern Vegan and have to pay $10 if you want a soup with your meal.  To round it out - servers are very patient and attentive and the restaurant is classy and clean.  One negative I've found: nachos and enchiladas have very little cheese on them and the cheese is not melted. These dishes are still good, but if you are looking for something cheezy - look elsewhere!  BEWARE Don't confuse this place Panchos Kitchen with Panchos Tacos on the east side of town!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a vegan friend.  Food could have used more flavor but the staff was friendly and service was on point!  I had chilaquiles with green sauce, the sauce tasted a little bitter."}
{"text":"Vegan menu has such bomb options. Loved them since they used to set up At the Farmers Market. This place is hella organic as well. Honestly one of the top ten restaurants in town. And for a vegan to say that about a non Vegan place is a lot. Also it's super affordable I have never spent more than $15 a meal."}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast burst with chorizo. Service was way above board, and this was a great crew running the business! A great experience overall."}
{"text":"Came because we had a coupon for buy one entree get one free from the entertainment book. They said it was a mistake and would not honor it. They did give a 10% off but it was less than half what it should have been. I got the Carne Asada burrito. It was big and looked great at first. It would have been very good except the steak was overcooked and dry. My fiancé got beef tacos which were fried too long so the beef was like jerky. My son got the chicken enchiladas which he said were alright but not great. The salsa was the best part.  Not a place we will return to."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic, obviously made from scratch and super fresh. The owners were really welcoming and showed us how they make fresh corn tortillas using a wooden press! My mom had the green chicken enchiladas (\"best I ever had\"), my dad had the salad bowl with carnitas, my man had the carne asada burrito and I had a fried avocado taco and the potato taco. Something for everyone! I could eat those frijoles morning, noon and night!"}
{"text":"We had a great vegan lunch!!! Pozole was awesome they served it with lots of fresh toppings. Micheladas were huge. Husband said his tofu chorizo was good and that's coming from a non vegan, it wasn't a huge portion. Nachos were good too and ice cream nachos to finish off a really filling well made lunch. They have taco Tuesday specials, we will be back to try those too. Nice little place great service."}
{"text":"Great Vegan food and nice atmosphere. I will definitely be back to try more of the vegan food!"}
{"text":"A great vegan find! This place features a common and vegan menu! With plenty of options to choose from both. The dining area was nice and clean with adorable decorations and the staff was lovely and friendly. The meals were affordable and flavorful. The presentations were very nice and clean. Their elote and horchata were to die for!!! The only down side may be the area but it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Yummy food, good vegan options, nice staff"}
{"text":"I would love to come back and try more of their vegan fare but based on my first visit, it wasn't all too impressive.  I'm so glad there is an authentic Mexican place that offers vegan anything so three enthusiastic stars for that alone!  My boyfriend did really enjoy their vegan burrito, too.  The vegan avocado taco was TINY, and really didn't compare to Garden Grill's beer battered avocado soft tacos."}
{"text":"Food is great as well as their customer service! We got salsa and chips, a wet burrito and tacos. My friend said her tacos were yummy and my burrito was soo good I ended up eating the whole thing! The chips and salsa were not the best, maybe they can improve a little in that area, I've tried wayyy better."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place is awesome! I love that they serve both vegan and non-vegan food so everyone can find something they want. The food presentation is beautiful and it tastes as good as it looks! I will be back."}
{"text":"The avocado tacos here are amazing!!!! I could eat them every day! Go for taco Tuesdays and try any taco for $2! Great deal"}
{"text":"I'm vegan myself and I was so happy to come across this gem! They have a separate vegan menu which is great & easy to order off of. I had the molletes with deep fried avocado as a topping and it was amazing! Also had their asada fries but it didn't come with vegan beef so it was okay. Healthiest asada fries I've ever had haha. Their proportions are pretty big. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came for the Vegan food and were SO impressed. Expansive menu with tons of options including breakfast which we will definitely be back for. We were seated and got food within 20 minutes. Great service and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND: Best vegan tamales ever!! Actually everything is good!! Everything is homemade and the owners are super nice!! First tried them out at the farmers market at Tivoli Village on Saturdays then realized they are right behind my house!! Super convenient and did I mention delicious?!?!"}
{"text":"For the service, price, and taste of the food this place deserves five stars!!! So happy to now have a delicious taco shop on this side of town.  Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting Soooo long to write this review. First thing I have to say I I can't wait to go back. The architecture of this building is AMAZING. Please see my pics I took, you walk in through two sets of massive Spanish mission doors. There is beautiful mosaic tile every where, the immigration brick skillfully hides the structural support in the central \"Garden\" . I saw at least one fountain in the garden room and a tone of foliage! You apskot feel like your outside with the 9 giant skylights above. Also, people in the restaurant industry usually judge places by their bathrooms ( if you spend the money for a nice restroom, your probably looking a pretty solid operation everywhere else) these restrooms were equally as nice as the dining area however , why they didn't put dark wood water closet dividers that match the rest of the space , I do not know.   Now to the food! Great segue right? The food was excellent. I have been when waiting for a \"real\" Mexican food to open up on this side of town forever.  Beans and rice are always the first thing I try, these were great and everything was very hot and fresh. Their salsa is very similar to frank and fina's with healthy amount of onions and sweetness.  I had an order of Guac which was good but extremely over priced (13.95 for what couldn't have been more than 3.5 ounces) . If anyone from Panchos reads this listen now: Agave went out of business in 3 months, less than 1/2 mile away for trying to do the  same thing. Yes, your in Summerlin, yes red rock CC is near by, but the majority of your business will be retirees and families that live within 3 miles. Don't price yourself out of the market and give someone that beautiful building for pennies on the dollar.   Back the the food, I had a combination, beef taco and chili relleno. The taco was a less greasy version of Roberto's. Which is great! The real winner here was the Relleno. Easily the best relleno within 100 miles and the price for the entree plate was 14.95, totally within reason for that plate. Go have one.   Finally, Antonio was in training with Fernando and they were both excellent servers with warm smiles. I will be back frequently."}
{"text":"Responding to Vanessa G's review, I don't blame the restaurant for not refunding her. She ate half the food. And when she didn't get her way, she stormed out and dumped all her food outside in front of the entry way. Very childish customer. Don't listen to that big old baby. This place is awesome. Great service, management, chefs, and food!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in town! Full vegan and carnivore menu. Food is so fresh, amazing. Service is always excellent!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place....... The restaurant itself while charming, has very little seating, and for me taking my food to go is def not my first choice.  I had the crispy potato tacos special with rice and beans.... it was good, not great.....a little bland, not at all the flavor I was hoping for. The chips and salsa was about the same, where is the spice? I tasted tomato and cilantro... thats it...... I know everyone is excited about the vegan options here, but if there is no spice and no flavor then what is the point?????? My husband had the carne asada burrito and he said it was good, not great.... probably can't talk him into trying it again because of the huge options of Mexican food here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Affordable, authentic and priced so well! Walking distance from my work I'm in love with this place. The staff is so friendly too."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing...everything on the menu is delicious!!! The Chicken Pot Pie, smoothies and salads are great! We had a huge group and they handled it perfectly:) When you come to Vegas this is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously where have you been all my life!?!? Great food all the way around. Insane menu including tons of vegan options! I will be back often! Great work!"}
{"text":"I don't know why they offer vegan food here if they never have a complete vegan dish. Never coming back. 2nd time this happens"}
{"text":"OMG!  Vegan green enchiladas are AWESOME! I will definitely be back! So glad I looked for vegan places in the area."}
{"text":"The best place for vegan Mexican food in Las Vegas. The zucchini and poblano taco was a little too spicy for my taste but good. The lime, cilantro and mushroom taco was my favorite along with the avocado taco. The crispy potato taco was pretty good also. The rice and beans were very flavorful, surprisingly so. I definitely will be back to try more options."}
{"text":"I was interested in trying this pace since I heard great things about the vegan menu. Oh man I was definitely underwhelmed. I got the fideo soup which was too salty, the flautas (I think) from the appetizer menu were just ok. Nothing spectacular. The nachos had good flavor but the description on the menu sounded more appetizing than what it really was. The only thing I really enjoyed was the beer battered avocado tacos.  I wouldn't go out of my way to drive over there."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love me some Pancho's Kitchen! The first time I tried their food, I came back a few days later because I couldn't stop thinking about trying those lime-cilantro-mushroom tacos... So I went back, and I did not regret that decision! Really! Try 'em for yourself!  The vegan tamale wrapped in greens is also amazing! It is the best I've ever had. Waiting for my own food to come, I took bites of the veg burrito from my generous significant other! I cannot wait to get my hands on the avocado tacos for next time... The nachos were good, too! Portions are decent, and I find myself with a plate licked clean every single time!  It's a hole-in-the-wall type of atmosphere, so don't come in here expecting a full-service restaurant. But the bathrooms are clean, and the employees are absolutely pleasant! When it comes to Mexican. Pancho's is the place to be!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!!!!!! Their vegetarian fried avocado tacos were amazing and their nachos were also out of this world!!! Eat here, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"By looking at the yelp pictures I was under the impression that this was a full restaurant, but it's actually a small/fast food Mexican joint. Just imagine a Roberto Tacos, but instead of a chain restaurant it is a family owned business. I ordered a carne asada burrito which was delivered within five minutes. The food and flavors were very authentic and had a very good taste. They mixed the meat, rice and beans with their sour cream and pico de gallo. I was happy with the food and the price point. However, let me make it clear that this is not a good place for first dates, its more like a quick lunch/dinner type of place. They also offer fresh orchatas and aguas frescas. They do not have sodas machines so you can get a cold coke in a bottle or your typical can soda! Either way this is a good and cheap mexican restaurant to try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Vegan Mexican food ever. The waitress was beyond helpful and would recommend it to anyone who is Vegan or not."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and Karla was an amazing waitress!!! It was a great time, and I highly recommend Pancho's Kitchen to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"I've stop by this place because I was nearby they have great authentic Mexican food so anybody out there looking for a good restaurant to eat this is the place service was excellent not exaggerating very friendly I would recommend everybody green enchiladas!  They also have great beer micheladas ! I rarely get about reviews but this food is awesome"}
{"text":"I am really starting to get adjusted to my vegan / vegetarian lifestyle, and places like Pancho's Kitchen definitely have opened my eyes to vegan / vegetarian food that can be full of flavor.   A co-worker and I stopped in for lunch. I had browsed reviews on Yelp and looked at so many yummy pictures.   There is a full vegan menu, complete with everything from appetizers, main dishes, desserts, and drinks. So many choices!   I decided on the taco combo (two large tacos, rice, and beans. I tried two different fillings, lime cilantro mushroom and poblano zucchini.   The tacos were LEGIT. I especially liked the lime cilantro mushroom but the poblano zucchini was good as well. The rice that it was served with was light, not greasy or salty. Everything was so full of flavor.   The only disappointing part of the entire dining experience was that I filled up on the tacos and had no room for desert. Haha.   Will definitely be back. All you vegan folks out there, this is a must try! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Pancho's Kitchen is outstanding. They serve traditional Mexican food and offer a full and tasty menu for vegans! I love how accommodating they are for their vegan customers.  Everything was so good, it was actually overwhelming, and I don't think we spoke the entire time we were inhaling it all.  It has also been years since I've had an elote! I used to flag down the elote man like every damn day growing up in Los Angeles, so I was in heaven!   Lastly, I asked for a bolillo bread roll by itself, as the menu lists it as a sandwich-type dish, and I expected the waitress to think I was a weirdo. But not only did she NOT think I was a weirdo, she totally validated my request and we both went on about how delicious they are with just a little bit of [vegan] butter and sugar with cinnamon. She happily brought some to my table. I love her. And her mother (who was in the back cooking up deliciousness) also commented on how good that sounded and that she wanted some too! I love her also.  Thank you Pancho's Kitchen for providing delicious vegan Mexican options!"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim. After a long night of drinking I needed posole to get it together!!! I went in and sat down on a Friday around 3pm and it was completely empty. No big deal! I was happy to be alone but still feeling pretty sick. I asked the girl to bag it to go. When I got home, I sat down to eat and when I bit into the meat of the posole it was hard. Almost like they tried to warm it up in the microwave and the meat hardened. It was terrible! I called the number on Yelp and a woman answered and I told her what happened. She was mortified! She said this has never happened before. Within 20 minutes, she had someone deliver a fresh new batch of posole to my house! It was perfect, just like my abuela used to make it!!! With this type of customer service, I will always come back for more!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, bland, overpriced and the order was trashed.  Probably partially due to delivery service, everything was tossed in boxes, soggy and unedible.    Three of us ordered, all three threw food away.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered the green pizole and pork carnitas platter. Delicious and friendly service."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a week visiting a friend and end up eating here three different times. Of all the places we went out to this was both the most casual and the most delicious. 10/10, both the vegans and non vegans thought the food was slammin'!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try this place! Came here for vegan tacos but I always end up changing my mind. Server was really nice and recommended the Chilaquiles for breakfast, it sounded really good but not was I was in the mood for but I let my indecisiveness take over and go for it. Got mushroom and beer battered avocado for $2 extra. It was really good but I think I just got too excited that it was vegan and didn't realize it was probably one of the unhealthiest options. I mostly wanted something not too heavy after my hike. The chips are fried (I also got chips n salsa since I didn't realize this) and avocado is fried. So it's basically a big plate of delicious fried food that I wish I wouldn't have gotten. With that being said it WAS good! Red and green sauce were both good, avocado dangerously amazing, and mushrooms were the only fresh touch. Can't wait to come back and try something else"}
{"text":"This is so far my favorite place to go for vegan Mexican food Everything that I have had has been amazing Great customer service I even order a lot of pick up orders from this place and they are always prompt and smiling when I come in  Please try this place Even if you don't like vegan food But who wouldn't They have regular Mexican food with all the fixings"}
{"text":"My new spot for to go Mexican!  Ingredients are from local farmers market, and even have a Vegan Menu.  Wouldn't think that it would be possible to clean up Mexican food, but this place did it!  Mexican food is and always will be heavier and saucy, however Pancho's lighter use of oil and decision to veer away from lard has not led the food to lack any flavor.  All dishes are made fresh to order, including sopes. The only item I believe to be pre made are the tortillas.  The green enchiladas covered in a light spicy green chile sauce have a heavenly flavorsome sauce that, depending on who's cooking in the kitchen, can be light and fluffy as cotton or thicker and saucier- all the same both have great savor.  Once the chicken was diced up on the enchilada, another time shredded.  So not always consistent here on preparation, but consistently palatable. If you're lucky enough to catch them when they have blue corn, their blue corn sopes are scrumptious! Well cooked with a light crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, you can tell they are freshly made. The difference in white or yellow vs. blue corn are subtle (blue had a slight nutty flavor) but if I see blue corn on a menu I always go for it. The Vegan Menu- how neat is it to see this at a take out Mexican spot? I ordered the vegan tamale and it did not lack any of the toothsome-ness the regular items had.  Vegan can be delicious!  The corn masa was wrapped in chard (which was exquisite by the way) and stuffed with local farmers market veggies such as squash and corn, all seasoned generously. This dish did not disappoint!  Pancakes.  At a Mexican take out? Yes, and they are worth ordering.  Chocolate chip pancakes made fresh smothered in chocolate and condensed milk, decadent!  Bye bye iHop! Posole had two separate experiences with this, one spicy one not.  But you can definitely tell this soup is made in a clean way, doesn't have the sticky gelatinous flavor to the soup.  In my opinion, Mexican is difficult to make upscale or fine dining (case in point I've been to Javier's, but I'll save that for another review).  However, Pancho's is a little shop with 3 workers that act as server, cashier and cook who make well-prepared mouthwatering Mexican food.  Home cooking at its finest. Taking a star down for a couple reasons.  1. The wait.  I've ordered ahead of time as far in advanced as 1 hour and still waited an extra 15 min when I got there.  2.  Consistency.  As mentioned earlier, dishes were prepared differently depending on the chef, sauces had different textures and meats done according to whomever was cooking. Wrapping it up, good ol' wholesome home cooked Mexican food with Vegan options and all made with the health conscious in mind.  Order ahead because you'll have to wait!"}
{"text":"Ordered the enchiladas in green salsa. Amazing.  I live in small town Ohio so the combination of merely having a vegan menu plus a flavor explosion was overwhelming. I'll definitely be back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As vegetarians, we were thrilled to find this place for brunch while on vacation. The food was exceptional, every single dish was a hit and we totally enjoyed the experience! highly recommended"}
{"text":"On my first trip to Vegas, this is one of the restaurants that came up when I searched for vegan food. I first ordered through UberEats, and was genuinely surprised at how good it was. I then decided to come into the restaurant. The customer service here is lovely. The atmosphere is authentically mexican. They had cumbia music playing as well as some classic songs playing in the background. You walk in and can take a seat wherever. The waitress then asks if we wanted to see a regular menu or a vegan menu. We took one of both. (My sister is not vegan) While I waited I ordered their vegan michelada which was delicious!! I then ordered the vegan chile relleno. It was lovely except I personally like to eat mine with vegan sour cream. We ordered the loaded fries with grilled veggies and I finally got to eat some corn on the cob! I have not been able to eat corn like the elotero man makes it in so long, and this one was just how i remember them *insert crying emoji* Even my non vegan sister enjoyed the corn.   My one pet peeve with vegan mexican food is when they over do it with the spices. Its an over kill for me. This place DID not disappoint, It AUTHENTIC mexican food, with meat or no meat! Highly recommend for everyone to try!!! Vegan or non-vegan."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I'm a vegan who truly appreciates that separate vegan menu!! Everything we tried was delicious and great service!!  We were on holiday for 4 days and came here two days in a row !!"}
{"text":"I saw this place has some good reviews from my fellow yelpers. I decided to come dine in today for one of my business lunch, and I was glad that I did.   The service was attentive. The food came out pretty fast which was a plus since we only scheduled one hour for this meeting. There wasn't that many people at 1:30pm, so it was quiet for us to talk.   We all wanted meat so none of us tried the vegan menu. They looked pretty delicious on the pictures. I will come back and try them later. From the regular menu, the server recommended enchiladas and creamy poblano chicken. I went with the chicken enchiladas. One of my colleague got the shrimp enchiladas and queso with chips and salsa and the other one got the carne asada nachos. Both of us who got the enchiladas were satisfied with our entrees. Not my coworker who got the carne asada nachos. She only had few chips.    Chicken enchiladas (4/5): I enjoyed my dish. The flavor was great. However, the chicken was a bit dry.   Carne asada nachos (2:5): I tried a few. I didn't like the carne asada. It has a lot of fatty chewy beef. Not enough cheese either.   Overall, I will return again due to the convenience factor, good services, and decent food."}
{"text":"Thought I ordered delivery, turned out it was pickup. Showed up after they closed and they saved my food and let me in to get it. Love the food, the restaurant, and the family staff. Just wish they stayed open a little later because I could eat there more often."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer since their Fort Apache location. When that location closed, I was devastated. Although another guy took over the restaurant under a different name (Paiz) and a similar menu, it was not the same. I've been patiently waiting to find out what Elena and her family had in store for the future; so I was beyond ecstatic when I saw news of Pancho's opening on Facebook this morning. I immediately rushed over!  Wow! Pancho's always had the best vegan Mexican food in town, but now they have a great looking restaurant to go along with the food. The old place was very plain. This location is a LOT bigger and everything from the wall decor to the stringed lights makes for an ambiance that matches the cuisine perfectly.   Their vegan menu is also more extensive than before, and I intend on trying all of their new items with each visit. I can't speak about their non-vegan items because I have never tried them nor will I ever. All of their vegan food that I've tried thus far has been delicious! My favorites are the crunchy potato tacos, the vegan nachos, and anything with the cilantro lime mushrooms. Their vegan beverage selection is all made in house and yummy as well, from their horchata to their fruit juices. They also have an alcohol license now. I look forward to trying their micheladas very soon.   The only way this place could be better than it already is is if they went 100% vegan, but I completely understand that as a business it's more profitable to be appealing to the general public. If you could not already tell, I am a huge foodie, and I can confidently say that this is my FAVORITE restaurant in Vegas. If I could give more stars, I would for this yummy vegan friendly restaurant that's run by a super sweet family!"}
{"text":"Simple Mexican dishes done right! Fresh ingredients, clean establishment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time and everything was amazing! I had the micheladas, vegan pozole and  vegan tacos. My boyfriend who is not vegetarian had the shrimp and carnitas tacos, and a burrito with asada and was very happy with it as well. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I picked up dinner here today. Fast service and good food. My second time coming here, just this time I ordered to go. I ordered street tacos of Carne Asada and gorditas of Carne Asada. Salsa is delicious. I'm Mexican and this really close to authentic Mexican food. The lady who takes orders is super friendly since you walk in. I will definitely return. I did want to mention that I think some people are confusing this restaurant with another restaurant named \"Pancho\" in Summerlin and posting pictures of that restaurant to this one."}
{"text":"We ended up here randomly, glad we did.  I had the Beef Flautas and my husband had the Chicharron Verde.  Both came out warm and fresh.  The salsa was very fresh that was served with the chips.  The staff there was very attentive and friendly.  They only have beer, wish they had Margaritas/Paloma's.  Will go again!"}
{"text":"First off the food! Delicious for vegan and no vegan! I got the rolled tacos with potato filling. It was a tiny bit bland but with the added delicious salsa I loved it.  The Horchata ids delicious and I thin homemade but NO refills.  :/  The menu is fairly extensive, and after being told the two year old birthday boy was allergic to milk they brought him a piece of cake to celebrate. Not a dairy free one, you can imagine how that went down Decent amount of seTing the extra point I would take off for the service was added back in because of the Churro with ice cream. Easy parking, place was clean. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Great service Very friendly and food was really good! I tried something new just to see what it was about- tried the potatoe tacos and the beer battered avocado on the vegan, my hubby had the quesadilla with Assad and tortillas were FRESH will be back again"}
{"text":"Freshly made tortillas.  When a Mexican place has those, it's a safe bet the food is going to be good as well.  It is.  Their tamales are excellent and flavorful - never had a dry filling like you do with so many other places.  Great tacos and burritos.  The seating isn't anything special so some people may ding them for that...but for small groups or grabbing lunch/dinner to go it's amazing."}
{"text":"FINALLY! Vegan Mexican food! Oh happy day, this place is good. We ordered the tacos and red enchiladas with beer battered avocado filling. My friend said the mushroom lime filling was her favorite. The chips were great and the pineapple water was delicious!!! The servers were sweet as pie. Love this place! While their Charleston location is currently open, their grand opening is Friday, March 24th and we're planning on going to support them."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was pretty good, even the vegan options. It took a while to get our food. The customer service is lacking. We've been sitting here for he pass 15 minutes and no one has yet to come by and refill our drinks or ask us how we are doing! All our drinks cups are empty at this point. Next time I will order to go!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place! They can't get orders right they have the WORST customer service! This place is over priced and crap! I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN! wish I could give a ZERO STAR because that's what this place deserves!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I could not. I got the vegan posole and regular shrimp sopes. I loooooved the posole it was very good! I would definitely come back for it. I really wish that was all I had ordered. The sopes were terrible, SO bland omg  ugh they were so disappointing Instead of paying 14$ i could have made better ones at home honestly."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Panchos Kitchen! The food is AUTHENTIC mexican, it's not a heavy/ greasy. If your vegan this is by far the best mexican vegan selections. Even if you aren't you'll enjoy it regardless. Great service and the food is consistently great! Have visited five times over the last six months and have a had exceptional experience every time. Thanks Panchos for considering the vegans and don't forget to try a michelada!!"}
{"text":"Off the chain!!! Great authentic Mexican VEGAN Food-every time I want to leave Vegas I hesitate because of all of the wonderful Vegan options in town. Add this to the list-"}
{"text":"Great service and lots of vegan options! GET THE AVOCADO TACOS. Apparently, they are changing their hours and adding more breakfast options? We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch-TACO TUESDAY special! If your undecided on what tacos to get, you need to order 10 shrimp tacos! Their shrimp tacos are delicious."}
{"text":"I am a vegan and I just had the extreme pleasure of having lunch here today and I have to say it was over the top wonderful. They have a full menu just for Vegan they also have a menu for Non Vegan. Very clean and friendly and music in the background.  I ordered the green enchiladas (which you have 5 choices on the stuffing) and I couldn't resist I had to try the cauliflower wings.  They were both delicious and plated very nicely, the wings were great I chose medium (a little to hot for me my bad)  the enchilada (you get 3)  had a wonderful texture and lots of flavor with a side of beans and rice :)  I will go back again and again, you have to try it."}
{"text":"From the atmosphere inside to the authentic food this place has it all! I enjoyed the freshly made guacamole and also fresh juice options. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food tastes good and fresh.  I ordered Carne Asada plate for $18.99. The portion of each on the plate was small - just spread out."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Above and beyond service. We can't say enough about this place.  Both regular and allergy menus are bomb.  The vegan gluten free menu is delicious.  They are very conscientious about cross contamination of wheat and dairy which is great for freaks like me. I had the veggie bowl.  What ever is in the mock sour cream, it's very realistic. Lots of veggies and delicious sauces.   My little one had a tummy ache when she arrived and they made her some white rice.  Not on the menu.  They made it special for her.  When she was feeling better she pounded a quesadilla.  Loved it.  My husband had the chicken tacos.  Again, lots of fresh veggies and fresh chicken.   The food was yummy and filling.  Large portions of healthy food kept us going strong all day.   It will take a little longer than your average fast food Mex to get your food but you won't be disappointed.   Carnivores and herbivores alike will love this place.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Great service, phenomenal food! They have a separate Vegan menu! I ordered coffee, pancakes, hash browns, and vegan eggs. SOOO YUMMY! Everything was perfection! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very satisfied with their vegan menu! I had the the vegan nachos can't wait to try other dishes. I couldn't hardly decide what to order there were so many great options. Maybe one of the best vegan menus in town. I think more restaurants should have separate vegan menus like Panchos. Don't make me think about what I can or cannot eat, just let me sit down and enjoy a great meal. Well done! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a recent convert to the pescatarian way of life. So, eating out, something I truly adore, has become a tricky task. Craving tacos and missing \"Al Pastor and Carne Asada,\" I decided to venture in to Panchos as people have raved about their vegetarian/vegan tacos.   The place is small and has a super clean, family owned Robertos feel to it. The food was super fresh and made to order. There weren't huge vats of food needing to be reheated.  I got the special of the day: 2 tacos (any kind), beans, rice, and a can of soda for $7.99. Not too shabby. I also picked up some carne asada tacos for my roommate and an order of the shrimp empanadas.  The empanadas were made-to-order and the lady told me it would be a 15 minute wait. ¡No problemo! The empanadas were definitely worth the wait! The MAIN reason I'm willing to give this place another go!  The potato tacos (carbs on carbs, yo) were okay. They weren't amazing, the weren't good, they were okay. Along with the vegetarian beans, and the rice. They did have vegan cheese which pleased me greatly. (I don't know why I like it so much because it doesn't taste like cheese, at all.) The homie really enjoyed the her tacos, agreed about the lackluster beans and rice and raved about the shrimp empanadas!  I really struggled with 3-4 stars, but they forgot my sodas and the tacos were just a-okay. I will be back to explore the menu more."}
{"text":"I am so sad to say that the last time I went here, the food was awful and the customer service was worse. After looking through my entertainment book I saw there was a coupon for Pancho's so I brought it in. The lady at the counter said it wasn't supposed to be in the book and they didn't accept the coupons anymore, but since I was a good customer she would still give me a discount. She gave me a dollar off. WTF?! And their coupon is in the entertainment book again this year!  That stunt and the food being subpar really makes me sad. No longer a fan of Pancho's."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan options and plenty for the carnivores too. The elote (reg not vegan), potato taquitos, vegan nachos and vegan burrito with cilantro lime mushrooms were all delicious. The fresh salsa and chips were awesome. The service was quick and very accommodating- they even split the elote in 3 for our party to share. Also, the music was perfect! Great place to visit off the strip."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite taco place in all of Las Vegas, I can only speak for the vegan menu, but I think if a restaurant can take the time to make good flavorful  vegan menu then I'm sure the meat is good too, panchos veggie tacos give everyone a good reason to choose compassion when they eat out!"}
{"text":"Vegan Mexican food?! Blasphemy! My co-worker convinced me to try this place out. Not too busy during the lunch hour. We ordered 2 lettuce wrap tacos - lime/cilantro mushroom and poblano-zucchini, veggie asada fries with added beer battered avocados, and veggie stir fry. I also ordered a pineapple agua fresca.   Firstly, everything was seasoned well and had tons of flavor. The mushroom taco was \"meaty\" and had a nice spice. The zucchini was cooked al dente, which is exactly how I like it. The sauces on both tacos were mild but still packed a little punch. The asada fries were packed full of veggies and vegan cheese. Again, veggies were cooked just right. The beer battered avocado was a little heavy, not something I'd order again. My co-worker said her stir fry was pretty good and the sauce was flavorful. The agua fresca was so refreshing and you can really tell it's fresh.   The menu says everything is cooked fresh to order so be ready to wait just a little longer to get your order. I wasn't too keen on vegan Mexican but I was impressed with this place. I'm sure I'll be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Woah I was impressed with this place! Food is absolutely delicious. Looking forward to the next visit!  UPDATE!!; Food is still absolutely delicious !!!"}
{"text":"Ill start with the positives.  Was not too busy at lunch so was able to have a conversation. They have a vegan menu option. The hibiscus drink was good, not too sweet. Now for the disappointment. We ordered vegan fries with everything on it to go. Waited for 45 minutes and no one explained to us why the wait for one order was taking so long. I had to ask after 35 minutes why is it taking so long and the lady took another 10 min to get back to me. 45 min later, we got our to go food and the fries were soggy, and the vegan order had nothing special about it. Tasted just like something I usually whip up at home. For $14, was not worth the 45 min wait to only eat something super simple-tasting. Will not return."}
{"text":"First time today and I went specifically to check out the vegan options. Got the poblano tacos, fideo soup, and horchata. All really tasty. It is a sit down place but they accommodated my to go order. Love that they have a whole vegan menu for breakfast and lunch. Will be back!"}
{"text":"For some Veggie Loaded Fries 40 mins... they need to hire more staff or cooks. Place is busy and everyone is just waiting a while.. Food quality good and place is clean. Again only complaint is more staff to reduce wait times."}
{"text":"I went vegan a while back and there's never a vegan Mexican place around, until this one sprung up! The food is delicious, and their salsas are the best I've had. The woman who is there whenever I go is so lovely and kind. She goes around and talks to people to make sure that they are comfortable and their food is to their liking. The chef will sing in the back, which is quite the show! I adore this restaurant and I will be returning."}
{"text":"Pancho's Kitchen was recommended to me by a veteran vegan customer that I met in Simply Pure in Container Park. When she said \"vegan mexican food\" my jaw dropped. I didn't know there could be so many variations of vegan food! It's so great being able to still have that same flavor, but just with healthier alternatives. This location just opened up last month. The interior of the restaurant is designed and decorated so nicely. It has that vibe as if I'm going to my best friend's mom's house for some tasty authentic mexican food - very homey and welcoming.  The hostess/waitress I had was Lily and she was extremely kind and helpful. She checked up on my boyfriend and I many times to make sure that we were doing okay.   I like that they give you an appetizer of chips and salsa, on the house. I ordered a vegan burrito with lime-cilantro mushroom and my boyfriend ordered from the regular menu - a burrito with al pastor meat. Yes, they are a little bit pricey, especially on the regular menu. A burrito with a side of chips is $10. But at the end of the meal, I still felt very full and content."}
{"text":"When Pancho's just had a stand at the farmers market I used to get their chips and salsa all the time. The salsa Verde was my favorite. So I was really happy to hear they were opening a full location. We came in for an early lunch on Sunday, it wasn't too busy but once the norm lunch time hit it started to fill up.   We ordered the beer battered avocados, a wet burrito and the bistec ranchero. We also got a watermelon and Pina fresca, delicious!! The food was good, I especially appreciated their authentic beans and rice. The corn tortillas were awesome, they tasted home made. I think next time I might order from their vegan menu. From what I've heard, that's where they really shine. I'm obviously not vegan, but I love great food wether it has meat or not."}
{"text":"My Vegas expert and Yelp amiga, Elizabeth B, has been extremely helpful with the vegan eatery suggestions.  After reading her review, I drove over here for some potato tacos and nachos.  I received 3 potato tacos and they were crispy and delicioso. I requested no pico de gallo since I don't like tomatoes, however, I got mucho de gallo instead.  It's ok; I brushed it aside, although I lost a lot of my salsa.  The beans and rice were ok, but I could've used a tad bit more sabor (flavor) in both.  The nachos were ok. The portion was huge and I love that it was piled high with veggies.  I asked for both spicy red salsa and the green salsa.  I only received a small amount of red salsa; enough for the potato tacos only.  My nachos would've been a lot better to me with more spicy salsa.    They did not have any vegan desserts (I asked).   Inside is small, but comfy, like abuelita's cocina.  The lady at the counter was very pleasant.  Prices are reasonable. Located in a strip mall, so there was plenty of parking. I'd go back for more potato tacos and to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Tuesdays have now become my favorite day of the week because why? $2 VEGAN TACOS, that's why!!!   I can't get enough of how amazing this place is and how it perfectly caters to my Mexican food cravings! They have Happy Hour all day on Tuesdays with tacos priced at $2 each (except the fish and the shrimp) as well as a variety of drinks such as beers and Micheladas discounted from their regular price. They also have a separate vegan menu so any and all members of your party can enjoy all that Pancho's has to offer!   I cannot explain enough how delicious the vegan tacos are! My non-vegan friends even ordered off the vegan menu and actually ended up really loving their choices. I definitely recommend to try each of the tacos that come in the base choices of: potatoes, cilantro-lime mushroom, beer battered avocado, and zucchini poblano. One bite and I swear you can't even tell that it's vegan! Also other recommendations would be the vegan horchata (made with almond milk) and their veggie fries.    Love the atmosphere of the place! The restaurant has a lot of seating which allows us to always get seated immediately. There are also various TV displays of reggaeton music videos playing that make me dance while I eat my delicious food!!  You also get complimentary chips and salsa with your order so you have something to snack on while you wait.    Definitely recommend trying this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. Head here for brunch every Saturday with the whole family. They have an awesome vegan menu! Like seriously... amazing. Expect to wait a little bit, but the food is out of this world! Everything is so fresh and flavorful. The staff is super sweet and they do a great job. They have something on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"I have hesitated writing a Yelp review for Pancho's because it's like writing a love letter to your crush. Like, how do you even start to convey how amazing they are or how much you adore them?   To start, the food is phenomenal. Their vegan menu is massive, and I like that the emphasis is on veggie based alternatives (and not just soy based mock meats---though they do offer tofu now). My favorites include the green pozole with all the trimmings, the mole enchiladas stuffed with succulent mushrooms, and the vegan PK omelet (which, don't tell, but they've let me order past noon on more than one occasion).   The staff here is so sweet and attentive. Some servers definitely move faster than others, but they are all very nice and try their best. Though if you get \"that one guy\" be prepared to give gentle reminders in a \"bless your heart\" kind of way.   The only itty bitty, teeny, weeny bit of criticism I have is that they don't give you heaps of chips with the salsas or guacamole (and I usually have to ASK for the initial courtesy serving of chips/salsa). Know how most places give a whole basket? They offer one small handful per person at the table. Like, I'm talking maybe 5 chips apiece. This always strikes me as weird because all the other portions are huge. I'm sure it's because they don't want them to go to waste, but those chips are bomb and I want more, dangit! I might have to settle by just ordering the nachos! :P   Seriously, I love this place. I have never taken anyone here who has not fallen in love with it too. This place has my heart!"}
{"text":"The place is simple and homie. The place needs a TV or some sort of entertainment because the wait for the food takes a while to prepare because it is authentic Mexican homemade. They should also provide a salsa bar and chips to munch on while the food is prepared. I didn't see any chunky salsa, just the traditional red and green. The drinks were not given to us when we ordered, but when the food was ready. The staff was friendly. The food was good and reasonably priced. The place was clean. I'm not sure if there are refills on drinks. Next time, I am going to call the order in, and then go pick it up."}
{"text":"I first found out about Pancho's Kitchen through the Fresh 52 Farmer's Market at Tivoli Village. I've tried three of their most popular dishes: tacos, burrito bowl, and tamales.  Tacos: I normally get carne asada tacos. I love that they melt cheese on the tortilla and then put the steak directly on top, so when you bite into the taco you get a perfect mixture of both flavors. I also love that they cook the steak on the crispy side, so it has a nice char taste to it.  Bowl: I typically get carne asada for their burrito bowls, but I highly recommend asking them to put the veggies they put from their vegetarian bowls in the steak bowl--there's a great mixture of cauliflower, zucchini, lettuce, and tomatoes.  Tamale: their vegetarian tamales are the way to go! Love the flavors and textures you get from the veggies they have in there. The sweet corn and carnitas tamales are delicious as well.  A must try!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. I won't lie i was a bit shocked that rice was not red Spanish rice but it was still good . I would definitely recommend the Jamaica tasted very fresh ! I would go back :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why it took so long for me to try this awesome place, I drive by almost everyday. Once you enter you are asked if you want a \"regular\" or \"vegan\" menu, which is a great option. I have visited a couple time and have had the poblano taquitos, tacos and molletes. All these plates were very delicious. The staff is very friendly and patient with all the many questions my friend and I had about the menu. It also has a great atmosphere, they have music and videos playing on the tv's."}
{"text":"Love seeing an authentic Mexican place with a vegan menu. Ordered the Beer Battered Avocado Tacos and they looked amazing & tasted even better! The rice and beans were great as well. It came with a green, spicy salsa and delivered the kick that was definitely needed and appreciated. Also ordered the vegan Horchata and it was refreshing and pleasant. Customer service was great as well! Will be returning in the near future :)"}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for somewhere inexpensive and were craving Mexican when we decided to try this place out.  We found them in our Entertainment book and decided to give it a try.  We were disappointed when we got there as they would not honor the coupon but we chose to stay anyway. Big mistake!! My food was atrocious and almost inedible. I ordered their beef tacos and what I got was beef jerky in almost burnt shells. My fiancé's burrito was dry and had no flavor.  The best thing we had was the chips and salsa which unfortunately was lacking in quantity.  Won't be returning :("}
{"text":"Amazing food! Do yourself a favor and eat here ASAP! Incredible menus including vegetarian and vegan options. Amazing flavors, family owned, excellent service and quality.  Can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"Found this unexpectedly while driving. Very friendly. Food is exceptional. We ordered carne asada tacos and tostada salad bowl. The salsa and sauces taste very authentic and homemade. I liked the crispy tortilla shell from the salad bowl. Very light and crispy. Overall great atmosphere and our server Chris had great customer service."}
{"text":"Super yummy vegan options at the restaurant and farmers market! Love the grilled avocado tacos they make, and everything really. Staff is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Saturday morning we went for the menudo & boy was it good!! Highly recommend it & the enchiladas!! Nice quiet atmosphere..."}
{"text":"I eat meat, but understand the health benefits of eating Vegan. So when I see a place that probably does vegan food well, I try it out.   This place killed it. My burrito was excellent, I chose the fried avocado as my \"meat\".   Everyone's meal was great, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice and clean restaurant, I enjoyed the music and videos being played. The food was pretty good, only complaint is the chicken was too dry. Staff was friendly, would try it out again."}
{"text":"No good . Service was horrible , bad attitude and super slow. Food had poor flavor & was overpriced for what it was."}
{"text":"Came 3 days in a row during my visit this week because I did not want to eat anywhere else. Wet burrito with potato filling is bomb. Sangrias are bomb. Veggie fries are bomb. Everything BOMB. Also, I got a chance to try out their breakfast and guess what? BOMB.  I love this place, it is the only vegan spot in vegas that serves breakfast, lunch, dinner that I want to eat at everyday during my visit!!! Service is SO nice. Food is reasonably priced and fresh. LOVE!!!  Recommend to all vegans, non-vegans, and vegetarians visiting vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Vegan nachos were very disappointing.  Carrots do NOT belong on nachos.  I was going to order the nachos that were not dressed up but I was up sold :( The 'cheese' was slightly disappointing as well. I dont know if that is how traditional nachos are but I prefer the runny yellow queso.  They use unmelted white cheese.  Also I got a little baby portion of chips and salsa. ?kinda weird. Go to Panchos Tacos and order the full nachos with the melted cheese  Panchos Tacos is much better !"}
{"text":"Best Vegan Mexican food in all of Las Vegas. My favorites are the grilled avocado tacos,the Vegan Spicey Nachos,  and the Vegan burrito. I love this place."}
{"text":"This place serves the freshest vegan mexican food in town! I love that they make their own tortillas!"}
{"text":"They have the best chips and salsa in town. I got shrimp tacos and they were delicious. The place looks clean and the stuff is very friendly. The prices are average."}
{"text":"Ok I read all the reviews so I thought I'd give it a try..well I really think people don't know good food..ordered Carne asada fries..hardly any cheese..they were the steak fries..not good..order crunchy tacos with beans and rice..the beans were horrible. .they tasted sweet..I'm told the owner..she said no we just use salt..there's no way..everyone tasted sugar in them..so back to the tacos..they were served sealed shut with the stuff on the side..so u had to open the tacos to put the lettuce etc into them .so they cracked when u had to pry them open..mom got green chicken enchiladas..which the sauce was canned..and they used mozzarella cheese..never heard of that in my life..also ordered a chicken tamale..was so dry..should have know better when we were the only ones in there..oh when they brought out chips and salsa..well the chips were old and stale..and we had a beer battered avocado taco..horrible ..and you could tell the oil hasn't been changed out..the red salsa was horrible..no flavor just tasted sweet..I'm not a robertos fan but I would eat there over this anyday..worst mexican food I've ever had..I know good mexican food..trust me..don't waste ur money..and ND they sell cans of soda..so no refills..this place will be outta business"}
{"text":"Vegan Mexican food is a new concept to me. I've tried some other vegan interpretations of popular dishes and have been underwhelmed. But Pancho's Kitchen does it right. I was intrigued by the beer battered avocado tacos and I'm so glad I ordered them. Delicious! How they create a crisp crunch just like a fish taco is genius. The side rice and beans were flavorful and the complimentary chips and salsa were also good. They offer a choice of mild or spicy salsa with the chips. Everything tasted fresh and house made. I'll certainly be back because I have to try the crunchy potato tacos and green enchiladas. The dining room has a nice atmosphere and I noticed that the staff take care to keep the tables clean. They don't just swipe crumbs on the floor, they actually clean the tables properly. See you folks again soon, I'm glad I have some meatless options that don't involve bread, pasta, tofu, or the eternal salad."}
