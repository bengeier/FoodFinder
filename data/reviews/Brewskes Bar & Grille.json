{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas all I wanted was a place to find some familiar faces. My boyfriend and I started playing pool here a few days a week. The bartenders learned our names and drinks and made sure the pool table was open for us. 
The people here gave me a little spot to feel at home after moving across the country from everyone I know. 
The changes in management are shaky (not sure what's going on, but we do love Dan), but everyone continues to remember us and show us kindness so we won't be leaving any time !"}
{"text":"First time visit, had no expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. Their menu is small but has your basic bar food selection's. They had draft and craft beers, which was a plus in our book! Wings are my go-to's (Wing Queen) so I had to try their hot wings. They made them extra wet, as per my request and I was very pleased with the heat level, portion and size of the wings and the fries were seasoned well. My boyfriend had the Fried Chicken slider's, which he liked, however needed some sort of sauce to compliment it as it was a bit dry. Nevertheless, we will be back!"}
{"text":"While the bartenders are usually great, the owner's policies are HORRIBLE. After gambling over $170 and having four shots (which are now served in a thimble) and a club soda, I get handed a tab for two of the four for $13. Forget it Stewart, I'm done with your crappy customer service. I would rather go to bars where the bartenders actually are allowed to be real gaming bartenders. Another point Stewart, if the staff turn over at one of your locations is consistently HIGH, a new one about every three weeks, maybe it's time for YOU, the owner, to reevaluate your policies."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received. The bartender was drunk and had no idea how to make any of the drinks or shots I wanted. He had to look them up on my phone and they still tasted nothing like they were supposed to. The bartenders and waitresses ignored us pretty much the entire night. When they finally took our order they told us they ran out of pitchers. I'm sorry, what? You're a bar and you ran out of pitchers? Wow!! Never again will I return to this bar, they give local bars a bad name."}
{"text":"The bartenders friendly and the atmosphere is very local friendly. It's nice to be able to go to a spot with very little to no drama"}
{"text":"This review stems from sampling their food from Bite of Las Vegas so take it for what it's worth.
They offered sliders are their tent, a Jameson glazed burger slider w/ onions & a Philly slider. They came out fresh & were VERY tasty. The quality was so good we are def interested in going in for the full dining experience. Def worth checking out for the food!"}
{"text":"Wow...I won't waste my time here EVER AGAIN.  There are plenty of places that will actually appreciate you and your business.  I wish I could give it ZERO stars.

They pushed us away last spring when we hung out after kickball...it was poorly run and the staff was horrible.  To think we drank a lot but didn't gamble!  In a BAR!!  We didn't sit at the bar so we weren't taking up gambling spaces but they were still rude to us.

Then the Lodges took it over.. Yay!  Ft. Apache lodge is one of my favorite if not my favorite place to gamble.  Should be better now... NOT.

When Michaels closed a few months ago, we brought in over 50 Charger fans in several weeks in a row to watch the Chargers play and they ended up telling us they didn't want us to come back.  We weren't too rowdy...AND we got crappy service because they only scheduled ONE bartender and ONE server for us after the first week where they had several.  I guess they thought the numbers would drop off.  They don't know our base very well i guess.

So, why did we get pushed away?  One theory is we did not gamble enough.  (I know i played a couple hundred myself and saw others playing).  Too bad... i know a lot of liquor was ordered, food was ordered.  Only gamblers sat at the bar... including me.  

I was done with Brewske's at that point.

Today I go in to redeem a free meal I EARNED on their designated day (I could only redeem it there on this day)  and they wouldn't honor it.  Apparently the card I was given wasn't filled out properly when I EARNED it (not that i would've known...it wasn't MY promotion).  The problem with the card?  1.  The only thing it showed to fill out was address, phone number and email address for ME.  I could have filled it out on the spot.  THEN they said it expires after two weeks.  THERE IS NOTHING ON THE CARD ANYWHERE THAT SAYS IT EXPIRES.  Totally misleading.  The bartender explained that she told that to the management and they appeared to have NO CLUE.  

I'm sorry, even though I love Ft. Apache Lodge, and spend at least two nights a week gambling in a Lodge somewhere (Durango Lodge being another place I frequent) I can't see myself supporting such STUPID management.  Management that doesn't keep their word.  I would highly recommend you don't either.  Save your money for bars that deserve it... not expect it."}
{"text":"Super cool bar. New menu is perfect. Short. Concise. And affordable. The machines are hot. Most days. Drop by. They will hook you up."}
{"text":"Met some nice customers, the boss was nice. Bartenders were cool. Had the French toast. Very filling."}
{"text":"Came here last night to check out one of the bars in the area that isn't your traditional Timbers. 

Pros: 

Bartender (Juan) was super nice, suggested a signature drink he makes called apples&oranges that we all thought was tasty. 

Space was open, lots of tables and seating available.

For bar food? Pretty tasty. The sweet potatoes fries had a nice little kick.

Cons:

Music.. old rap and R&B. Did not fit the pub setting. At all.

The service was very slow.. waited about half an hour to even be able to order our drinks, and then the bartender came back about ten minutes later to make sure we had valid ID. Can't blame the guy since he was the only one working and had at least twenty customers. But still. Very slow. 

Price. For a beer, gin, and order of sweet potatoes $20. During happy hour? Little steep if you ask me.."}
{"text":"Excellent !! Stop in there very often , bartenders are like family ! Erik / Amber /Gina/DustyLee / Jamie ! Try the food here too ! Great job"}
{"text":"I just learned my friend Dan would no longer be the gm here, and that makes me a little sad... I really thought he was doing a great job here, and I wanted to come here because I thought he was turning it around.  I will still come on graveyard to see Carey Ujhely, because he's a great graveyard guy, but whether it's right around the corner from my house or not, I just want consistency.  As a player I don't want a new bartender every other day, I can play any other place.  Good luck in your endeavors Lodge group, but please give me more of a reason to come here"}
{"text":"Awesome late place to grab a bite to eat. Better than your usual place in my opinion. They have a different selection from PTs so I enjoy it here. It has pool tables and plenty of space to hang out and conversate with girls. Always open. And close to home."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this bar isn't on Bar Rescue! There's so much wrong with this place. I don't know where to start.

To begin with, it's in a location which is in a spot where you have 2 other bars, within a mile. 

The building is 20 years old, and very dated! I remember when it was the Colosseum! 

I frequented this bar from 05-07 when I was living in the area. 

The bar has gone down hill over the years! There's never more than 10 customers in the place. 

Just judging my experience tonight, I won't return for a while! 

To begin with, I went in at 5:00pm... I had 3 beers, which came to almost $20.000. There  are several bars in the area that run a $3.00 happy hour deal. Within 5 miles.

When I first walked in, the bar tender was too busy doing shots with customers, and a guy who seemed to be the manager, to come get my order. As a new person I felt very un welcomed!

I hung out for a few hours, the obnoxious regulars just kept getting louder.  The staff encouraged it! I ended up leaving more annoyed than when I walked in!

I had a bad day, and wanted to relax, & this was the wrong place to do so.

It's been a year & a half since I've been there, and it'll be at least a year before I go back."}
{"text":"So, this was the oddest \"Pop In\" experience... Not sure how to rate it.

Brewske's in a nice place. it's comfortable. The people know each other and are friendly. The bartender was cool and have WAY TOO MUCH fun.

The menu is extremely casual in a \"you belong here\" way. 
Our food took 35 minutes (for a wrap and a sandwich). I'd be a little upset about that, but my Mustard Chicken sandwich was one of the best hings I've even eaten and the fries are FANTASTIC. 

Prices are on par with the area, if not a bit lower.
I will deff be back soon and will absolutely update the review.

I want to like Brewske's and I think that I really will after a few visits."}
{"text":"Service has gotten much better. I can't comment on the draft beer since I ordered bottle beer. Fool me once. The burger I ordered was pretty good. I've never come here at night so I can't comment on the crowd, but it looks and smells clean which is pretty good for an older bar that allows smoking.  They really need wifi. I mean EVERYPLACE has free wifi even McDonald's."}
{"text":"I've been a customer for quite sometime and I always enjoy the ambiance and cocktails. I've ordered food before and it was pretty good, but there's a new cook in town ;) Her name is Daphne and everything I order is DELICIOUS. With the revamped menu & her soulful touch, you feel as though you her sitting at her table. I've started ordering pick up to grab lunch and head back to work. If you are in the area, stop by Brewske's. Nice People, Good Food & Tasty Drinks..."}
{"text":"Decent bar, no complaints! The bartender, Kat, was very friendly, and whipped up some shots she called, \"Kat's vagina\", which were actually pretty tasty. Free pool tables, and some fun video games. I didn't eat the food, but everyone there who ordered food enjoyed it. It's pretty smokey, but it is a bar, so that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Compared to other options in the area, Brewskes is just a dated, overpriced dive bar.  The Menu has improved, but everything else (including the atmosphere) makes you wonder how they can justify chrginng the prices they do. There are much nicer places."}
{"text":"Sadly, this did not meet our expectations as a Charger Bar.  The first 2 weeks were great, then we were no longer wanted.  We have found a new home."}
{"text":"Bartenders are all awesome. Food and drink prices are good. Machines pay decent compared to other places I have been. There's pool and music box which is cool."}
{"text":"Won't be going to Brewske's any more - apparently we Charger fans weren't spending enough.  Adios!  Good luck with your Sundays now.  GO BOLTS!"}
{"text":"So this place leaves a lot to be desired. It's kind of a retro, tacky feel when you first walk in, and the music doesn't really match the decor, or the other music for that matter... Not sure who chooses the playlist but they could try to pick a genre and maybe roll with it for a few songs... Hearing What is Love?, then En Vogue, then Phil Collins kinda made me a little confused about life... The food was not good! Like not good at all. You can tell everything was frozen at some point. The nacho tater tots were the only good thing we had. I had the honey glazed salmon which was dry, over cooked and tasted like feet. My boyfriend  had the turkey burger which he said was just okay, and the fries were greasy and left a gross feeling in your stomach. Also, they have tables but no servers so you still have to walk up to the bar to order everything. And yes it's a gaming bar, but they don't have any open bar seats that aren't at a machine, so if you don't want to play or have a machine in your face, you have to keep getting up to go the bar every time you need something. Overall experience wasn't pleasant and we won't be returning. If the hours are right, go to the old school brewery on desert inn and Durango, better food, better service, better prices."}
{"text":"Excellent staff and a great dive.   We love all the bartenders that we've met and friended!!
Head chef Daphne is amazing and feeds you what you want and never been disappointed!! Thank you Daphne and thank you Brewske's for our new favorite watering hole after our move!!!"}
{"text":"This place is our neighborhood bar and we come here on a regular. Tonight was one of the worst nights we had. Our food came out wrong. We didn't complain and after spending 200$ in the machine. We asked for our bill and honestly after spending that much money we usually don't have a bill. But instead we had to pay for our food. But \"they comped the drinks\" all we had was three beers and one shot. Im just kind of baffled by the fact that we had a bill or that we had to pay for both plates of food. Most bars around us just comp everything after playing over $100. This place is so easy for us to come to but we probably will never be back. Unsatisfied customer"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with the service here. My friends were getting married and decided to have a combined bachelor/bachelorette party at Desert Breeze Park and after wanted to grab drinks at a close bar. This is the place they decided on. I really like the convenience. It is right across the street. The bar itself is cool. It has an old feel to it. Reminds me of Cheers but darker. Idk. My friends spoke to the manager and let them know we would be bringing a big group at such and such time. They said they would schedule accordingly and that it was okay. We got the the bar maybe around 4 and and there was only 1 or 2 people in there aside from the ONE bartender. We sat down at the bar and let her know we were with the big group and she just didn't seem too happy. We found out who ever was supposed to come in called out and she was on her own. Well that is great. We stayed and continued to order. They had a special called the PB&J. It's PBR and a shot of Jameson for $7. Great deal right? Too bad they don't carry PBR anymore. You should probably take that off the menu. Oh, while you are at it maybe make a note that happy hour isn't on the weekend. I get it though, it's not your fault someone called out but please don't be rude. We understand it's gonna take some time. We won't rush you. But please don't snap at someone double checking if you got the order right... and then it comes out wrong. I'm happy I ordered first and got all the good stuff. We also tried to play music from the jukebox they have but because the basketball games were on it wasn't turned up and they couldn't change it because they would get in trouble. At this point we were the only ones in the bar... 15 of us paying for food and booze and we don't get to pick what we listen to. Maybe you should call your manager to come down and help you because this is not customer service. After all this she said she was going home and that she needed to close the tab and if it was okay to charge the card while handing me the receipt... YOU ALREADY CHARGED ME?? I was pissed. I had cash and I was going to split it with the people I ate with. Whatever. Yup, close me out it's time to go. I will not return."}
{"text":"Since this place was in my (new) neighborhood & on the recommendation of a friend, I decided to check it out.  It has become my 'Cheers.' The bartenders are friendly. The service is great. I'm glad I finally stopped by. The menu is adequate and tasty. The kitchen is open late too. I was told they are under new management (about the last 2 months). It certainly shows. This is a hidden gem in Spring Valley."}
{"text":"Nice place, the inside is pretty large, a little deceiving from the outside. Several pool tables, towards the west end there's quite a few more secluded tables and the bar reaches around that way too. 

Cool and personable bartender, I think his name was Graham. 

Very smoky in side, I think about every one in there had 3 cigs hanging from their mouths...good if you're a coal miner, bad if you're not.

Seemed like a decent enough place to grab a drink and bullshit with friends, but we didn't try any food so can't review on that...Beer was cold and decently priced. I think I paid $5 for a 24 ounce tall draft."}
{"text":"Started off as a fun replacement bar for our Charger fans but apparently bringing in 50-70 people extra a week who buy food, drink, and some gamble is not enough to add an additional bartender and waitress to expedite service. when GM Eric tells you we are not making enough money for them Charger fans get the hint. New home a lot better and welcoming."}
{"text":"Since the start of the football season this bar claimed to tailor to NY Giant's fans. We went there 2 weeks ago and had a decent time. The bar wasn't really busy and we were able to get a seat at the bar. We went back today and found out the owners don't want to cater to the Giant's fans and they are non-denominational - say's Melissa (bartender). They took the banner down that said \"home of the NY Giant's\". Many patrons, including us, said we will not be going back as Melissa said she can not guarantee the game/sound will be be on. Pretty rotten to change things up mid season. Thought we found a new place, but we'll have to keep looking.

On a good note, they have $1 sliders and $.50 cent wings during the game. The sliders are tasty!"}
{"text":"If you want to feel right at home with a great bar come here! Service is amazing. Gina and Nick are amazing and are beyond on top of their jobs. If you wait more than a minute for a drink when you walk in the door.....that's rare! Great atmosphere, free pool, and great food!"}
{"text":"Great power hour on Saturday!!! They have Guinness on draft. Yessssss! The bartender even put the sound on for the game we are watching!!! Great neighborhood bar!!!"}
{"text":"Nice locals bar to go for a drink or watch a game. The burgers here are very good, above average for bar food. Plenty of machines also for video poker."}
{"text":"Although we had front row seats for a crash this evening, this place is awesome. we were new here today and they welcomed us into the fold as if we were Norm from Cheers. I love Vegas for this reason and this bar is a nice little place to go where everyone will at some point know your name and then buy you shots of Jameson in appreciation :-) a nice place to drop the BF off as I get my lashes done and its a win-win for both!"}
{"text":"Spot is cool...some hip hop/RnB playing...good prices on drinks...haven't ordered any food but cool atmosphere...some pool tables..good place to kick it at...James is a good bartender"}
{"text":"Finally found a local spot where the bartender's not a d*ck and they have some more options than just heavy bar food. Got the chicken and avocado salad and it's not gourmet or anything but way better than most dives. And they have Jameson on happy hour, my favorite! :)"}
{"text":"Machines were good! Bartender was very attentive and drink was never empty. Ordered mac abd cheese casserole and hangover burger to go. We will see"}
{"text":"For bars this is good as it gets. Friendly bartenders. The pool tables are free. I didn't order the chicken nachos but it looked huge. The bartenders recommend stuff you never had before like Bananas Foster shot's. And the drinks are strong at nicely priced. The top shelf is stocked as well. And sports and news are on the TV. Its in the same lot as tcs rib crib. Eat ribs and then get a few beers. This will be my bar from now on."}
{"text":"It's easy to understand why this place is empty at 8pm on a Friday night.  $6 Beers ????
Sorry, but it's just a neighborhood bar......not Bellagio.   We're new in town.....tried it and will go elsewhere in the future.

Udate to the review......I left my coat on the barstool when we left.  When I went back the next day to get it, they didn't have it.  That's a reflection on either the staff or the clientelle.....you be the judge."}
{"text":"Very tasty food cold beer nice place I would recommend to go there good service also  happened to like the burger"}
