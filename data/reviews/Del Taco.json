{"text":"This Del Taco is just sad. We have been here twice using the drive thru and they have failed to give us hot sauce. Come on get your stuff together. I was gonna give you no stars."}
{"text":"When i used to get off at midnight I'd go here. almost every time the tacos were messed up and thrown together, order messed up multiple times."}
{"text":"Just got three tacos.  Ordered no cheese as I'm allergic and they confirmed no cheese then the asshole making to food put cheese lots an lots of cheese on the two on the bottom.  I checked to one on top before leaving.  He did it to be an asshole.  Great way to loose a regular customer......."}
{"text":"I like Del Taco better than Taco Bell. I also like their selection better but I don't like the fries or burgers. They should stick to the tacos and burritos They have many tacos to choose from I like the Macho Taco and Del Carbon."}
{"text":"If you want good Del Taco - do NOT go to this unit! Their 1/2 pound burritos are the size of the $.69 cent burritos - they consistantly range from 5 to 6 ounces instead of 8. Which means for every two burritos you buy, they save the cost of one! They skimp on cheese, red/green sauce, sour cream, tomatos, beans and meat. The hard tacos are always broken in half so its impossible to eat, and they are all lettuce with a dab of meat and a few strands of cheese. Since the Hollywoood Video/GameCrazy next door closed they are really cutting corners including using the .69 cent tortillas on the .99 cent burritos. CiCi Pizza is opening where the GC/HWV was...it does not bode well for this unit. If you want GOOD Del Taco...stay away from this unit...go to Bruce & E. Charleston - THEY make Del Taco the way it SHOULD be!"}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru to get some food. Apparently the manager thought it was a brilliant idea to take an unusually large order through the drive thru and inconvenience the rest of us that were waiting in the neighborhood of 15 plus minutes in line behind this genius or geniuses that placed said order in the drive thru!! This was totally ridiculous and they had a delivery at the same time so there was a semi blocking the parking lot as well!! WTH I finally backed out of the drive thru and left in disappointment!! You geniuses have lost my business for good! I'll never come back and will tell everyone i know to go elsewhere as well!! That was the dumbest most inconsiderate experience I've ever had in my life!! Its a drive thru to expedite service not hinder it!! You should be ashamed of yourselves!! Never again will you treat me badly! I hope you close your doors!! Btw time was 9:20pm  on sat 4-19-14  TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Order was taken by a girl with braces (sorry never got a receipt to know her name). Also can't do the deal taco survey cause of no receipt. I was never offer any sauce and she was nice but short cause she wanted to talk to her friend."}
{"text":"Only one in drive thru after 2am and a simple number 1, yet I get home and voila a turkey burrito !!  maybe that's a number 1 after all hahahahha 

I get del taco once in a blue moon due to messing up orders in the past  and lo and behold , same same.

No mas del taco !!"}
{"text":"U like taco bell . And never ate at Del Taco. This location is clean . The staff were nice.Food was good as well."}
{"text":"The food and service here is acceptable. Nothing to write home about but for the prices what could you expect? It's nice to order food here every now and then."}
{"text":"I LOVE deltaco but this location is SO SLOW its ridiculous and then food is not even that great ,they need a new manager asap I have tried 3 different times thinking maybe its time of day ,crew any excuse but now I'm done its just crap all together."}
{"text":"Fast service and good, hot food.  The taco shells were fresh and crisp.

The manager running this location at Serene is doing a great job. One suggestion though, you may want to wipe the tables in the lobby a little more often during lunch."}
{"text":"There is a young man here who helped me two nights in a row. I cannot see very well and he was very helpful and sweet while I basically asked him to read the menu to me. Wish I'd gotten his name. Thanks, you are a gem."}
{"text":"I am so upset this is the third time ive gone to this del taco,  ordered a bean cheese deluxe burrito and barely get any lettuce,  barely any tomatoes,  this time zero tomatoes,  and now put in random french fries gross... I even said id pay extra for the lettuce n tomato n sour cream and still i get a fail compared to the one i got when the big boss or owner was there after the wind storm"}
{"text":"Such a joke, I bought food from them through their drive-thru and was eating it in the parking lot while I played pokemon go since they have a pokestop there next thing I know I am being threatened with the police because I am playing pokemon go while eating the food I just bought from them.. Newsflash instead of pushing us away should give us discounts to drive up your sales"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Especially the value chicken tacos and the 1/2 lb. been and cheese green chili burro.  For $4.00 I can get all 3.  Beans are made from scratch.  I can't think of any other fast food place that makes food from scratch, can you?"}
{"text":"Don't bother. . . 
Don't really eat fast food but when I do its because I want it, fast.  Not here.  Second time here, last time here.  The drive thru is like a sit down dinner... it takes FOREVER.  Make sure you have plenty of gas in your car."}
{"text":"That one employee whose a hefty middle aged bitter white woman with six pounds of eyeliner on makes me feel like my food is as dirty as her and her attitude."}
{"text":"This place is always good for a quick, cheap meal. I love their iced coffee here. Pretty tasty and it's only a buck! Staff is friendly and when the lunch rush comes in, they step it up to get everyone in and out fast."}
{"text":"My guy and I both like del taco. My guy and I also disagree about damn near everything but if there's one thing we both agree on is the guy that works drive thru every night is a complete moron. Since we've gone there we have gotten the wrong bag twice. Almost every visit where missing something it's gotten to the point where we just know to sit and wait at the window because guessssssssseeeeee what yer probably missing things you've paid for which is the main reason why I'm writing this review if you go there check yer food no joke one day there was a piece of like a purple/blue glove in my salad not happy about it but it was at the bottom of my salad and I pretty much ate the whole thing did it stop me from going there of course not del taco is cheap and I like my late night snack once a week but come on it's not hard to make sure what's on the screen is in the bag if it is that hard maybe you should try a new job like male modeling"}
{"text":"Of all the places in the world to order french fries... Del Taco?  Yes!  Do it.  Crinkle cut fries, perfectly salted, and served in a large drink cup.  It's so ingenious!  I have come to Del Taco just for fries on an occasion or two.  In fact, the only other thing I've tried is the $0.39 taco which is also very good, but I like the fries so much that I order the large and that's my whole meal."}
{"text":"Extremely horrible service each time I come here . 
Naming it my last time going . 
I waited in the drive thru for 25 minutes and there was only one car ahead of me. It wasnt even busy . That's the longest I've waited in any drive thru no matter how busy it is. Smh"}
{"text":"6 regular tacos for $4.18!!! What a deal and so good too. Oh and I forgot to add the Medium drink, so 6 regular tacos and a drink for under $5.00 can't beat that deal!!!"}
{"text":"When ordering a burrito or some tacos, I always order a soft drink to wash it down and refresh. Sadly I will not becoming back to this location due to their soft drinks having and nasty unfiltered taste. I asked for a refund for my drink and was given one but I was very unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru during my 30 minute lunch break by the time I got to my work ready to eat my coworker and I did not receive silverware for our chicken bowls we ordered. Did not have time to go back until after work and asked for a refund which the manager on duty told me she does not do refunds....worst ever.  would rate 0 if it was an option"}
{"text":"Del Taco is way better than Taco Bell and the prices are way cheaper! The fried shrimp taco is unhealthy fried food heaven. The service is always fast and the employees are funny! Did I mention the prices are way cheap?"}
{"text":"The food was average quality for the price, about what I was expecting. The staff was super busy, but they were trying very hard to keep up. There were two mistakes in my large order, but as soon as I walked up to the counter, the girl helping me knew what had happened. We'll probably go back when we're looking for a quick cheap meal, but not too often."}
{"text":"Out of fries. Out of crunchy tacos. Out of fish. Out of sweetner. Out of tea. Out of EVERYTHING! hey stoners, stop coming to work hi and do your job. You're not out of shit, you're just too lazy to make it."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money or time. Had worst experience here. My order was wrong twice after waiting almost a half hour for two tacos. Then when letting manager know, he gave me attitude. I don't pay to have someone insult my intelligence and doubt anyone else would. I suggest going to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I find this location provides a little better portion than other locations.  I like the fact that when I get a macho burrito that it is a full pound.  Staff if nice.  I usually go before lunch rush."}
{"text":"If your on the run and need a super quick bite and feel like Mexican fare the chicken soft tacos are a great choice.  The churro dessert is also a great quick sweet treat and for a dollar a piece, grab 2 of them."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Don't go here because you'll give them a $20 and they'll say you gave them a $10 and a 7 dollar salad becomes a $17 dollar salad. I know nobody really reads these but if anyone does, choose another location, because these employees provide less than ideal service and treat you like you're the idiot. Maybe I am for coming to this location. Employees look dirty and are very rude to top it off. Very unsatisfied and I won't be coming back here. Worst $20 I've ever spent."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite if your in the mood for Mexican.  However if you have time to sit and eat, you are much better served driving 2 miles west and dining at Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"I'll never eat here again. The \"steak\" doesn't taste like real meat, and the potato in the steak and potato burrito is french fries thrown in the burrito. Very lazy and uninspiring concoction."}
{"text":"I came in here recently and my order taker made me wait so he could complete a phone call. Then after his call he didn't change his gloves. The thing that makes me the most mad is my review of my poor customer service was flagged and deleted. this place is garbage."}
{"text":"Very very bad service.. Went there twice for shrimp tacos after midnight and they said they couldn't sell them at the time cuz they were \"CLEANING\" the frier..went back after a half hour like the lady told me and still.cleanjng . Bad experience .. Very lazy workers. Wouldn't go there again"}
{"text":"Fast & cheap!  Never puny tacos at the 35th ave/Greenway location ;)  Nice people working there, and they never mess up my order even tho I order about 15-20 tacos at a time, varying in cheese, no cheese, & cabbage added, etc."}
{"text":"Found a lizard head in my salad & when I took the food back I asked to speak to the manager he was very polite but when he saw that I was upset he became rude and raised his voice at me!"}
{"text":"Idk who made my burrito but it was straight fire. The chicken is usually all at the bottom of the burrito so I have to eat half of the burrito with no meat. BUT TODAYYYYYY! The chicken was evenly distributed so every bite was just heavenly."}
{"text":"Did drive thru. Had a coupon for Buy one chicken burrito get one free. I ordered two chicken burrito and gave her my coupon and assumed that it would be $3.19 for the two chicken burritos. She said you already got the special 2 for $5 so I can't use your coupon. Ok, my coupon would be cheaper. Why are you forcing me to pay for the  special price when my coupon is cheaper. At the end, I reconfirmed with her if all my food was in the bag. She said yes. Came home, opened the bag, three tacos were not there that I already paid for. Also, everything was cold. Not hot, not even warm but cold. Not edible. That's why I drove back and went inside to talk to a manager. He was discourteous. When I told him there's items missing, he said what do you want me to do. I said take a look at the food because it's all cold. He said I don't have time for this. I can give you a refund. I took the refund and drove down the street to Taco Bell. Wasted my time. Don't know how they can stay in business with that kind of service, that kind of food quality, and that kind of manager to be in charge of their already mess."}
{"text":"I love Del taco. the night guy working is the worst human I've ever seen at this location. he is the rudest person and I am a please and thank you could a person. he shouldn't work there..."}
{"text":"I eat here way too often. 24 hour tacos with avocado got me. The manager man is super cool too."}
{"text":"If their was negative stars they'd get them! Been to many different del tacos here in phoenix. So far been to this specific location about 3 times and gotten horrible service! Also All 3 times my order has been wrong and taste like I get the leftovers ! Never fails."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite right around the corner from home. The food is always fresh and delicious. But more than the food, this place is clean,and the service is phenomenal. I'm so used to getting bad service, and seeing dirty floors, and dirty tables at quick service restaurants, that it is a welcome surprise to always be able to stop by Del Taco for great service, fresh food, in a clean and well maintained restaurant."}
{"text":"It was extremely great food! A really great worker named jovonnie was there who was super kind! Plus he was really cute!(: I will be back the service & food was great & clean!!"}
{"text":"Yes, this is the best fast food restaurant I've been to in a while.  Always clean.  Employees are great.  Orders are accurate.  Food is great.  And service is blazingly fast.  

I went through the drive-thru last night at rush hour and between the menu board order, where the nice girl over the speaker told me my total was $5.52 or something like that, and the window,I pulled out my wallet and got a $5 bill out then dropped my wallet in the car.  I spent the next minute or so feeling around the car to find my wallet but failed.  I got to the window and said that I only had $5 now and please remove an item from my order so I can pay with the $5 bill.  Apparently the manager on duty in the background told the nice girl to let me have the whole order anyway, for $5.  

This place is just awesome and corporate DT needs to know it.  I fill out their surveys and I always give them top scores.  I've been to others, this place is really great."}
{"text":"This place suck balls they can't get orders right and they take forever crappy food I think they may even be putting things in it"}
{"text":"Worst Del Taco ever. It shouldn't take 18 minutes and counting when I was the only car in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Terrible, unfriendly service. Seemed like I was inconveniencing her so I walked out.

Revised review; I gave just place another chance. I went in this morning for breakfast and got the usual bad service. Not only that, I was short changed because she said she didn't have the change in the register to give to me. Are you kidding me!! If I'm short one penny, I have to break the bill and walk around with a pocket full of change. The lady behind me heard that and walked out. Then I get my food which was to stay, go to sit down and I can't because every single table in the restaurant was filthy so I ate outside. What kind of operation is this!? who runs this place!?who's the owner!!?? True, honest review this place just sucks!! Never again"}
{"text":"WHITE RICE?  You gotta be kidding me?!   I didn't stop in for Chinese food  I stopped for Mexican food and NO WHERE (else) except Del Taco will you find white rice on the menu.  It's faster, cheaper and lazier to make than to actually add tomato sauce and spices and yes, maybe even cook it with chicken broth instead of cheap h2o.  White rice for Mexican Food.  That's just disgusting even to think of it."}
{"text":"I know this is a new location but every time I go through the drive thru my order is wrong, and one night I finally decided to call and let them know I ask for the manager and he says \" I packed your food, I know it was correct \" OK first of all who speaks to a costumer on the phone this way? And I would not take time out of my day to call and complain so no sir you are wrong.  I didn't get my dressing for my salad and I couldn't eat what I paid for . Your costumer service needs work and you should be double checking all your orders.  I literally will go to the taco bell right down the street every time now because of this experience"}
{"text":"I have been to this location quite a few times. Every time I go They get my order wrong, the food is cold. and the customer service sucks. Plus I ordered extra chipotle sauce and they wanted to charge me 45 cents for a cup of it, I know for a fact that most Del tacos around the Las Vegas Valley do not charge for that and all the guy that was working said to me was \"sorry\"  I will never go back to this Del Taco again."}
{"text":"Stay away!!!

Last night my husband and I ordered del taco. We got the epic burrito and 3 classic tacos. When we got home to eat the food we realized that the sour cream was spoiled. We brought back the food and talked to a lady named Angie who told us she couldn't return the money to come back in the morning and have the morning person do it to tell them we spoke with Angie. Well the morning person wouldn't return the money either. She said there's no proof that we returned the food. We made her call Angie and she didn't pick up. So we left, $14 wasted. It's the principal not the money. We were served rotten food and they refused to give us our money back. 
We won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The restaurant was clean. The food was great for fast food. I wasn't made to feel rushed.  The background music was barely noticeable, which was relaxing and allowed for conversation."}
{"text":"Wanted to start off day with a good meal, dropped by del taco never at breakfast here before. The food was fresh the service amazing. Thanks del taco for making me full and happy and ready to start day."}
{"text":"39 cent tacos special (normally 69 each)... Crunchy shells, mildly spiced ground beef. 

In the Lowe's parking lot. Drive-thru convenience or eat in. 

Cheap, fast, friendly. Sometimes that's what you are after."}
{"text":"Id give them a higher star rate if they would be a little cleaner inside and out, other than that i definitely love the asada fries I always go for them."}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave! It never fails. Every time I go I receive an incorrect order. Food is good. Bring your patience if going through drive-thru when cashier asks to hold on a minute. A minute carries over to 3 just to take an order"}
{"text":"I ordered \"chilli\" cheese fries and only got cheese fries. Cold cheese fries at that. How hard could it possibly be to take and get this simple order correct? Smh"}
{"text":"We usually love this location! However we just have noticed service and employees have been sub par. 
We showed up at 11:15pm when the inside closes at 12 and they told us they were closed and the sign on the door was a mistake. 
Now today we had to go over the order, for only 2 people, 4 times with the girl for it to be correct. We are grateful del taco is a place that does not discriminate due to race, however, the girl honestly could not understand English very well hence getting our order so wrong 4 times."}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos. Orders are always right, which is more than I can say for taco bell!"}
{"text":"I had Del Taco 13 years ago for the first time. I recall having thoroughly enjoyed that fluffy flatbread taco with grilled steak. So, it is a wonder I never made it back, until recently. Thanks to this location, I have delicious crispy chili cheddar fries at hand when the craving hits. Now, don't turn me into a liar, you must consume the fries immediately so they are crispy to the end. Of course, if you let them sit in the carton on your drive home, they will be a soggy disappointment. Oh, Joseph had me take a bite of his bacon double del and it is great, too."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this location and can say they have never disappointed. Fresh and fast, everything I have ordered has been great. With other quick service restaurants available this is a regular of mine and my girlfriends."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed!! Drive -thru was a long line so decided to go in.  Ordered Beer battered fish tacos meal and upgraded to a large meal. Waited for almost half hour. One worker said they are making new fries. So. we waited. Finally, got our order. Drove home. Open my bag and beer battered fish was cold. lime was dried.looks like it was used. and macho fries was not fresh!!! Called them back. Had to drive back to get a fresh new meal. Brought back the old meal and this worker was like \" did u eat half of the fries?\". the fries sank inside the box because it was so loose so it looks like half. Came across with another customer and she mentioned she had got rotten lime from the same store before! Wow! Anyway, got our new meal. Checked it one by one makes sure it was ok. then I heard a worker said \"wow\". Reputation for this store is damaged for me.Just left the store and I will never go back to this store."}
{"text":"I went here earlier today & the machine where you get the stickers was not working properly. My son was going to put 50 cents in it but it was not functioning. I told the Mexican lady at the cash register but she was very angry. She gave me the 50 cents but she gave me angry looks. Here in Phoenix Az I spend money at these places & still get treated badly!!!! I don't know why Del taco hires mean people like her."}
{"text":"Had a problem with the app. The new manager called me personally and took the time to apologize even though it wasn't his fault. Shows ALOT. Good job Jon. Only because you fixed it will I continue faith in del taco."}
{"text":"I like Del Taco, sure it's not good for you and I'm sure food snobs would never eat there but it's a good Mexican fast food joint.  In case you've never been the food is pretty good, it's less gimmicky than Taco Bell and it's generally pretty cheap.

The problem isn't with the food it's the service at this Del Taco. I normally shrug off one or two times of slow service at a fast food joint because I understand in a business like that occasionally stuff comes up maybe they had some people call in.  But it's not just the slowness here it's the fact that nobody in there seems to care.  On more than one occasion I've been the only person in line and been flat out ignored, the kind of ignored were you and employee make awkward eye contact and you can tell they're wishing the back wasn't in full view of the public.  And look I get that maybe it's not your job to ring people up but if I've been there for 8 minutes and you're fiddling with the register at least say hey man they'll be with you in a minute.  

The weird thing is that this is a new Del Taco, how do you have your employees at the point where they don't give a shit this soon after opening."}
{"text":"This is the only del taco I go to. Can't get enough chicken soft  tacos. Even the burger is good if u ask for extra sauce makes a huge difference. The new queso fresco dip they have is amaze balls! Great for dipping the fries"}
{"text":"Cleanest location I've ever seen. Fast service. Everyone here is always smiling! Can't say enough good about this location."}
{"text":"Employees are pretty friendly for the most part but there's a couple of them who need to brush up on their English. The french fries are almost ALWAYS cold and they rarely get an order correct the first time; you have to make sure they repeat the order back to you so you know if they got it and even then, sometimes it's wrong."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite  but not this  particular location I came in to get tacos the cashier was friendly kind of busy working drive thru and Frank counter I walk away to go wash my hands could not getting restroom I have to walk back multiple times to get door unlocked when I finally  get in restroom the toilet was clogged so I came out immediately and told the manager which is what some guy he told me would you like me to do something about that so his customer service sucks I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Del will feed you for dirt cheap and it's much cleaner than eating taco bell, doesn't make you feel sick and regretful hours later haha. We like to hit this up when we need something quick and cheap."}
{"text":"It taste like any other del taco. But at night they are slower than slow. Waited 30 minutes for a burrito and 2 tacos in the drive thru. Either put more employees on the night shift or close earlier. It's called fast food not wait in a drive thru line for half an hour food. If you like del taco order here during the day and eat somewhere else after hours they aren't fast at all."}
{"text":"Beware of the ATM machines located in and around this dumpy food court. Pretty sure the fat lady manager (Hispanic) at this Del Taco location is a apart of a group of people stealing people's ATM cards. She is either tipping someone off or stealing them herself. There are several reasons why I believe this to be the case. I hope LVPD sees this review and arrests these pieces of shit."}
{"text":"So what can you say about a place named Del Taco. For a number of years I have had a very special friend in my life. When he would say he was going to Del Taco I assumed he meant Taco Bell and was saying it backwards.  LOL to my surprise Del Taco does exist. Not in the Midwest but definitely on the west coast. 

So I decided to give this Del Taco place a try. Wow when they say macho they mean it. Not fully understanding I said macho, thinking it was large like any other fast food establishment. Bam what seemed like a pound of fries in a large cup came with my taco. Who knew tacos and fries. Back to the fries though. I am in love. Not only has the food always been hot each time I have come here, the fries continue to live up to the very first ones I experienced. Although they are not made fresh in the establishment like others, they are always flavored just right. They aren't over or under cooked, nor are they greasy. I'm not so impressed with the burgers here, nor the tacos. Guess they are just better made at home. 

I've never been inside the establishment, so I can't speak on the inner cleanliness. I usually just do late night drive thru. The attendant is always kind and respectful. The wait is always less than 3 minutes, a huge plus. 

Three stars do to I don't think I can actually give it more until I experience the inside of the place. 

I'm in love with fries, they don't find fault in our relationship, nor do they check up on me! LOL comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"Gross, this place is gross. It is cheap, but that is obviously for a reason. Some fast food places nearby are even worse, & not even as cheap though, so no surprise they are still in business. What is it about fast food places not serving healthy food, seriously what is so slow about an apple, or banana? Healthy alternatives to what this place serves up may even be more affordable in some cases, organic bananas sell for 69 cents a pound nearby. For those who believe depopulation is necessary, this place is highly recommended for you first."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad but after a 10 minute wait for a burrito it feels like a wasted effort. This is the first time I have actually gotten food at this location because normally when i go the line is long and doesn't ever move. Today i happened to arrive with no line but by the time i left 10+ minutes later the line was at least 5 cars long."}
{"text":"Too much Spanish here. Employees are loud and obnoxious. I sat in my truck, couldn't listen to the constant bla bla any longer."}
{"text":"I order the number two combo which is the combination burrito fries and a coke. The French fries at Del Taco are always good. the combination burrito was very small and bland. the first half of the burrito was all beans and the second half of the burrito was all meat. The place looked fairly clean and the workers seemed nice. I'm here for the food please lets get it right."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years now. I always only go through drive through. Service has been fast and efficient and friendly. The food also is very consistent. I recommend you order a side of nacho cheese sauce to go with your French fries. Also I am a big fan of the del carbon tacos. I also like the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Seems odd to leave a great review for a fast food place, but this Del Taco location deserves it. I used to live near here, but have moved a few miles away - I still drive to this location because I've never had a bad experience here! The food is delicious and hot every time. The staff is *outstandingly* friendly, consistently! They're always happy to answer questions about the menu and make recommendations, too. We'll keep coming back if the staff here keeps being so awesome and the quality of food remains so good. Thanks, Del Taco!!"}
{"text":"Came by this restaurant and boy were my cultural eyes opened.  They had many strange and fascinating items from south of the border.  The first is called a taco. (tah-ko) A curved fried shell with beef, lettuce and cheese.  Next was a burrito. (boo-ree-toe) An unfried, rolled shell with beef, lettuce and cheese.  Then a tostada. (toe-sta-dah) A flat, fried shell with beef, lettuce and cheese.  I can't even describe the fish taco, it blew my mind.  All kidding aside, a clean, good, fast-food restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito from here and the sour cream was literally curddled into a cottage cheese looking substance. I got a couple bites in before I saw it, and I immediately almost vomitted, along with everyone around me that saw it. Never again will I dine there, you don't even get the chance to make a mistake like that again in my book. I did not get sick, thank God, but still, gross."}
{"text":"How do you screw up my order when there is no one in front or behind me in the drive up lane??  Ordered standard beef crunchy taco meal and got a burrito thing. Placed a large order so didn't look thru it before I pulled away but I shouldn't have to. It wasn't busy! Drove past taco bell to get to you. And never received a receipt so I can't go back and complain. Terrible."}
{"text":"This was the most bizarre Del Taco experience I've ever had. I love love love Del Taco, as referenced in previous reviews  . But a single employee ruined what should have been a nice quick lunch for me today.

As I sat down at the other end of the seating area, I immediately heard someone talking very loudly about homeless people. Random. I turned to look and it was an employee, presumably on break, talking across two tables to an elderly customer. I started to eat, and quickly realized this wasn't going to get any better.

The employee talked LOUDLY for the next 20 minutes about how homeless people deserve to be homeless because of their choices, and she doesn't give them money because she has her own family to feed, and how tax payers pay for the homeless.

Everyone's entitled to their opinions, but having a crazy employee yelling across a restaurant was so unprofessional and rude. I ate as quickly as I could and left."}
{"text":"Look, it's Del Taco. Nothing fancy. But they are always friendly and fast. Come here for lunch a lot. Burritos have great whole beans. Better than what you get at Taco Bell. The tacos are delish and full of meat, lettuce and cheese. Crinkle cut fries are surprisingly addictive! Three grades of sauce: mild, del scorcho and del inferno! Don't make the same mistake I did and grab deal inferno thinking its mild (it's the same color as the mild sauce from Taco Bell) mouth was burning for 30 minutes, oops! Price is always right here and they always have interesting new items. And don't forget taco Tuesday's!!"}
{"text":"Not a morning person... on top of that it was very upsetting to get to work, being excited for my 2 chorizo burritos, just to find out I'm eating 2 egg cheese and sauce burritos... I'm not happy and this is not the first time this del taco has ruined my orders. Lol the last time I went for dinner I asked for NO SAUCE on my quesadillas and NO Tomatoes on my Fat tacos ( after I asked no tomatoes, the employee stands to correct me to say that those don't come with tomatoes anyway) get home, sauce on ALL 3 quesadillas and tomatoes on everything. I'm done with this location. Btw there I NO chorizo in the burrito below, just eggs covered in their taco sauce"}
{"text":"Was closed by 10:00 PM people waiting in line but nobody at the register wokers inside but nobody want to work maybe just maybe they want to new job"}
{"text":"Loved that this new location is closer to me but I was giving it a chance because I knew when restaurants first open they have a possibility of still getting organized and efficient. And in this case its nothing different. My server STEVEN got my order wrong and the fries were very salty. When I was in the restaurant industry I knew people who didn't like their customers would break the straw so that way you weren't able to drink from your beverage. And that is what happened with me. I really don't complain much but I have to pass on the knowledge to be able to help correct issues to get proper service and ethical practices."}
{"text":"I've been to del taco a couple of times and had bad service I've finally had a good service from Nicole and they guy cook he even came to ask me did I want my sour cream on my taco or the side I've really enjoyed my experience with them...And very fast and fresh I give those two a thumbs up keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Nice employees and clean restaurant. very tasty mexican food. great prices."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience ever here. Most likely will just drive to the blue diamond one from now on. Talking to me like I'm a child and taking 25 minutes in the drive through line with only 4 cars in front of me. Nice service."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch, they got my order wrong and over charged me. Food is HORRIBLE. Had nachos and the chips were fried in stale oil and taste awful. Ground meat for tacos was so over cooked, tasted like it had been sitting there for hours. Don't waste your money here. The manager was a jerk when I asked for hot sauce. He said it was in the bag. We checked the bag and no hot sauce so I asked again and he gave me attitude and said \"I guess I'll give you more since you didn't look in the bag\" I know del taco is fast food and I should t expect much but this food was horrible. Other locations are so much better."}
{"text":"Authentic fast Anglicanized-mexican looking food. cheap new fish tacos are bizzomb. I love this fast food mexican 100x more than taco-smell."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times since they opened, both in the restaurant and take-out.  Have never had a bad meal (even fast food can be over or under cooked, just ask my son).  Service is always good and they keep the dining area clean.  Having the sauces in the large dispensers is one item I love since you don't have to deal with the little plastic bags and more often, take more than one needs."}
{"text":"I moved here from Connecticut where we don't have a Del Taco and all I can say is I hope i always live near one the rest of my life. It's very inexpensive and it tastes amazing compared to other mexican fast food chains.  Everything is always fresh and delicious.  I fell in love my first bite!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location quite a bit and never had an issue. I went today and they refused to take my Discover card because they don't accept it even though I have never had a problem in the past. AVOID THIS LOCATION IF YOU USE DISCOVER!"}
{"text":"Every time that I've been to this location of del taco it's been filthy. Lettuce/Taco sauce all over the tables, sticky floors, and bad customer service. Terrible!"}
{"text":"OK, I admit it. I'm a big ol' bacon cheeseburger whore. I'll eat a bacon cheeseburger anytime, morning noon or night but my favorite time is breakfast.

I hereby dub the Del Taco Bacon Double Del the \"Prince of Bacon Cheeseburgers\". Why, you ask? 

Well when I was but a slip of a lad my parents took me to Bob's Big Boy for my first restaurant hamburger. Not a McDonalds 15 cent hockey puck from a paper bag, mind you, but a for real, sit in the booth and behave yourself until your food comes, my God look at the size of that thing bacon cheeseburger. I'm not sure, but I have always believed Bob's Big Boy invented the double-decker.

Del Taco has recreated this culinary giant, from the two patties dripping with melted cheese to the shredded lettluce and ripe tomato kissed with raw diced white onion and blessed with thousand island dressing. 

So when's my favorite time to bite into a Del Taco Bacon Double Del? Right after I have swallowed the final bite of my first one. Yum!"}
{"text":"fast and friendly service every time I drive through...!!"}
{"text":"The home is a Taco Bell I'm in Angott shit on the doubletalk over here because the other good prices and a good before with better than them thank you Dunkagle you guys rock"}
{"text":"Better than a lot of other locations! Speedy service! By far better than any other del taco i've been to because they hook it up in the meals not let you go with a skimpy order."}
{"text":"Tacos had almost no meat, I also order fish tacos and the tortillas where not cook and to top things off my fries where cold, soggy and dry. By far the worse del taco I've ever been to. Only putting a Star because I cannot do negative stars."}
{"text":"Yes I know it a fast food place so the food might not deserve 4 stars but this place is really satisfying! It's the only place I can go at 12:00 at night or later and get just made food that isn't just burgers and fries. The workers are always really nice, and that's not easy when working an all-nighter. One person there named Aaron used to always work at night and knew us cause we always dropped by super late. He was a prime example of their good service. My boyfriend and I have gone a bazillion times and they never get the order wrong or leave something out (as often happens at most fast food chains). The churros are one of the better ones you can get outside of Disneyland-cause Disney's are the best! And the shrimp tacos they sometimes offer are delicious. The cheese quesadillas are greasy but irresistible. I just don't iike how messy they are since my bf insist on not ever putting it on a plate..."}
{"text":"One star was docked because the service was very slow. The food was okay and comparable to Taco Bell. They did have fresh avocado which was nice and delicious. I ordered their new chicken avocado bowl and it was decently cooked and seasoned. If I was in a rush, I might try them again but feel there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday Special (3 value tacos for $1.29) doesn't exist for this Del Taco. Sadly."}
{"text":"If you're looking for food in a timely manner go somewhere else. 25 minutes from placing an order until getting food. There was only 1 person in front of me too. Employees like standing around talking vs making food. By the time I got food it was cold. But at least the place is clean since it's new. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This location is disgusting!!! I will never go back to this location stay away if possible !!!! Food is gross!!! And rotten and fries is stale and old I hope this business shuts down!!!!!! Manager only says ok when you bring this to his attention. No I'm sorry or come back so we can fix it nothing!!!!!!!! This dell taco needs a make over or needs to be shut down just GROSS GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One word... booger.  On my strawberry shake there was a booger that got stuck to my finger. Never never again will I ever eat at Del Taco and will try to convince anyone else not to as well.  When I tell someone about the booger it's pretty easy to sway their decision."}

Okay....

So if you're looking to find reviews on fancy restaurants in Mesa, you won't find it here.

I'm kickin' it with mostly guys afterall, and us girls are either:
a) a new mom who's busy tending to her almost 2-wk-old,
b) a nursing student,
c) and me, saving up for an upcoming wedding and trips like these to see all my other friends and families who just had their first babies.

So, what to eat, what to eat during Lent on a Friday??  What will leave us satieted after spending a measly few bucks??  

We go to Del Taco.  Now, you all know I don't like Mexican food but the shrimp tacos were actually decent.  They're battered and fried and loosely stuffed in a small tortilla along with lettuce and cilantro.  Each small taco comes with its own slice of lime.  Add it to the soft taco & combine with the mild sauce, the flavors will offer your mouth their own rendition of a fiesta.  All for around $2 each!!

Ole!!!"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the single worst fast food experience of my life and that includes last week when this exact Del Taco forgot half my order. Thirty minutes in a drive thru is unacceptable; the lack of customer service or any sort of apologetic gesture only cemented the issue as one that will prevent me from ever returning. 

I rarely write bad reviews, up until now I never saw the point. But with multiple reviews just like mine at the top of this page it is clear the management at this del taco do not care about their customers.

I am appalled by the service and would recommend anyone reading to avoid this location at all costs. If zero stars were possible I'd give it."}
{"text":"This Del Taco is only about 5 minutes from where I live that's why we go here. The food is okay, in my opinion nothing special and more 'Americanized' Mexican food. Tables were dirty as well as the bathrooms. Staff was considerate surprisingly with the customers they deal with on a daily basis."}
{"text":"I've never had an experience short of excellent at this Del Taco location.  The night shift drive thru employees are always super friendly and accommodating!  I'm literally always surprised by how good the service is, especially since it's just a fast food restaurant.  I hardly ever write reviews but i just had to for this place.  If I owned a restaurant these would be the employees i would hire.  Thanks again for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"They don't listen, I asked for no pick on anything I ordered, it was on everything I ordered. $15 worth of food isn't necessarily a fast food price. You think you'd get what you asked for."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a couple burritos and had a great experience thanks to Kevin! He made sure we had everything we needed and we will be coming back because of it!"}
{"text":"The younger guy that works the cash register during the day is a douche! I went in yesterday and ordered 2 grilled chicken tacos.  There is a BIG picture of it on the menu right above the counter.  It clearly shows that the taco is prepared in a soft flour tortilla.  When I get to the table and unwrap the taco, I find it is in a hard corn tortilla taco shell.  I take it back up to the counter and state that I ordered the grilled chicken tacos.  He looks at me and says, \"yeah, hard grilled chicken tacos\".  I've been ordering these tacos for years, and have NEVER had one served to me in a hard shell.  I challenged him to show me on the menu where this was even an option.  He arrogantly walked around the counter to face the menu board and stared at it like a complete idiot.  Again I asked him, \"show me where it says grilled chicken tacos come in a hard shell.  The mook walked back around the counter and stood next to the guy who was re-making my tacos...the right way.  Service has really gone downhill at this location.  It used to be really good, but this tool that they have dealing with the public now is not who I'd want representing my business."}
{"text":"How can you criticize a place that dishes out 39 cent tacos? They're pretty good, and if you add some jalapenos it makes a solid, fiery meal for way under 5 bucks. The people always are friendly and pretty quick."}
{"text":"Told the guy chicken chipotle roller and a two classic tacos , the guy tells me chicken soft tacos and i repeat my order, the guy ends up giving me a chicken soft taco with chipotle sauce and a hard chicken taco. The guy was high or something"}
{"text":"Second time here,  both times over 10 minutes just to get a milkshake.  The soda machine had the nozzles off for cleaning. I fully understand the need for cleaning, but turn it off or put a sign up. A customer tried to use it and got sprayed for his troubles. No apology from the supervisor and a bit of attitude. 

Everyone wears gloves, which is good, but they don't seem to change them. The cashier handles money then straight to food with the same gloves.

Gave 2 stars cause the food tastes good lol"}
{"text":"Slowwwwwwww as F! Sat in drive through forever on a slow night 11pm, pulled up to empty drive thru placed order, had one car in front me they sat forever at the window finally got their drinks and then they sat 5 more min they got their food and me and car behind us drove on thru and left, prolly won't come back to this location again unless I want wait forever"}
{"text":"This place is roughly 4mi from my house so it's not convenient, and it is right across the street from 24hr subway so I don't go here often enough when I'm over here for late night food, but I love their cheap tacos and their 99cent churros. Never had a problem as far as customer service goes, the staff is friendly unlike most McDonald's and Jack in the boxes. Would recommend somebody to go here for cheap mexican food, I actually prefer their cheap tacos to Taco Bell's 89cent tacos"}
{"text":"So I went up to the doors like 5 minutes before their posted closing time. Locked. But people still inside eating. Okay no problem. I'll go through the drive thru. No law against closing early. Then a guy inside opens the door for me and gives me a look like \"they're not closed\" and says something i don't remember like \"weird, i dunno blah blah.\" i approach the counter if only to review the menu which i'm not familiar with. A guy behind the counter gives me a look like he wants to kill me. Not in my top 5 looks for service industry workers to give me. I say \"sorry man, someone opened the door, are you closed?\"
 
He nods.

\"should i just go through the drive-thru?\"

He nods.

\"okay cool. I'm just gonna check out the menu, i don't normally eat here.\"

He stands and stares. Then he says \"well, you're already in here, just go ahead and order\"

\"no really it's fine, i'll go through the drive thru, i just need a few minutes to review the menu, it's rather large and contains many appealing items an I'm an indecisive person\" (probably not verbatim)

\"Just order\"

My thoughts-\"dude just stop talking to me and giving me that death stare i want to live and eat tacos and I can't focus with you glaring in anticipanger\" (just made up that word)

So i just say thanks and leave and get in my car to go through the drive thru. The guy gives me a look like I'm an idiot when I was just trying to follow his initial wishes! I get that you want me out of here. I also want to be swift in this transaction, but i'd rather not hold up your drive thru line with my indecision. And there really are A LOT of items on the menu.

I go through the drive thru and i order my food and who's working drive-thru but THAT GUY! Like he just wanted to prove the point that it didn't matter where I ordered from, he still has to deal with me, and if that's the case, WHY DID YOU CARE SO MUCH THAT I ENTERED THE LOBBY?? No need to be mad at me. I see a locked door I turn around and go about my day. You should be mad at THE GUY WHO OPENED THE DOOR. That's the real culprit! Save your murder glances for that guy, scary del taco employee!!

But for real, their tacos are like 50 cents, jat order like ten of those and smother them with hot sauce you got yourself a cheap delicious meal. Way better than taco bell IMO. Five stars. Minus one for murderdude."}
{"text":"Yuk! Couldn't even chew the steak. I love del taco but never have I experience such a disgusting meal. Didn't get past the first bite."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place at all. Health inspectors definitely need to keep an eye out! Also management needs to be careful and pay attention to who they hire. Even tho management them selves are just as grimy. Called and complained tonight he had no interest or care what I had to say. The one who answered the phone his name was Javier and he hung up on me multiple times. Hair was in my girlfriends burrito. Food was cold I have no idea why they had to be so rude... One thing I do have to say is if you don't like your job don't give **** to the customers just quit.!!!!!!! Simple never will go to this place again Tatum and bell now that is service and is clean....."}
{"text":"Of all their menu items, their tacos are the best. But this review is more about the service and food quality.

I come here at least once a week for lunch because it's reasonably close to work. Unlike other Valley area Del Tacos, the service here is impressive. I always use the drive thru and everyone that's helped me has been friendly, articulate, and accurate. 

Other locations, and other fast food places in general, often have mumbly people working the drive thru and screw up your order half the time. And/or you get old food.

But not here. They always do a great job."}
{"text":"Cleans grill at 11 but open 24h. Just close if you're going to make me wait in your long ass drive tru line. For absolutely no food."}
{"text":"We love del taco but this location needs to get it together, we spend a lot of money here we expect our orders to be right. This time it flew out the ballpark with mistakes , so disappointing. My drink was wrong, my burrito had sour cream when I asked for none and no cheese which it had cheese, I'm lactose intolerant so this made it so I had to throw away my burrito. I spent $10 on a burrito just to throw it away. Never coming back and telling everyone I know to never go to this location"}
{"text":"We absolutely love Del Taco, but after moving close to this location and trying them several times, we have sworn them off unless we are close to the one on Val Vista and Warner. The tortillas are consistently dried out and crunchy on the edges, they are assembled half hazard and make a mess, and the service at this location absolutely sucks. Avoid this location at all costs!"}
{"text":"This Del Taco is a joke! I paid $5.00 for two Quesadilla's and both of them had cold cheese in them that was not melted. I went through the drive through so I was stuck with the food. 

This location also charges to use your debit card, which is ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been here they get the order right, and it's generally quick service, dine-in or drive-thru. 
But it's still Del Taco, and that is unforgivable."}
{"text":"I always go to this del taco and everything always taste good except when I go through the drive-through. They always take long or they mess up the order."}
{"text":"My rating is not so much about the restaurant chain. I give this location five stars. Fast, friendly, consistent, and good. I avoid fast food but, when I do have fast food this is the place."}
{"text":"This Del Taco is an absolute wreck! I understand that I am getting what I pay for and considering their tacos are under 50 cents each I am not complaining about the food. The staff on the other hand is a different story. It does not matter whether one works at Del Taco or Boeing....customer service is very important.

Every time I visit this Del Taco it never fails that these people always get my order wrong or do not give me what I asked for. I visited them yesterday for a quick dinner as it had been a long day and they are always fast in the drive-thru. My order was completely wrong and when I specifically asked for a certain sauce three times the manager failed to give it to me. No one ever speaks English and I struggle to understand what they are saying.

When I did call to complain about the service the manager accused me of not telling the truth which in turn I became livid with her. I drove back up there and showed her what she did wrong and she still had an attitude about fixing it! 

I will never go to this Del Taco again and I advise that if one seeks good customer service they avoid this place also. I will drive to the one on Tatum and Bell if I feel the need for some Del Taco!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Messed up my order called to speak to a manager and all he said was ok. No sorry....or please come so we can fix it. Just an ok!!! Never go through the drive thru"}
{"text":"The graveyard workers are clever as **** they put up a cone so no one can go thru the drive thru , guessing so they don't have to do anything.. BUT they leave the sign on that says 24hrs ? lmao lazy much?"}
{"text":"The food is good. For fast food, it gets 3.5 stars at least. Food quality is very good. All the ingredients are recognizable real food, such as lettuce, cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, cilantro, meat, onions. This is very different from Taco Bell. The food tastes good. They have burgers and fries also, which are better than average tasting for fast food.

Service is acceptable, although there are constant annoying upsells - as many as 4 per transaction. The problem is the pricing is getting out of hand. Most items are well over $1, and most tacos, except their smallest ones, are $2. Combo meals, which may be nothing more than 2 tacos or a regular size burrito, fries and a medium drink, are in the $6-$7 range. Del Taco has been increasing their prices every 9 months or so. It's gotten to the point I don't eat here as often because it doesn't feel like I'm getting my money's worth.

If money is no object and you want a better-than-average late-night or fast-food experience, then Del Taco is alright. 

As of the time of this writing, hard shell corn tacos are reliably gluten free. Nothing else is, including the beans or soft corn tortillas."}
{"text":"Hot sauce on the tables finally just like the Barstow del.  No complaints from this location."}
{"text":"The lady took forever to stop texting and realize I was there. Then she proceeded to take my order with a bad attitude like I owed her money or something. Sept 4 2017 10:50am"}
{"text":"New store, with horrible service! 

Staff is not trained making for long waits for food. Sometimes  drive thru is 10-15 waiting cars, and some drivers park and walk inside to see why the delay. We have gone there a few times because it is close by, hoping it would get better - not so far. Long waits, staff always asking manager how to do things like gift cards or coupons or even how to make a certain food item. 

Last visit there we had some Del Taco gift cards to use, they would scan them and say they were empty of value. So we unwrapped a NEW unused gift card and same thing. When manager finally bothered to come help, she said computer not accepting gift cards, voided our order, and basically said 'too bad, so sad, go away'. A fine way to treat senior citizen customers.

By the way, calls to Del Taco headquarters at 800-852-7204 have not been responded too - this store is a DISASTER."}
{"text":"This Del Taco is dope. Get them Tacos on that Deal Day. Hella tight. Open 24 hours in the drive thru. Awesome nice staff."}
{"text":"This is the WORSE AND I MEAN THE ABSOLUTE WORSE DEL TACO IN NEVADA. THEY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN. The late night shift has to be ran by circus monkeys I'm convinced. They give you your of old food on top of NEVER being in uniform. I bet the reason why they don't wear their name tag at nite is for this exact reason. My 4 and 5 year old son could make me a better burrito n taco then these local jokers. Someone go shut this shit hole DOWN!"}
{"text":"We came at 10pm and the workers were letting their friends into the restaurant, but when we tried to go through the drive through they told us they were closed and they had no cooks available, despite it being a 24 hour drive through and refused us... weird?"}
{"text":"The food at del taco has always been mediocre at best. The only reason I chose to have some del taco. Is because my pregnant wife wanted some chicken soft tacos. This is by far the worst place to use the drive through. We spent 25 minutes trying to order and then another 7 1/2 minutes at the food window waiting to get our food. We ordered 6 chicken soft tacos. Needless to say I will probably never go back. The manager at this location should be fired. He clearly has no managerial skills. There is no reason the drive though should take this long. The employees should also look for jobs they are better qualified to do, since fast food is clearly not for them. I can't believe these employees want $15 an hour. If I could give this review negative stars I would."}
{"text":"Veggie burrito was great! Really appreciate that they make the beans vegetarian. Very reasonable and lots of other folks must like it too as the drive thru is always busy."}
{"text":"What happened to the Macho Fries in the GIANT soda cup?!?!?!
I ordered Macho Fries and I got like a McD's \"Large\" and they were cold."}
{"text":"Cheap tacos / burritos / Mexican / burgers / breakfast and daaaamn good.  And so cheap!  You can get roughly 6 tacos for $3 plus change."}
{"text":"After waiting 21 minutes in line, Jessica, the shift manager, tried to collect money from me twice and gave me the wrong order twice. When I got impatient she told me to wait. I told her saying sorry would have done much more good than her closing the window on me and yelling for me to wait through a closed window. As I drove off I heard her yell at me not to come back. Jessica. I will follow your rude order. If the owner of this Del Taco read this, I have been to your restaurant over 100 times over the last 6 years. It's sad one person can do so much damage to your business I am sure you worked very hard for this restaurant. I will tell everyone I know to no longer patronize your restaurant while she works there."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I regret it. The food is not very good obviously, but it is super cheap. Typically I'd prefer taco bell, but the taco bell on Waddell and Litchfield always sucks, so if I'm in the mood for bad,cheap fast food tacos I go here."}
{"text":"Casual place to get good and actually pretty decent tacos and burritos. Price savings vs. the bell is great"}
{"text":"Always clean and places to sit. Lots to choose from to eat. Normal fast food prices. Staff are efficient. Great place to eat at night, and they've got a 24 hour drive-thru. I always get their chili cheese fries. So much to choose from. They've also got American food available."}
{"text":"Have always been a big fan of Del Taco, but this location was not what I was used too.  The service was bad and the food was just ok.  Good for a quick bite, but not much more.  Why did they get rid of the Macho Taco?  Was the best item on the menu, even if they will make you a deluxe taco they claim is the same thing.  Just OK."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I want to make it clear that this review is specifically for the street tacos.  I've had authentic street tacos when I lived in Mexico and I have to say that I'm impressed.  These are very good.  Throw some spice on them."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever received. Very rude. You know there's a problem when the cashier argues with you about your order. \"You're clairvoyant and know what I'm hungry for?\" I argued with the drive-thru employee for 10 minutes about what I wanted and he pretended to go to the back and change my order, come to find out when I got home he changed nothing on the order. I drove back to the store and the new woman working the drive-thru tried to tell me she took my order and didn't make a mistake. Instead of wasting anymore time arguing, I asked for a refund and left.  Definitely don't plan on returning!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Del Taco in general, and more specifically, this location. I come here often - and have done so of a long time.  O have nothing but good things to say - In my opinion, it's one of the two best Del Taco stores in Vegas.  The food is always superior to the other locations, and the staff is always friendly and professional.... even at 2 am!"}
{"text":"Drive thru open until 1am but we (and the line of cars behind us) watched the workers leave at 12:15am. The workers didn't even have the audacity to let us know they were closed."}
{"text":"Decent fast food style tacos/burritos at a pretty good price.  Staff was friendly, but they need to do something about the wait in the drive-thru.  Been the other Del Tacos around town and this one seems to be the slowest out of them all.  Always a wait no matter what time you go."}
{"text":"Update: I went back today. The first \"manager\" I spoke to was not very good at her job. She would rather lose a customer over a $3.25 issue than make me happy by making the situation right, siting \"store policy\". She then pointed at another employee stating that \"he is the morning manager\" in an attempt to deflect blame somehow.

HOWEVER, the young man who was designated as the problem by the original \"manager\" MADE THINGS RIGHT. He replaced the inadequate items, apologized, threw in a drink for good measure and then explained that if there was ever another problem to call him and he would be more than happy to correct any issues. THIS IS A GOOD MANAGER! Siting \"store policy\" and attempting to deflect blame is rookie bullshit. ANY owner, regional manger, store manager or shift manager worth their title will tell you to \"do what you can to make things right\". This young man will go far, the other \"manager\" will probably not."}
{"text":"Spanks tbell all day. Their hot sauce is actually hot and ya can't beat the prices ;)"}
{"text":"Love the fast food joint. Went there at 3 in the morning with all the drunks at the food court. Cashier had so much patience and the food was hot n great even at 3 AM. I love Del Taco."}
{"text":"I've actually worked here and it's horrible they don't wash the dishes all the way the way they clean the kitchen is horrible I really hate that people eat here"}
{"text":"It's fast food, they could spend some more time cleaning up the place.  Kids area wasn't clean and needs fresh air or hosed down.  Kids complained it smelled and that is pretty unusual even for then.
Food was so so, it's a meal I didn't have to make at home."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I asked for extra sauce on my burrito and got none. I also ordered cheese fries. When I told her I wanted more cheese she took it and basically made cheese soup of my fries. I'll never be back !"}
{"text":"Yuck, foreign matter in my drink cup!!!  Tried to get a good photo but lost some of the stuff emptying the ice out."}
{"text":"This del taco was the worst. My order wasn't close to being correct, and every time I ask for e yes sauce there is none. Annoying. Two of my orders, one being today has been incorrect. You guys are fast food... If you can't get my order right then I'm not sure what to tell you. Sad. I'm only rating this two stars because it's deal taco, and it's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Always pretty decent service. It's right next door to a car wash so its hard to hear the person on the drive-through intercom. Food is ok but I don't think it can be described as delicious."}
{"text":"You know its your guilty pleasure! It a fast food joint!! Its not Bobby Flay behind the grill,  its a kid working for minimum wage. Give em' a little slack.  Always check your order before you pull away from the window and life is all good."}
{"text":"Those beef tacos gave me and my friend food poisoning. It was coming out both ends. Not good at all! Went in and let them know and they said they couldn't substantiate it with no more complaints. Be careful people! I love Del Taco but just be careful....."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is the food always comes out hot and fresh. Service can be slow, but the crinkle fries are worth the wait. I like this place over taco Bell because sometimes u just want fries with that taco or burrito!"}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and it's Sunday heading home after a great weekend and some friends and I decide to stop at del taco and Mabel was attending us in the drive through. I had the worst experience of my life first off she got mad because we needed two separate orders also she was rolling her eyes the entire time literally even when other people behind us were ordering. I had to ask for salsa, napkins, and forks. Alsooo she forgot to give us our one drink we ordered, sometimes we all have those days but I know her service was so unacceptable as a manger I wouldn't stand for it. I love del taco and hope the next one I go to has better service. Btw food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband decided to go to this location yesterday since we were around the area.  This location has what I call \"Surprise chicken tacos\". I call them like this since it will be a surprise if you find the chicken same with spicy grilled chicken burrito that had mainly rice and beans. We will never go back!"}
{"text":"I wanted the epic chorizo breakfast burrito. The time was 12:30am. The guy says, let me know when ur ready to order. I says, Can I get the epic chorizo burrito?  Then I was told they didn't have breakfast and it would take a long time to make it.  The menu says BREAKFAST 11PM TO 11AM. Sounds like THEY were the ones who weren't ready. So I ordered a different combo and used a $1 off coupon. I pay and did not receive a receipt. It didn't seem like my coupon was even added. I get my food. Leave the window and see that it's the wrong order. Great! So then I have to pull in, get down and see the look on this boneheads face. I tell him the orders wrong and he didn't give me a receipt. They make my correct order and still I get no receipt. So stupid. This fool obviously doesn't know how to listen. Another time I ordered a burrito that was suppose to come with guac. Well guess what? I got home, start to eat it and there's no guac! The best experience tho was the guy that was taking orders in the drive thru months ago. He was talking to everyone as if he wanted to fight them as they ordered. Soooooo cholo and soooo unprofessional. It was shocking. Really. I wish I could have recorded it. I srsly thought it was a joke. Whatever man, I knew I should have went to Tacos El Gordo!!"}
{"text":"The Nick Cage -esque dude workin the drive thru knows how to own it!!! Top notch service, Best Del Taco in Town!!!"}
{"text":"I am a super fan of Del Taco! This is the cheapest, yummiest place any time of day! Whenever my friend and I go traveling this is the place we miss the most. In Europe they dont have Mexican food (well they do kinda but for some reason there is no spice and it is all made of kidney beans and corn... yuck!) and the first thing we do when we get home is head to Del Taco for the comfort of their yummy, cheesy  Half Pound Bean and Cheese Burrito with Green Sauce for $.99 and the Chicken Spicy Jack Quesadilla for like $2.79 or something. When I went to visit friends on the other side of the country recently, they were talking about what they missed from back home and inevitably it was Mexican food... specifically Del Taco. I almost cried when I found out that Del Taco isnt national. I think I am addicted to the stuff because I just cant do without it. The best thing is that they are open like 24 hours a day. They have hot cinnamony Churros for $.99 too! If you are doing something like Weight Watchers too they have a regular Bean & Cheese Burrito that is like 6 point or something I think. I read it somewhere but you can check it out.

Even so If I die from a Del Taco heart attack I will die happy!

Hey one more thing DEL TACO EMPLOYEES PLEASE BE CONSISTANT! The portions and flavors lately have been inconsistant. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best del taco I've ever been to!!
The manager is great. He has been doing a great job. Just in the 20 minutes I was there, I've seen him pick up dirty trays from the lobby. I've seen him do drive through, wrap the burritos, wipe down counters, and treat the entire staff with respect and a smile!! It's great to see this in a fast food place.
He even very politely and respectfully asked a homeless man to leave, but gave him a water on the way out. 
Great management = great employees and a great experience"}
{"text":"While eating a soft chicken taco I bit down on what appeared to be a chicken bone in a very hard piece of grissle. The result was upper and lower gum irritation and pain in both my right rear upper and lower teeth. Bad experience! Check out foreign objects that may be lurking in your food."}
{"text":"The last time I came here and got a breakfast, it almost killed me.
 
I shit you not, I got food poisoning so bad I had to go the doctor and  
spend a couple grand before the ordeal was through.
 
I know you roll the dice anytime you eat fast food, but save your  
broke ass a couple grand and go to the burger king next door."}
{"text":"Decided to try Del Taco and we were very disappointed. My two tacos maybe weighed 2 or 3 ounces. They was barely any lettuce and the lettuce was the most of what they put in the taco. I would have had to order 4 of the meals to match any 1 meal at other fast food places. When letuce which has NO nutritional value is the main ingredient in your lunch you had better find another fast food place to eat at."}
{"text":"We had a party of 5...3 adults two small kids . 1st thing we walked into a very wet floor with no caution sigh. I asked from the entrance if the dinning room was still open and they looked confused why I'd ask. We were only ones in line and there was a couple who had already been served. It took us 20 mins, their excuse was they needed to make Fries. Half of our meal had been sitting there getting soggy. When I was waiting I noticed a female in the back barley starting the kids meal quesadilla . She had no uniform, and kept pulling up her jeans to avoid exploding her mid and lower body. I notice her pull so.thin off the quesadilla machine and she looked grossed out and tossed whatever it was, and she turned and quickly turned again after she saw me watching her .Both females working didn't properly tie their hair. One had beautiful hair past her hips just flying aroundm. The other had her untrammedd curls in the way. Then they had to ask me how many kids meals did I order .  Just One customer came in and got his order with fries as we were still waiting. When we finally got our entire meal because they chose to let it sit it was soggy and unappetizing. Then about 5 feet away from our table was roaches . Thank goodness the 2 lil ones didn't want to eat. Us 3 adults didn't finish our meals either. It was a very slow and dirty del taco. This was 2nd time I went in, 1st time took me 30 mins to get 2 tacos and fries on a Wednesday after 9pm. Never again in this location."}
{"text":"Better and cheaper than Taco Bell.  Regular tacos are only .39!  Taco Bell's are over a buck.  Plus, it tastes about the same at Taco Bell.  My kids love the nachos, which are much bigger than TBells."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get tacos. We don't have Del Taco in Pennsylvania where I'm from, and it's much better than Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place - made me kinda sick after I ate here.  If you want mexican, this place just doesn't come close to good 'ol Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Taco Bell's line was really long so I decided to give Del Taco a try.  7 hours later (3:30 am) I woke up feeling clammy and sick."}

{"text":"Some places should not sell economical steak.  This should be one of them.  My teeth are strong, but I wish them to be able to chew my food better.  I go here way more than I should, I seem to have a lot of shame, kind of feel like I should take a shower afterwards.  I have from time to time gotten ill from eating this food, I am sure it is me."}

{"text":"Food wasn't bad! Unfortunately, the service was.  Literally stood there and waited to place my order  while the \"shift leader\" organized his coupons and some other papers...completely unaware I was standing there. Unacceptable!  At least look up and acknowledge that I was standing there. .."}
{"text":"After a long day of work, I looked forward to a burger and taco's to end my day. Unfortunately once I got home I saw the meat wasn't even in my hamburger. Taco's were decent thankfully."}
{"text":"Saw a Del Taco employee here try to fight a customer. The customer had a toddler with her. The employee had to be held back by another employee and pushed to the back.  The employee threw food at the customer. Had sign that said cash only. Afternoon on 12/30"}
{"text":"Why when I order food I am always amazed how cheap it is. Funny drive through people, yummy franchise tacos, and chocolate milkshakes con tacos who would have thunk it!"}
{"text":"It is our \"go to\" place for fast food tacos and burritos when in Las Vegas. They tend to over cook the steak, but overall the food is good. I had the grilled chicken and avocado burrito and it was awesome...."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite thing was getting their large fries served in one of their large drink cups. I stopped eating here for a year and came back to large fries served in a regular bag now. I regret not taking more advantage of it while it was still around."}
{"text":"Del Taco fans stay away from this location. Fries were cold and way over done and when I asked for fresh ones the server looked at me as if I had just asked her to cut off her own arm. I also had the del beef burritos and the meat mix must have been left over from the AM shift. It was tasteless and room temperature at best. I tossed  it all in the trash. I like Del Taco I remember it from it's Naugles days. But I'll never eat at this one again."}
{"text":"My 8 year old daughter and I were eating in there dinning room and all we heard were the staff using foul language. I later found out that it was coming from the female manager and her boyfriend. The Manager would not give us the customers the time for saying she's sorry. Do not take your children here."}
{"text":"We need a zero star rating here! Went through the drive thru, repeated the order. Wasn't what was in the bag. Fixed order then found that the meal I mucho sized only had the fry box half full and flat soda. Thanks for the salad tacos guys. Never again!"}
{"text":"I havent had any complaints about this place for their tacos but the cheese quesadilla tasted like a grilled cheese. It's much better at taco bell or Moe's Southwestern. Even Applebee's has a better quesadilla. But what is crazy is that my husband was served an avocado that was disgustingly not quality-it had black spots all over it. Come on now, how you going to serve that?? He went back up to the counter and asked for FRESH avocado. Disappointing that the manager wasn't checking and that the employee thought this was OK to serve."}
{"text":"If you are paying with cash, make sure you are getting the correct amount back. The lady at the drive thru tried giving me just my change and keeping the two dollars. When asked about it she didn't even open the register, she just gave me a snarky attitude and handed the two dollars back. I know it was only two dollars but makes me think, who else is she pulling that with but getting away with it? Just be careful.."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst location I have ever been to. I'm a huge fan of del taco and was so excited when this went up by my house but I would honestly rather drive farther down the street for a better quality one. Everyone here seems to be highly inexperienced, rude, slow, and half the time that I've ordered from here I have ended up taking two bites and throwing the rest out because it was so disgusting. They need to start over with a new staff that has some fast food experience."}
{"text":"It was okay. Not being from the area, it was something I had to try. Reminded me of taco bell. I do like that you can get tacos with fries. I got an original chicken burrito, it was decent. The best were the $1 Verde nachos! Yum! Cheap and good. A+ for those nachos!"}
{"text":"Del Taco is the best fake mexican food. And this location nails it!! Even down to the free extra limes and the secret menu.. Ask for Go Bold on any item and they add fries and secret sauce.. WIN.. Not as good as the company stores in Barstow CA but pretty decent for a franchise."}
{"text":"OMG.. The last two nights, I got off work extremely late with no lunch breaks. So of course, I am starving...The first night I go to McDonalds that is right down the street from my house (bad service to begin with)...comes to find out as I was walking in thru the gas station part that they were closed due to upgrades on their computer softwares. DANG IT. So I drive down the road to Taco Bell (also bad service).. DANG IT DANG IT... I had to drive even further which was Carl's Jr. As I am going thru the drive thru, the computer comes on and says that they were closed as well. WTF.. All the restaurants by my house are freaking closed and I WAS HUNGRY. Now, I am pissed, hungry, and sleepy....So I made one more attempt and went even further away from the house to Del Taco... YAAAAAAAYYYYY Someone was open. So I ordered the combo #5 which is the two BIG FAT tacos, fries, and a soda. Then I ordered a side order of jalapeno rings. The total came out to a little over $9. Boy was I satisfiied. Then there was last night as well that I was starving once again with no lunch break from work. So I went thru the drive thru again. This time, I ordered two orders of jalapeno rings, a chicken del taco carbon, shredded beef del taco carbon, and the steak del taco carbon. My stomach was full, but I was happy to have a full stomach after long night at work. THANKS DEL TACO for being open 24 hours."}
{"text":"I also prefer this place to Taco Bell any day. 

This specific location is open 24 hours a day. As far as I know, there is not a 24 hour Taco Bell in town (again, as far as I know). So if I preferred Taco Bell, I couldn't access it whenever I wanted, thumbs down. 

The #5 is an excellent choice. Two big fat chicken tacos, fries, and a drink. Or, you could go with a #4, two chicken tacos, fries, and a drink. Yes I like their chicken tacos. Both combos are satisfying to my tummy. Even their hot sauce is hotter and tastier! 

I will continue to go to Del Taco when that late night craving takes over."}
{"text":"Just stopped here on the way to California from Phoenix. It's very easy to get in and out of. The food was hot, and the drive thru service was prompt and friendly. They also gave us enough sauce packets (a rarity for a lot of places). I would stop here again."}
{"text":"Carne asada taco
Spicy chicken burrito
Delicious"}
{"text":"This is hands down the SLOWEST Del Taco in the world.  No matter what time of day it is, it literally takes you 10 minutes to get through the drive through, if not more.  Even if you're the only one in line!  It's ridiculous but Del is delicious so I'm stuck.  My order is always right and the food is fresh so they get 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"This is actually one of the better Del Tacos in Vegas. Food is always made right and i have never been dispointed here. This place is great for quick food at any hour of the day.  It's open 24hrs for breakfast,  lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Why zero stars is not a viable option is beyond me, because this Del Taco has earned exactly that. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

I used to eat at this restaurant frequently, loved the value, and for the price the food was pretty good. Service was typically a bit bad, but they lowered my expectations at this location long ago.

However, even for me the end of the line was after seeing a group of small live ROACHES poking out from the drain at the soda fountain. YES LIVE ROACHES. Never seen this before in a restaurant, ever.  Left immediately and will not be back. A quick check of the Maricopa County health site revealed they have had 4 consecutive checks, all with LIVE GERMAN ROACHES all over the cooking side of this place and the soda fountain. 

So, unless a little unexpected crunch of insect protein is what you want in your fast food taco, I would not eat at this place. ZERO STARS."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest Del Taco I have ever been to in my life. I've given it a few chances on different days but there is no difference. The drive through is the worst I've ever seen. It's worth the extra couple miles to go to the blue diamond location."}
{"text":"The food was good. However do not dine in because you will be eating with flys as well. Over all get the food to go."}
{"text":"S/O To Alexis, killed it in the drive through. She's so nice, please give her a raise. Literally. Love it. Xoxo."}
{"text":"Located in a food court with mixed seating, it is similar to Taco Bell or Taco John's, only way more kick ass.  Cheap spicy food, yum yum.  Satisfy your hunger for less than $5 after losing your ass in poker or black jack.  If you win, by all means get the buffet at the Bellagio.  For the rest of you, see you at Del Taco or Wienerschnitzel.  Chose between processed cheese covered burritos or processed cheese covered weiners, it's a classy joint.  No shirt, no shoes, no problem.

Update:  Wienerschnitzel is no longer in this food court, it was replaced with a Sbarro.  :("}
{"text":"I have been enjoying great hot food from this del taco for years. It's great! Quick service. Team staff work well together."}
{"text":"If I could give Del Taco 0 Stars I would! This place is complete dog shit. I order 4 hard tacos from them, when I went to eat them it was 95% cheese and 5% meat. I drove back through the drive through and asked if I could get more meat in them and the guy said we only do a quarter meat in our tacos. First off it wasn't even a quarter meat it was all cheese and shell. Don't recommend this place to anyone meat tasted like dog meat and you pay more for toppings then you do the meat! I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh they. Cut the cheese daily. My order I got an extra taco. Free they didn't know but they gave me an extra one..

Other than that the place is cool.
No issues no ruckus. It's a good spot.

Get the nacho frys real good.."}
{"text":"Chicken tacos are good for a good price. I like this place sometimes better than the Bell. The Carmel cheesecake bites are the bomb."}
{"text":"Good good. Helped us out during travels. The food was good. Sauce is good. Like the mild salsa. Cheeseburgers recommend. And the steak and fish tacos are good. Plus with the onions in them are good and the spicys."}
{"text":"If I could rate zero stars I would. This Del Taco is a complete waste of time. I figured I would give it another shot as the store may have been having a bad night my first time around. Was I wrong! I waited in drive through 10 minutes at the speaker for my order to be taken. I ordered 10 chicken soft tacos no lettuce, 2 crunchtadas, a bean and cheese burrito, 2 fish tacos, 3 street tacos, chips and cheese and 8 cheesecake bites. I get to the window to pay and wait an additional 20 minutes for all of this. I had a feeling to check my items before leaving the drive through and I'm glad I did. I was missing my burrito (which I didn't realize until I left) 8 cheesecake bites and my chips and cheese. Its upsetting this location is open and I'm not sure how. I went to drive back in to get my missing burrito and the drive through is blocked off by wet signs. In my previous review, it's clear the phones don't work, they are extremely and always understaffed and I think the general manager needs to be retrained on how to operate. Some of my chicken tacos had 2-3 pieces of meat, and look as if they were from a garbage disposal. This location is ridiculous and I will DEFINITELY NOT BE RETURNING!"}
{"text":"Worst del taco in Las Vegas horrible customer service in drive thru I've ever experienced will be coming here again got my order wrong and said it was my fault can you believe that!? You guys need to hire new workers oh and let's not forget sometimes at night \"they're systems are down \""}
{"text":"Went in 5pm on Saturday.  Took 30 minutes to get food.  Service was lousy, dining area filthy and food was cold.  During visit four customers brought food back with complaints.  This place used to be a lot better, where is the management!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I waited a good 5 min before someone even came to the counter i placed my order. And i look up and the girl making my food first of all was not wearing any gloves i seen her pick or scratch her nose then continue to make my food. I asked the girl at the register totalk to juan the gm and she told him he walked away. I told the girls coming in for the new shift and him and he finally came up i told him what happened. He told me he was busy counting money.he couldnt do everything. That when my jackass button kicked in i told him isnt the customer right no matter what. He started acting like a duche. It was not busy told him if i was his boss i would fire his ass on the spot. If the health department seen that he would be fired on the spot. Poor management for sure. Andrea stepped up made the food didnt even question it she will be a chef one day. I might come offer her a job this week..."}
{"text":"I love you Del Taco BUT!!!!
If I pay near THREE DOLLARS for a burrito I expect it to be bigger and better than Taco Hell's $1.69 disaster.
Also, THE WAIT even inside is grinding on my very SOUL.
There's always just TWO PEOPLE working.
Sorries don't cut it if EVERY TIME I HAVE TO WAIT AGES even if there's only a few people ahead of me! Take a lesson from 3rd Street location.
---------------
April 2013: GOD DAMN YOU. I was the only person in the place, there were 2 drive through orders, and I STILL HAD TO WAIT FOR AGES!! 

AND my tacos were crammed with lettuce.

STOP IT!!!!!  

You just got degraded to ONE star.

WHAT
THE
F*&%

April 23/2013: See what happens when you have a manager as an extra person to help out? YOU BUST YOUR ASS THAT'S WHAT!!! I had my order in a few minutes.
Thanks and keep it up or I'll start complaining to Mister Manager.

April 25: I nearly keeled over in shock. SIX PEOPLE WORKING.
I had my order in under 2 minutes.
Tacos are now 49 cents.
We shall see how this new plan plays out and maybe you get a star upgrade."}
{"text":"Well things certainly have changed at Del Taco.
Gone are the days of 39-49 cent tacos and dollar deluxe tacos with pico and crema.
Prices are up but so are the portions.
The large taco, the Del, is a large thick shelled taco JAMMED with meat and cheese! No room for the tomato bits on top, they're just there. Crema is extra charge. My main point is, this is the most cheese I've ever SEEN on a taco EVER! Really, you need to see this meat n cheese MONSTER. I mean FULL! 
There was enough ingredients there for FOUR regular Taco BELL tacos! Actually the amount of cheese on there would probably go on SIX regular Taco Bell tacos.
F-you, Taco Bell! You're getting STOMPED by this big boot taco! You will be SHAMED out of existence for your skimpy ways!"}
{"text":"I see I'm not the first to comment on the fact that over the years (why do I keep going there??), there is ALWAYS a problem in the drive thru late night...this time, they were leaning the grill and couldn't serve ANY egg dishes or steak. What???  Are you serious??  Took 25 minutes to get food we didn't even want (and the cold half cooked fried sucked)....oh, maybe their fryer was being cleaned, too??!!  No more vacation late night stops!!"}
{"text":"I gave a three star because dont vet me wrong the  food is good but the place ia not atocked with anything the floors and tables were flithy and the trashes were full to where the trash was also on the floor"}
{"text":"Every time I go here weather it's a normal employee or I just Putin an order for 4 fish tacos they have terrible customer service if you ask a question they act like your bothering them I asked about the special and the manager a larger Hispanic male gave me an attitude grimaced that I didn't know something  and his tone was awfully given. The food is good but lacking seriously in people skills. I guess that's why they get paid so low it matches there skills"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed to see how bad the food was here and i would like to share it. One day my family felt like tocas so we went to del toca. While i waited at home for my mom to get the food she walked in tje door with the food. She explained that the line was long and the employees were terrible.i ate my first toca and started my second then I noticed a jand full of hair in it and my gamily said everything said the food was not fresh. Dad talked to the manager amd she said we would get free food next time we came. But we never came back..."}
{"text":"I happened to be in restroom when manager brought back in an employee to show her how to correctly clean the bathroom. I was totally impressed on the cleanliness and how well she explained the mistakes left to the employee rather than yelling. She said this is what you missed and this is how to clean. Good job"}
{"text":"Their French fries are on point and their burgers are like a combination of mcdonalds and in n out burger. 
Very yummy. 
However their tacos are rediculously small so order more than one."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in the drive thru still 3 cars away from the window after being in line for 20 minutes. When my order was being taken she had to repeat it several different times before she got it right. I only ordered a couple of things with zero modifications. I'm just annoyed at this point."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Del Taco I've ever been to  because of how the Manager handles customers. Kudos to you for showing what real customer service is."}
{"text":"They had horrible French fries! They gave us hard cold fries that were stale. When we asked them to give us hot fries, they gave us hot stale fries, because they mixed the cold fries with a few hot ones on top! Just terrible!!!!we will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"Good for the price plus Del Taco gives out coupons in the mail. Which helps for your budget. Surely return back for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I work nearby and frequent this location, weekly. I tend to take advantage of their Taco Tuesdays and Thursdays, and am always greeted with a smile and quality service. The food is what I expect every time, especially for the sale price I'm paying. They actually walk through and ask how everything is and if they can get you anything... I sometimes welcome this, and sometimes want to be left to myself. It is nice though, to know that they're giving an extra effort. I even had a complimentary Queso Crunch Taco a couple days before it's release, which was a nice surprise. I will be back, as I said before, it's too close and too affordable to pass up."}
{"text":"Went here late at night 3am. Ordered the most complicated meal for 7 different people. This place got the order exactly to order. Everything was hot and fresh. Miguel took the order and did a phenomenal job with everything. GREAT SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"Employee working the drive thru around 12:30pm on 02/19 was extremely rude. I asked for two large strawberry lemonades and when I got to the window, she was giving me two regular drinks. I said I got large and she rolled her eyes. I even apologized. Then she started talking to the other employee about me. This was very unprofessional. She claims her name was \"Hannah.\" Employee should be trained to have accountability and to also be grateful for customers as she failed to say, \"thank you.\""}
{"text":"On 9/28/2016 around 5:30 AM I wanted to make a stop at Del Taco to grab breakfast. I usually get service around that time but when I pulled up to the speaker and the female said they're closed till 6am. No need to promote 24 hrs if your not gonna be 24 hrs. As I drive by to depart she had her head down at a table. At least hide from the customer as they drive by, don't just put your head down like you hate your life. That's why they get 1 star, no mention why they were closed and looking lazy so customers can see you as they drive by."}
{"text":"Epicenter for homeless hustlers.
One employee kissed one then went into work .
Gross.  How does she have a health card.
Passed on eating at that Location"}
{"text":"There have been way too many instances of when we've tried to visit this drive thru and encountered either machines are down, they can't sell anything cause of doing a cash drop, or they are just flat out closed. This is irritating cause this is a 24 hour location and one of our favorite chains. Something needs to be re-evaluated in the management of this property and it's lazy employees. Until then, we won't be back and will let others know as well."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!! Host Zilma is very rude and obviously hates her job. I asked her for ranch while at the drive thru and figured she didn't hear me so I patiently waited... she thought I drove away and was obviously annoyed when she saw I was still at the window and I asked her for ranch... again. She said we charge for that so I told her no problem, can I have a ranch and a receipt she quoted me 40 cents then told me I wasn't listening when she said 50 cents. It's mind blowing how some people don't know the basics of customer service. Very disappointed. This employee should really get trained properly, it wouldn't hurt to show her some people skills too!!!"}
{"text":"Normally I LOVE Del Taco... but not this location!

My wife and I ordered our food and dined in. As I an approaching the Drink Station to refill my Iced Tea.... a freaking COCKROACH runs across the counter behind the Tea machine!

I immediately alerted an employee, who gave me an \"Oh Well\" look, and she walked away......

I promptly got my wife and we left. Never going to this location again!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 del tacos there was very little meat and lettuce as for the tomato there were only 3 small pieces and they did put ample cheese. The picture in the store sure didn't look like what I got"}
{"text":"I purchased 2 del tacos and a medium
Drink the del tacos had hardly any meat and lettuce del Taco is getting worse than Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Well shame on me, I thought my soft taco would look like the one on coupon ad. It showed this definitive picture of bulging cheese, eggs, salsa, and the taco dwarfed by the size of the food spilling out of the end. Hoo Ahh, I could cut off the first three inches of the taco and not touch the filling and then it was only a half inch high and two inches long. It was just a glop of egg, cheese, and the salsa was one spatter of red stuff. The \"hash browns were just old greasy flavored tatter tots. How could anyone possibly serve this stuff with a straight face? I emailed the company and they sluffed it off on the store manager. She called me and I told her the story and her answer was; well everyone advertises this way, but admitted that it was a little deceptive. Duh yuh think? She said come on in and I will buy you a breakfast to get your business back. Do me a favor and hold your breath. . . . .Check out my picture above."}
{"text":"Great hang out spot. Their burgers are some of my favorites! Their churros are great, too. Open late. Cheap. Taco Tuesday friendly! Ask for a quad burger or a triple del! They'll add patties onto the burgers for an extra charge."}
{"text":"So the last time I went they forgot something I ordered $ paid for. I just went back & it was terrible!!!! There was not one car in the drive thru or in the restaurant but after I ordered & paid they asked me to wait at the front. They bring out my Double del (I SAY NO MEAT) & It didn't have sauce. I ask sauce & they try to charge me a dollar?? They forgot it! Oh let's not forget I asked for fries no salt.. I got half filled old oiled fries. It's just annoying to spend money on shit service & food. Shoutout to the young kid working there though! The only good one there"}
{"text":"To add to my teview:  can't figure out how to ediut my review on this site..but whatever you do do NOT go to DT on the night-shift...that was when I got those poison fries (literally)."}
{"text":"By far the worst del taco I have ever been to. Waited over 45 minutes in the drive thru for tacos. DO NOT GO HERE. I wish I could rate 0 stars"}
{"text":"I will try my hardest to write reviews for only local businesses or locally owned businesses, because the last thing I need to know was what you think about the rude cashier at McDonald's. This will be one of my few exceptions. 

My friends know when my night out is ending when they see the famous \"Yelp Check In\" at Del Taco. This one is on the way home for me and so on a Friday or Saturday night, sometime between 2:00 am, to as late as 6:30 am the last time I was here, this is my last stop before hitting the bed.

The drive thru is open 24/7. They are always super fast giving me my secret combo of value menu items to prevent that next day hang over. 

OK, you convinced me to give up my secret. This is how I prevent hangovers. Get the bean and cheese burrito, and the chicken soft taco. Get your preferred level of hot sauce (mine is inferno, nothing but the hottest for me). It's only $2.07 out the door with tax and when you get home, drink lots of water and tear into your food. I never have a hang over when I do this. 

Protip: Take out your contacts before eating that burrito. It's tough enough taking out those things when drunk but when your fingers are like little balls of fire that your just rubbing into your eye, it never ends well."}
{"text":"Fast takeout friendly staff. Ordered Macho Nachos and Steak Taco's.
Tacos are very good.Macho Nachos are good but again I am seeing a trend of putting a little less meat and cheese on. Once more charge a bit more and load it up with the good stuff. If there was an option to double meat I would but guess the idea doesn't fit the standard."}
{"text":"Waited 5+ minutes at the drive-thru for this order. Fish tacos are completely cold. Soft tacos are completely cold. Not even lukewarm. I thought they were preparing my food in that 5 minutes of wait time. What the heck did they do? How was the ingredient stored? Why were they served cold? Not even gonna microwave it for me? Not like it's the right thing to do anyway but at least try making it warm, no? And I paid for that extra salsa. Nope, it's not in the bag. This is the one single most disappointing drive thru purchase I've ever made.

I'm never going back to this branch again."}
{"text":"Why am I writing a review of a fast food restaurant? One simple reason: I have been to this particular restaurant countless times over the last 15 years, and they have gotten my order wrong only once. ONCE! In 15 years! And every time I go there, the employees are quick, friendly, and on the ball.

Yes, I know, Del Taco is not the greatest food in the world. But you can't go wrong for the price, and they actually have a pretty broad menu. (French fries and burgers at a Mexican restaurant? Who knew?)

Tonight I had chili cheese fries. Why? I don't know. I usually get tacos and bean burritos. (And I will say I was not a big fan of tonight's order.) But, as I said, it doesn't matter what I order; it's almost always delivered quickly and correctly, and the employees are always friendly and attentive.

I'm not sure who to thank--if it's the franchise owner for this location, or if the employees at this place just take pride in their work--but I must say that I've never seen one particular fast food restaurant have such a long run of great service.

If you want cheap eats and great service, take the Jones exit off 95 and give Del Taco a chance. My advice: Stick with the Mexican food; go to Wienerschnitzel if you want chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"The employees did a good job and the food was good.
The Del Taco menu has a generous variety of items,
some of which are given names that are tongue
twisters.  Perhaps they should simply give a number
to each item, then customers could order by number.
It works for Carl's.
Our receipt did not have the address of this location."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco. I don't know why, but they are just yummy to me. I only get their chicken soft tacos. Here is how Dottsy eats a chicken soft taco from Del Taco: Open the taco, pour a packet of INFERNO sauce on the taco, spread guacamole over it, and place 3 or 4 french fries inside the taco. Fold one end, the fold in half and take a BIG MESSY bite! Hey..never knock unless you've tried!

I will say that Del Taco uses REAL chicken pieces and every time I eat there my food is hot a fresh, even the yummy crinkle cut fries. Yes, it's a guilty pleasure, but Del Taco is a step up from other fast food Mexican food. I wouldn't even really consider it Mexican food, it's more Calexican food, a mixture of California and Mexican.

Hit Del Taco for a quick fast food fix, you might be surprised!"}
{"text":"The manager here Elizabeth, is extremely rude. I gave her my order of three soft tacos and kids meal cheeseburger. I got my order and it was just a cheeseburger and two hard shell tacos. I went and explained their error, she still did not fix it. Elizabeth is shameful to say the least she kept trying to justify her mistake by placing blame on me. So much for customer is always right. She didn't even bother fixing it. I will definitely be contacting my card company and getting a refund."}
{"text":"I love del taco .the staff is ALWAYS excellent and make great food especially naida.jennifer.
Delilah.arrely.Christina and those i haven't mentioned.they always take good care of me and i cannot say too much.THEY ARE AWESOME.I go each sunday afternoon.thanks ladies.you are the best."}
{"text":"Punished again!

We love taco Tuesday, but they just can't get it right. 

No one in the drive thru at 6pm is usually a bad sign. The staff is always nice but if the order isn't wrong(short items) then the food is bad. Hard shell tacos are chewy and stale usually empty just to top it off. On the other hand the soft tacos are hard to the point of almost being crunchy. Stale Stale Stale. 
They probably could use a heath inspection although they have not made me sick yet.This has been the trend for over a year now.

Maybe we will try again in a few months..... Till then, taco bell"}
{"text":"This is the worst Del Taco ever based on customer service alone. We have currently been in the drive-through for 25 minutes to get carne asada fries and a cup of beans.  My understand the run a skeleton crew on the night shift but it is completely ridiculous to wait 25 minutes in line in a drive-through"}
{"text":"Cashier Nicole was very nice, said hi me to as soon as I walked in. I would give her 5 stars, food was 2 stars. I ordered Chicken Verde Burritos Plater, the burrito skin was very thick on the bottom, chips were very very salty, I had to throw it away."}
{"text":"Came through the drive-thru for a quick bite to eat. I was appalled by the poor service we received. While placing our order, the girl at the window had an attitude as if we were inconveniencing her by placing our order. She kept trying to rush us even though we had more items to add to our order. Then upon pulling up to the window, we were given the wrong item. When we brought it to her attention, no apology whatsoever. There was just a whole air of poor customer service. Now I remember why I was never a big fan of Del Taco. Will be awhile before I return to this location."}
{"text":"prices are cheap.. great value for the price. i always leave full.. however this time i left mad instead of full. my mom  and i stopped by to grab a bite to eat after visiting with family. ordered food and sat down. i stepped outside for something and when i tried to go back in i found they had locked the doors.. apparently it was closing time and even though my mom as well as my things where still inside they didn't feel it necessary to let me back in... NOT OK!! i had to call my mom inside to tell her they wouldn't open the door. i like del taco but i can tell u i will not return to this location again!!!"}
{"text":"Clearly the dumbest kids I have ever met. The manager was rude and I just said thank you all polite."}
{"text":"I've never gotten food poisoning here. I have gotten screwed up orders alot. It would be nice to deal with more Americans though. All in all it's an average Del Taco."}
{"text":"I come here quite often but via the drive-thru. I went inside yesterday at the slowest time of the day and this place was a mess! No toilet paper or seat covers in the restroom, tables were filthy, and the food presentation was mediocre at best. Cheese on half of my nachos, cold fries, etc. I mentioned the restrooms to the gal at the counter and they still did nothing. I may not be back!"}
{"text":"When you go through the drive-thru you can almost always smell the grease trap from a nearby restaurant, it is not appetizing in the least.  I haven't gone in a long time because the last half dozen times I went, the workers drove me away.  They are generally rude and always have the appearance of wanting to be anywhere else.  I understand they would rather be somewhere else, but they're being paid to help the customers (IMO with a smile on their face) and they can barely do that.  Also, every single time I order a taco, it's folded the sideways  Every time.  I don't know if it's some sick joke that they do but I always have to open them up and fix them.  If you order a soft taco, you can also expect part of the tortilla to be stale"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Will never come here again. There was no one in the drive thru. Nor was there anyone in the dinning area. Yet the gal at the drive thru that looked like a clown had us waiting for almost a good 7 mins till she finally took our order. 
For one look more presentable at work. She look she was stuck in October season."}
{"text":"Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible. It is bad even for fast food. If you must eat here stick with their Mexican options, because everything else is gross. Even still I always prefer Taco Bell and I am not crazy about that either."}
{"text":"Don't come here. At least for a few months. I've been in this drive thru line for a long time. Finally, when it was my time to order, the worker informed me that they don't have the normal \"Del Taco\" menu because they're new!  What?  Then why are you open. Thankfully I convinced the cars behind me to back out!"}
{"text":"U lost a customer this morning when you were not open for breakfast at 7:45 a.m.
This is a prime time for breakfast and yet you are not open..."}
{"text":"As much as I love Del Taco.... this location always has a 'problem' with credit cards because the employees are stealing money so good luck!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in this neighborhood for more than 25 years and this is my go to spot when  I don't want to cook or need a quick meal. The staff is always super nice! That being said, last night I was very disappointed. I ordered my standard combo burrito meal and when I got home to eat, it was cold. I should have known something was wrong when I pulled the condiments from the top of the bag, the fries, then another set of condiments and napkins. The burrito must have been made 30 minutes earlier. Stone cold. Hard tortilla. It was approaching 10pm and I wasn't going back. Will I go back?? Absolutely!! I won't let one bad experience get in the way of my easy meal fix. The \"kids\" just need some training. I was starving. I ate about 4 bites, but couldn't eat anymore. Gotta love the fries!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never experienced so many fast food issues in one place, in such a short period of time. About 2 months ago, my wife and I went through the drive through and placed an order. When we got home, we realized that what we received was substantially different than what we had ordered. No big deal, I drove back. It happens sometimes. Well, a couple of weeks later, it happened again, but this time, I'm certain that it was because the manager decided he'd rather BS with the employees than work, as they were chatting all around the counter. So, I called the 1-800 number and left a detailed message. The franchise OWNER called me directly and apologized and even gave us an unlimited and free meal to apologize. Of course, we spent about $15. We aren't jerks. Well, come this week, we go through the drive through again and guess who's palling around at the counter, talking and laughing again? The manager. Guess who got there order wrong again? Us. We are not going back to that location, ever."}
{"text":"This Del Taco is pathetic, I went in tonight because I was in the area and was beyond disappointed.  I bought 6 tacos to take home,  When I arrived home I found to my dismay that none of the tacos had any cheese on them and only 3 had a small amount of meat.  The other 3 were all lettuce, I kid you not ALL lettuce.  There is no way I would ever return to this Del Taco."}
{"text":"Wife and I have been going to this Del Taco pretty much since it opened ... mostly for a quick weekend breakfast, but sometimes for en evening meal or Fiesta Box (HELLA DEAL!!) for the kids.  

Not any more.  Not as long as \"Jessie\" works there. 

Up to now, we've always been happy with the service and the food, and we've laughed and joked with the help there,. 

But about a month ago, Wife was ill.  I dropped in to DT to pick up breakfast-to-go, was greeted \"Yes??\" by someone I never saw there before. I ordered two breakfast burritos as usual, with no drink on one and an iced tea on the other.  Look in the bag when served -- no hash browns. 

So I ask about that. She says, \"You didn't order them. You ordered burritos only.\" I said, \"And a drink. That makes a meal. A meal comes with hash browns.\"  No good. She insisted that a meal had to be SPECIFICALLY ordered, or hash browns had to be SPECIFICALLY ordered. No attempt to fix it ... no \"I'm sorry, let me make that right for you\" .... just real hard unhelpful, in-your-face rudeness.  Made up the hash browns, but demanded I pay extra for them. Wasn't worth a fight. 

So I asked her name.  She said Jessie.  I said Jessie who? She wasn't going to give me that.  I said OK, you know what my complaint is about ... I want you to make sure it gets to the manager.  She said, \"I'll see that it does.  I'm the manager.\" 

So Jessie, if you're reading this, be aware that for a few pennies worth of hash browns you lost at least six regular customers (my family), plus a number of my friends ... plus, maybe, anyone who reads this review of your management style. 

Folks, there's a Taco Bell just a few blocks up the road from this Del Taco ... new menu, great prices ... and even good breakfasts.  Not my first choice, but the food is fine and the service is ALWAYS great."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here was gross. The regular tacos are just normal. The fish taco was disgusting I thought I was gonna throw up. Gave it to my mom and she hated it. I'm glad there's other places around because I'm never going here again."}
{"text":"REALLY ugly interior, really awful food, stuck next to perpetual construction from the light rail, in a sketchy neighborhood.  I only ended up here because everywhere else was closed.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Usually come here late-night.  Depending who you get helping you, usually the guys are cool, but their drive-thru lady can be not so friendly hence the 3 stars.  So service at night ranges from 1-5.  The food is good, but like any fast food not great.  Although I will say their steak tacos al carbon are pretty good and pair well with their most often than not fresh crinkle cut fries.  In my opinion if you want to avoid the gift that continues giving (diarrhea if you didn't know) that Taco Bell gives with every purchase come here.  Or get your Pepto ready at that other place."}
{"text":"This is my go-to drive thru when I'm looking for cheap mexican food. Cheap, however, shouldn't equate to crappy service. When the owner/general manager is there, you get great service and fresh food. Most times, specifically at night, there are two larger, obnoxious women, who are rude, don't wear gloves, and are piss poor at providing customer service. Heads up to the owner/manager."}

And the frys

Ew"}

They need to retrain there employees horrible location"}
{"text":"Knew exactly what to expect when I walked in this store. Not authentic Mexican food, but some resemblance of Mexican fare to satisfy the craving for something fast, cheap and tasty.

Got to play it safe in these types of fast food Mexican places, so we ordered 10 tacos and got exactly what we requested. 10 crunchy tacos, a little shy on the meat but we expected that too - hell they are only 69 cents each. 

The folks that work there were plenty friendly and gathered our order as quickly as they could. No complaints, we wanted fast food, we got fast food. Never going to come here for dinner, but when a busy day occurs - I'll surely be back to take care of the hunger pangs.

Thank you ladies and gentlemen."}
{"text":"Best fast food Taco place. 
I eat here a lot.
Taco Tuesday 3 tacos for $1.00

Black pack sauce taste best."}
{"text":"I always stop here on Tuesdays for the 3 taco special. So I had a coupon to buy 1 platos and get one free. So we got the carne asada and the chicken platos. They both are wet burritos, rice, beans, and fresh  sliced avocado.  We got the usual tacos special as back up just in case we didn't like it.

The burritos are medium size (not too big and not too small) by we were pleasantly surprised. The sauce they used for carne asada was red and for the chicken they used green sauce.  I didn't think they could pull it off but they did and they have really stepped up their game. It doesn't taste like authentic Mexican food but it was tasty enough. Being born and raised in Cali, I know what it should taste like and they get a pass from me.

Service is usually pretty good even though they're always crowded and extremely busy.  I have attached the photos so you can see they actually look like the picture.

Oh I forgot they also give you chips and a salsa cup on the side. (no picture)"}
{"text":"i have loved this place since i was in california.  i moved to georgia and finally found one and i was very please.  i probably visit this place 1-2 times a week as i love their tacos.  the price is always reasonable and service is always friendly and fast.  they only drawback is when i go through the drive-thru i never get enough of the mild sauce when they give it to me.  i ask for extra but it's never enough for me as i use 3 for every taco i eat.  none the less i am please with the food and will continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"I can not believe the only have 3 people cooking and on order taker at 12:30pm. The place is a mob scene took me 20min to get lunch and the food tasted like it was thrown together. My chesse on the tacos was not even melted food tasted luke warm!"}
{"text":"Just watched the girls sit and have a clearly not work related conversation while I waited over 10 minutes for my \"fast food\" only to have the girl running the register handle money, then go to cook/serve fries after biting her nails without washing her hands or putting gloves on or anything. I mean, seriously. You handle cash, then put your fingers in your mouth, then go straight to handling food? Wtf?"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!
First after a long day swimming with the kids so they suggested to go to taco Tuesday so heck yea why not..when I walked in there was no customers at all almost..i felt kinda strange but w/e..just wanted to eat n let the kids have some fun n leave..waited like five mins no one talked to us..there were like 7/8 employees working..n a couple walked in they just ignored me n they just took their orders first..bad service so I was unhappy already..but still got my order from some super mean lady n just decided to eat n leave..n found an alive bug when packing up my Togo...never seen a bug on my dining table so I was asking for the manager no apology at all!!!!Been there many years but no more going back!!!"}
{"text":"Del Taco is a little different than other fast food chain. Aside from burgers, tacos, nachos, and quesadilla, they have better savory options like their Pollo Asado Avocado Fresca Bowl and Chicken Verde Wet Burrito Plato. For a healthier alternative, they have Avocado Veggie Fresca Bowl and a good selection of Handcrafted Salad like their Signature Taco and Mexican Chopped Salad. This particular one is in the University Plaza, it's on the corner of East Tropicana and Maryland Parkway. I like how it's so convenient, it's right next to Vons and there's a good amount of parking space. The downside is that dining in is not 24/7 so when it's passed 11pm, you'd have to go to the drive thru to order your meal. Sometimes it can be a bit of a wait when there's a convoy of night owls and an after party crowd. But when I'm at the drive thru they're real nice about making sure my order is right. 

I don't think I'll ever stop being a fan of their Macho Crinkle Cut Fries ($2.79). When I order they serve my fries hot, well-done, extra crispy, no salt, and that's how I like it. Personally I like the mild salsa, it's all that's needed to give it a little spiciness. If you want to fancy it up, you can opt for the Deluxe Chili Cheddar Fries. Usually I always go for their Epic Chipotle Chicken Avocado Burrito ($5.69). It comes as a big tortilla wrap with tender grilled chicken, rice, seasoned black beans, pico de gallo, fresh avocado slice, and that creamy chipotle sauce. It really is an EPIC burrito, they don't skimp on the ingredients, the portions are generous, it's fulfilling and very tasty. For sweet cravings, they make strawberry and chocolate milkshakes, I've tried the cinnamon churros and their caramel cheesecake bites are serve hot and crunchy. But one thing I have a weakness for is their good old-fashioned Chocolate Chip Cookies, you get 3 for $1.89, it's a reasonable price and I would always buy extra for a gratifying midnight snack."}
{"text":"Sometimes you pay for convenience and this time was proof of that. This was the first time that I walked in rather than using the drive thru. So glad that I did I was able to finally see this disconnect between what I imagined and what is handed through the window. There were only two people on staff I expected slow service but at least accurate and consistent. Man was I wrong my burrito had cheese that wasn't even melted all the way. I fell in love with the restaurant years ago and maybe it's franchising has led to a more diluted product. Not all California staples can withstand not having that key needed oversight. This will me my last visit to this entire chain. If your hungry in the area there's an In and Out across the street , it's a better use of your time and money."}
{"text":"Easy drive thru transaction with some special requests: #5 with extra sauce on the chicken soft tacos, nachos instead of the French fries (I'm sorry, I've just ALWAYS hated the French fries from all Del Tacos...tacos and fries just doesn't make sense to me), and a Diet Coke with no ice.
Order was quick, perfectly accurate, and the drive thru attendance was very pleasant...just like the experience should have been!"}
{"text":"I came in early to try to catch up on some work and my co-worker wanted to treat a few of us to Del Taco.  So since they were buying why not drive and I sometimes enjoy Del Taco.  So as I walked up to the door 6:12am the door was locked and I was unable to get in.  I looked at the sign on the door and it stated that dining hours were 6am-12am so I standing there a bit confused.  I was forced to go thru the drive thru which I hate doing when I have multiple orders and I need to make sure order is correct before I leave in addition to them giving me more that 2 or 3 sauce packets (sad right?). 

So after I put my order in I pulled up to the window to pay and I ask her why is the door closed and she said oh we were cleaning up.  What in the living daylights are you talking about?  I have been here plenty of times while they have been cleaning or whatever they needed to do to tidy up.  So I'm pretty sure that was a big ole fat lie!  I haven't been in the best of moods these past couple of days and almost questioned her further but to avoid that conflict I shut my mouth.

Needless to say I sat there waiting 10 minutes to get my order while there were other cars behind me waiting even longer for me to get my order.  And guess what???  About $20 worth of food for 4 people and they gave me 6 sauce packets!  Yes I'm a little irritated but I'm not going to complain over something so small because there are people out there who aren't able to fill their bellies as I am.  But it's gonna be a great day today!  :-\"}
{"text":"It's disappointing when you can't find a Taco Bell and having to go to Del taco instead. When you're in a hurry and you go through the drive through you don't have time to go back and exchange stuff. The girl and asked me what sauce I would like I said mild.  I needed to mild packets for my 1 item. She gave me a handful of everything except mild. It's only three in the afternoon. It's not lunch rush. I was the only one in the drive-through and no one was behind me. Just annoying because I'm not gonna go back to exchange my sauces and I'm also not going to eat my Veggie burrito."}
{"text":"Horrible! Discussing restroom, charged me double because order taker didn't know how to ring in a combo... Charged $8 for a small burrito combo. Many del taco locations seem to have a bad staff... this is one of the worst I've been to (only because my son wanted it.)"}
{"text":"Its not the best food ever but its fast food what do you expect? They will mess up your order sometimes but its fast food what do you expect? Do you see where I'm going with this? The reason I like this Del Taco is that its great for a quick cheap meal....and they have Mr. Pibb."}
{"text":"Just went through drive through, and they said they were all out of mild sauce. Walked inside and the tables were filled with mild sauce. Laziness level off the charts."}
{"text":"Its an okay place to stop by after youve been out but definitely better fast food mexican restaurants out there to enjoy in vegas."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SUCKS!  I am currently sitting in the drive thru for 20 minutes now and NO ONE GIVES A YOU KNOW WHAT!!!  I will NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!   I want everyone to know how bad this place sucks!!!!  They shouldn't even get one STAR.  This is totally unacceptable!   There are five cars behind me in the drive  thru - WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE?!!  When I finally got my food I tried to tell the rude girl at the drive thru that it was hot outside and people's patience is thin - her name was ARIM, she just handed me a bag and said Thank you - no eye contact - and shut the door!   

NEVER AGAIN !!!!!!    People please don't go here - they are SO RUDE!!!!"}

Next time you need yummy and quick give them a try."}
{"text":"This is the most poorly run Del Taco location I have ever dealt with.  They hire people with poor customer service skills.  The last two times we went the around 4pm, we couldn't even order a burger which is what my partner likes because they were cleaning their grill.  Why would a fast food restaurant clean their grill just before the dinner hour?  Today, I asked to speak to a manager to complain about this.  A young girl came to the window who clearly was not a manager.  She tried to tell me they have to clean their grill at this time due to shift change. She claimed they close at night now so they cannot clean it overnight.  Although, the posted hours on the drivethru window says 24 hours.  Plenty of fast food restaurants are not open 24 hours, but do not inconvenience their customers by closing down half their menu at one of the busiest times of the day.  I would not recommend this location to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"If I could get negative one start I would. I do not think these employees know how to listen. First rang me up for 2 burritos at regular price. He asked 3 times what I wanted in my burrito... cheese and lettuce.... not that difficult. The manager came up to help. Asked what I wanted on it. That's fine. As I walk away, she asked again, what do you want on your burrito? \"Ma'am just cheese and lettuce\" I sit down, get my burrito, only cheese on it..... are you kidding me? JUST CHEESE AND LETTUCE. Not to mention, the meat was like warm and was definitely sitting for a while. I'm gonna assume, whatever was left from last night. I recommend you drive a couple more miles to different location. I will never return."}
{"text":"Ordered an ensalada with NO meat. Meat on the side for my dog. What do I get??  A bowl full of meat. With no avocados. These employees don't care about customers  orders.  

Edit: Oct 4th. I went to the drive-through and of course I was very specific with what I said I needed no meat extra beans no Cilantro. The guy told me back my order extra meat no beans.  I said no nobody ever listens to me here please listen to what I'm saying and got all offended and he said you don't have to yell at me.  Lol. Kind of yes I do because I even told him half the time I get home and my food is wrong.  So I get my taco salad I check it was nice to beans he fix that part they put more beans but when I got home and the light of course there's cilantro all in it. And absolutely no avocado again!!! Why am I paying for this? Why can't they get the order straight just one time?? And why do fast food people want $15 an hour when they can't listen, they get offended, and  then make our food wrong??  

You might ask why even come here to eat? When it's made correctly it's under 500 cal and it usually tastes good WITH Avacado."}
{"text":"Not open 24 hours even though every sign says so. Lol. Rude staff, but what else do you expect from a fast food joint."}

Today was grill chicken soft taco, jumbo shrimp taco and iced tea. Disappointed about the chicken taco, salty. The jumbo shrimp taco was actually good. The shrimp was not heavy with batter or over cooked. The iced tea is just ok."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to this location .
The first time they didn't put chicken in the avacado bowl 
  
I just got home tonight Order number #73 
Ordered a bowl no beans extra rice and salsa 

And there were beans in the bowl . 

I'm usually not one to complain but to get home after the order is wrong is a little disappointing .

Just make sure your paying attention so that you don't have mess ups like that .
I will come back because it's convenient but I will definitely make sure I check everything before leaving"}
{"text":"the best part about this place is the fact its 24/7. You get 1 free refill on your soda. the grilled chicken soft shell tacos were okay. there was a weird mayo flavor in them, the sauce, that i am not sure if it went well with. but face it, this is a quick fast meal and you get more bang for your buck. tacos were filling for sure. i like that they used real tomatoes and fresh lattuce, you can see everything being chopped up there. also the fries are not needed in the meal, give me another taco instead!"}
{"text":"?????????"}
{"text":"I been coming her a lot with my bob. Since I haven't had a lot of money, Del Taco has became my best friend. And its also nice that I live right by a Del Taco. lol. I get the munchies at night a lot and one of the great things that I love about this place is it runs 24 hrs. 

There value menu is not that bad! 99cents for a 1/2 bean burrito. (I always get sour cream and guacamole in mine) Not too crazy crazy about there fries, but they are pretty good.. Soft tacos 59 cents only(or you can get it hard taco as well) The meat always come out nice and hot. Its So juicy when you take that first bite! YUM! Also I would recommend getting some of there 69cent cookies! Oh they are so good! They always come out nice and soft and gooey! Goes well with your meal!!
There place is always clean and they now started to put there sauces in baskets at the table you eat at. I think that's a great idea better getting up every 5 min when you need a some new sauces. Fast service! That I like about my fast food! Also there customer   service is really good also. Always serving us with a smile on there faces. Nice job guys, I will be back in when I am graving another more of your tacos!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of fast food, but the macho nachos here are trouble! Recently had a bad day and stopped in, devoured them on my own- no shame, eating the pain away.
They're good though- portion is HUGE and the dish is heavy. Initially they look to be swimming in sour cream, but the pickled jalapenos balance that out pretty good. Amount of beans and cheese is fairly low, so these aren't really a \"heavy\" dish that will feel like a brick in your belly afterward. 

This place also has pretty good fish tacos, served classic-style with corn tortillas with a nice sauce. Tasty, would order again- pair of tacos comes in a $3 order, upgrade to shrimp and the pair goes up to $5.

Service, even in the dead of night, is friendly. Have yet to dine in. As others have said, given they have the same price point, this chain is head and shoulders above Taco Bell's menu offerings and quality."}
{"text":"Wow! Clean restaurant, friendly employees. Got my order right the first time. And even with training new people they still got my order out in a timely manner. Glad I gave them another chance after my last visit!"}
{"text":"It says its open 24/7 on yelp, when we went through the drive thru at 12:30a on a Saturday we were told they were closed. When we questioned it he said \"we haven't been open 24/7 since the first of the year\". Ok fine, but its 12:30a....on a Saturday. Drove through, checked on the window. What time did they actually close? It said 1:00am. So we actually had 30mins before closing. But truly, i dont want a taco made from someone who says they're closed 30mins before they actually are though."}
{"text":"This was Naugles when I was growing up. Although I miss them, Del Taco does an great job to accommodate you if you crave old menu items. Their new value menu is pretty darn special. I love the 1/2 bean and cheese burrito with green sauce ( I mean, do I really need any more than that? ha! ) And the mini bacon quesadilla was delicious. I love the fresh brewed Tetly, also. Face it. They are awsome in a pinch, late night drunk food, and early morning quick bite. Just try not to get to technical with special orders in the drive thru ; )"}
{"text":"You've probably had Del Taco before if you're looking this place up. In my opinion it's a better Taco Bell, this location is pretty standard. I've never actually been inside because they have a 24 hr drive thru. My go-to is the spicy jack chicken quesadilla or the tacos if they're on sale. Tuesday is 3 crunchy or soft tacos for $1.20ish and Thursdays it's 3 grilled chicken tacos for like $2.50ish. I've been here several times and have only had two issues ever, the first time they gave me the wrong order and I didn't realize until I got home. I had a really good chicken avocado burrito and the del tacos which are crunchy tacos but like supreme, I had ordered like $4 worth of value menu stuff so this was a happy accident. The second issue was they ran out of big tortillas once so no quesadillas or burritos, I didn't order anything that time. Other than that it's an okay location."}
{"text":"First visit , half of my order wasn't in my bags. When I tried to call the phone keep ringing. Super disappointed. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I can't really say how many snacks and lunches I have enjoyed at this particular location.  Never a problem with my order and the staff at the window always friendly.    Never been inside because after hitting the drive-thru, I really enjoy rolling over to US Airways Air Cargo parking lot off of Surrey & Patrick and enjoy watching the jets coming and going. I have fond memories of really going overboard with my DT orders but as I grow older and food costs have gone up, my orders are more streamlined now. It is healthier and it keeps the car cleaner."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop at this location vis the drive-thru on our way out of town.

Staff was friendly.

The order was correct and served up in a tidy manner.

Tried the funnel fries for the first time.  They were a sweet and tasty end to the meal."}
{"text":"My first time here. Bald headed guy at the register is rude and miserable. Don't think I will return. But hey I used their free wifi to rate this place!"}
{"text":"Its fast food, so its never going to be above 3 stars from me.  But for fast food, its pretty darn good.  This location is clean, which is a rare thing in fast food, and the staff seemed competent, again a rarity.  I enjoy the strange sounding combo of tacos and fries, with lots of hot sauce.  I've had better tacos, but not from a fast food joint.  Del Taco is a go!"}
{"text":"We went on Christmas eve & it was not busy.  I love Del Taco because of the food tasting fresh & somewhat better than taco bell.  

This night we ordered carnita combo burrito, 8 layer burrito & spicy Jack quesadilla.  The burritos were great (8 layer is way better than Taco Bell's 7 layer) but the quesadilla was gross.  It tasted like they gave me and old order from like 2 hours before.  

Because of my love for Del Taco I will go again but this time I will check my order before I leave."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco. . .however, I experienced a situation which prompted me to contact corporate and no one responded. . .therefore I am going to be vigilant with warning people to check their cups or simply \"DON'T ORDER A DRINK\""}
{"text":"Slowest Del Taco drive thru I've ever been to. No apology or reasoning once I actually got to the window as well. It should not take 20 minutes from the time I pull in to the time I get to the window with only 3 cars ahead of me. I don't even normally review fast food restaurants but this was really, really bad."}
{"text":"I am sure the food is good. The establishment was way understaffed had one person trying to do drive-through and front counter at the same time. Needless to say I walked out because of lack of customer service"}
{"text":"DT as DT does.  This can be a busy location during lunch time."}
{"text":"Don't let the siren's song at the menu taking your order fool you into believing that this Del Taco is special....It's not.

While at the check out window, the cacher/server was anything but nice.

After taking our sizable meal down the road to grind.

With each undressing of the wrapper revealed that we were in for one terrible meal.

Chicken soft tacos that looked like made in a nuclear reactor, to the soupy quesadilla that we tried desperately to keep from staining our pants.  Everything lacked any of that quick efficient tasty chow that I know DT is capable of making.

My poor buddies guts were absolutely trashed for the remainder of the day.

Shame on you lazy DT cooks.....shame on you!"}
{"text":"I've always used the drive through at this location, in the morning time. Have never had any problems. Customer service always good. Order always correct. Sounds like 5 stars or close to it, right? 


Well this morning, I am hungry, and opt for a classic chicken burrito. No lettuce. Extra cheese. Extra chicken. All was well until I was about 1/3 of the way into it and I look down and notice I was eating a burrito with RAW chicken. I called the store and spoke with a manager named Maria. She was so so, offered to have me come back and make another burrito. I declined for obvious reasons and stated I was now at work and cannot come back. I told her I just wanted my money back for the burrito. She said she would like me to bring it back so she can see and speak with her cooks about it because they might not believe her. Really? Ok. I kind felt like she was calling me a liar. I told her that I've been cooking for years and I'm pretty sure I know raw chicken when I see it and she should talk to her cook immediately so other patrons aren't served raw chicken. So I inform her I am not off until 4pm, she tells me to come in after work, with the burrito, and she will update the manager on duty at that time of the situation.

So fast forward to about 5pm. I come back with my burrito from the AM. The gal at the register initially was nice and gets the manager or shift supervisor who then  leaves whatever she was helping to cook and  walks up nonchalantly to the register, she then proceeds to throw the burrito in the trash (WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT IT, doesn't wanna see the photo on my phone either), gives me back $6 and then gives me back my receipt copy (after I have to ask for it). Did she talk to me once during the transaction? Nope. Just kept her head down and talked to the register (no it didn't answer back). 

Had i received better customer service in response to bringing raw chicken to their attention,  I probably would've rated this store higher. The reason I give even 3 starts after a raw chicken experience is because my past experiences here have always been pleasant."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and went through the drive thru.
Got a red burrito with extra red sauce & extra cheese, fries were alright,
but the burrito has got to be THE BEST red burrito I've ever had! Was here on a 
Spring Training visit, and it's something when it beats the California ones where I'm 
from that I've been to! Even though the location isn't so great, especially around evening."}
{"text":"Love this del taco location the food is always fresh the customer service is great and the food is always made on time and they never once messed up my orders each time I came here."}
{"text":"Del Taco is the second faux-Mexican aberration to come out of California (behind Taco Bell).  Being a transplanted Californian in Las Vegas, I'll go out of my way for Roberto's.  That being said, it'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Bad service, told the girl 4 times about a drink,she still forgot it, when asked for it, the lazy guy working there just said \"she didn't enter it in\" - like that's my problem!!! Lazy staff.. I would pay these people $4 per hour let alone 15!!!"}
{"text":"Total stoner food. For the record I was NOT stoned only drunk. 

I am from Houston and we only have one Del Taco and it isn't close to me, nor do I eat fast food often. When IN VEGAS...drunk + tacos = great idea. 
I can only vouch for their crispy beef tacos, they were pretty good and WAY better than that other Taco with the BELL place. $6 got us 6 tacos. Great deal, bad for your arteries. For those health nuts they do offer ground turkey. 

Fast service, fast food and no stomachache in the morning. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"For fast food Mexican I can't complain...I'd rather go to a taqueria, but at 9pm they aren't open :( So, Del taco will do the trick. The people working were nice, or food came fast and everything tasted good (for fast food :)) No complaints for this fast food joint. And Del Taco is cheap :)"}
{"text":"Absolute cold served garbage, they even tried to give me hot coffee in a waxed soda cup because they were out of foam coffee cups. The drive through attendant was barely audible and seemingly as high as a giraffes belly button. The food was cold, like never melted the cheese cold. Just shredded cheese and cold diced tomatoes on a suspiciously luke warm tortilla. The worst. I'll never go to any Del Taco, first and last time there."}
{"text":"I really like coming to this one and Brian is the best Del Taco employee ever! He is very energetic and polite. Great customer service! I came in the drive thru around 2am and had to pee really bad. He's was so kind to open the door for me and let me go. The food was great too!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Order was repeated back. Drive thru line moved quickly.

Food just okay, but about what I would expect from a fast food place. Fish taco was small. Fish was greasy. Nachos were good size and filling."}
{"text":"When I am in the area running errands and I get hungry it's a toss up between the famous burger spot across the street or DT.  Sometimes I bust out the coin flip app and let fate decide.  This particular DT's drive-thru can get a tad insane at times.   No worries it moves quickly.  Never a problem my order and the servers are nice everytime."}
{"text":"DT here is quick and friendly from the time that you order and also when you go and pick it be it at the counter or the drive-thru.

Every single time I head home...I think about making a stop.  The thought of eating DT everyday would fatten me right up.....RIGHT...I don't hit it everyday because Sunset and the traffic is a mess."}
{"text":"Daytime = excellent. Nighttime = pretty crappy.
Wanted large fry and cheese quesadilla, was told it would be 2 minutes for the fries and to pull around. I've been waiting for 10 minutes outside while slowly everyone else is getting their damn food. Not cool. Probably won't be coming back at night if it's the same guy mending the mic as aside from his rude comments about the people behind me he has zero lack of skill when it comes to calculating time. While writing this 2 more minutes has passed and nothing is happening. Pretty crappy if you ask me. Watch the fries still be cold or something lol

....3 more minutes elapse...

THEN HE BRINGS ME THE WRONG SIZE....
Just absolutely called it, the guy comes out with a medium fry, I told him \"what the hell\" and he went inside and got another order of medium fries. I checked out the cheese quesadilla and it was as cold as it could possibly be, not even remotely melted, all the cheese was still intact and the tortilla used felt like it was room temperature. Like really what the fuck. 

Literally came here on my way back to work (I was on lunch) a 5 minute situation took almost 20, I was late back to work. This is fucking dumb, I blame the dickhead behind the headset as he \"appeared\" to be in charge but had zero managing skills at all. If he wasn't, and their WAS a manager in that building then my god she/he is doing a terrible job running a nice new location. Fucking terrible experience. 

Was \" \" this close to hand delivering the order back they the window."}

{"text":"Just ordered the Plato the guy repeated my order wrong four times and when I got to the window it had sauce on the tacos I said not to add it, he said 2 side of brand I said no I told you two sides of rice. The rice was old and cruddy the carne taco had old meat in it!!!! Disgusted I spit it all out not coming back ever!!! I could've gotten food poison. They had to bring my order out to me"}
{"text":"shout out to Adam in drive through.  you are awsome.  thanks for being super friendly after a long day at work that  is what i needed.  see Adam. he rocks"}
{"text":"4th time in a row no churro on their advertised managers special. 1 star this time for the blatant lying of the rep at the window. Closed the window them to make a churro when I mentioned it, and told me it was already in the bag. Well I leave, start eating at work and realize there's no churro. Please remove it if you have no intentions of following through. It's just a churro in all honesty, but I've asked every time. Unfortunately it's the closest 24H near me or I would yo elsewhere in a pinch."}
{"text":"I visit this Del Taco every once in a while and have no idea why it's at 3 stars. Food is always great, the tacos look like tacos, the fries are always crisp, and the burritos are decently filled. Every time. Customer service has always been on point during my visits, but today Ismael really set the bar high."}
{"text":"Decided to check this location out because a friend said they are generous with their portions. Quite the opposite...the tacos had only a few pieces of lettuce and was the lightest and flattest I've ever received! Drive thru was a little slow but staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. They literally threatened to call the cops (bc my friends black) on us bc we were asking for food, and we saw them sneeze on a whole batch of tacos. EWWWWW. Never ever again #fuckdeltaco #ewbitch
But for real don't go! Horrible never go"}
{"text":"This place sucks every time. I go to order a double cheeseburger they always tell there cleaning the oven . And I had a friend order the same thing and he got serve the same meal I got denied from . I been trying to file a complain to this 968 store on Craig but no one ever calls me back ."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. I have never left a negative review..but unfortunately this was just so inconvenient I wanted to share...I ordered a fairly large order for my company lunch from this location. TWO HOURS before the scheduled delivery time I received a call saying their system was down and they had \"lost\" my order. I let them know that luckily I had an emailed receipt from del taco that I was able to print out to read off to them. As I'm going down the order list, the woman on the phone seemed to be getting pretty confused, so in an attempt to not waste anymore time I decided to leave work and drive down to the Del Taco myself and give them the receipt I printed so they would be able to build the order. Which was a huge inconvenience for me and my team when it's insanely busy at my job as it is and then I had to take time out so i could help them with theirs.(I don't want to sound rude but it is what it is) So finally it was time for the food to be delivered. When it arrived we had a ton of tacos and burritos (enough for 50 people) and absolutely NO hot sauce packets. NONE. Which, after having to take time out of my busy day to drive all the way down to their store with LAST MINUTE NOTICE was the cherry on top of this experience... I mean, it isn't very difficult to grab a bunch of packets throw them in a bag and send them on their way... but anyway... we ended up having dry, cold tacos... one of my team members said eating Del Taco without hot sauce is like \"getting married and forgetting the rings\" lol needless to say, we won't be ordering from here ever again and I wouldn't recommend any one else does either, at least not if you have a large order. Which is a shame because we order lunch frequently and they're missing out on easy money for their store..."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco.  It is my ole reliable when I am out an about and in need of something to take the edge off.  This was the case recently while heading north up Rancho a little after 10 at night.  I spied one car in the drive-thru and thought I had scored.  That was until I pulled in and another vehicle which had come in from another entrance beat me to the squawk box.  

They took their time ordering and I get this is not DT's fault.  Listening to the order it was nothing out of the ordinary.  It just took a while for the driver and passenger to come to a conclusion.  

I quickly made my order which consisted of a quesadilla and a bean burrito.  I then pulled up behind two vehicles.  One of them was the original vehicle I had seen in the drive-thru.  I lost track of time after an approximate 10 minute wait.  I had to go to my happy place after thoughts of 4x4 out of the drive-thru crept into my mind.

When I finally arrived at the window, I felt an unreasonable amount of time had surpassed given the amount of traffic.  I wanted to just keep driving, but I was hungry.  You can't eat principals but you can always yelp.  The cashier was so so and in no way matched the pleasantries I was throwing down.  Oh well, at least the food was warm..."}
{"text":"The favorable perception of food positively correlates with the person's alcohol level regardless the actual quality of the food.  With this in mind, I proffer Del Taco as the prime example.  Nobody with a sophisticated palette would enjoy Del Taco if they were actually sober.  And, even when drunk, I'd much prefer Taco Bell over Del Taco.  However, options are limited at 3am and after downing nearly a 5th of vodka, anything sounds divine - even Del Taco.  When you've just finished hitting the clubs at the MGM, rest well knowing that Del Taco is right around the corner.  [Original Visit: November 6, 2010]"}
{"text":"This is my favorite stop after a night of being out. They really hook it up & it's pretty fresh (even late at night). The drive thru is probably the best they could do this late at night but I expect it. & they're actually really cool. They're worth it, even after a long night out. They get that. I would totally suggest this for a late night bite. And they have wonderful costumer service being that they are serving you LATE AT NIGHT. Also, DON'T expect a 5 star restaurant in the middle of the night... if otherwise, you probably shouldn't be eating at 1am & make you're own burritos.

The employees at Del Taco, YOU guys are great!"}
{"text":"The review is based on the breakfast chorizo - too spicy for me."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for over 5 years.

The service is pretty good quality. All of my orders have been quick - and correct.

I have never had a problem with an order, and it has always tasted great! The Orange milkshakes are back so I have been back a few times to claim them.

I do wish I could get breakfast at 11:30am though."}
{"text":"Usually Del Taco is wonderful but this location in particular is trash. Every time I go there I end up waiting 25 minutes for my food that ends up being cold, I don't get it."}
{"text":"Slowest service.  No matter the time of day. Terrible attitudes??  1 kids meal.  28 min wait."}
{"text":"Even after the \"Del Taco Sauce Fiasco\" involving an employee being filmed using expletives with customers over hot sauce packets, they still can't seem to get it together. At least the sauce anyway. 

I visited today (different location) and asked for lots of packets of the Del Scorcho sauce. When I got my food and opened it an hour later there were none. 

Two stars for decent fast food. Zero stars for the poor customer service."}
{"text":"Feel bad for this place only have 2 people working and it's 5 o clock feel like there should be more people so this wait wasn't so ridiculous :("}
{"text":"I love their food but the past few times I've come I've stated I'm allergic to onions and make sure they know I'm deathly allergic to them ask for no onions yet get half way threw my burrito to find a shit tone of white onions! I'm part of the culinary business so I know how sometimes it's hard to keep up with remembering the orders when it's busy but when it's just one person there how hard is it to remember one small order with no onions! Getting tired of the allergies reactions and will no long ever again eat at this del taco!"}
{"text":"Because it was easy...I rolled in for a little Del Taco flavor given that it was Cinco De Mayo.  There was only one car ahead of me as I pulled into the DT drive-thru.  Given that it was a \"cheat\" day, I ordered up a 1000+ calorie meal for myself and some chow for the GF and the Boy.

The service was nice and the order was made with ease.  Normally, I would move to a sparsely populated section of the parking lot to devour my meal.  BUT.....that was the old me.  I took the meal home.  Much like anything else that you order out and take home...DT does not travel well.  With that being said..condensation knocks a meal down a few notches.  This is not DT's fault.

ONCE again...Del Taco is as Del Taco does.  A solid A-OK meal all the way around."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this location all the time many moons ago.  

The service (drive-thru) was quick and the food was all that is Del Taco."}
{"text":"Was out in the area and needed to bring home a quick and reliable meal around dinner time.  DT has pretty much never ever failed me. EVER!  That was until......I came to this place.

Not a lot of vehicles in the drive-thru so I thought I scored.  Rolling up to the squawk box, I was patient with the not so pleasant order taker.  The order was made in quick fashion.

I rolled around to the window and after stopping immediately felt tension radiating out from the window.  Awkward tension....anger tension.  I tried to engage the order taker but they were really having none of it.  I watched as my chow was thrown into a bag and brought towards me.  No stop at the sauce tray, no asking what sauce I wanted.  Figuring the food had already been made and not having to fear any retaliation, I asked for sauce.  Sauce and attitude.......yummy.

Now I don't live around the corner but I don't live that far away.  The 215 makes for a quick trip back to the casa.  When I arrived and threw the spread out on the kitchen table, my quesadilla landed like a folded up frisbee.  In retrospect a frisbee might taste like my quesadilla did.  My bean burritos looked like who ever made them was trying to choke them.  The choking killed them....no heart and no substance.

Knowing what I know now.....there are a few other locations in the relative immediate area.  This one is off the radar and I will seek out those alternate locations in the future."}
{"text":"Cheap Taco's and food. The walls are polka dots. The food isn't half bad for what you pay Service isn't stellar normally I'm reminding them what comes with the meal and to make sure I get what I ordered."}
{"text":"I had the epic carne breakfast burrito. It was delicious and huge. It was packed full of cheese, tomatoes, cilantro, salsa, and tater sticks. I really enjoyed it, but it probably could have been fresher."}
{"text":"Not bad if you want something hot to eat, but beware as you might need to wait a while when there are a lot of people ordering.  Keep your receipt and do the survey, you'll save $1 off the next time you buy something."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this is the worst Del Taco ever. Food took a long time and every item was cold cold cold including the fries, chicken, and fish items."}
{"text":"Horrible ordered the avocado bacon chicken salad no bacon avocado was brown and had finger prints on it and the chicken looked disgusting (what was on there) manager was rude as hell AVOID this location!"}
{"text":"Aye aye aye!! I'm a glutton for punishment and for .59 cent tacos. Two cars in the drive thru and it took 7 minutes to place an order for 3 tacos. 10 minutes to receive them and the cashier made it seem like I'm some sort of a-hole for patronizing his place of employment. Ugh."}
{"text":"I like there tacos only because it tastes better than taco bell !  nachos sucks, we tried other things and it was ok."}
{"text":"If you're on the Strip and looking for a decently priced, quick meal, Del Taco is the place to be! 

Unlike some of the other fast food joints in this food court between the MGM and Planet Hollywood, Del Taco's prices seemed pretty consistent with their prices in the \"real world.\" I got two grilled chicken soft tacos for $3. Cheap meal for Vegas!"}
{"text":"I used to work at Petland back when I was younger and I'd go here all the time. It was okay during the day. My friend from highschool worked here for a while.

One night I had a craving and 2 of my friends were here on leave from the Army. We decided to go here because we were craving their crinkle cut fries and it just sounded good.

The guys working were complete assholes. No one was in the drive-thru, we sat there for about 5 minutes and my friend was like, uhhh...okay. They came back and asked, \"What do you want?\" I was with 3 other people, I ordered a Del Classic Chicken Burrito, the 2 guys got tacos or something, and my gal friend got chili cheese fries.

Basically, these guys didn't want to be there (I don't blame them), and having a friend that worked there I knew what went on. They smoke weed in the back. We felt weird about it - knowing what I know and seeing how upset they were. I opened my burrito and SAW spit. It even smelled like weed. The other girl looked at her fries and she said the same thing. The guys were already pissed. We put everything back in the bag and didn't eat a bite. 

Total bullshit. Never going here again."}
{"text":"I had a craving for their crunchy tacos & french fries! The drive-thru was fast & the lady working it was nice. She seemed a little distracted, asking us the same questions a few times, but our order was correct! The tacos were exactly what I wanted & exactly how they always are! The fries were lukewarm when we got them & cold by the time we were home. It was a little disappointing but not surprising. I'm sure I'll be back here when another crunchy taco craving hits!"}
{"text":"DT is as DT does!  Rolled into the drive-thru and made my order with no drama.  The two chicken soft taco's and quesadilla were of the same quality you you would get at a DT in town or Barstow, CA.  Fast & friendly service.  What else can be said?"}
{"text":"Did a hit and run while in the area running errands.  I rolled into the drive-thru and was greeted by a very affable employee.  I did not want to order up so I just asked for a chicken quesadilla.  It was made in a speedy fashion despite it being lunch time.  It seemed everyone was not in the mood for the DT's fantastic speedy mex.  Lucky for me, I grabbed and rolled to a free parking spot to give myself some speedy calories.  It was then that I spied a female walking over to parking block, sticking her finger down her throat and vomiting for what seemed five minutes.  I thought to myself.....odd.  Should I be disgusted and perhaps throw up myself?  NO WAY!  It's Vegas and DT is awesome.  I just want to say in closing, who knows where the female came from because I was a few lots away from the DT I had just ordered from.  It appeared to be a total random act of barfing and not related DT what so ever."}
{"text":"Not too sure what else I can say about DT but that I'm addicted to it. I eat here a couple times a week because it is quick, cheap and tastes as good as you can get for a Mexican fast food chain. I always get coupons in the mail and use all but the chicken ones because why people come here for chicken is beyond me. This last time I used a coupon that got me a macho combo burrito for just $2! I was all over that. I change it up from time to time and get it either double wrapped, or all beef no beans, maybe some extra red AND green sauce, it just depends on my mood. The macho combo burrito is filling and not intended for the weak. My wife has a hard enough time finishing a half pound burrito and usually just sticks to the value bean and cheese burrito for only .50 cents. It was Tuesday taco night so I got 6 soft tacos (3 no lettuce for the fur-baby) as well. taco night is every Tuesday from 3pm - 11pm and regular tacos are 3 for $1.09 or you can upgrade to 3 classic tacos for a $1 more. My tacos were as good as always. I also tried this new crunchtada tostada. It tastes like the tostada they already have on the menu, but you can get it with beef or chicken if you don't just want beans, cheese and sauce. The crunchtada was just ok.

DT offers different breakfast deals that are worth checking out. Save your receipt to use for a free 1/2 pound bean and cheese in your next visit. Don't forget to save room for caramel cheesecake bites."}
{"text":"They have an exceptional manager.  Great food as always.  Clean bathrooms kitchen and lounge.  Excellent store."}
{"text":"I only came here to purchase a breakfast item for my friend.  Not really into this types of fast food.  It located in a great location, just not very popular at the time of my food purchase."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've had.  Beer battered but hopefully the fresh veggies in the taco helped offset the fact I was eating fried food.  Very clean restaurant with American and Mexican food choices.  Cheap too."}
{"text":"Everything is wiped down very nice.  Staff behaves very well in the back kitchen, by keeping their back kitchen conversations to a low level without any inappropriate words/conversations that one might pick up in every other.  Plenty of selections. Everything was well made. the produce looked fresh, and everything actually looked like the freggin picture. lol"}
{"text":"I love this del Taco locations in Summerlin and town center the help is very professional meticulous gracious they aim to please the customer and it shows I recommended highly"}
{"text":"I been to this place several times. Every time I been there the food has been good for a fast food place. The first time I went there I was surprise of amount of food you get. So far the only problem I have had is the lack of communications when I ordered my food. I though I was ordering a few items but I ended up getting a meal. It was OK with me I was hungry. Live and learn when you go to a new place."}
{"text":"This one is not about the food as much as it is the service. While Del Taco's food is quite solid and the carne asada street tacos are actually quite legit with avocado, this is about the service. Staying at South Point, I visited this Del Taco twice and was served twice by Javier. Dude was super friendly, made recommendations, and told me his personal favorites. I followed his suggestion on my second visit and the food was outstanding. Javier definitely has the skills/personality to be a server at a nice sit down restaurant, but no matter what his career path may be, it definitely seems like that guy has some potential!"}
{"text":"Ordered a small amount of food. (A few taco) and they they forgot part of my order purposely. Usually wouldn't care but it was the second time this location has tried to stiff me."}
{"text":"SO I come here all the time and NEVER had to deal with such stupidity and unprofessional jerks untill Now ! First of all they should have a person who knows how to actually explain the menu right and will inform you and 2nd someone who isn't rude and act like you can't hear them talking crap when you pull up to the widow . They had a little kid name ANDREW taking the order who was rude listen kid if u can't take a order correctly or nicely then don't be on headset I work for fast food also and I make 11$ to make sure customers are complete satisfied and never speak shit about a customer no matter how frustrated you are ( at least make sure they can't hear you) the manager on shift was MANNY was letting him speak and act this way too he even acted like I was the problem and they did nothing wrong. Most unprofessional business at night during the day the know how to act right I come here ALOT night shift sucks if u can't take a order nicely or even put hotsauce after asking twice then customer service Isnt for YOU KID and MGR MANNY."}
{"text":"First timer, I came in through drive through, super fast and friendly! Was looking for something healthy and they have these really yummy veggie bowls, rice, beans, avocado , and grilled chicken."}
{"text":"#1 - They messed up my order. I ordered 4 Del Classic Tacos, and the lady charges me for 4 Del Classic Burritos. It's funny, because before i ordered - I questioned the ditz if they still had Del Classic Tacos, and she said yes.
#2 - After waiting 20 minutes and watching others who ordered after me getting there orders, I went up to the counter and told the ditz that I would like a refund. My number was #31 and you just served #36.

NO EXCUSE. WORSE DEL TACO in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The best DT location in town! Old school locals know what this building used to be and we welcomed DT when it took over and decided to make its presence known (incorporating menu items from the previous business) in Vegas years ago. Yes the location is smaller but the building is older. They have never messed up my order here and it's always hot and delicious. The manager has been there a long time and gets to know her regular customers. She welcomes you like family no matter if you come inside or use the drive thru. It's crazy that a fast food place can do that but that's what I've experienced for many years at this location. On taco nights the drive thru can get backed up but it goes by quick so don't hesitate to stop if it looks long."}
{"text":"If I was stuck on a desert island with just one menu to eat from it would be from Del taco.

God only knows how many times I have eaten chicken soft tacos, quesadillas with extra green sauce and 99 cent red burritos with extra cheese.

As for this location...

Never had any problems with the drive-thru.  As far a presentation and packaging for the meal it was good as good gets a going through a drive-thru. This is the reason for the three star rating.

As for dining on the inside, well that's another story...I won't do it again.

On a recent outing I stopped in to have lunch.  Retrieved my order and went to sit down to eat.  It was then that I noticed the tweaker sitting there with no food charging his cell phone on an outlet in the dining area.  He left shortly via the back door shortly after I started eating.

Next was a vagrant that snuck in via the back door.  He tried sneaking up to the drink machine to fill some jug that he had brought in with him.  Some how someone in the back noticed him.  They told him to leave and he did cursing them out as he left through the back door.

That back door is not safe, it's dangerous, don't eat inside!"}
{"text":"Had to make a run to a truck stop to pick up a part for a project that I was watching my buddy do.  I also had to pick up some chow for the boy.  Figured I would go to the ole' faithful that is DT.  I was in a happy place so I did not care if it was Friday night and the location was on the strip. Despite all the cars this place is dialed and the line moved right along.  The servers were super friendly to boot."}
{"text":"Del taco today=crap. Been here a dozen times. Usually late at night.  Always drive- thru.  Nice, friendly staff.  And that's over the intercom. Speedy.  Order always correct.  Never any issues except for tonight.  Boyfriend wanted \"mexican\" fast food;I wanted a burger, so what better menu than del taco to order from? I should have known to stick to the \"mexican\" menu than to venture out and order a burger from del TACO. It's all in the name. His quesadilla and bean burro were good, but my cheese burger was awful, and fries ok.  The burger wasn't cooked to order.  Bread was hard and stale, cheese was over-melted, patty was too thin and dry, shredded lettuce and tomato were a mush with the sauce they slopped on.  Overall, disappointed.  I know better for the next visit."}
{"text":"Love Del Taco here for the following reasons

Awesome Burritos

Some of the best fries around

24 hour drive thru

Price is right

Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I love their fish tacos!!!!  The drive-thru at this location is not always consistent when it comes to efficiency but it does look like they are trying... at least they are nice.  I don't really like the other stuff I have tried here...such as the chicken soft tacos.  Also, for some reason I think it is weird that they serve fries with tacos.   4 stars for the fish tacos!"}
{"text":"I was so happy that they opened a Del Taco by my home.  I was soooo disapointed!!  I have been a total of 6 times.  I have never waited less than 20 minutes in the drive thru.  I always get chicken soft tacos (my Favorite)  They put half the chicken in the taco that the Del Taco on Durango and Farm puts in.  They only put a light sprinkle of cheese.  Some of my tacos only had 3 small pieces of chicken in them.   I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"6/1/14
Previous comments still stand.  One of the best managers around.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I always order the hard shell tacos and it has been always delicious. They are not cheap on the cheese, tomatoes, and sour cream. They'll give you plenty. The beer battered fish tacos are one of my favorites. 

I'm really glad that there is a del taco near my place!  I've only been to drive through and never had a problem with them."}
{"text":"I LOVE del taco. The only reason I come to this location is because there isn't one closer.

BUT THEY HAVE THEE W O R S T CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER EXPERIENCED. Me and my bc come once a week,and its the same service no matter who works"}
{"text":"New location right across from my job so I gave it a try. Walked in. Kid at counter looked scared as heck. Ordered and was told fryer was down so no fries. Dang they got the best fries around!! Manager says they can offer chips n salsa. Ok no biggie. Pay for my order and find out he charged me separate for everything I got instead of meal price. And charged me for chips n salsa. Have to say the epic burrito was amazing. Went back following week cause co worker wanted del taco for birthday lunch. Ordered food. Got back to office and everything was wrong. Didn't get my order. Staff needs some help with training. Food tasted amazing again tho!! Won't go again unfortunately. Don't like being overcharged 2 times in a row."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco but I'm from Southern California where these are as Californian as In-N-Out. This one is attached to a gas station in a ganky part of town but they have a couple of plusses.
1) Del Cheeseburgers - better than any BK or McDonalds monstrosity, they're like a homemade backyard burger with fresh tomato, cheese and shredded lettuce. If youre gonna do drive through in this area, try one
2) Deluxe Chili Cheddar Fries. Crinkle cut fries, chili, cheese, sour cream, diced tomato and onions. So good. Love these.
3) Epic Grilled Chicken Avocado Burritos. HUGE and they have big slices of real avocado. Gives Chipotle a run for their money!

Plus 3 tacos for 1.09 on Tuesday. Can't beat that. The drive through isn't bad and you're right back on the freeway!"}
{"text":"Ordered tacos in drive through in a combo and when I got home it was a burrito (and the burrito was not good).  I went back the same time the next morning and ordered the tacos and i just asked if I could get a discount since they screwed my order up the day before.  The owner/manager comes to the window and accuses me of lying.  Like I'm going to lie over a $5 taco order?!?!??   I told him forget it, I'm not going to argue over $5 I will drive next door to Jack in the Box.  The guy is a total douchebag.  I regularly have fast food places screw my order up and they always apologize and try to make it right.  But THIS GUY...oh no he's a gangster so he's going to show me.......idiot."}
{"text":"This review is for February 7, 2018 the time is 10:32 P.M.  This information is for the genera manager, and the district manager.  LOCATION W. Lake Meade.  The boy working there was to busy talking and laughing with a female employee to even get our order correct.  We were waiting while he was completely milking time screwing off!  He did not give us what we ordered, he charged (for the steak carne Asada) wet burrito dinner.  But he put a chicken verde burrito in the bag!  This isn't the first time so we won't be going back. Horrible service and also every time we've been there the shake machine is down OR BROKEN!  This place is a joke....the employees are ridiculous!  Maybe the managers and district mgr's aren't  caring enough to hire decent employees. But you've LOST OUR BUSINESS...and judging from the lack of stars.. Corporate should be informed.  PATHETIC PLACE!"}
{"text":"Not coming here ever! Service has an attitude, just wanted ranch but they also charge 50 cents but I don't mind paying, just don't give me an attitude"}
{"text":"10 times better than i remember , very fresh food and efficient workers , if u gave this location a bad review in the past i recommend to try them again they recently remodeled the interior too with very comfy chairs and nice paint !"}
{"text":"No bueno. I liked the fries but that's about it. Maybe I didn't order the right thing but so far I'm not impressed at all. The tables were all dirty and iwont be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I absolutely love Del Taco, they have the best quality to frugality ratio of any fast food. That being said, this location is utterly abysmal, frequently providing food that I would categorize as disgusting, and at worst inedible. I was elated to see a location open so close to me, but it seems their staff are completely incapable, bordering on criminally stupid as the food quality and service is ALWAYS unacceptable. I keep going back because I keep wanting to give them one more chance, but every time they produce terrible food. Want a quesadilla? Hows a cold, unmelted and uncut cheese roll sound? (literally every time) Its yours! Want a burrito? Let us make sure its rolled as loosely as possible and falls apart immediately. Some tacos? Lets stuff those full of lettuce that is wilted and has obviously gone unrefrigerated for who knows how long!

Long story short, this has to be a problem with management, as this location is universally regarded as terrible, as the Yelp reviews already show. Get your business together, this is an embarrassment."}
{"text":"I mean, it's Del taco so what do you expect? Decent prices for greasy fast food, but always good (although never good for you). Breakfast burritos are always on point and if you ask them to grill their bean and cheese burritos, you will find your new cheap addiction."}
{"text":"If your sign says 24 hour drive thru- make sure it's open 24 hours- freaking bullshit! Corporate gets a call tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of all things Delta Tango.  It is my menu for life if ever stuck on a deserted island and I could the proverbial \"one\" or multiple things.  This particular location is surrounded in a moat like fashion by the drive-thru.  If your going into dine, you have to walk through it.  I arrived on cold and windy day, looking for chow for me and some to take home to the boy.  The line seemed short (one vehicle) but little did I know, that one vehicle had ordered..it seemed everything on the menu.  I waited....waited...more vehicle behind me...and then we all waited.  In other fast food establishments, this sort of customer is told to park and the food will be brought out to them.  NOT HERE, but maybe they should take a look into this policy.  After waiting almost ten minutes, the thought of rolling through the drive-thru and seeking chow elsewhere danced in my head.  I took multiple breathes and had it not been for the pleasant demeanor of the Anna Kendrick doppelgänger, I would have done just that.  Despite the slow service, the chow is as Del Taco does."}
{"text":"Pulling into this location was a trip down memory lane for me.  In the late 90's, I used to gorge myself here, while on a very tight budget.  As the years went on and the budget became a bit broader, I would pass this DT many, many, many times but would never stop.

While out and about recently, I though I would stop and check it out.  I can't eat as much as I could in my 20's, so I ordered two simple items.  A bean burrito with extra cheese and a chicken soft taco.  This service was quick and friendly enough.  Of the two items, the burrito did not have extra cheese, and the chicken soft taco was limp.  By limp, I mean a DT chicken soft taco that was marginal at best.  Not enough to hate....but enough to leave one wanting.

Thanks for still being here.  Thanks for taking me back to a familiar place as I devoured my chow on a near-by side street.  But as for the DT is as DT does...My meal could have used a little more love in it's preparation."}
{"text":"Takes 25 mins for a chicken bowl. Would have left but I was stuck. This was what I got, when I oreder a CHICKEN bowl. Thanks. Never going there again."}
{"text":"For a Del Taco, this location is awesome. I always go through the drive thru and their customer service is great. They are patient, try to save me money, and always have my food hot and ready when I get to the window! The workers are always nice, which is not what I would expect from a fast food joint like this. The only complaint I have is the new queso blanco they have only comes in a 2oz serving :( but this is not their fault, something corporate needs to change."}
{"text":"This del taco is the worst most disorganized place I have had the pleasure to waste money in in along time. I placed my order the man and he changed it, I explained again what I wanted and again he changed it, every time I told him what I wanted he changed it back to I guess what he wanted. I never did get the correct food and explained the situation to the manger and he and the man who took my order explained that I ordered wrong. So with del taco you can order anything you want as long as it is what the guy taking your order wants you to have.  Never again del taco never again."}
{"text":"This Del Taco isn't in the best place of town. It's also connected to a Circle K. As I pulled up there were various people on the sidewalk, just sitting (keep in mind it's 100 degrees)... a little odd, but to each his own.  Drive in window is locked down, so they had to unlock it to give me my food, and then promptly relocked it as I was pulling away. Interesting... Overall the food was eatable. Especailly considering it was Taco Tuesday so $1.09 for three! Score. If there was another del taco within the area, I would happily never come back to this location again."}
{"text":"I can't stand this place!!! I go here twice a week at least! I always order a chocolate shake! I have never gotten one! I'm always told,\" the machine is being cleaned \"! I go here as a joke at this point. I always tell whoever is with me to order a shake.  We have never gotten one."}
{"text":"The rudest most miserable person I have ever encountered in my entire life works at this Del Taco, on the late night shift, in the drive thru. My receipt says his name is Bonnell, and for the record I do not believe in calling people out by name on yelp, but this employee is seriously mean. You're probably thinking give the guy a break, he was probably having a bad day, but he is ALWAYS having a bad day.  It's a guarantee if you encounter this guy at the drive thru that you would agree with me. I usually only come here during  the late night hours and I dread seeing his grumpy ass! He actually complained to my face about the hour I was there vs greeting me with a hello. When I placed my order he says all rudely how I didn't say what kind of drink I wanted but then repeats the exact drink I said I wanted. I use to take it personally until I saw the car in front of me one time trying to fight the guy, and asking him what time he got off of work. The driver in front of me actually ended up pulling off without his food and he had already paid for it. Another time he went off on a customer for paying with change. Why does this man feel the need to be so damn rude? At this point I would pay Del Taco to fire him."}
{"text":"I ate here all the time, but tonight was the LAST TIME. It's Taco Tuesday, which is usually a good deal, but this is the second week in a row that this Del Taco has made my tacos with far less meat than they are supposed to be made with... If a Classic Taco is supposed to be double-meat, I'd hate to see what the regular taco looks like on a Tuesday. Pitiful, and the service people were rude when I called them out on it... Won't be going back to this Del Taco unless I hear back from them with an explanation as to why they're being cheapskates when it comes to portion size.

Secondly, when you order six classic tacos and an order of nachos, they should probably give you more than one napkin. Absolute cheapskates!"}
{"text":"Great fast food Mexican and way better than Taco Bell.  Fresher ingredients and better tasting. My order came out very fast and correct. Young employees need to be more professional and not be horsing around so much behind the counter. They were loud."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service with a great Mexican fast food experience.   A very clean location as they seem to clean all the time both in and outside store"}
{"text":"My husband's chicken burrito was missing just one ingredient.....CHICKEN!!! He was extremely unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I know. It's Del Taco. But it was so good. I'm tired, hungover and not in the mood to sit in a restaurant and be around people today. Our drive-through order was perfect and error free. They gave us lots of napkins and a mountain of Del Scorcho sauce. Food was hot, fresh and just what we expected. Now I can nap with a full and happy tummy."}
{"text":"Took longtime to take my order. One employee was arguing with another. Food was good though."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the worst customer experiences I've ever had. Workers look like they don't want to be there and it took forever for some tacos.

After drive thru, I had to go inside to the store cause the line was too long again because they forgot to put in an extra taco.

Not like the drive thru wasn't long enough of a wait!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Del Taco in existence. Every time I've come here, I've waited approximately 15 minutes in the drive-thru even if there's just one or two cars. I can't understand how the service is so regularly horrible but it is. Look at all the reviews commenting on horrible service and extremely slow wait times - they are all true. I came here again last night (poor judgement on my part) and even though there were three cars in line I waited 17 minutes (I timed it). Oh and it's very expensive as well. A large #8 which is a drink, fries, tiny taco and medium burrito is $9.25. Go to subway, get a foot long with chips and a drink and you're paying $7.50. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Your typical del taco... Cheap food. Fast service. Clean tables. I love that they serve cherry coke at Del Taco. Goes perfect with the cheese quesadilla (no green sauce) and some fries. The parking lot here is a bit of a nightmare. Came on a Saturday and the drive thru was clogging up everything. Once inside it was pretty quick though."}
{"text":"Had to call and tell the manager to send whoever was ordering for 50 people, because that's how fast the drive thru line was moving, to tell the customer to go wait in a parking stall for their order to be brought out. Then the guy who finally did take my order had to be told three ways what the Taco Tuesday special was. I don't do fast food often, but the coupon in the mail today is going in the trash. I'll never come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered a tostada.  very simple very plain order, I get home and sure enough I open it up and there is absolutely no cheese what is up with that?"}
{"text":"Just used the drive thru but, I did receive fast and friendly service. Tried the 2 for $4 fish tacos no pico. The tacos were came with a wrapped in foil with a lime wedge, cabbage and some sauce. For a fast food taco it was ok and little small. Fries were great crispy and hot."}
{"text":"Nice folks here.  Water is free - not a buck like someone posted.  Tuesday Taco is my favorite.  You honestly can't make dinner for the price!  Carne Asada fries are the bomb.  You gonna love it!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh, another Taco Tuesday at Del Taco and the food is fantastic!  This location, due to the friendly folks and clean floors, is my favorite place to go for Tuesday Taco night!"}
{"text":"Terrible! The chicken soft tacos had barley any chicken, the beans in our bean and cheese burritos were extremely dry (maybe super old) and the churros were not fresh, seemed as if they sat out for a long time or they too were old as the were stale. Choose somewhere else to eat!"}
{"text":"If you're going because either you're cheap or it's too late for a buffet, you won't be disappointed if you're expecting standard Del Taco fare."}
{"text":"I've gone to this Del Taco for years. It's always been consistent with corporate standards.

From day one, the restaurant and parking lot, have been clean. 

I used the Drive Through. It was a perfect experience. 

Anytime I'm in the area, I love to visit this Del Taco."}
{"text":"Good: Prices and convenience; which is essentially the definition of \"fast food\".

Bad: Having been to this location at separate times throughout the years, I can honestly say that I've never had worse food from a fast food chain. I've tried just about everything on the menu, in hopes that not everything can suck. But I was wrong -- very wrong. The meat tastes like taco-meat flavored wet cardboard, the tortillas are stale, and even the chili-cheese fries taste \"off\".

Other Thoughts: I used to work for Del-Taco in California when I was in high school, and I am saddened to think the food I loved when working there will never be available here. I've sworn off coming here since last year and haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Open 24/7!!!  Perfect for when you are getting back to your hotel as the sun is rising on a Monday morning.

Bitch we totally won that bet and you better pay up!"}
{"text":"First off - This place is much better than Taco Bell.  The food is always fresh, the portions are very fair for the price (yes - it is cheap - but it is good) and customer service is good across the board.  Drive thru is efficient, restaurant is clean and they have some good specials during the week (Thursday 3 chicken soft tacos $2 is my recommendation).  Keep up the good work!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here once, just tried the Jumbo shrimp taco, I love it! I have no complaints with the service I got. I don't know why people complaints on small things unless your buying a $10 worth taco I would understand. Anyways, Great Customer Service!!
Food and service wise, AMAZING!
Overall experience is Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are so good after midnight. Maybe cos I'm dying of hunger?"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through last night to get some iced tea. Also ordered a chicken adobo avocado bowl.  The attendent informed is that she had to brew more tea and we decided to wait for it. She was friendly and did her best with the tea, and that is the only reason I gave this location 2 stars.  We waited quite awhile but got the tea.

The real disapointment was in the food. The avocado in my bowl was brown and mushy and the rice wa spongy and overcooked, the portion was quite small for costing nearly 6 dollars.  Very dissapointed. We should have just gotten 1 dollar tea from McDonalds."}
{"text":"People are rageing about the chicken tacos, but don't sleep on the Double Dell Cheeseburger - a damn tasty burger! It goes great with the Deluxe Chili Cheese fries.  And top that 1,000 calorie bad boy with a small diet coke... :)"}
{"text":"chile cheese fries deluxe are recomeneded!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at the service I received from this location on Monday, 05/04/15.  I've gone there quite a few times over the past year, as this is the closest location to where I live.  And, honestly, this is the first time that the service was this bad.  I knew it was going to be a bad experience from the moment I placed my order at the drive thru.  First off, the female taking my order was talking to her co-workers right in the middle of taking my order.  When I got up to the window, she was still talking to them, and only turn for a split second to say the amount: \"$11.47, what kind of sauce??\".  No, \"Hi, how are you\", no confirming what I ordered...NOTHING.  Then, when she handed me my order...she didn't even turn to look at me...still talking to her co-worker, she stuck her arm out the window, not even looking in my direction.  She didn't say thank you or anything.  And, if that wasn't bad enough, he arm wasn't even far enough out of the window for me to comfortably grab the bag without unlatching my seat belt!!  Then, I get home and discover the churros that I ordered had little to no cinnamon or sugar on them, I ordered extra cheese (which I was charged for) and they neglected to add that as well.  Then to top it off, I asked for mild sauce and was given inferno.  Yeah, probably the worst experience I've had with a fast food restaurant in a very long time."}
{"text":"Del taco always has fast service. Just tried the chicken rollers, taste good. Only one dollar each."}
{"text":"Just went to grab some food, they left out my burrito! I did like my extra Ches on taco I received.  Let's make sure all the food is in the bag next time."}
{"text":"Seriously? No hot sauce when asked if we wanted any.  burger patty... so gross.. guess no dinner for me tonight.  So gross."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Consistent with other del taco's in California and good price."}
{"text":"Drive thru experience.  Ordered the double burger with cheese n bacon but asked for no special sauce, I was told earlier that was what they used.  He said the special sauce is like a thousand island of which I again said no sauce.  The guy questioned my request and I said that I preferred mustard n ketchup.  He then stated that the secret sauce is made of ketchup n mayo, as if that would be alright.
I am now amused but a bit irritated at this point as I just don't like \"special\" sauces for my dressing and I feel as if I am on a comedy skit.  Another person came on and said that we don't have ketchup n mustard of which I really don't care and can address the dressing when I get to my address and get out of my dress and just relax!  He then asked about all the other ingredients, of which were never in question, and again stated just the sauce.
Well, I get home, open my burger, take a bite and notice a flavor I have a distaste for and that is the special sauce of which was on there.  My goodness.  And the majority voted to give them a $12 per hour \"expectation\" wage?
I gave an extra star for the burger which was good despite the sauce."}
{"text":"Del Taco, you are clean and your employees are super friendly. I only have one question? WHAT IS THIS MEAT YOU USE? Honestly, is seems to be beef yet, it has the consistency of old fashion paste. You know, the glue like stuff they use in kindergarten. Shivers!
What do you mix in to your beef-like-substance to give it this texture? Baffling!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I don't get drive-thru food often, and my experiences here reinforce that conscious avoidance. Crispy tacos that are cracked right down the middle the second I unwrap them, fish tacos on tortillas that are torn in multiple places and drowning in mayo? It's like they're not even trying to make the food even remotely edible. The gal at the window was nice but not enough to make me want to stop here again."}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest, I'd never had Del Taco. Can't really say I've missed anything: the bag probably had more flavor than the cold, limp fries and unmelted cheese on the all-lettuce \"chicken\" tacos."}
{"text":"It's alright. It gets the job done. You order your food just like any fast food joint, wait for food to arrive, then take it away to your table. Place is clean, but in an odd part of town. I only came here because my workplace is near it. Probably not going to return unless I forget to bring food from home again."}
{"text":"How are you still in business? I ask because as far as drive thru the service is terrible and I get home and the food is terrible as well. Who do you think you are serving garbage to people? Your pandering to the lowest common denominator of people. If I were to go to del taco again, it would only be in California because they at least take pride in what they are serving even if they are serving the same food, which \"quality\" definitely dips in AZ.  Own up to your utterly disappointing moment you claim as \"fresh\". Anyone else reading this, do not go to this or any other location in AZ because you will just be more upset than having not eaten at all. I'd rather wake up hungry than pretend like you satisfied my taco/burrito craving. PS please stop doing seafood! It's always been ridiculously fantastically obscene in a bad way. I would rather spend less money on cereal and milk. Your bad and you should feel bad for the garbage you impose on others"}
{"text":"First off the order taker/cashier also gets your drinks. He used our paper cups to get the ice with his bare money handling hands. (He did wipe them off with a paper napkin.)(Money carries more germs than a public toilet.) All our items were in the bags but... I ordered the grilled chicken burrito; it only had one tiny and one small piece of chicken. No salt on the fries and only hot taco sauce when we asked for medium or mild. I am very impressed...never going there again, maybe never Del Taco again!"}
{"text":"Used to go to this location many years ago without any  service or product issues. However, since 2013 /2014 I have received bottom-level service and a poor product (food quality) on repeated occasions. 3 or 4 phone calls to management over the past year or so have not been returned, thus showing a complete lack of care for customer concerns and loyalty. 

I have been lied to by the staff; I have been consistently overcharged; The food temperature and quality has been lousy; The orders are often incorrect.....and on, and on. 

Went to the Del Taco on Pecos / Windmill instead, and they mentioned that many of their new customers have continuously complained about this location on Serene & Eastern. Will never return to this location - and as for Del Taco, my visits will become less and less frequent."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer. I came here around 1am on  a Saturday night. There was no line at the drive thru but the cashier taking our order was so out of line. She gave us so much attitude, and when my brother told her the attitude wasn't necessary she said \" you can leave then, i'm not going to serve you, bye\". I was so shocked no one does anything about the customer service here, it's always TERRIBLE! We left the drive thru & went to eat at the one in centennial instead, with a better attitude & fresher food. Apparently these employees forget customers are the reason they are even receiving a pay check."}
{"text":"Just come from there getting a burrito!! Been calling no one is picking up so I guess I'll just Charge it to the game and never go back!! But the Rice inside was really really hard as well as the fries was completely just nasty! But every time I go here it's like they can care less about the food smh but this is it for me."}
{"text":"Update your hours. We just drove 20 minutes to this location being closed when it's posted online open till 12 am."}
{"text":"Our first night in Vegas we were out searching for a late night meal. We found Del Taco in the food court not too far from MGM. I had the taco salad. It was ok. It got the job done."}
{"text":"You need to employ enough people to not have to wait 19 minutes for \"fast food\"... this is after I wasted 7 minutes at the camelback location for the same reason. I hate this place!"}
{"text":"The service is always fantastic, but our order is almost never correct. Usually not a big deal-a taco or 2 or the wrong taco. Tonight however, we were missing 2 tacos and fries. We got in the 3 bags 1 tostada & a burrito. We were missing more than half our order."}
{"text":"The customer service was good. The staff was very friendly. That ONE star goes to them. Besides that, it was not so good. Multiple times our order was completely wrong and we never receive sauce, even after asking several times when we order. I have (finally!) learned my lesson and won't be back!"}
{"text":"I just ordered my food and I saw the cashier who may be the manager with Red hair wipe her nose with her hand. I hope she is not preparing food yuck! Also another girl who was sweeping touch her nose and grabbed a cookie and did not have gloves on or wash hands. Thank God the girl that was serving my food had gloves on."}
{"text":"I love this location as it is near my home and always has great service ! I'm vegan and I often have picky and complicated orders. They workers here are always courteous and provide excellent customer service. When I allow myself to splurge on the fries, I always want then we'll done and crispy. This is the only location that gets it right the first time around. 
The drive through I also fast and accurate here. 

I enjoy the 8 layer veggie burrito without the cheese and sour cream. They are currently 2 for 5$. My wife enjoys the fish and shrimp tacos that are now available.  Try the 1$ strawberry lemonade with real strawberries, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Very disapointed. My husband and i love del taco. We go to del tacos everywhere.  This is my first time here. Being on a trip, stopped for lunch and had to run to the restroom. Took them about 13 minutes to even come to the counter to unlock the bathroom.  They got the guy next to us order wrong and were rude about it. Very sad about this visit."}
{"text":"Normally pretty happy with their food so stopped to get breakfast burritos. My wife order eggs cheese and bacon, I ordered carne Asada cheese and eggs. Got home and both burritos we're slathered was red sauce that completely ruins the flavor, we neither asked for or were told that this crap would be put on the burritos. We ordered exactly what we wanted and should not have to tolerate that someone else wants to put on their food the completely destroys the flavor of the food. My palette enjoys food not the taste of chili powder, it has its place just not in my breakfast."}
{"text":"Love Del Taco but not this location.  

Same food, crappy policies.   Charge $1.00 for a water cup!!!   Bad business!!! Not coming back here."}
{"text":"I really love Del Taco and will continue to go to them in the future. This review may seem trifle but maybe it will help out. I love their Steak Asada Tacos, and I especially love them because they add a slice of lime! Yum! Every other DT I go to adds the slice of lime.   This location on Serene use to, and now I have to ask for it. But every time I ask, they don't add it. 

Sorry to sound like a such a complainer over something so small, but I've given them every chance. C'mon guys! I know you're awesome and the staff is great. That's why I love to come here :)"}
{"text":"I purchased two Del Tacos from this location with a coupon for buy one get one free. Upon receiving my food I remembered that I had received a birthday email from your establishment for a free premium shake. I advised the employee, Maria of the email and placed my phone on the counter so that she could read it. She looked confused and seemed to question the authenticity of the email. Once she was done reading I picked up the phone and read the email again myself thinking that I may have missed something. I realized that there was a button to view the actual coupon with the barcode in order to scan for the free shake. I clicked on the button and then placed my phone back on the counter for her to scan. She hesitated to even give me the shake and made accusations that the email was not legitimate from your establishment. I assured her that this was how the email was sent to me and showed her the barcode to scan. After attempting to scan the barcode for a few minutes she asked me had I used the coupon previously and that was most likely the reason why she was unable to get the coupon to scan correctly.  I assured her again that I had never used the coupon and prior to the look of confusion on her face I did not even read the portion that said \"click here for coupon\". In the end  she was unable to get the coupon to scan and had to override the transaction in order for the purchase to be completed. She asked for another individual to validate the receipt by placing their signature on the receipt and then proceeded to accuse me of attempting defraud your establishment by using a coupon for a free shake multiple times. What is really sad about the situation is that she did it in Spanish with her other coworker not realizing that I understand the language and it is spoken in my home. I was embarrassed in front of my coworkers. We patron this location numerous times during the month and there is always an issue with the individuals working during lunch time. Especially from the management. I also live less then 3 miles away and this is our Del Taco of choice. Apparently I need to rethink my choices. My family is Hispanic. This issue is in no way a race issue but a respect issue.  If there were truly a concern then it should have been addressed with me directly and in English because that's the language I was speaking at the time of the transaction. Also I think there needs to be a lesson in intelligence. Just because I am dark skinned and I look black does not mean that I do not speak, comprehend or read any other language. Prejudice comes in many forms and what I experienced today in your establishment was just that. I do not through the work racist out there because I think it is a term that is over used or abused but I will say it is a fine line because I wonder if i would have gotten the same treatment if I looked to be a traditional Hispanic woman in her opinion."}
{"text":"Have a designated driver? This place is perfect for the indiscriminate drunk looking for something cheap to sop up the booze before passing out. I've been going here for many years though not in a long while. They still have a dollarish menu. I was a little surprised about how proud they have gotten with some burritos near the 6-7 dollar mark. My last visit was disappointing. They were not crowded but the wait was almost 15 minutes inside for a simple menu item and two soft shells. Opening the food one could tell it was hastily put together with what appeared to be hand torn lettuce. The capper was little bugs in the bottom of my cup. I didn't bother bringing it to anyone's attention as these were the little gnats always by the drive-through windows. Once again perfect if you are having a late night and looking for sustenance, but with so many better places why bother?"}
{"text":"Visiting from another state, so I have never had Del Taco before. The service was typical fast food, at or slightly below McDonald's take on service. Restaurant was very clean. This rating is basically off of food quality. First I do not understand why you would put taco and fries together and call it a combo, that's weird. Second, the taco quality is lower than taco bell. 

Basically avoid unless you  are drunk and looking for a burrito at 3 am."}
{"text":"Best hangover food on the planet! Their Macho Beef Burrito is fantastic! I like all of their Mexican items as well, but the burgers and American fare is just OK, nothing to talk about one way or another. Its clean and bright inside if you decided to dine in."}
{"text":"Longest wait in Las Vegas....this location needs help!!! I keep giving them the benefit of the doubt but every single time I'm disappointed.... my order is almost always wrong and the food is always presented sloppily."}
{"text":"Open 24/7.. but you can only get breakfast certain hours.
We ordered red bean and cheese burritos with extra cheese. Wow they loaded them with cheese!! 
For a quick bite this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"This store was very dirty despite a worker trying to clean the lobby. We ask for well done crispy fries and received extra greasy soggy fries. The workers weren't very friendly or helpful. Next time, I'll use the drift thru to avoid more interactions with them."}
{"text":"I went through the the drive through for my colleagues and I. I'm vegan and ordered something without cheese and sour cream. The lady taking my order repeated my order twice correctly. When I arrived to my work to eat, there was tons of cheese and sour cream. I called the store, as I was upset at not having a lunch. They were very friendly and apologetic about the situation and gave me a credit at their store. Fantastic customer service Del Taco! Kudos to you! One happy customer even though I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is stuck in 1989.  The people who work at these places don't understand why someone would want to sit down and use a laptop computer for an hour or so... Hello!.... You guys offer free wi fi.... So, the people who live in 2014, may want to use their computer and the internet. This store has Blocked all the electrical sockets so, you can't plug in your laptop. The Del Taco in Los Angeles welcomes laptop users. Las Vegas thinks you are strange if you spend time using a computer..."}
{"text":"I have been to Del Taco 3 times and each time I have had the Guacamole Fish Tacos.  They are really good.  The fish is always crispy on the outside and flakey on the inside."}
{"text":"We ate here two days in a row because I could not believe that this establishment was actually this clean and the staff were this nice. I was totally wrong. The same young man who took my order the night before was here again while on my way home. Still nice as can be and was constantly busy from behind the counter when there were no orders to be taken. The establishment was clean and even smelled clean."}
{"text":"Never knew this Del Taco was here until my husband got lost trying to head back up the hill toward home. Found this little cozy hidden gem. The staff were extremely nice and helpful when asked for changes on certain platters. I look forward to returning to this place again."}
{"text":"Pulled into drive thru at 11:45 (closed at 12) with 2 cars ahead of me. When my turn came, nobody was answering at the drive thru. Pulled up to the window and the lights were turned out and it looked like everyone was either hiding or left. On one hand, I'm really irritated but on the other hand, I guess I didn't really want diarrhea tonight after all"}
{"text":"I love going to this place because it's cheap good food.  Were talking fast food here, so don't think that 4 stars means this is gourmet dining...it's clearly not.  But, for the money and the amount of food, you can't go wrong.  I love the double beef double cheese tacos, and the macho nachos are awesome.  Way more cheese on the tacos here than Taco Bell.  Overall pretty good food, nothing special about the service because it's fast food what do you expect."}
{"text":"4 cars in front of me and it's been 20 minutes in the drive thru. Still have one car in front of me. The only reasonable explanation for this is that there's one persons working behind the register AND the food line. Mortifying. Last time I came here they charged me double and told me to call a number to fix it which never amounted to anything. Horrible service. Mediocre food. And ridiculous wait times. Avoid"}
{"text":"This place was smoking busy and the kid Hyden took care of everyone like a champ!! This is customer service at its finest and Hyden is a first class worker. He was so professional even repeating every order and such a great attitude even when it was so crazy busy. Thanks Hyden keep up the good work, you're going places!"}
{"text":"Should have known right away to get out of here after drive through woman had to ask whether they use white or dark meat in their chicken burrito. She assured me it was all white, but she was all-wrong as a giant piece of thigh meat spliled out of the poorly constructed item upon opening. This was one nasty burrito that went untouched. Crinkle cut fries were goo reheated, but that's about it from this taco hell hole."}
{"text":"OK so I was a little nervous going in there... I mean my picture is on my yelp profile... What could they do to my food to make me not come back.  But!  I went to the manager on swing shift and showed her my yelp review.  My fries have been better but still not AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Definitely go here on GRAVEYARD!! My fries were surface of the sun hot! And everything tasted fresh! The lobby unfortunately is no longer 24 hours but they have an outside sit spot."}
{"text":"Slow service and rude employees. When once when the manager was there and she didnt care about my issue and didnt even attempt to fix it."}
{"text":"Best del taco on earth. Period."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it wasnt good. Got 2 egg burritos, 2 bean cheese 1/2lb burritos and bun taco. The flour torts were dry and hard one cracked while biting into and sauce squirted out all over shirt. The bean burritos were NOT 1/2 lb and hardly any cheese and the bun taco the bun was dry and hard/crumbly and the meat tasted old!!! No reason for this on the food they werent even busy!! I will second guess before coming to this location again. This is the second time this has happened and all that is said to us is OH.."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short. Ordered a classic grilled chicken burrito this past Monday. Within 40 minutes my stomach didn't feel right. I had to go home from work because I couldn't tolerate the pain anymore. I vomited in my car and about 6 more times at home over the next 2 hours. I continued to throw up/dry heave the next 36 hours, and had diarrhea for three days. It's been 4 days since this happened and I am just now feeling a semblance of normal. I will never eat from Del Taco again, nor will I recommend it to others."}
{"text":"We've been eating from this location for years and it's always good! The food is prepared to order, my order has never been wrong and the food is always hot and fresh. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Didn't give me a straw. Didn't put the lime in the fish tacos. The fish missed the tortilla and was sticking out a whole out the side of the aluminum foil The cabbage missed the tortilla. No lemon in my ice tea. I love Del taco but these folks are not paying attention"}
{"text":"If you choose to go thru drive-thru expect to have vagrants walk up to your car and ask for spare change. Del Taco does nothing to stop this."}
{"text":"This del taco is never consistent with the way they prepare food.  I ordered carne asada fries twice, and the first time they were decent but the second time they were horrible.  Only \"5\" pieces of meat and the rest was soggy fries with cheese. Wth!!! Who actually even bothers to add meat. If I had a count on how much meat they put just at glance.  Then there is something definitely wrong.  Won't go there again."}
{"text":"I love this location.  I really only go there after work if my husband and kid want quick tacos and chili cheese fries for me. The fries are always delicious and the guy at the window is so nice and authentic when he smiles and greets you. I will never know if he's had a bad day because it never shows. I wish we all were like him and made customers feel appreciated."}
{"text":"Very good food. Hot and fresh. The best taco joint I've been in lately. Friendly serviNo complaints."}
{"text":"Good food. Fresh, high quality and good service. Typical of a Del Taco in this city. Once you get used to eating fries with your tacos it becomes a great idea. They role their burritos funny and I always re-role them."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this Del Taco and they always do a great job, sometimes there are mistakes but it happens but more importantly they take care of the customer efficiently."}
{"text":"Love DT and this location is one of the greatest. Not just clean but really friendly people."}
{"text":"The name of the so-called \"steak and potato\" burrito should be changed to the gristle and french fry burrito. It was so awful I gave it to the dog. It literally was some form of tough meat and french fries wrapped in a tortilla."}
{"text":"Staff is rude food is not good. I have been there a few times and have had to take fries back because they were so old or had to go get the rest of my order. Go to another one much better service and better food"}
{"text":"When I come through drive thru @4:30 am ... Im greeted by  Kyara  And she is always a pleasure...awesome customer service. Food times need to be faster but the food is great so it's worth the wait. Thank you"}
{"text":"So I don't know if my tortilla was supposed to be cooked, but my 6.00 burrito had a goey tortilla and was pretty luke warm, not hot. Definetly not worth my money 
I never leave reviews on yelp but dont come here and get the extreme burritos"}
{"text":"Squeezed a couple minutes to grab some fish tacos and fries via drive thru And the lady taking my order was extremely welcoming, hospitable and you can tell she was smiling  by the tone of her voice. Soon as i drove up to the window to pay, they had my order ready in my hand, with all the sauces, straw n napkins.
Thats what you call excellent customer service. keep it up!"}
{"text":"Always slow or understaffed. Orders come out correctly. Kids working are always kind. The French fries are my weakness. The drive thu is poorly built. Many times you will see ppl backing up and re attempting the turn. Also exiting is sketchy they have a bar and stores as you exit and often people are parked randomly (parking lot is not well defined) and this makes it difficult to wiggle your way out 
I love Taco Bell but honestly the food here is better"}
{"text":"Happy to say that customer service is back at this location. Pleasant all around. Excellent improvement. They must read the yelp reviews. Rising star! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Used to eat here frequently.

Went in last night and my son pointed out a roach in the soda fountain.

Last trip here. My wife about freaked.

Health department verified the roaches living under the soda fountain, and in the employee room in back.

They sprayed later that day supposedly."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was lunch. After sitting at the counter waiting for my number for along time, I asked about it. The manager gave me attitude and told me he called my number 3 times, which clearly he didn't. I watched same manager very rudely get upset at another customer who got something different than they ordered. He was mean to his employees as well.
Second time was last night. We went to eat dinner. I ordered a meal and asked to substitute fries for nachos. I ended up paying more and getting nacho fries. I didn't bother arguing because I remembered my last visit and seeing that he was still pissed off about something based on him yelling at his employees, I decided to try the nacho fries. I wish they would have put the cheese on the side lime most other del tacos do.
The food both times were good, but whoever this manager is that seems to always be there, he needs to go. He is gonna ruin business for a lot of people. I am thankful I don't have to work there. I am thankful that as a customer I will not go back."}
{"text":"This place has possibly the slowest drive thru I've ever seen. Today it took 20 minutes to get our food with only two cars ahead of us. They also got my simple order wrong. I realized that I've been there several times and the service is always slow and apparently they don't understand \"no tomatoes\"."}
{"text":"I make my visits here few times a week mostly in the mornings for breakfast menu and coffee. I always get great, fast and accurate service here. Awesome morning crew thanks."}
{"text":"the service here is always terrible. the only reason i have one star here is because the food is good, but other than that it is very unpleasant every time i visit. i usually come on my break for lunch at work, and they have made me late quite a few times because of the slow service."}
{"text":"Where else can you get 59 cent tacos at? You get beans, cheese and lettuce on them. The inferno hot sauce is the best here. They told me everything they use is organic so that's definitely a plus. You can get full with just 3 bucks or less. The bean tostadas are pretty good here too. It's like taco bell but cheaper, healthier and just flat out better in every way possible."}
{"text":"Forgot the avocado in my chicken avocado burrito, also I wish the location was cleaner."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst locations in town. Every time I order my food something is missing (night crew). Getting the food replaced is even worse, bad attitudes and arguing. It seems that they do not know that the customer is alway right. Never again will I return to this horrible location."}
{"text":"The place looked clean and the service was fast and friendly. :) I liked how they are showing the fresh food it is a nice touch. I gave them 4 stars for being in the ghetto or I would give it five. The manager was very helpful and the new layout is much better. Tuesday and Thursday are deal days."}
{"text":"Fast drive thru.  Accurate order

This location is kind of off the beaten path an dhas never been busy when we've gone here.  Place is clean and the service is fast and friendly. 
What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The Del Taco chain is like a slightly nicer Taco Bell with better selection, and potentially more \"real\" meat in their meals. I typically don't have any interest in this place unless I'm craving nachos or a crunchy taco.

But the other night, I had zero interest in cooking and a killer fish taco craving. So I picked one up, added on a veggie burrito, and they gave me an extra bacon quesadilla that was a duplicate from a previous order. I wouldn't order that, even if it's priced at 50 cents- it's literally a tortilla folded over some bacon bits with some cheese. No thanks.

Beer battered fish taco is exactly what I like, wouldn't order the veggie burrito again though- cheap though it was. They seem to have recently added a cali asada burrito that I may need to try in the near future- somehow I doubt it'll measure up to the cali burritos I got in the bay area, though."}
{"text":"This was the slowest fast food experience I've ever had I sat in the drive-through for over seven minutes waiting for two breakfast burritos this place really needs to change its name from fast food to slow service"}
{"text":"Ah, Del Taco. It's not great (even for fast food), but it ain't bad. One thing I particularly like is that they serve a mix of \"Mexican\" (tacos, burritos, etc.) and \"American\" (chili cheese fries, burgers, etc.). So if you're craving a mix of items, or are \"dining\" with someone who doesn't want \"Mexican\", this is the place to choose - especially late at night after some drinking. 

My personal fav is the chipotle tacos. They're cheap and tasty. I'm also a sucker for their macho nachos. They also have good hot sauces (those little packets), but I often neglect to remember just how crazy hot their hot sauce is (and I like hot).

This particular location is pretty good. They never mess up orders and the drive-thru is fast.

So all in all, it's not stellar fast food, but it's a-ok and has some decent options."}
{"text":"Just try to imagine for a minute the sheer joy and excitement I felt when I saw they were putting in a Del Taco basically across the street from me. No longer would I need to drive like 5 mins to get to one. Now I would be able to drive to just barely outside my little neighborhood. I felt like I had won some sort of prize.

When I noticed it was finally open, I went through the drive-thru for lunch. My order was perfect and I had one of the absolute friendliest fast food employees ever. My taco future was so bright, I had to wear shades.

But then I came late at night. And then another late night. And then again for lunch. Easily, three of the worst fast food experiences of my life. My order was wrong every time (and in some cases so completely, almost laughably, wrong). And the service (yeah, yeah, it's a drive-thru - but there's still an element of service) was horrible. Just horrible. I have literally pulled up to the window here and had the employee do nothing but hold out their hand. No mention of the amount. No \"hello\". No anything. Just holding out their hand. And no \"thanks\" or any other words at all were spoken either. It was bizarre and, frankly, quite rude. Now, maybe I could overlook that if my order was at least correct. And when the tacos have been correct (but still with other items incorrect), they have little to no meat, crappy lettuce (seemed more like cabbage), and just a teeny tiny little bitty smidge of cheese (like 5 little shreds of cheese). Really? I get that it's cheap fast food, but c'mon now, that was pretty ridiculous.

So tl;dr - First visit was fab. Every other visit has been dismal. You're better off going to the one just a little further away."}
{"text":"I always go to this del taco late at night 1am after work since it's by my house. The drive thru guy is always and was gonna tip him but said he said no it's okay. I ordered nachos and some tacos. When I got home first thing I grabbed was my cheese. I was very upset at what I saw. Are they low on cheese? They also changed cups it use to bigger than this. Please fix it.. I didn't pay for nachos and have little to no cheese."}
{"text":"This location doesn't understand that when a person pays for Macho fry it's not to be half-full, in addition to that they're not personable.   They're quick but that's all I can say that's positive. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"I get tacos on Taco Tuesday because until today, they use to be a good value. I also use to find value in their Macho Fries, however they are starting to get more and more skimpier on the amount of food you get.  I may have to stop eating at any Del Taco if this continues.  No wonder they offer a $1.00 off your next purchase of $3.00 or more.


Management did not offered resolution when I spoke with somebody about it."}
{"text":"Have not had much reason to enter the Del taco world and since they have no white meat chicken that doesn't help their cause. Desperation as I was in a food deadzone led me here for a quick lunch. 
The 99 cent tacos were loaded with decent meat and all the fixings right to the top of the taco.
The medium Del Scorco sauce is not that hot
The min-quesadilla is a good deal at 59 cents
The $1.00 strawberry lemonade has frozen strawberries inside and is refreshing."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru. The guy made us wait 12 minutes for the food with one person in front of us. When we got the food I doubled check to make sure it was correct it was incorrect. The guy Brian said why are you still here we already made your food. I told him the problem, and he was like it's already made. Well it's made wrong first off and instead of me calling and telling you guys messed up my order just fix it on the spot. Whoever the GM is they need to get rid of this guy an get someone who is good with customer service. I cannot believe I was there checking my order and instead of them fixing the issue they made a big deal that the food was already made. I understand you get what you pay for but at the same time I'm paying a buck each  for 6 chicken soft tacos with no lettuce and they can't seem to do it right. On top of that the chicken is skimp. Maybe he's just unhappy in the food business that's why he's like this but don't take it out on people's money."}
{"text":"i love this place i'm all about .39 cent tacos, that's right .39 Cent Tacos that are just as big as the ones at taco bell! They are yummy, and free wifi although it did not work for me -1 for that!"}
{"text":"I will never come back to this location again. Ive been there twice and both times i was dissapointed. The service is slow just as others described. The 1st time we did order to go. We waited almost 30 minutes. Someone who ordered after me got there order before mine and it was bigger. Second i asked for chipotle sauce both times and never got it either time. So on to the next time.. i simply wanted a wet bean and cheese burrito and i was charged wrong first, he charged me for a chicken plato without chicken. They refunded it and when I tried to explain that i wanted a wet bean and cheese burrito they just didnt know what i meant. She (assuming shes a manager ) asked red or green sauce i said red because usually when u ask for enchilada style its red, and that  i would like it on the outside (since they didnt get it)..  I get my order and whoever made the burrito put the red sauce on the inside. after i specifically explained how i wanted it. We also ordered ranch chicken rollers and got the original ones. Im not sure how they can mess that one up when it said on the receipt ranch. Anyway, i decided to write this review after i went to the del taco on lvblvd and silverado ranch and had zero problems on ordering the same item. They made it perfectly without question. So if youre reading this, drive the extra 2 to 3 miles to a different del taco, its worth it !"}
{"text":"I love Del Taco, but come on man there's no meat in this! I used to get the Del Tacos until they started skimping on the meat on those too. Now these \"value ones\" there's hardly ANY meat. Lady at the drive thru window was rude \"Uh huh\" she answered to everything. No hot sauce and no napkins."}
{"text":"Ive been coming to this location for a while. They have such a nice crew there but...
Fish taco, put the damn lime in.... heres a pix of my fish taco the slaw topping was huge whole pieces no pico no cilantro... this fish taco is NOTHING like the fish tacos at the del taco on trop and jones.... im glad i didnt order the platos!"}
{"text":"This location is one of the best Del Tacos ive been to. Many times ive been here and they always have done a great job. Whatever theyre doing they should pass it on!"}
{"text":"Del Taco, in my opinion, is better than Taco Bell. I've come to this location a few times over the last year. Each time I've ordered hard shell beef tacos and enjoyed them each time. I'm not sure why they got so many bad reviews - this is fast food NOT fine dining.

My philosophy on Yelp reviews is to go with the latest possible reviews, over the last year if there are that many to evaluate.

I've had great food at this location over the last 12 months. This establishment is clean, the staff is friendly and food is what they advertise."}
{"text":"If you're thirsty and are craving a refreshing drink. Pick up their 1$ strawberry lemonade. This location is really fast in the drive thru area so you won't need to wait long. I recommend this location because they are clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays!!!! Can I say anything else? If you want a cheap meal on Tuesdays, Del Taco offers 3 crunchy tacos for $1.39. It is crazy. The tacos are crunchy, the meat is savory and the lettuce does not taste like it comes from a bag. I am so grateful that I can feed my family for such an affordable price on alternate Tuesdays! This location is busy, but I appreciate being able to drive through on the way home."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday: 3 tacos (soft or crunchy) for $1.39. You can't beat this price. Our family always enjoys a great deal. Every other Tuesday, we swing by De Taco to score about a dozen tacos. Sure, it is fast food and not super authentic, but hey, it fits the bill and feeds the fam! So, if you want a super affordable meal on Tuesdays, check out Del Taco.

Tip: They have great coupons in the mail if you wanted to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"For Del Taco, a fast food establishment selling high volume, quickly prepared food at low prices, YES it's as good as it gets.  

I go here every so often for their 39 cent tacos or 49 cent burritos for a cheap meal.  They will substitute meat filling with beans at no extra charge too.  The tacos/burros are always fresh, I've never received the wrong item, the staff is always friendly and smiling, and the place is clean.   

I have minimum expectations from fast food places, and this one far exceeds them.   That's my 2 cents.  37 more and I get another taco!"}
{"text":"Went through drive-thru for late Thanksgiving Day snack.  Ordered one of the new \"platos\", Chicken Verde Wet Burrito. The menu board advertised $1 drinks, with plato purchase, in two different places.  Ordered beverage but was told by order taker, Felipe, that he was unaware of $1 drinks. I took a picture of both places the menu board advertised and showed Felipe upon arriving at the window. He again stated that he didn't know how to charge for it on the register.  I asked for a manager and was told there was not one working. He reiterated not having a way to charge for it, asking, \"what am I supposed to do?\"  I offered that good customer service would at minimum be an apology and give the customer a fountain drink until he figured out what button to push. He did nothing to remedy their error. Sad that Del Taco doesn't empower their employees to make judgment calls in the name of customer service. 

2 stars given was for the food, it was tasty, but poor customer service trumped getting higher rating."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Del taco on the planet. Order will be wrong about 90% of the time. They have a new clueless person every time I go back. Heed my warning and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Is this place still open? I keep trying to stop by for breakfast a few times and they are never open. 9:30am on a Sunday and they are closed..... This happens a lot here. Have a backup plan if you come here for food."}
{"text":"Not sure how you can mess up four chicken soft tacos in a fast food chain but they sure made it happen along with some horrible customer service. 
Thumbs up for Dominique, the cashier girl, you and your attitude really shouldn't be working front of house and dealing with people. Even though the way you yelled at the kitchen guys gave us something to talk about for the next two days.
But back to the story..
As we entered the restaurant there were maybe five ppl standing and waiting at the cash register. Nobody was talking, ordering or being helped which was odd. 
We asked one of the other customers if this was a line and he stated \"oh no we are just waiting, go ahead!\" 
As we proceeded on front of which wasn't a line, I greeted the girl, Dominique, who was leaning against a pillar about four feet away towards the kitchen. She alternating played with her phone and her fingernails not giving us any form of acknowledgement. A light nodding with her head would have done the job but she chose to give us the silent treatment which I responded with another \"helloooo\" a bit louder then the first time. She finally raised her head telling us we have to wait. \"Wait ????\" For what?? It didn't seem like she was doing anything productive! 
It was a very odd situation, leaving us uncomfortable and not sure what to do. About three minutes later when we decided to turn around and leave she finally stepped to the register.. \"so, what do you want?\"
Wow what a kind and honest greeting!
I wanted to say something about this attitude but really didn't wanna wait any longer so I just told her our order..
4 chicken soft tacos, two of them with sour cream, please!
Then she asked/said something about beef combo.
I repeated \"no I would like chicken not beef!\"
She repeated : 2 chicken soft tacos and beef combo....
Noooo, again 4 chicken soft tacos. Two regular and two with sour cream!\"
Your total is 3,78$
No miss, that can't be right! Chicken soft tacos are a dollar each that makes $4 plus sour cream plus tax.. 
Dominique responding: \"oh u want them all chicken?? I don't know how to fix this!\"

Then she yelled in the back of the kitchen to make them all chicken.
Dominique: \"we call you when it's ready\"!

We sat down at a table and watched the orders of the other ppl standing there getting fixed and coming out.
I m not sure if I was annoyed or entertained.
We waiting exactly 9 minutes for our four tacos to come out and just as expected they came out half beef and no sourcream!
So we went to exchange it.
Again she yelled in the back kitchen that she ordered all chicken. They kitchen guy responded \"but the ticket said reg. Taco\" and honestly he was right!!! Another four minutes later we finally got the other two chicken tacos. Needles to say the first ones been cold by then. We are still waiting on the sour cream!
Please Dominique get another job! One where you hiding in a closet not dealing with people!"}
{"text":"Georgemeeka on graveyard is hands down the best server I have ever had in a fast food restaurant. My husband and I have been served by her and via drive through many times and she has always gone over and beyond for us. She's always in a good mood and makes us laugh, and the one time our food took a little long, she was so apologetic and went out of her way to accommodate us. She definitely deserves a higher position!"}
{"text":"Typical visit at this place. Food on the floor. Dirty tables and floors. Why am I here?  Oh yea. Lunch.

Update: they let dogs in. Not service dogs. Just any ol dogs. Weird for a minute there I thought I was eating where they prepare food in a sanitary manor. Hmmm. I guess if I bring my giraffe it'll be ok. After all it's del taco. And not just ANY del taco. It's my least favorite del taco. 

So I decided to have 3 tacos cuz it's taco night and I'm cheap. No cheese. None. I think my daughter had one that had 3 whole strands. How can I complain? It's taco night. 

Two stars this time cuz heck it's starting to make me laugh a little. At least if nothing else it fills the gap in the tummy and provides cheap entertainment. Hey I wonder if we can get that dog into a tutu to jump they a fiery hoop or something?"}
{"text":"This location is amazing!!!!!!!!!!  My order is always fresh, delivery is fast (on time or early), food is always hot, and my delivery drivers have all been great!  Highly recommended if you need something fast and easy delivered to you!  They are also extremely generous with the portions you get, as I know some places that deliver really cut corners when they make your food... not here!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I used to go to DelTaco by my college almost everyday with my best friend back in the day. Now, since moving and living in the midwest, I don't have the pleasure to eat such nice and cheap tacos. 

This weekend I decided to take my boyfriend, a midwestern through and through, to try some fish and chicken tacos. We came to the one here in the food court, on the strip, and weren't disappointed. The prices are pretty good and so is the food. I really seem to enjoy the fries here, a lot. 

Why not?"}
{"text":"The fries were stale!!!  They refried an old batch so it was hard!!!  Was there @11:15pm on 3/22/18"}
{"text":"If you want a quick and cheap bite to eat this is the place on the strip. $1.59 chicken tacos and $2.99 for large fries."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru experience! Waited over 30 minutes to get my food & not even a single apology for making the customers wait. So pathetic!!"}
{"text":"No taco meat, no rice and oh hell no on the no beans...! This would be a great place to open a taco stand... This was a terrible place to stop for dinner.
The staff is on the rude side that really set this review on the one star level. Won't be back."}
{"text":"So far I can only review the process-product TBD (but strawberry lemonade for $1 and $1 mini shakes are great! I am excited enough to post this because I am happy to share that a Brand New Del Taco off Spencer near St. Rose Parkway offers online ordering-full menu including $1 and under items quite extensive-Able to feed 3 hungry teens and 2 adults for $24 and that is with desserts and drink extras. Easy to get started-Sign up first and then log in, if you opt for \"Raving EClub\" you get 2 Chicken Tacos Free and a Shake on your birthday.  If you opt for SMS offers you can utilize a free offer instantly on current order. They offer the paperless coupon to be scanned at pick up-most surprisingly is not only the online ordering and easy to navigate menu, (down to the number of sauces & everything is listed at checkout) but payment with card & Drive thru pick up! (on orders $25 or less)
And lastly food is \"Unfreshingly Believable\"....
Anyone else feel weird about that tagline initially? LoL"}
{"text":"Just went through the drive through & got the worst taco ever. I guess on Taco Tuesday's they feel like they don't need to try. 

Don't ever disrespect a taco like this again 

(See pic)"}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure how anyone eats here once they've been inside.  A dirty restaurant is one of the best ways for me to get on my 'list'.

Yeah, this place is on that list.

As a non-native first year med student I just didn't have a lot of time or options so, silly me, I would go here thinking \"maybe the last time was just an off day\".  There were times I'd walk over and over half the tables there had food remains all over them.  Often times there was trash waiting there too.  Well, after a month or so of their off days with terrible, greasy, and just wholly unappetizing food, I decided to finally take a little extra time to bring or travel further for food.

I'm sure it's the healthier option anyway.  For a number of reasons.  I don't think, no matter how busy it gets, that I'll be stopping in there this year."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Del Taco for a few years now and, aside from a sluggish drive-thru and the occasional green/red sauce mix up, haven't had issues. Just went there on a \"quick\" lunchtime run. Had 5-6 cars ahead of me in the drive-thru and somehow ended up waiting 15 minutes to order and another 5+ minutes to get to the window to pay. I watched people who had been behind me in the drive-thru (but weren't trapped by the actual drive-thru like I was) back up, go inside, eat their food, and leave before I'd even paid. 

Gal running the drive-thru totally butchered my order. Different number of tacos, wrong sauces on burritos, etc. Went inside to talk to the manager. Cashier told me they \"weren't there.\" After I refused to simply accept them remaking an already wrong order (was charged for more tacos than I wanted), they grabbed the manager from the front of the food line. Manager was a total *****. Didn't care that their drive-thru was moving so slowly, didn't comprehend that I was charged for things I didn't even want, etc. Simply left it at I could A) Have my order remade or B) Get a cash refund. Told her I used a card and would prefer that to be re-credited. She clearly didn't understand that either, so I begrudgingly took the cash refund just to get out of there. She then threw the food into the garbage and tried to take my receipt. I told her she was leaving me something with a customer satisfaction number, she tried to make excuses, and eventually just handed me somebody else's old receipt.

Will be very surprised if I go back."}
{"text":"Yo so this place kind of sucks because I asked twice for bean  burritos cause I realize the screen read wrong. It read breakfast burritos... So I pulled to the window and i asked  \"those are bean burritos correct?\" Lady at the window said yes.. I drive away and take a bite into a fucking breakfast burrito. I don't feel like it's worth my time to go back and fix this.. I'm just not going to go back."}
{"text":"Del taco is a solid fast food restaurant for sure. They have a great value menu. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was quite friendly. The chicken soft tacos are incredible as are their chicken quesadillas. I wasn't a fan of their chilli cheese fries. They are located all over Vegas and out west. It's def a must try when you get the craving for quick tacos. I'm still addicted to Taco Bell tho but del taco can be a healthy alternative. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I love Del Taco! I've been to many of them all over Las Vegas. I just so happen to work near this location and come In frequently. Jimmy the manager is what really sets this location apart from all the other ones. He is so awesome! He always has a huge smile on his face and is just genuinely so nice. I've sat down to eat and just observed him with the other customers that come through the door and he has superb customer service! I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"My BF and I went to this deal taco location on Friday. Got 2 double dels and fries. Within 2 hours of eating both of us had food poisoning!!!"}
{"text":"Fast food usually gets a bad rap, but I'd say 60% of my visits here are positive.  The other 40% tend to be slow or I have to repeat what I said multiple times to make sure they got the right order.  (\"Chicken\" does not sound like \"beef.\")

Fresh ingredients for the salads, which is always a bonus.  Sometimes fast food salads just sit in a fridge all day and you can kind of taste that, or see that in the sad-looking lettuce leaves.

Good place to go to eat on the cheap, and they usually have coupons in the weekly mailers sent to our house.

Side note: Churros and lemonade don't mix, but I have this awful habit of doing it."}
{"text":"Always a positive, quick experience when I come here. Newer location by Liquor World.  For fast food, my order is always correct (with customizations) and I never have to wait long even when there's a line."}
{"text":"They got the order wrong  for flat bread meal (only giving 1) then we ask may we get the 2nd one and the employee said it only came with one( so one taco a fry and drink cost 9 dollars and 36 cents). So the manager comes out and said oh we got one on the way. Then comes out with the wrong one. Then he got the nerve to take it back and throw it away and told us to wait. 30 min. Later still waiting for that one flat bread steak taco. Then we got it and it is a vegan (no steak) which we paid for..taco.Wow! No words."}
{"text":"Senior discounts, reasonably priced food but the drinks are pricey!  Service was pretty quick!"}
{"text":"I think this is perfectly placed! I love del taco and this one specifically is close to one of my favorite places to go, Fremont Street Experience. Big thanks to staff here !!"}
{"text":"Umm. Why did I go? Waited in the drive through at 8:30 pm and wasted my time. We backed up and left because it took so long."}
{"text":"It's an OK Del Taco in terms of food and cleanliness, but management needs to make sure the kids at the register know about the current specials and how to ring them up. 

Two times now I've stopped in for the \"buy two chorizo breakfast tacos and get a 5 pc. hash browns free\" special and both times the kid at the register had no clue what I was talking about ... in spite of a big sign advertising it sitting on the counter just to their right! Then once I pointed out the sign to them they didn't know how to enter it in the register. Guessing this place has super super high employee turnover, but otherwise it's not bad."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco, and this location is near my house so I go there quite often. The staff is friendly, almost comically sometimes, and my food is usually done quickly with no errors. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend  people clean the grill at the busy hours and ask us to wait 20 min"}
{"text":"Another awesome Del Taco! Located on the strip, upstairs in the big food court building, within walking distance of Luxor, Excalibur, MGM Grand and New York New York. Open 24 hours, and is awesome!"}
{"text":"Not a bad location but they have a tendency to close quite a bit before their posted hours so don't count on swinging thru for late night grub."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Chicken Roller and walked to the drive thru only to be told, we don't want you're money. 
Worst business management I can think of...
Who ever owns this location needs to have a serious talk with the employees. Money is money. You take it in exchange for food."}
{"text":"Horrible frakin service!!!! Wow..  how is it that we order our food and get it after they gave the people behind us there food first
 Then we finally get our food...and it's COLD! Not once did we get an apology nor did the manager come out to see if he could help us in anyway!!!"}
{"text":"Got an iced coffee here and it had a big bug in it. Left feedback and manager called me back saying there's no way it was from their store, basically called me a liar. Offered me a free iced coffee but told her I would never be drinking one again and that was that. So glad they r fine with losing a customer. Guess it's Starbucks across the street for now on, u get what u pay for"}
{"text":"Brand new Del Taco location up in Centennial Hills just off 95 and Durango. Open 24-hours like other locations. Pretty good service and consistent food, always know what to expect from Del Taco. This location is often not quite as busy as the one in Centennial Center, nice to have an option."}
{"text":"I wouldnt give it a star at all order the chipotle chicken avocado burrito without pico de gallo and chipotle sauce and they gave me a chicken burrito without avocado and with pico de gallo. Will never go back to this location"}
{"text":"My experience here two days ago is most definitely biased because I arrived here after cycling for almost 5 hours in 30mph headwind.  My husband and I decided to do a little bike tour (101 miles on Saturday and 80 miles on Sunday) and it turned out that Sunday was super windy, making what should have been a mellow, easy ride into some sort of sick cycling joke.  Anyway, I think I almost cried tears of joy when we pulled into this Del Taco.  The lady behind the counter was really nice and very interested in our trip, our burritos/fries/veggie bowl/cookies/Cokes (we were really hungry!) were all hot and salted well enough to satisfy our bodies' craving for electrolytes.  Ok, so Del Taco isn't fine dining, but when you're tired, hungry, and demoralized from fighting through stupid wind on your bicycle, comfort fast food does the trick.  (The restroom was clean too, yay!)"}
{"text":"My review on this restaurant is solely based on the customer service I received. I have no issue for the food here, I frankly find it delicious.

After I went through the drive thru I noticed an item missing from my bag. I then walked into Del Taco to get my missing item. Rather than getting my missing item, I received an attitude from the women behind the counter. They refused to give me the missing item. 

I'm not upset about having the missing item, but rather how poorly they handled the situation. This will be my final visit to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru. I ordered a fish taco, potato bites and a large water. The savvy salesperson upsold me on two fish tacos for $4 and I ordered entirely more than I could comfortable eat. Good for her on the upsell though. I can't resist a deal. Fish tacos come with a soft shell. I asked for hard. I got a hard shell and let me tell you, that tasted weird together. Don't do that. You'll regret it. 

I got a dixie cup of water. I laughed and let her know I ordered a large water. She gave me an additional dixie cup of water and told me a large cup would cost me a dollar. Um... OK? Overall it was just OK. I don't know that I will be back right away."}
{"text":"Despite being located in a busy area, this location never gets too packed. I like that they're 24 hrs so I can stop by any time I'm hungry. I usually just get their crunchy tacos, chicken soft tacos, or burritos because everything else is kind of mehh, especially breakfast! Their breakfast is no bueno. Their food is already dirt cheap, but come on Tuesday nights for crunchy taco night or Thursday nights for chicken soft taco night for a real steal."}
{"text":"Greatest place ever. Finally a dollar menu that doesnt have ketchup as its salsa.  But man,  everythings a dollar why do they hire security guards.  What are they going to take the mild sauce.  Feliz gringos, chintitos, India's y Moreno's and everyone in between enjoying my culture.  If I owned it,  id be taking everyone's money to the bank,  cause I'm the only Mexican that eats there.  It's a cheap breakfast,  lyft 7 bucks,  5 dollars for breakfast."}
{"text":"My mom and Iwere the only customers in.the restaurant. I walked up to the young lady at the counter who was on headsets taking a complicated drive thru order.
So I waited and waited, you get the idea. While.I was waiting, a guy who is apparently a regular walked in and yelled his order directly to the kitchen. I don't remember if he actually got his food first. We were waiting so long, my mom had to sit down at a table. Finally the woman behind the counter was ready to take my order and apologized for the wait. Maybe they were shorthanded, so no biggie, it happens.
  When we got our food, it was awful. Probably the worst Mexican food I ever had. I had a chicken burrito that was filled with bland rice and tasteless chicken.
Mom had a ground turkey burrito and asked me where the turkey was.
    Why doesn't Del Taco take a cue from Pollo Loco? I've never had a bad meal at Pollo Loco. I can't understand how you can take essentially the same ingredients and have 2 such different outcomes.
 This Del Taco even makes Taco Bell seem like four star dining!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience EVER tonight!  Went through the drive through and ordered 9 tacos: 3 with regular; 3 no cheese and 3 no lettuce or tomato.  Checked them before we drove away and they were all made incorrectly, not to mention there was very little meat in them.  I went inside and spoke to the cashier who said they could remake them for me and apologized.  He even offered me a drink while I waited.  Got home and opened the tacos in which they were ALL made incorrectly AGAIN!  3 of them even had NO MEAT in them.  I was furious as this was dinner for my children.  I called and a woman answered and said she was acting manager for the evening.  She asked me to come back through and they would make it right.  I went back through the drive through and explained the call to the drive through person and he rudely said, \"we don't have a manager on duty tonight!\"  I then said, \"whoever is ACTING as manager tonight.\" He said, \"we don't have anyone acting as manager!\" So I pulled up to the window and asked to see the same person who helped me before.  The guy didn't want to come to the window and talk to me.  I was very upset as no one was asking what the order should be or even talking to me.  The drive thru guy (assuming Dante as that's what's on the receipt says is the name of the cashier; host was Carlos) was very rude and just typing on his register.  Next thing I know he said, \"I just voided the transaction and the money will go back on your card.\"  He practically threw the receipt at me and shut his window!\"  It was so rude and unprofessional!  This location obviously needs a manager on duty at all times because the staff doesn't understand good customer service.  They think it's funny to prank their guests by putting no meat in their tacos.  I will never go to this location again!"}
{"text":"Used to come here late night after clubbing with my sisters all night, the memories!!! I always got the double del cheeseburger... Seething about that Del sauce!!  Now a days, I'm much more of a taco gal. Never disappoints me though, their C.S is meh, but they get my order correct so that's a home run for me."}
{"text":"According to yelp, 3 stars = \"A-OK.\"  This place, for me, is exactly that because it's cheap, convenient, and surprisingly tasty.  How much can you expect from a bean burrito that is $0.99?  Not much, right?  Well, here at Del Taco, the beans are slow-cooked from scratch.  They're not a mushy mess.  Hubby likes the strawberry shakes -- there's REAL ice cream in them things! -- and the chili cheese fries (cardiac arrest on a plate, but you only live once).  It's a great option after a hike, when you're ravenous and want calories NOW.  

I've never experienced less-than-friendly service and you can get as much hot sauce as you want!"}
{"text":"I really wish we had these back home! Yummy food with fresh ingredients. Love the avocado here. I had heard good things about Del Taco from others and was happy to finally be able to try it myself. I was not disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"I tried Del Taco over 20 years ago. I had thought it so bad I have never eaten it since. 

Driving towards home after showing some homes I was about to pass a Del Taco. I thought what the hell time to give it another try. 

Nice clean store, alert employee, no wait. 

The food was fine, nothing special really, but fine if you happen to be hungry and it is there to be had. 

The price can not be beat for what I ate. $3 plus tax. 

I suspect I might be back with less time in between."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm a regular somewhere, I think consistency is super important.
 
I'm such an F-A, for ordering the deluxe chili cheddar fries with cilantro n jalapeños, always and 9 times out 10 it's perfect. Fries are freshly fried and crispy, ingredients are fresh with the right amount, quick efficient service, very welcoming with great big smiles no matter what. That 1 out of 10, they must've used fries from 5 minutes ago. 

Needless to say, out off all the eateries that surround my work area, I keep coming back for the tasty eats and awesome service.

Go del papas! I mean, Del Taco."}
{"text":"I live near this place, so its a quick stop (sometimes). I have backed out and gone to the fast food joint next door on quite a few occasions. The moment minimum wage went up , my 1st thought was GREAT now they get paid MORE to screw up my meals! Awesome! My meal if often incorrect, they will hand me someone else's receipt, or food! I have handed 2 and 3 bags of food back to them, letting them know I am 1 person with 2 items. They have forgotten the drinks, plenty of times. Its a real cluster .... . 
I once got so frustrated with the wrong order, I went inside to exchange it for mine, and the girl at the counter put her hand up towards me as to say , not ready, then got busy with other things.  I said out loud that I got the wrong order, she looked at me as in not understand and remained on the other side of the counter. I then walked out and kept the order which was more than and not what I wanted but my frustration level got too high to wait any longer.

The prices are great! The food is great! 80% of the time the person at the window is kind. I just wished they would get organization and inside manners down."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. Been sitting in the drive thru for 45 minutes! Slowest Del Taco ever."}
{"text":"honestly worst fast food place out there, if I could give this place a 0 star I would. yeah it may be \"real Mexican\" but it's absolute trash. I asked for cheese fries, and what they gave me were terrible soggy fries with cold shredded cheese, I was so displeased that I 1.) paid over $4 for them. but 2.) that when I tried to return them, the manager gave me sass and replied \"umm we Dom have a microwave\" because I wanted them melted. so unprofessional and will never be returning to any del taco again."}
{"text":"Filthy place and poor customer service from this location. I frequent Del Taco. Will not return to this after three trys"}
{"text":"Out of all Del Tacos Ive been to, this one has to be the worst customer service in drive thru. Ordered my food and was told to pull up just before the window? What kind of service is that? Ummm no i think im going to drive to the window like normal people so that i can see my food being made. And then the young girl at the drive thru has the nerve to give off negative vibes along with her attitude, which showed. How do you expect to get respect if you cant give it. Bottom line, if you dont like where you work, go somewhere else. Hopefully management sees this and will do something about the service and their employee."}
{"text":"Food is good I prefer Taco Bell, the meal deal is only $5 good price. Not what would call fast food since we waited in the drive thru for 10 mins more then once and last time the order was forgotten. Oh if you dine in make sure you ask for the sauce when you get your food if you can otherwise good luck catching someone later."}
{"text":"Del Taco...just amazing!  To get 39 cent tacos anytime I want makes me feel a significant inner joy which is hard to put into words.  I would give it five stars if it wasn't for the irritation it will likely cause my bowels later."}
{"text":"Dear Del Taco employee at the drive up window, I am so sorry that I have inconvenienced your day  by saying good morning. No response. Got my change and said thank you. No response.  Got my food and said thank you again. No response. If your day sucks maybe you should have stayed home.  I deal with people all day and always leave my problems at home.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Came the other day and spoke with a cashier that was beyond rude. He was upset I couldn't make an option fast enough, and spoke to me like I was an idiot. Speaking so slow like didn't understand English.

Lastly when I got my food and left I put my hand in the bag to grab a fry and felt that they didn't put the lid on my secret sauce and it was all over everything. Fried, tacos and burger. Gross. Never again. It's sad I like they're food too since it was my first job in high school"}
{"text":"Oh del taco how my heart has a soft place for you. Probably because I used to work here in high school. If you want to know how things are made, feel free to ask. I know all the secretly good items too.

This one in particular always has my order right an the graveyard cashier is always friendly, quick and funny. It's important they don't lose their customer service which many do since the late hour always brings jerks and drunks."}
{"text":"Just. Not. Good. I love Del Taco, done right. It's not here. Service and food quality have significantly declined since they opened. Staff and management just don't care. Food is hastily made and always lukewarm if not cold. Very disappointing. Revising my rating for a formerly great store. It's almost always dirty. No one greets you when you walk in or even at the counter. They seem rushed, disorganized and uncaring. \"We Ran out of napkins.\" No \"sorry\" or \"here's a paper towel\" or anything. They're not putting in the effort to have a nice store. Owners need to step in and reevaluate."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience at a del taco , the cashier Miranda is the worst employee there first of all she had her name tag upside , her attitude is terrible , she gave me the wrong change , dropped my change , got my order wrong. The restaurant is still good but she need further training"}
{"text":"$0.39 tacos?! Yes please.

It's not gourmet. It's cheap and it does the trick. Only a few blocks from the Premium Outlets, it's become a favourite spot to grab a quick bite when I'm in the area.

What I love more than anything is the Del Taco Inferno hot sauce. I use it at a clip of one packet per taco and take some for the road.

Fast and cheap. If you take a cab, be sure to offer your driver a taco or two!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda surprised at the bad reviews on here. I think their  latest taco, the \"DEL TACO\" is pretty decent.  I usually ask for a side of the fresh salsa casera to put on them. The fries are really crunchy and taste good. I haven't had bad service or food here yet. Guess it just depends on the day. I'm a regular customer, and plan on staying one."}
{"text":"After a long shift at Hustler.. I wanted tacos. The African American male working tonight was very smiley and sweet and while I typically hate getting fast food because people have shitty attitudes.. this guy was great :) thank you for actually caring about your job!!!"}
{"text":"Drive thru is the slowest ever..... so ridiculous but I'm not going to Taco Bell 
This cashier is special"}
{"text":"Just an FYI to everyone... this location is no longer doing taco Tuesday all day on Tuesdays. It's only from 3pm on. According to what appeared to be the manager at the drive thru window \"we won't be doing that during our busiest times\"... so go to another location for lunch if you're looking for taco Tuesday. I think that's stupid. It's not about the fact that it's a dollar more for two more tacos, it's the fact that it's been a Del Taco staple of taco Tuesday, and I went with the regular del taco taco Tuesday expectation and was disappointed. Also, they didn't give me my total when I ordered. So I didn't even know until I went to pay and had to ask. Minor pet peeve of mine. Tell me what I'm paying before I get to the window. It eliminates many issues and concerns."}
{"text":"I am big on Food Safety and when I see food safety violations (especially when someone else is cooking my food), I feel propelled to say something. I stopped by here and placed my order. The female taking my order called another employee over who was on the line cooking the food to help her with a cash register issue. The employee stop making the food, walked over and started handling the money and pressing buttons on the cash register. I ordered through the drive through so I can see how nasty the monitor was on the cash register. 

The female that finished handling the cash register issues went back to make the food without exchanging gloves. I said something immediately and to my surprise the original cashier clerk defended her action as if she was scared to correct her. This happens in the workplace a lot. People see others violating rules and dont say anything to \"keep the peace\". 
I was sooo mad, I told the cashier \"Forget it\" I dont want this food and drove off not even negotiating my refund. 

I have eaten here many of time and had great experiences. I just had to post this so the whomever is in charge can round up the employees and remind them about Food Safety and not be to lazy to wash their hands or change gloves when touching other things away from the food prepping line. Customers are watching."}
{"text":"This location is ok. Most of the items are ok. Some even good. The hips are usually stale and the cheese dip old. The staff is pretty slow and not super friendly. It's usually clean though. Giving them a star for that."}
{"text":"I give Del Taco 4 stars but this place 3.  It's not as clean as it should be, the bathrooms are always a wreck, but they DID start putting sauces on the table, which is nice.  The food is a little below par of other locations too.  But when in the neighborhood, I'll go."}
{"text":"This store is a tough call. The food is good. The staff is good. They are very nice.  I see why they do a lot of drive-thru business. The store is old, dirty and tired. I'm not sure if it's a company store or a franchise but the owner needs to revamp this location. It's super dated and not really comfortable."}
{"text":"Two days in a row I pull in there to grab a quick breakfast and I get the same thing I'm sorry our systems are down we cannot take any orders at this time how did they run a business"}
{"text":"Ordered 7 Breakfast burritos at $3.50 each and they were the smallest burritos I've ever seen. I will probably never go back to any Del taco after this. Each burrito was about 4 bites. I have posted a picture to go along with this post and used a sugar packet for scale."}
{"text":"Yup.  I'm actually going to do it.  I'm actually going to review a fast food joint.

I usually always brown bag it for lunch at work, but today I ended up at work empty stomached and empty handed.  I planned on picking up a pre-made salad at Vons, but there was major police action happening outside and inside the market.  Uhhhh, maybe another time...

I haven't had any fast food in months and months, but seemed to remember noticing that Del Taco had added fish tacos to the menu - which is great because I don't eat meat or fowl.  Luckily, there's a Del Taco conveniently located in the same shopping mall.

The drive-thru staff were perky and friendly.  On to the tacos - the battered and fried fish with cabbage slaw and salsa fresca were wrapped in corn tortillas and actually pretty darn yummy.  The fries were kind of meh - but I tend to like fries slightly overdone with some crunch. 

Overall, great place in a pinch."}
{"text":"It says its open until midnight but this place always closes earlier.  Got here at 11:50. No one at the intercom."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for 19 minutes. 7 at the window. Horrible. Not fast food. The manager wasn't cool when questioned."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Del taco experience I've had. Their coffee was not vanilla-ish at all and originally we weren't even going to get coffee we were going to get soda but the soda machine was so disgusting and smelly that we couldn't do it. Their tacos were not as to par and they are usually. The chips were so loaded with grease and salt it was Hardly edible at all. Earliest in the morning we could've possibly been there they had zero french fries that's an abomination. This experience was horrible I do not recommend this Del taco."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner was awesome service and chicken burrito burrito was excellent supper friendly people and thanks for the senior discount"}
{"text":"Del Taco. DEL TACO. Cheaper than taco hell and better. So this place is not in the nicest area but closest del taco to my location. The drive thru is tight squeeze but they're pretty quick. I asked for a quote on quote \"a bag of medium sauce\" and she literally gave me a bag of medium sauce. The food was fresh and I didn't have runs so that's great. I even ordered one of those 1/2 pound ban burrito and I was fine, not even too gassy. I was stoked. Chicken burritos, 59 cent tacos and deep fried cheesecake bites are worth your change."}
{"text":"Best tasting Pico di Gallo anywhere. I add it to my tostado and tacos. It cost $.40 but well worth it. I like the turkey meat. The coffee tastes great always. Mexican food is my favorite and Del Taco is the and their low prices are a bonus. Go try them today."}
{"text":"I enjoy Del Tacos Turkey Tacos with extra cheese. They are low in fat and calories. The service is always very fast. I like Mexican food and most sit down Mexican restaurants can't beet Del Taco. Try a turkey taco today and I think that you will agree with me."}
{"text":"Visited the drive-thru on May 11th 2018. They were extremely rude. I ordered a quesadilla and they just thre it in the bag. Didn't put it inside anything. I opened my bag and seen a tortilla with cheese"}
{"text":"My go-to since I live next door at Elysian Stonelake. Perfect for a late night snack after a night out drinking. I've only ordered through their drive-thru but they're always friendly and quick. Definitely worth a stop and their chicken tacos/rollers are always bomb!"}
{"text":"I frequent this Del Taco a lot. It's one of the ONLY lunch options in the neighborhood where I work. I've always been happy with my lunch. I mean, you can have a filling lunch for around $2.50.  You can't really beat that. The food is always fresh, the place is always clean and the staff is friendly. It's everything you'd want from a fast food joint.  There are some sketch characters around the building some days, but no big deal."}
{"text":"Always friendly and accurate.  When I go through a drive through, I look for two things:  friendliness and accuracy of the order.   Who wants to deal with a grumpy, non-chalant worker after a long day?   Everytime I've been there, they have met me with a smile.   No one wants to get to there destination and find out that they received the wrong order!  This Del Taco has never messed it up.  I do recommend this restaurant's drive through for fast, friendly and accurate service."}
{"text":"I LOVE GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! Got to Del Taco about 6:50 pm on Monday, January 1, 2018. Going through the drive-thru at this location is usually BLAHHHHH but tonight I was blown away. Service tone was delightful, was offered a better deal based on what I ordered (although I said no haha because I like what I like), got my food quickly (which means they were well prepared) and everything was right. I called back to speak with the young man and thank him for being GREAT and again he was ON POINT. This is a great start to a New Year hopefully this kid continues to grow here because I now like this location because of tonight and I've lived in this area for 10 years. THANK YOU FOR BEING GREAT! THANKS TO ANFERNEE FOR BEING A GREAT TEAM PLAYER."}
{"text":"Went there around 4am and received terrible service. The person working the drive thru seemed like he had no idea what he was doing. When I gave him my order I received no response after he read it back to me. I ask him do I move forward or what my total was and all he said was uhhh yeah. Once I moved forward he finally told me what my total was and I paid for the food. Then once he gave me my food he closed the window. I had to try to get his attention because he forgot to give me my drink. When I did get his attention he gave me attitude and then finally had to be my drink. To top it off the drink was watered down"}
{"text":"I can't help it, I love the chicken tacos. Why do they have to be soo cheap & tasty! ?"}
{"text":"Here's the deal. The food is good as always but nearly every time I'm here in the drive thru they forget items in my order. I'd say it's a good 60% chance that something will be missing. I have to go back in and get the missing item. It seems like the reason may be that it always seems that the employees are all over the place at every station rather than having assigned jobs and tasks in a normal assembly style fast food operation."}
{"text":"Ok, when I feel like having fast food and maybe include a fish taco or something, this is a place that comes to mind. I've made the drive here many times but honestly, their service is horrible lately. You can be the only one in line and they'll forget numerous items! It's gotten so bad that I've actually made an effort to contact corporate about it and have received no response. Seems like it's not a big deal but in the past 6-8 months I've given them many chances and have been disappointed 8 times out of 10. We'll see if they make any changes...as for now, it's true mexican food at one of the 'berto's for me..."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  Good for a quick meal.  Not the best but not the worst.  Food was food and cooked to order.  Good customer service, cashier last night 6/3 at approx 11pm was friendly.  Order was spot on (huge bonus when getting fast food).  Overall good experience and will be back."}
{"text":"It's not often I can give a fast food establishment 5 stars, and I'm not giving this location 5 stars based on one experience.  I work nearby and have been coming to this location for well over a year, probably about once per month.  I have yet to ever have a negative or even a mediocre visit.  Every time I visit, the staff is very friendly, smiling, and helpful.  I commented to the drive thru cashier the last time that I'm impressed how happy they always are!  She said they love their jobs.  Again, today, another friendly cashier.  I don't know who manages this location but they must be a good leader and treat their employees well.  Someone is doing something right!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in this particular Del Taco, you notice how well maintained it is. Since this location is new, so is the interior design. Fun lighting and seating arrangements. The most exciting thing you'll notice are the very large sauce dispenser bottles. They are internally lit and have bright colors. I had to immediately take a photo. Service was nice and I even got a smile, which is rare in fast food restaurants. I know I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's sad to see people write such rough reviews for this location.  I live around the corner and I eat here more often than I should.  I don't mind backing up for the timer or waiting in the parking lot because my food is alwayshot and fresh. There have been mistakes made in ordersbut they always take care of us. The boss lady night manager is the reason I am writing this review.  She is always working so hard and handeling the madness that is a fast food shift. Treat her well, Del Taco or it will be your loss. Employees like that are rare!"}
{"text":"I had to work today on my birthday.  Since it was just me and my girlfriend who moved out here and we're broken up, I didn't have anyone to spend my birthday with, so I ended up just getting some quick chow.

I mentioned it was my birthday and the friendly lady said;  \"you're not spending it alone because you have your friends here at Del Taco\"

And they gave me a free cookie to go along with my food.

And....I'm crying a little right now because this tiny act of human kindness just made the biggest difference.

;I

****
AHEM!

Try the Epic steak and guacamole burrito, ifs awesome."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years, the service and food has always been great. Now this location is under new management. The manager is rude and disrespectful. He now refuses to allow a simple $1 free bean and cheese burrito with purchase which was bought from a school fundraiser in the area. Instead of explaining why he won't allow it, he makes the customers feel like morons for presenting it when the card has been used at this location for the past 6 months. On top of having to interact with the manager while ordering, the food quality has decreased a whole lot. Since new management everything is either stale or really messy because of how it's put together. We now drive to peoria if we want del taco."}
{"text":"I always get exceptional service here. Employees are always nice, greet in a happy  way, and say miss, ma'am, sir. They smile a lot here and don't hurl your food at you or side eye you like you're inconveniencing them. Food is always hot and fresh when i receive it from this location"}
{"text":"Someone told me, that every time they write a Fast Food review, an Angel cries.  LOL

So with that warning, I like this Del Taco, the employees and location. I haven't decided yet if I prefer Del Taco over Taco Bell. 

The reason is their predominance of potatoes in many of their dishes as a filler. Btw, if you like French fries with ground beef and cheese on top, then this is your place. 

Like TB, Del Taco has gone down the rabbit hole of gourmet burritos, which they call \"Epic\". It's similar to TB's Cantina offerings, which also come in bowls if UR doing a protein diet. 

They have four offerings called Cali Steak & Guac, Grilled Chicken Fajita, Chicken Chipotle Ranch and Steak & Potato which are all priced around $5.50 and with a drink are $6.70. 

I had the shredded Steak Cali which wasn't bad. The rest of the menu is pretty basic, with the usual offerings including breakfast.   

So far my stomach is doing okay. Btw, I love the 50s tunes they play. If it wasn't for all the colorful seats and chairs I would feel like I'm in the movie Pleasantville.   LOL"}
{"text":"Usually good for late night bargins, good thing I got the tacos and burritos! Only problem is no medium sauce, my favorite!  Even though I asked for all 3 sauces.  see picture."}
{"text":"Fast and freindy service always, food is always fresh had the chicken rollers they were so good"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience this location has went to the pits, after waiting in the drive through almost 15 minuets I pull out and go inside to wait another 15 minutes without getting a order. With a manager and 4-5 employees no one had a clue to what they were doing, some major training needs to take place. Very disappointing, I just asked for my money back!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Del Taco I frequently stop at locations near my work place.

Unfortunately this location on Spencer is understaffed and wait times are 15+ minutes for simple orders.

I hope they get it together or this location will not survive."}
{"text":"First off I got to the speaker and waited for a good 5-10 minutes without being greeted. Then I drive to the window and sit there another minute or two for ginnifer to come to the window. I asked if the speaker wasn't working, she ignored my question and took my order very rudely. Customer service needs improvement."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru today and the guy that took my order seemed to be upset cause I didn't ask how his day was. Right before I placed my order he stated \"I'm good thank you for asking\".  
He charged me for a macho drink price for a medium cup of ice water. My combination burrito was basically a bean burrito with some cheese and a little bit of red sauce and I got some over cooked jalapeño potato poppers."}
{"text":"I like Del Taco it reminds me of Might Taco in Buffalo NY. But this is the hands down the worst location Del Taco owns. They have forgotten my sour cream on my tacos 3 orders now - only went 3 times so far, so not that good. To be honest they put it on just one of 6 once , which is prob the more frustrating. The dang sour cream cost as much as the tacos but I like it. Tacos have all the meat in a lump, cheese one end and they are too lazy to fold the paper around them properly so you have lettuce all over  before you even eat. The location is not dirty but looks like a high school just passed though every time i visit. Go next door to taco bell or Whataburger."}
{"text":"Amazing service for fast food I don't understand why people get so upset at them they are there to feed us and they do a good job . Cassia and her team are amazing thank you to the manager"}
{"text":"I eat here somewhat often since it is close to my workplace. I like the food that Del Taco offers. However, this particular location probably isn't the best. In one visit I tried to order a shake, \"no, our shake machine is down.\" Ok, that wasn't the most polite response. Then once I paid I was asked if I'd like any hot sauce, I said mild, \"we don't have mild.\" Lol this one visit soured my opinion on this location."}
{"text":"Customer service not that great not to mention there's nothing fast about going to this fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"So I am first up in line waiting  for 5 mins no one says a word (will be with u in a moment) I was in line looking like idiot..."}
{"text":"If I could give you 0 stars I would. This location sucks and the employees including the managers are UNPROFESSIONAL. I waited in line for 7 minutes and at the window for 8. A total of 15 minutes for my food. I asked the manager if I could have a drink for the wait and he REFUSED. Are you kidding me? Do you know how much gas I wasted sitting in line? You can't even give me a free $1 soda for the inconvenience. 

On top of that my orders are always wrong or missing something. I'm so tired of these fast food places being so shitty because the employees don't know how to get off their asses."}
{"text":"This place sucks. They never get my order right. I always pay extra for sour cream and its not on my friggin tacos. Ask for soft, they give you hard, ask for hard, they give you soft. You people don't deserve your jobs. Lazy asses."}
{"text":"I like del taco. I go to other locations. but this one is the worst. we came around 11:30 pm. and we didn't leave the drive thru until 12:06. no apology, or anything. my boyfriend tells them there's no way it should have taken that long. the guy at the window  says nothing. we started to drive and I check the bags, none of the food was even put together.. it exploded all over the inside of the bag. so we called to ask for our money back. the same guy tells us there's nothing he can do since we drove off..."}
{"text":"Good fast food Mexican food. 
Clean restaurant.
Drive thru is fast. 
Friendly staff.
Decent menu and specials when eating on a budget."}
{"text":"These fish tacos are worth the trip. I love the fries and other goodies that they sale at this location. The drive thru is always moving pretty quickly.  The people who work the drive thru are pretty nice. But make sure that you double check your order. I give it 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"I just waited in the drive thru for over half an hour and had to ask multiple people to back out so i could leave. Worst experience ive ever had. Its new years eve night and im hungry after getting no break at work. Thanks for letting me down. Whoever owns this franchise needs to clean house."}
{"text":"I walked to Walmart today because there was no bus coming and no bus shelter to wait in so I ended up walking. I stopped at the Del Taco because I have been wanting a cheese quesadilla. Well ordered my quesadilla and ended up waiting longer than I had to because the two girls decided that they should prepare tacos for a customer who came in after me and ordered nine Tuesday tacos. She spent about $5.00, she paid with a $5 bill and received charge. She is a regular and get those damn tacos every Tuesday but I was there first, was not rude, I didn't even complain because I have Yelp.  You're supposed to serve people who come in first, first unless there are extenuating circumstances, there were none. But I learned I will not visit that Del Taco location again, I do not approve of racism from anyone even when I am not the victim. I will however, visit the location near work where I am treated well."}
{"text":"Does a pretty good job with inexpensive Mexican, they recently introduced some new items that start at 50 cents.  I just want to know whose idea it was to put creamy ruin everything with a creamy ranch sauce....yuk,  NOT a good idea,  just give a packet of hot salsa please....thank you very much!"}
{"text":"I have become a regular at this location because of the positive attitude of the staff assisting me at the drive thru and the chicken rollers are my favorite on the menu. I also enjoy getting the Epic Burrito (between $5 - $6) and comes several different flavors which will depend the amount you pay but they are pretty darn good, and with a drink its around $8. I've also gotten the 2 for $5 classic and spicy chicken burritos which always hits the spot too. Like I mentioned in the beginning of this review, there are a couple different cashiers that have a great and positive attitude which is rare on the late shift but it's good to see that people are happy at work and the food I get from this location tastes better because the individuals preparing it are happy and good at their jobs."}
{"text":"Shame on me for not writing this review sooner!

I have never met such a wonderful employee named Bambie that works the night shift at the drive thru! She is someone that you would expect to see working at Chickfila her attitude is just that great! She is a shining star and I hope management has given her the recognition she deserves!

So when I first moved here and hadn't gotten groceries yet, we came from breakfast late night and there was Bambie at the drive thru window super friendly and she got our complicated our right the first time!! My order is very complicated because I don't like a bunch of stuff on my breakfast burrito! 

Not to mention this Del Taco has be the freshest and most delicious compared to the all the ones I've eaten at! Nothing is ever too salty, the food tastes fresh and doesn't feel like it was sitting under a lamp! I have 0 complaints about this location! ^__^"}
{"text":"Why is it impossible for people to figure out that is someone says \"no onions\" that by association that means \"no pico de gallo\" because it is made from tomatoes and...ONIONS! 

On this particular visit i went through the drive thru as I was rushed and it was my only chance to eat before 3. I said \"no onions\", she said \"it has pico de gallo\" to this I replied \"then no pico de gallo please\". What did I receive? A completely in edible turkey taco with pico de gallo. 

To add insult to injury the paper wrapper had so much liquid in it, it immediately 
 broke through the wrapper and dumped pico, cheese and turkey all overt lap. 

Always lovely to go to an appointment smelling like a taco, stains in my shirt AND nothing to eat because 1/2 of it was on my lap and the other half still had onions on it."}
{"text":"I had been out to see a show (Show Stoppers at the Wynn Las Vegas) with My Husband on our way home we decided to get a taco bell but My husband said lets try this one Del Taco as may be as good as Taco Bell, we drove up and put our order in which was quick and easy, we waited for our food to arrive and the young lady who was at the drive thru window asked if we wanted any sauce to which we replied yes hot and mild, when we got home there was none, the fries was luke warm and not very nice, the portion was okay but not great, I recommend driving 2 more minutes on the same road to Taco Bell as their tacos allot better in taste, portion and service, Del Taco thanks but no thanks !"}
{"text":"If your sign says open 24 hours, but you consistently cannot sell food because you shut down all registers at 5am, TURN OFF YOUR DRIVE THRU LIGHTS. it's bullshit to drive up and then get an excuse that you do not have a single functioning register."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times through the drive through and every time my order has been completely wrong. Worst del taco staff and management. You need to seriously evaluate your management and staff."}
{"text":"Good fast food tacos. For some reason I was intrigued by them having French fries so I tried them. Unsurprisingly they were not very good. I'd say a little bit better than the bell. Cheap."}
{"text":"Meh. It's cheap fast food that's open late and conveniently located. Various sauce options for every level of mild to spicy. It's good for what it is. I like the new turkey option but would like nutrition info to see if it's actually healthier."}
{"text":"The fish taco from a Del Taco drive thru is always better than 99.9% of fish tacos elsewhere, no matter the price point. Period."}
{"text":"If there is one thing I can't stand, it's paying for food in the drive thru that I don't receive. How f-ing difficult can it be to check the order? And the one time I don't I get screwed. Well screw you, taco trash...eat your well deserved crap rating."}
{"text":"My significant other and I went inside this location last week and made a simple request, Bean burrito, no cheese, bold with avocado.. We received 2 dry ass burritos with the avocado on the side!!! We asked for the avocado to be put on the burritos and we were then asked to wait for the manager (she was on a personal phone call that she answered while ringing us up).. When she was finished with her call she took the burritos and \"fixed\" them.. When we got home they were still incorrect and dry as hell!!! SO, we called and were told our info will be put on a list with the \"correct\" order and we were to go whenever and pick it up.. 
We make the time and pick the order and get home and the damn order was still wrong!!! IF THE ESTABLISHMENT DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING CORRECTLY PERHAPS EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE RETRAINED!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Del Taco  experience to date! I went through the drive thru this morning 5/7/18. I ordered the \"Epic Steak & Potato  Burrito with Bacon  \" and a medium Diet Coke. When the cashier took my order I was amazed at the price. I thought maybe he heard me wrong, because it seemed he was in a rush. I got to the window only to be greeted friendly by Gabriel who kindly repeated my order when I asked. And even altered my order to save me money. He was pleasant, helpful and my food was fresh! Customer service seems to be on the decline these days. Not at this Del Taco location! Thanks Gabriel for the excellent customer service and customer appreciation! You made my morning ?"}
{"text":"I don't have any problem with this place. Good amount of variety. Cheap. Fast. Friendly. Fresh. All the other adjectives used by previous reviewers. Plus, the kids meal \"toy\" is actually an educational pull-out book which my 4-year-old is now delightly thumbing through on the sofa, as opposed to made-in-China rockem-sockem-robots or dragons that spit out flying plastic bullets like what you get from McDonalds. Oh, and I haven't gotten food poisoning from it (unlike from Chino Bandido, Macayos, Taco del Mar etc). Not exactly healthy food, though, so it's rare that I eat here. Kid loves the \"reetos\" when we do go."}
{"text":"Well, if you are old enough, you might remember Avis Car Rental's slogan; \"We Try Harder\"  In many ways, that could describe Del Taco.

Taco Bell has been trying to improve it's image recently, by updating it's menu items with offerings from \"Chef Lorena Garcia's authentic Latin recipe\".  So you might think they are taking Chipotle seriously.  Oh contraire mon frere!  I believe they see Del Taco in their rear-view mirror. 

Over the last couple of years, Del Taco has been upgrading their menu items, too.  It's not just a taco place.  Besides Mexican inspired food items, they also sell cheeseburger (single, double and triple), shakes, potato poppers, crinkle cut fries, as well as chili fries.  So, they are closer to Carl's Jr Green Burrito, than Taco Bell.

Another difference, is their reliance on Text Messaging to send you coupons, or specials.  Here are some recent examples: \"Get a free small fries w/ any Crispy Shrimp Taco or burrito purchase.\"  Or, \"It's Taco Tuesday @ Del Taco starts @ 3pm. Get 3 regular tacos for $1.09 3pm till 11pm.\"  Taco Bell is more focused on Facebook to get their message out. How passé.

The food at Del Taco is good and seem reasonably priced as compared to any of the other taco or burger boys.  They also serve breakfast, which is very good.  This location is near The Home Depot.  It is clean, friendly enough and the line moves fast.  What else could you ask for in a fast food joint?  

I've posted two Tips which you might want to try.  First, use the Microsoft Tag scanner App on your phone to become part of Del Taco's email Club.  Second, \"Text Club\" to 60259 to join Del Taco's text club for food and special offers. 

So in summary, Del Taco is Three Stars, A-OK"}
{"text":"This location is great when you can get it.  I agree with the hours thing.  Not only about when they close, but when they open.  Supposed to be open at 8:00 am on weekends.  I showed up at 8:15 this Sunday and the lady behind the counter told me it would be and additional 20 to 30 minutes before they could serve me (wasted gas!!!  This was the only reason I left my house!!!) .  It does have all the great features of Del Taco including real meat, real cheese, and real freshly cooked beans.  Unlike other large Mex style fast food places that serve, what I call, meat flavored cottage cheese like substance.  Del Taco cooks and uses REAL MEAT!!!  I have almost always received great service at this location.  The staff is typically friendly and very helpful and prompt."}
{"text":"Filibertos and Taco Bell are WAY better!  Del Taco (in my opinion) is amongst the weakest (if not the weakest) of fast food Mexican.  ONLY a last resort."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE. EVER. If you work in a restaurant you should probably NOT IGNORE ALL THE PEOPLE STANDING IN LINE, and then give us all a shitty attitude when we want to order food. If you hate your job so bad, effing quit."}
{"text":"Most Del taco restaurants have good service. This is the worst del taco I have ever been to. Nearly every time I go through drive thru they mess up the order. I have to check bag every time and almost every time they forget something. Recently, I checked the bag and everything was in there. Then I got home and the burrito I ordered without cheese (food allergy for my son) had cheese in it and my chili cheese fries didn't have chili on them. So not only do they mess it up by forgetting things, now they mess up what they put in the bag. I called manager and all she said was, \"I can get you a free burrito when I come in next time\". This doesn't make it right. The entire meal should be comped since I was already home.  Horrible."}
{"text":"I don't care if Del taco is just a fast food joint.  This is one of my favorite restaurants and one of those places that just makes me feel like I'm home.  Yes the service usually sucks, and yes about 30% of the time they screw up my order, but as long as the fries are hot, everything is ok."}
{"text":"Well all the good that this store had is gone. Went there got 4 Chicken Tacos with no sauce or cheese but add tomato.  When I got the total I asked why so much.  The guy told me it was 40 cents per taco for the tomato.  Even though I didn't get cheese (which is way more per pound than tomatoes).The taco only cost 99 cents and I got no cheese or sauce.  So they charge 40 cents per taco for 1 tablespoon of tomato (that is a charge of $26.00 per pound for tomatoes) .  WHAT A RIP OFF  I hope that the $1.60 extra was worth it because I will NEVER eat at a Del Taco again for that reason.  I would have given zero stars if I could because when I got home there were no tomatoes on the tacos.  If I wasn't so tired from work I would have gone back there and threw the tacos in the drive thru window.  I will more than make up for the $1.60 rip off in the near future, lets just say that it is going to cost them a lot more LOLOLOLOL"}
{"text":"This was my fav place I'm guessing they have a new cook because 2x I ordered and paid for the DEL tacos (extra meat and cheese 20% more) anyway I was given the regular tacos and my steak burrito had no steak......"}
{"text":"So so so disappointed!!!  Not only was my order repeated twice, but I ended up with beef soft shell tacos, instead of the Reg chicken soft shell tacos.   On top of that, I got onions on my macho tacos!!!   Been coming to Del taco at different locations for years, and have always ordered the same Macho Nachos.   Weird!!!   I'm very disappointed!   I don't suggest ever going here late night!  The staff is not right"}
{"text":"del taco  is not to bad when your on the run and need a fast bite.. but the only problem is that beef and chicken is not very hot or even that warm its almost cold  a cold burrito  is gross please make the meat hot !!!!  like what's up with that ???? other wise i like it better than taco bell ."}
{"text":"This is a new Del Taco located in the corner of  St. Rose & Spencer St.  I've been here a couple times and it's been good so far.  The service is prompt and friendly, and the lobby is clean.  The food is exactly what you would expect from any Del Taco, but both times has been warm and recently cooked."}
{"text":"You know, I don't think I will usually review fast food franchises but this Del Taco gets an exception in a good way. No matter what time I pop in, nor what time of line there is in front of me, I can get my food in less than 5 minutes it seems, always hot and they always ask if I want hot sauce. 

It's sad to say but it's a level of service rarely seen from fast food chains.  So, I give it 5 stars as this particular Del Taco seems well run, and has been for all the years I have lived up the street from it. Great job and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I HIGHLY recommend that you do not drive through this location.  Both times I have had two people in front of me but wait for 20 minutes to be serviced!  The service inside is way faster.

I really enjoy the Chili Cheese Fries with no red chili, add green chili sauce and cheese.  Yummm!!!  $2.79 and it fills me up and I leave happy.

They also offer a macho sized fresh brewed iced tea with lemon for only 79 cents."}
{"text":"okay so Rand H. and I when here for a quick bite to eat I ordered a macho combo burrito and I added steak to it for an extra dollar. I also ordered french fries and a small drink it was a combo with the dollar hop up. Anyway my meal came to around eight bucks and change, an Rand
told me I could get for the same money at Juan's Authentic Mexican Food
or at Filiberto's a heck of a meal for the same money. But what the hey there we were. I hate it was full but it was nothing spectacular. And the help was an awful and the place wasn't anything special. So three stars to eaks out of my forgiving mouse hand. That's all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"The guy making the food used his bare hands multiple times to handle the food. He also sneezed into his elbow but in the direction of the food and when I brought this up to the manager all he told him to do was go wash his hands and put on new gloves. Not to mention they NEVER clean the playground and their bathrooms always smell of raw sewer."}
{"text":"So glad Del Taco opened up near us in Southwest Las Vegas. Just opened today! The manager Ruty was very welcoming and nice. We tried a chicken spicy jack quesadilla 5/5 delicious, chips and queso (pepper jack spicy cheese sauce) 4/5 always tasty, queso crunch Taco which is a soft Taco wrapped around a crunchy Taco 5/5, a grilled chicken taco from the $1 menu also very good and made fresh 5/5, and lastly a $1 drink with bottomless refills. All in all a great meal fast and fresh! We now have another option in Mountains Edge. Muchas Gracias Del Taco!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars i would! 5 cars in-front of us and about 5 cars behind us haven't moved at all... took the guy in front of like 10 minutes for the person to be ready for his order... so slow what's the point of a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Ug, never had been, never will go again.  It's a sad thing when Taco Bell is better than something."}
{"text":"So if you have have high standards do any fast food then you should not be going to fast food. That being said this review is a reflection of the better experience and service one gets at Del Taco versus that competitor with that silly bell. Case in example, I like lettuce ...but as a salad. So when I get a taco I ask no lettuce. So when I go to the bell place I get no lettuce and get the same amount of cheese and meat (enter rolling eyes emoji). But NO not at Del Taco..that sucker was packed with cheese and meat to the brim.   So kuddos to a place getting it right!!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten my order wrong 3/4 of the times I've been there. A pretty busy location. May need better employees who actually pay attention to details."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous. I ordered 3 burritos and 1 taco, didn't receive my taco i paid for, all tortillas were stale. Fries extremely salty and old. Ordered a Mtn Dew and got diet coke. Wouldnt rate this a 1 star. Shut this shitty ass place down. Teach your employees how to actually work. Doesnt deserve my business nor do he employees deserve $10 an hour."}
{"text":"I have visited this Del Taco 3x's a week for months. The security guard recognizes me. The clerk remembers that I like green sauce with my big Del taco!  I came in today & HAD the use the restroom. A woman behind the counter felt she \"had\" to tell me that the restrooms r only for customers. I get that they lock those doors because of the homeless or others. My eyes were popping out! She does open the door. Thank you, God! But she has lost a customer forever.  I will never stop there again. That was so awkward & unnecessary. RUDE"}
{"text":"Bitter employees mad because they make minimum wage. Mad at the world cause you broke. Didn't even let them take my order because the customer service was so bad. Trash."}
{"text":"it will do if you are in the area. I used to stop by here late after a concert to grab a breakfast burrito for the road. The graveyard shift needs the boot. I had to go in the place because the drive thru window was stuck. It took 15 mins for a simple egg and cheese burrito. Had to wait extra cause the dude dropped it. This was not just an off night for this location , after a few similar visits I decided to seek my burrito needs elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good for some cheap eats, service is kind of hit and miss. Really depends on the crew working that day. I usually frequent this area on my way home after a concert in the early morning hours. The graveyard shift crew is pretty on the ball and delivers prompt service."}
{"text":"Rarely am I impressed by a fast food place. Forget the food. I expect what I get. But I will say they do a really good job at customer service at this location. Very friendly and engaging, all the staff Very rare in the industry. Good job"}
{"text":"Yeehaw Del taco eats right up the street, I really like that they are adding new eating spots on Stephanie. I usually grub here when I'm coming home after a late night at work or for a quick cheap meal. The times I have actually dined in the restaurant it has been kept tidy and the folks behind the counter were nice & provided quick and pleasant service."}
{"text":"1 1/2-2 ish star. Only been here a few  times in the late wee hours. The graveyard shift crew is a little iffy. Most of the time they look at you like you interrupted a game of freeze tag. The plaza it's in is uber creepy at night. I usually go for a late night breakfast burrito. I asked for sauce and napkins they said ok but behold none were to be had. The dude at the drive thru was too busy bullshitting with his pals. I'm surprised I got my change my back."}
{"text":"Terrible service this last Tuesday at approx 515pm! I ordered a few items and repeated my order. What i got at tge window was sok wrong i handed the bags back and told tge manager what my order was. She keep trying to give me the samw wrong items and was grossly incompetent. She spoke englisg well enouhh so that was not it. I as told the chicken and beef tacos were both on special...NOPE charged me full price for chux, glad i caught it. The manager would not make it right and honor what the cashier promissed me.

I would take 30 more mins to write up everything that went wrong, so i will juat say that 10 mins at the drive thru window is the last 10 mins i will ever waste at this place.

Del Taco you lost a frequent customer for life! I will never patronize this location again."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back to this location.  Just took me 10 minutes to be served 1 jacked up BRC, a small fry, and mini quesadilla.  The drink station is never stocked, the employees curse in Spanish,  they have one person grilling, one person assembling, one person at cash and one person at the drive through (at 12:00 pm on a weekday!!!).  It is always staffed like this.  This is hands down the worst deal taco south of the 215.  The general manager should be fired for having no clue how to staff or run a restaurant."}
{"text":"I go here every morning and every other night for an item of some sort. The customer service is excellent. Both day and night staff are wonderful and go over the top. Once in a while they forget to ask me if I want hot sauce but I always get it regardless. Even the drive-thru speaker lady is very nice and welcoming.  Food is great and always perfect temperature."}
{"text":"For some reason they can't get the beans right here.  I grew up on and worked at the original Barstow Del Taco and these beans here are too hot and have noooo flavor.  Customer service is great though!"}
{"text":"I wish I can give this location no stars! So i decide to go to this location to grab something to eat. But if I knew that the guy that took my order was going to have the attitude he did I would've just gone somewhere else. 10:47pm to be exact, I believe he was the manager. He had a annoying ass face, like he didn't want to be there. He was not polite at all,and looked like it bothered him when I asked what came in the shrimp tacos. His answer was just what u see in the picture. No manner at all ! I would say thank you and no response! If he was manager that is just sad !!!!! I just feel that workers should leave attitude and problems out of work and treat customers the way they should!"}
{"text":"I  worked 16 hours today and wanted shrimp tacos on my way home. Get home with them and the shrimp are RAW, i mean not even pink at all. Completely gray. Come on man."}
{"text":"Great tacos and fries prices were cheap and the food was great. I had the soft fish tacos and they were good. The food came out fast and hot. I never eat at a Del taco before and I liked it a lot. Great prices and food was fast and hot. You can't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Slowest del taco ever. Employee at the drive thru didn't say a single word to me. Food is so so"}
{"text":"This location cooks their fries perfectly, just enough salt and crispy.  I tried the beef taco asado, and this is very yummy!  The chicken soft tacos yummy, the white buttermilk (I think) based sauce) makes these with the marinated chicken.  I loved Naugles (who Del Taco bought) and order the egg and cheese burrito and add beans making it similiar to Naugles egg & bean burrito.  One of my fav fast foods spots!"}
{"text":"Long freaking hair inside my burrito. How can you not notice a huge hair as you're wrapping my burrito??"}
{"text":"Tonight I went in to get some late night snackies . I got a couple tacos for my friends and I and I was really craving a churro from del taco because they are usually really good, but tonight was different i am not sure if this is what they do now or what but it tasted salty. I'm pretty sure they seasoned my churro with pepper and salt , it smelled like it and tasted like it. I am very displeased with my visit . Not likely to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Had the new  under 600 alorie  black bean avacado and chicken salad  Was good, fresh, tasty. Amazingly. Avacado was not ripe though.  Not bad."}
{"text":"No wonder there are such bad reviews. Not a big Del Taco fan anyway (unless it's the originals in Barstow and Lenwood) but I drove through this one on Cactus just to get in and out quickly because they're never crowded. So the girl who took my order was the rudest POS I have ever encountered at a fast food place. I politely asked if she was having a bad day, she gave a BS smile and practically threw my change at me. I try to empathize with people and maybe lighten their day, but this girl was just nasty. Rotten. Haven't even eaten the food yet, and I'm sure I won't be back. Lots of other options in the area, no wonder this one isn't crowded."}
{"text":"Leckere mexikanische Küche als Fast food. Bestellung ging schnell und essen War in Ordnung. Würde ich würde hin."}
{"text":"Ordered  2 chili cheese fries, a fiesta box and a macho fry.  tacos were made right away then sat near fry area then 13 minutes later they asked me what I was still waiting on. 15 mins go by and theyhand me my food, well it's not fresh anymore. I watched y'all do atleast 10 orders before giving  me mine. So had tgem remake it. took me a half hour to get my food and there was no line when i walked in.   then a worker did appologize for skipping me. So atleast th eres that but i wont be going back to thus location. horrible ... Just got home took a bite of the chili cheese frys  and the frys care actually kinda raw/undercooked. wow, yeah I'm DONE with this location and another thing, I ordered 6 soft tacos and all 6 are hard"}
{"text":"Best Del Taco I have had in Vegas. Each time I go it's always fresh and the burritos and tacos are fat. Awesome Chili Cheese frys as well"}
{"text":"Del Taco is the only fast food chain I frequent.  I like this location because the dining room is open 24 hours, not just the drive thru.   As long as there's Inferno sauce, I'll eat here."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst del taco in the world. Like every other review states, long waits at the drive thru and your order is hardly ever correct. 5min wait per car. As soon as you get to the intercom you're asked to wait, then wait again after you place your order. Last few times I've been here I've ordered the  chorizo breakfast burrito and been given the 60 cent burrito instead and been charged $7 for the wrong order.

It honestly blows my mind how this place is still in business with how many people post negative reviews. Gave this place 3 chances. No more."}
{"text":"Honestly, I thought I was going to be the first on this one! No matter. Del Taco! You are made of crack cocaine my friend. You are in my neck of the woods! you live on 3rd street, I live on 3rd street! Seriously, my friend and I try to stay away but we visit almost nightly! The place is open all hours and we pretty much know all the workers by name. We spend about $8 a night here but that's chump change. They have GREEEEN burritos! They are the best. The spicy jack quesadilla. best. Veggie Works. best. veggie works. again, best! Don't ask me about the meat stuff. That's gross. Ask me about the Tostadas! I just discovered them. Definitely NOT Taco Bell. For the record, I do not like the elementary school cafeteria french fries or the nachos. The breakfast? meh. whatever! Also, last time I had a strawberry shake there, it was like a STRAWBERRYMILKSHAKEPEOPLE. Don't eat anything but the MILD sauce and you're good to go! Tonight I made a home-made burrito at home and still put Del's mild sauce on it. mmmmmama!"}
{"text":"Whoever made the shrimp tacos today should be ashamed to have gotten out of bed. Ordered 4. Every single one is soooo sloppy and soggy and just disgusting to touch. Sure, tacos should be fun and messy. This is just awful. The cabbage is also either not \"ripe\" if that's a real thing, or is rancid."}
{"text":"Please stop putting the large fries on top of tacos!!!  It's fucking stupid!  AND NO ONE WANTS BROKEN TACOS!"}
{"text":"Worst Del Taco in the chain of a great restaurant. I love Del Taco and have been a fan for a long time but this location needs some work and also some new management. I went there Tuesday to have great meal before the Thanksgiving holiday and went home with Food Poisoning. It ruined my Thanksgiving and when I called and spoke to the Male Manager R... he really didn't care and acted like there is no way that their Del Taco (attached to a gas station) could have done that. 

I have called the health department and informed them of this issue. Upper management needs to offer the current management training on how to deal with customers and not act pompous towards customers with a complaint. This manager in particular probably needs a new job as he feels like he owns the place. He is lousy at customer service. 

Never going back to this location! Still love Del Taco but beware of this location, bad attitude and bad food."}
{"text":"Worst place in the ENTITE world . I'm watching chopped as I write this and this del taco needs to be chopped from the food chain ! I order a nacho and in Mii tray I find about 6 burned French fries . Seriously !!!!!!! Not to mention a roach in my strawberry lemonade ! I will never eat at this or probably any other del taco . They have the nerve to have a grade A hanging in the kitchen. They need to be visited by health department. To mention they barely even speak English at an American Taco Chain where is the sense ?

Zero stars zero stars zero stars"}
{"text":"This is my buddies go to late night munchie place.  So naturally I am along for the ride.  The drive thru for this location gets busy late night because it is one of the only easy access restaurants when coming home from a night of drinking in the downtown or strip areas, and need to make it safely back home to Summerlin, Westside or Centennial Hills.  

The line moved pretty decent even though they were busy and the most important thing is that they got our order 100% correct.  I am normally a Taco Bell or Jack in the Box  fan for late night munchies, but the great thing about Del Taco is that you can have the best of both world's of FF mex or burgers and fries.  What a great concept.  

I think it will be difficult to convert me to a full fledged fan of Del Taco, but the food quality seems to be decent, hot and fresh compared to others late night staples.  Now if they had some chicken wings this place would be 10 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"The people are really friendly and the food tastes good. We would have given 5 stars, but the reason for only 3 stars is twice recently we have ordered fish tacos at the drive thru and both times they gave us regular tacos.  My son was disappointed to get home and not have the correct order 2 times in a row. I guess next time we have to make sure before we leave that they gave us the correct items."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas and wanted something quick to eat. Was hoping Del Taco was similar to Taco Bell, but the food was definitively not good at all. The fries were stale, the tacos looked bad, and it was overall just a not so great experience."}
{"text":"Came in around lunch time and was able to place a large order of over 70 items. I was feeding a large group and this location was super courteous throughout the entire process. Definitely a fan of the service!"}
{"text":"Is probably the worst I'll talk with ever been to. Manager Anthony is very horrible. Please do not come here for your family sake"}
{"text":"This place is way better then taco bell but they will screw your order up more then taco bell when you go thru the drive thru so just check your food and it tastes good nothing horrible its fast food what can you expect."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food places around. Beans slow cooked, chedder cheese headed by hand, this pave really focuses on quality. Try the Chicken Soft Taco and a green burrito and enjoy the best they have to offer. The burgers are surprisingly good for that family member that doesn't want American Mexican.

Breakfast burritos rule as the Del Scorcho sauce is surprisingly flavorful."}
{"text":"Last week I stopped here The fryer oil was so old the fries tasted like burnt  lighter fluid. The crunchy taco shell was so stale cardboard would have tasted fresher. If the food taste this bad I can't imagine they keep the place very clean either. They definitely never clean the fryer. Nasty.. don't use this Del Taco unless you like getting sick after you eat."}
{"text":"I arrived before 11:30pm, and this Del Taco locked it's doors.  The sign on the doors says it closes at Midnight - but the person on staff inside looked as though she had friends inside and only they were allowed.  Boo."}
{"text":"I keep giving this location a chance cause I like their food, but I just don't understand why the service is so bad. Twice now I have sat at the drive thru with no car in front of me and not been able to place my order for five minutes or so. I actually think the first time I was left sitting there for 10-15 min. I thought this was a fast food place. Then when I pull up to the window I can see that there are only a few customers inside. I really don't get it, cause these last two times I was there between 6p and 8, so not odd times to grab a meal. This last time I ordered the cheeseburger meal. No one asked me if I wanted ketchup or any dipping sauce, so when I got home I had no ketchup for my fries and I'm pretty sure napkins are a staple for a to go meal, but I could be wrong.

This is the closest location to me unfortunately and it hasn't always been bad. It got like this with in the past few months, but is probably the reason why it is never close to busy when I have been there."}
{"text":"Amazing place for the price! (Given the genre and type; fast food) Food has really good flavor! The tacos are on point as well as the nachos and queso tacos. Further I had one of the strawberry shakes for like a dollar and was honestly not expecting a lot.....however, very good flavor! Definitely worth the stop! You will leave pleased!"}
{"text":"So I order a taco salad and there were nats in it.  Is that not some kinda health code violation? I was so grossed out I instantly got sick and threw it away. Maybe it was my fault for trying to eat at a place of boulder highway. My usual experiences at del taco is good and so is the food, but because of the experience I will think twice before  going back."}
{"text":"Just pulled up about 20 minutes ago and no one was at the drive-thru, pulled up again because they appeared after we were gone. Took them about 5 minutes to take our order. In addition, she was giving attitude because we said hello due to bad audio coming through. I only gave 1 star because we actually got our food. Very irritated and disappointed."}
{"text":"4/1/15 at about 11:30pm went through the drive thru and ordered the Guacamole fish taco combo and a beef taco and what did I end up with? Two $1 nachos. I was in a rush so didn't found out till I got home. Tried calling and no one answered at all. It's a 24/7 location so people are working. Even the nachos were a mess and very messy put together. I paid $10 and got $3 worth of food that I threw away. Never going there again."}
{"text":"After hearing about the deliciousness of Del Taco for some many years from my friends, I finally tried it since I now live out west..... Whelp, it wasn't as epic as I hyped it up to be in my head *Deep sigh!* 

It was just typical tacos from a fast food chain. Don't get me wrong it was decent, but really just a middle of the road taco. That is what I get for over hyping something I've never had  and need to keep my fast food expectations low! Hahahaha."}
{"text":"Drive thru wait over 45 minutes with just 5 cars, 2 of them has already placed their order.... then I order and have to repeat it a couple of times. When I get to the window she asks if I would like sauce and i say no thank you! Get my order and lady at the window proudly says I gave you mild and hot sauce.... maybe pay more attention to the people and it might not be that long of a wait next time!"}
{"text":"I order from here often. The staff is amazing the food is as good of quality as you can expect from del taco. The price is good for what you get. I would rather eat here than taco bell. However anytime I get a burrito its always cold in the middle and the last time I ordered 9 tacos on taco Tuesday I only got 8."}
{"text":"Wow, this particular location is situated on a busy street and yet nobody has done a review? Ok so here's mine. When it comes to fast food taco joints the two names that come to mind are Taco Bell and Del Taco. Im telling you right now, I am never gonna do a review for Taco Bell unless I am blown away by some memorable event foodwise. 

Del Taco has better choices, specials, and heck, you can even order a burger off their menu if you're bored with tacos or just wanna change it up a bit. That's pretty bold I think and I do admit that their bacon double del cheeseburger is pretty good. 

A lot of people tend to go here on tuesday nights for dinner. Why? Because tuesdays are taco nights! This is what a lot of college going students live for! A lot of good food for not a lot of money! Most places have 2 tacos for 99 cents or 3 for 1.29! You can choose either hard or soft tacos. I think the most tacos I ever ordered were 40! I had a grip of people up in my house and I only paid around 20 bucks for a boat load of tacos! Hell yeah!

Just about everything on their menu is the bomb! I have yet to begun to scratch the surface! Also I dont ever remember getting any bad service from these guys whether its this location or another. Most locations are 24 hours so for you peeps that get the munchies at 2 in the morning for some reason or another (you know who you are!), then you are definitely covered!

So for more info on their menu, go to: www.deltaco.com"}
{"text":"Well, Del Taco is a piece of work - their tacos and taco-salads are incredible. I always enjoy their jack quesidilla and chicken taco but now they have this beef taco salad which is amazing.

They have a really fresh, quality product that is amazing. They hire nothing but mexicans but I guess that's how they insure the quality mexican food =)"}
{"text":"Go to another Del Taco!!! Not clean at all! Sticky floors and gross bathroom. I thought the bad reviews were exaggerating, but their \"Epic\" Burrito at this location is literally ONE THIRD the size of the Epic Burrito at any other location with probably 30% the amount of meat!!! You like service with a smile? Too bad, RBF is what you get. Half the staff was friendly, the other half like they're about to spit in your food. I wish I could give negative stars because one star is too generous."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Del Tacos chili cheddar fries and tacos at 2am. We arrived to del taco at 2:55am. My husband had to repeat himself 4 times because he couldn't hear him when he continued to say tacos. Although, he did hear him clearly when he ordered the first item......confused. It was not busy of course, one car in front of us getting their food and had to repeat himself again at the window."}
{"text":"This Del Taco location is close to my house so I visit every now and then. I am consistently disappointed in the service. Way worse than other Del Tacos or fast food. Even if months pass between visits it still the same. Just bad customer service.

I do love Del Taco food though. Can't complain about that. But I am always much happier when visiting other locations."}
{"text":"It's ok, the only thing I order from here are the chicken soft tacos! It is awesome because they are open at all times of the day, so whether you need some fast Mexican food during the day, or if you need some tacos to help your drunk self, this is the spot! Cheap"}
{"text":"Ok, I know, its a chain, but I gotta give kudos to these guys for at least putting out a better product than Taco Bell. Yes, I said it, Del Taco has the edge in the fast food taco chain competition. Go ahead, shake your head at me. But once I start spewing out good points, you'll be shaking your head in agreement once im done.

First off, every DT I know has its drive thru open 24 hours. I dont know how many times these guys have rescued me from a horrible ordeal with the munchies late at night and into the early hours.

As for the food items. Come on. For every new failed product that TB has put out, DT has always had the same quality ingredients and that includes new products as well. Did I mention the shrimp and fish tacos? Carne Asada? Shredded Beef? Carnitas? Hello? Tap, tap, tap. Is this mic on?

I like how if you want the biggest size all you have say is macho! You know, the biggest you can get. Macho Nachos, Macho Burritos, Macho Drinks, Macho Fries, etc. What does TB do? They call their stuff XL, XXL, and XXXL. I have tried a bunch of their so called XXXL stuff. They hardly put any steak or chicken in their items and if im not mistaken, it doesnt even taste like real meat.

Specials? Well DT has 3 tacos for 1.09 on tuesday nights and I think 3 chicken tacos for 2 bucks on thursdays. TB? They got some kind of happy hour thing with some of their stuff for only a dollar. That is probably the only thing that I might mention TB as worthy.

Service? The chances of me getting lousy service at TB are much higher than at DT. This is based off of all trips between both guys.

Heck, even the desserts are way better at DT and im not even gonna go there.

So there you go. Coming from southern California and now living in Las Vegas, Del Taco is the shiz when it comes to the battle of the fast food taco chain war.

Yelp 2014 365 Review #102"}
{"text":"By far the worst Del Taco in existence. Employees at the drive-thru, without fail, will tell you to \"hold on a minute\" and then proceed to take 10+ minutes to finish whatever it is they're doing. Then when I get to ordering, they ask me stupid questions like if I want sauce??? I'll tell you at the window if I need sauce. I just want you to make food. Fast. I gave the place 4 tries. On the third try, I wanted to take my coworkers there to show them how far Del Tacos food has come, and the drive thru is closed...Open 24/7 but the drive thru is closed for \"break\" for 30 minutes. My friends and I have never ever seen anything like that before. Just makes me wonder what the staff does after hours...The last time I visited I got so upset that they told me to hold on again, I asked them why it takes them so long to take an order and was told not to tell them how to do their job! Yay! Don't go here. Especially during night time hours."}
{"text":"this del taco on west charlston has very good food excellent turkey tacos and the staff does excellent job of taking care of their customers/bodacious"}
{"text":"An epic Del Taco location, no doubt.  I think that I've been to this location on just about all my Vegas trips.  Not sure if it's 24 hour these days or not, but I recall having several late-nite blurry walks to it during my visits to Sam's Town and the Eastside Cannery across the street and a couple of blocks down.

TIPS:  Check out the \"other\" Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas sign, as it's right along the way on the rocky highway median from the casino hotels.  Just be alert if you're wasted, as there always seem to be cop cars hanging out in the parking lots around here.  They bust people for jaywalking in this part of town, too."}
{"text":"Worse location ever, employees don't seem to care about customer service. Service is slow, and they don't have utensils available"}
{"text":"Waiting 16 minutes for fast food is a little excessive. No apology from the \"tray bringer outer\" person. A simple \"thanks for being patient\" or \"sorry about the wait\" goes a long way. You know it's bad when number 28 is done eating and gone by the time 30 (me) is called.  The dude also can't seem to get an order right, cause he forgot my chicken soft taco and messed up a couple orders after mine. Plus, what's up with the remake of the Big Fat Crispy Chicken Taco? It's half the size of the original, and I'm pretty sure it costs more. Lame if you ask me."}
{"text":"I was in town for a convention.  I came in dressed up as a sexy cop lady.  I'm a pretty big dude by the way.

Even with my weird costume on the staff was super nice to me.  There was a super nice worker who complimented my costume, I don't remember her name, but she should get a raise.  And the manager coped with my strange requests to add the weirdest stuff to my food.  They even let me buy a tortilla.  JUST A TORTILLA.  The other places don't let me do that.

That whole week I ate at this Del Taco all day, everyday.

I'll miss this place!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst burger ever!  I know, who goes to Del Taco for a burger?  Well I do.  That's the problem with franchises (i'm guessing) because no two locations prepares the food the same way.  I should of trusted my gut when I saw this location; it looked closed.  It even took them a while to answer the drive through call, I almost backed out but they caught me just in time.  I waited over 10 minutes for my order but I told myself \"well its probably freshly made.\"  It was freaking gross.  First off all, the burger looked like something out of the school cafeteria.  Secondly, it was a double del which one would assume there are two patties of meat.  They took a regular patty and sliced it down the middle.  Third, I asked for NO ONIONS (it's the fruit of the devil) but there were onions in it anyway.  You'd figure they had enough time to get my order right.  No other cars, no other customers.  Nothing chaps my hide more than f***ing up my drive through order.  And these people want to be paid $15.00 an hour?  F*** you!"}
{"text":"This Del Taco is consistently great. Whether you walk in or use the drive thru, they always greet you with a friendly smile. The food has always been fresh, hot and when you ask for xtra anything they load it on, not like other places that wave the xtras over your order and then charge you!
This is my 'go to' spot for quick and good fast food."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for on taco Tuesday and as an added bonus you get a hair in your food. Managers should apologize but instead looked disgusted and just remade it without an apology"}
{"text":"Not sure about all the hate here... My husband and I have been coming here for years and this place is king among 'like' fast food places (and I rated it in comparison with similar fast food joints, i.e. McDonalds, Taco Bell, Wendys, etc.). The staff is always very friendly. The value menu is hands down the best. We love the grilled chicken tacos and half pound bean and cheese burrito. I also enjoy the crunchada tostada. On the regular menu, I like The Del Taco and my husband likes the battered fish tacos. I also like to get their chicken and cheese quesadilla. We like to get the grilled chicken tacos on taco thursday when they are in the 3 for $2.25 deal. Overall, with how often we come here (all the time!), we have only had like two times we were disappointed, and we come here usually weekly, sometimes multiple times a week for basically several years. I mean, this place has an option for you to get tacos and fries- can you really find that variety elsewhere? Also, considering horrible ongoing experiences with other fast food places, I decided it was time to let Del Taco know how much we appreciate them! The staff is good! The food quality and value for the price and 'like' alternatives really cannot be beat..."}
{"text":"Not the worst stuff in the world after a hangover. It's like taco bell, but better! It's cleaner, the sauce is more spicier, and they serve their food with a smile --- oh me likie big time! Steak and eggs on a burrito with coffee plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."}
{"text":"great people, food was very good....best late night place near the casinos on Rancho for the price."}
{"text":"From my experience, the customer service here isn't all that bad. It's not perfect, but it's not horrible either. My main issue is their slowness with orders. There is NO WAY I should have to wait 15 minutes for a fast food meal. It's absolutely ridiculous. These employees should be trained to hustle when preparing orders. From my several past experiences here, it's always the same. There was even a time where I was sitting in their drive thru for 15 minutes. UNCALLED FOR. Any Corporate Member of Del Taco reading this, please get it together with this location. You're losing customers!"}
{"text":"I love del taco and am so glad that I live close to one now. This place is hit or miss. They have messed up our order a few times and we didn't realize it until we got home. They are always friendly and pretty quick to get us our food."}
{"text":"Worst drive-thru experience of my life. It took over 15 minutes. But of course by the time I realized how ridiculously slow they were being, I was trapped between cars. After getting to the speaker to order and saying, \"hello,\" it took them two minutes to reply. What finally got them to reply/acknowledge was me saying out loud, \"Is there a problem, is something broken?\" To which the dolt on the other side replied, \"Nothing's wrong... give us a sec.\" Got to the window and had to wait another few minutes for them to come to the window so I could pay. When they did I told them they should find a way to warn people if they're going to be stuck in the drive-thru that long. To which the imbecile working replied something to the effect of, it only took a minute. Then he struggled to figure out my EXACTLY ONE DOLLAR CHANGE!!! I realize this is a fast food restaurant and not Ruth's Chris... but I'm pretty sure a pack of rapid raccoons could be trained to do a better job than those working there now. Haven't tried my fish tacos. Frankly, I'm a bit nervous to after the experience and will probably throw them away. This location has lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"This del taco is decent, normally busy since it's on the south end of las vegas blvd. The food is normally good, service is blah... but the convenience of it makes me what to give 3 stars. I've been to cleaner and better serviced locations. But for a quick bite it's not bad"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a late night snack it's close to my job and they are open 24 hours STEVEN was my server he was very nice and polite he offer me everything to complete my order great customer service the food was made fast and delicious my number one place thanks"}
{"text":"More expensive than a regular Del Taco off the strip but a godsend when you're drunk, hungry, and hot. It's the cheapest food in the Showcase Food Court, plus it's hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Just grabbed an epic burrito.  This thing should come with a warning... I honestly could not finish this thing.  It was so delicious!  I think it was less than 4 bucks.  I'd know for sure but we weren't given a receipt.

The guy at the drive through was very pleasant & quick.    So stuff!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service experience possible. Not sure how to explain the lack of fortitude or the service of employees who do not give s shit. After working a late shift the Bf and i where excited to make a late night run to Del Taco, 6 miles out of our way. 

First we order fries and fish tacos and \"Julio\" told us that the fryers were down for cleaning and we could not order anything fried they offered. Being kinda dead set on our cravings we asked when the fryers would be available to make our food....  Julio said 20 minutes. Having traveled all this way, hungry and tired we ordered crunchy tacos while we waited for the fryers to be cleaned,

Crunchy tacos were delivered cold and thrown together! Stale tasteless cheese and meat surrounded by a cold shell....... All the while we sit in the parking lot and watch three cars go through the service line without an issue. Now were kinda pissed, We wait the appropriate 20 minutes for the fryers to be \"cleaned\". We go back through the drive through and try to place our order. Again we are met by Julio, he says again that we cannot order anything because they are still cleaning the fryers and are now closing...... 25 minutes early! 


We ask what we can order and are suggested to order more tacos and crunchy tacos..... and guess what? THEY'RE STILL STALE!! 

The soft tacos are so cold that the tortilla is inedible.......


I understand that you may not have the best of jobs or even life your job,,,,, but that is not an excuse for lies and closing shop early. Those actions speak volumes of  the type of employeez Del Taco is willing to hire or want to represent the company.



No longer willing to go out of my way for this company"}
{"text":"this is an update on the last review...again great service from the drive thru. I didnt have to ask for any extra stuff with my meal. Drive thru worker (host) Guillermo was on point and did a good job expediting my order...just want to give him proper recognition for insuring i had a good meal. my order was a dinner order and it took place on Nov 15th 2013 at 642pm. Once again del taco goes the job right and puts most drive thru fast food resturants to shame!"}
{"text":"I swear I think they tried to poison me my drink was sour and tasted like something rotting the next morning I went to pour the soda down the drain and it reeked of something awful. I can't go back after that."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star I would. Every time I have been here there always seems to be something missing in my order. I'll just say this, don't waste your time. The people who prepare your food do it hastily and will probably forget to put it in your bag, leaving you with a bag of salsa packets."}
{"text":"I love this location !

My favorite is the macho burrito ( Huge ) and the french fries all for about $5 give or take plus tax.

Del Taco is right next door to the ghetto Circkle K so you can't miss it.  They have great specials from time to time such as .39 cent tacos.

If you live near one give them a try."}
{"text":"When my partner and I went to Las Vegas we walked from Stratosphere all the way down the strip. I was fascinated by all the food options I he never tried before. I was like a kid in a candy store. I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat, but we both knew it had to be somewhere cheap. We walked past what looked like a good court from all the many fast food signs located on a single building. That's when we both saw the Del Taco sign. I didn't think anything of it since I'm from Chicago and we don't have any around there. My partner, however, couldn't hide is enthusiasm. Being a fan of fast food, he told me I had to try it.

Now I'm a huge fan of Taco Bell (this is where you hate me or agree with me) so I was already walking into it thinking I'd hate it compared to TBell. I have to say I'm glad I tried it. The prices are cheap, and they have a pretty decent selection on their menu. Some which you can't get at TBell like fries, burgers, and fish tacos. I decided to go with the fish taco and fries.

I fell in love with it instantly. The fish was crispy, and piping hot. The batter had a delicious flavor to it because it is beer battered. I can't express how much I love beer battered food. On the taco it came with a combination of cabbage and a secret sauce which honestly combined tasted like coleslaw. I was fine with that though because the cabbage was crunchy and the sauce was creamy. It went perfectly with the fish. 

I have to mention the French fries too. I'm surprised a taco place could make me gasp in amazement at their French fries, but Del Taco did it. They were crinkle cut, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, salty, and the right amount of greasy. A perfect fast food fry. The whole meal was delicious. I just wish I hadn't eaten at a buffet a couple hours before so that I didn't feel like death after stuffing Del Taco down my gullet.

It's fast food, but no food should be discriminated against. Give it a try if you're cheap and got a hankering for some good fast food. I obviously recommend the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Del Taco......this place is my go to place as I have grown tired of taco bell. I always get the chili cheese nachos and they really spare no expense on the cheese sauce. Friendly people that work there and rarely have any issues."}
{"text":"Every single time I come to this location and simply order just grilled chicken tacos, im asked to pull off to the side and wait for my order.... Las time I checked it was called fast food right??"}
{"text":"My son and I eat at this location at least once a week and everytime we go there we're greeted with warm, heartfelt smiles by Sam and the rest of the crew.  My son always had a special order, as do I, and it's never been a problem!  The ladies who work the cook line are awesome at what they do!
Thank you Del Taco for bringing back carnitas!!! My favorite, especially in a crunchy shell with avacado and pico de gallo!!! Yum! Best ever!
If you were here a long time ago and were disappointed, I urge you to try it again. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I usually order the crispy chicken ranch taco, which im always satisfied with.. but tonight, I wanted to tried something different... ordered the crispy shrimp taco and it was alright. This was my second time having it and I felt like it tasted better the first time. There was more lettuce and pico de gallo in it this time and I barely tasted the shrimp. The churro I ordered could've been better. A little too hard for me. Other than that , its always a plus that theyre open late at night!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever went here last nite ordered one large sprite get to the window and the cashier told me the drink was $10 five times...finally after she realized that all I had was one drink she told me how she know the board says it's $1 but the manager changed the price...clearly that's false advertising and I wasn't having that everything about this was all wrong aside from me spending 20 min unable to get out of the drive thru the negative attitude from the cashier and the rude manager the soda was just ok... never going back late nite crew is the worst!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Made the effort to drive here at 650am and door says they open at 6am but the doors were locked. not open but someone sitting there eating, employee maybe. This location sucks for this reason at least."}
{"text":"I like Del Taco for the most part.  But this location is crossed off my list of places to eat.  They switch out their shift managers like underwear.  So the service isn't consist ant.  I went to the drive thru and ordered about 12.00 bucks worth of food.  I checked the bag for ketchup and notice the fries were all burned.  I parked and walked into the dinning room and asked for fries that weren't burned (dark orange and super crispy).  The manager said they're all like that.  And sure enough, I looked and they had a whole thing of where they put the fries sitting there burned just like mine.  

I'm not picky but Del Taco fries are always salty and a little crispy but not crunchy like chips.  I complained to their corporate office, even giving my contact info along with completing a survey.  I have heard nothing.  I sent a follow up email to their corporate office complaining about the visit how they didn't even offer to cook new fries.  I got my money back for just the fries and ate the rest of the food without FRIES.  I should have refunded the whole order but I wasn't thinking.  Oh well, let somebody else pull that crap and I will.  But I don't go to that one location anymore."}
{"text":"Watched the staff completely disrespect a family. The \"manager\" was a coward and did nothing to help the situation. There's not enough characters for me to explain how poor this staff behaved and how much it pissed me off and it wasn't even directed toward me. Consider yourself lucky Del Taco that I won't say anymore."}
{"text":"I really like Del Taco in general, but almost every time I go to this location they mess up my order."}
{"text":"I like Del Taco in general, but I won't be going back to this location. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with no sauce, but they gave me one with sauce. The tortilla was hard and it looked like it had been sitting for awhile. I also had to wait for them to come back to the window for part of my order that they forgot."}
{"text":"its del taco.  Just order the food as it comes and dont make it complicated and you will be fine."}
{"text":"Good Drunk food.  They actually put cheese in the tacos unlike other locations."}
{"text":"Just about every time I go to this location, there are issues. From cashiers not able to speak English, food is taking too long to come out, forgotten items.  I once saw one of the food makers boobs touch the inside of a burrito she was making.  The food is decent but service is bad"}
{"text":"I always have a great experience here! I live right behind it, thus a weekly regular. I most always get crunchy Tacos and soft chicken tacos. Always yummy. Rare to have an issue, but when I do, I bring it up to employee and it is always handled fast with no question; guess it helps to be a regular!"}
{"text":"While conveniently located near me this DT doesn't unlock its doors early. If you want to sit and eat its not an option. Also, they never have cream for coffee. Once the guy gave me a small milk bottle. Just gave it to me to use for coffee. The Del Taco in Mesa on Country Club never has these issues."}
{"text":"Food was fine. Counter service fine. BUT staff yelling and cussing at each other was absolutely ridiculous!!!!  Not to busy, bunch of staff standing around making inappropriate comments to each other and the dining room was a giant mess..  not sure where managers were but apparently not there."}
{"text":"Need to get more help in the inside.. waiting over 10 mins and no one said anything to me. The young man took the couple order in front of me and then went back to drive thur helped another 2 more cars and took another order and I still no ORDER.. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.. THANK FOR NO SERVICE.."}
{"text":"The customer was excellent. The restaurant was steady but the service was great. I was greeted once I walked in the door. Way better than the service I received at the other Del Taco on Peoria Rd. Thank you for your fast clean service ladies."}
{"text":"This del taco is horrible, they have no idea how to run a fast food restaurant. The drive through takes about 30-45 mins. The order is 99% always wrong. The Manager has no clue! Corporate should shut it down or fire all the management and put in people who know how to have respect and serve great customer service. No wonder it's never busy!"}
{"text":"Best del taco in town hands down. Staff is amazing. Food is wonderful. Can't ask for anything better. Also just found out dining is open until 2am on most days and on the weekends, open all night! Score!"}
{"text":"Never been to a Del Taco in my life... and boy... was I missing out.

It's one of the chains that I feel like the food is actually better than \"South of the Border\" (reference to the old Taco Bell slogan if you're too young to remember).

Great food, and it's super fast.   I noticed that through the drive-thru, they actually have a timer set on the drive-thru window.   I actually dislike this method of management for food since sometimes you get some really crappy wrapped up food or what not.   It is fast food, but no reason to completely screw up someone's order due to a timer.

However, this is a nice segue to Tex Mex when you want it but don't feel like running down to a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times. Pretty decent. The drive-through is fairly quick and the staff very friendly. I like the idea that you get french fries with talkers. I like to get fish tacos when Igo there. My daughter likes the chicken tacos."}
{"text":"This would have been 5 stars but the bathrooms come on!  But there is a young Hispanic kid(not being discrimitory I forgot his name). He mainly works the drive thru he is amazing always remembers my order knows what car I'm driving in and knows I like a lot of sauce!  I will add his name when I ask him but day time drive through that kid rocks!!! Thank you for hiring him!!!!"}
{"text":"i can't stop eating this junk. 
Tuesday and Thursday Tacos! I swear everytime I go in , they have new people??! what's with that?

anyway.. i like this place because its simple, fast and taste good."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco but this location..What can I say I give negative rate if l could. First of all the drive thru is a nightmare. They can't take more than one order at a time. They don't take the order till the car at window leave. And the order... Ordered two of same number combo, had to repeat it 4 times. When I got home nothing was right. Asked for extra crispy on fish tacos and fries but what I got was uncooked frise. Overall the experience was horrible. PLEASE FIX THIS STORE..!!"}
{"text":"Last time I came here it was a horrible experience all together. Well I decided to give it a second chance and I'm very glad I did. I was greeted by Juan Pablo and may I say I was very happy with my overall experience. Very friendly and by far the best customer service Ive ever received at Del Taco. BRAVO MR JUAN PABLO!!!! WE WILL BE SEEING YOU AGAIN SOON!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Del Taco's food, but this location is very much lacking.

The past 2 days i have been there they have been unable to take anything but cash orders due \"technical difficulties\" I work very early in the morning and at 5am there aren't too many options available, but I will start seeking out other options. Even before these past few days Ive had problems with extraordinary waits in the drive thru, incorrect orders, etc., so when I read the other reviews prasing \"speedy service\" I had to do a double take and make sure I had the right location.

I understand its fast food and I keep my expectations reasonable, but at some point I am paying money for a service and when the ball is dropped over and over at some point you finally say \"Enough is enough\" and go elsewhere....and that's what I am doing with this location.

Adios Muchachos!"}
{"text":"This is the Del Taco location that can be found on the south side of Tropicana and west of Maryland Parkway.

I do like me some wonderful Del Taco for quick, cheap eats on the go. Not the healthiest option in town...but oh well...shhh..stuff happens..

My recent visit to this particular location turned into a comedy of errors rather quickly..

\"Welcome to Del Taco, can I take your order.\"

\"Yes, I'd like 3 chicken soft tacos with no lettuce, 1 mini quesadilla, and 2 Diet Cokes.\" ...(Yes, yes...I don't want to hear it about the Diet Coke lol)

\"What was that?\"

\"I'd like 3 chicken soft tacos with no lettuce, 1 mini quesadilla, and 2 Diet Cokes please.\"

\"Hold on a second.\"

(*grrrr*)


\"Welcome to Del Taco, can I take your order.\"

(*seriously, dude?*)

\"It's still me and I would STILL like 3 chicken soft tacos with no lettuce, 1 mini quesadilla, and 2 Diet Cokes.\"

\"ok. pull forward\"

Damn. That was exhausting!

I get to the window and the first thing that happens is some dude pops out of the window and says, \"No lettuce on those chicken soft tacos, right?\"

\"Um, no.\"

....

About 2 long, awkward minutes pass and a girl shows up at the window and collects my money. I got my food and it did the trick...but damn! I felt like I was starring in a sitcom or something!

What in the blue hell just happened??

I like Del Taco, but this is NOT one of their better locations. The people seem nice enough, but appeared to have great difficulty pulling their heads out of their rectal cavity long enough to complete the taxing assignment of getting my 3 chicken soft tacos with no lettuce, 1 mini quesadilla, and 2 Diet Cokes.

No Bueno.

2 stars."}
{"text":"This Del Taco location can be found on the west side of Rainbow Blvd., just north of Warm Springs. It is easy to spot just south of the Hooters Restaurant. 

It is ok for what it is. It is cheap, quick food available 24/7.

I love their chicken soft tacos! I also love that they have an extensive menu of items under 99 cents! You can grab a value size burrito, a mini quesadilla, some hard shelled tacos, or nachos among many other items! All of these things (and more) are priced at just  99 cents or less! The food I have gotten here has been solid by Del Taco standards. Nothing over the top, but not bad either.

The service is okay. I've certainly had worse at other Del Taco locations. That being said, keep your expectations realistic. 

So, I guess what I am saying is that this location is your standard, run of the mill Del Taco. It is what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.

It's A-ok...for what it is...

3 stars."}
{"text":"This is the Del Taco located on Sunset Road,directly across the street from the Galaxy Luxury Theater. 

On the way to go see Avengers: Age of Ultron last night (fun, fun movie , btw), we stopped by here to grab some burritos to sneak into the theater. (*Shhhhhhhh, don't tell anyone*)

We pull up, ordered 2 Del Beef Burritos and were told to pull forward. Cool. Just as we were pulling forward, the girl who took our order says, \"It's gonna be a while\"

Wait. what?

We pulled forward with one vehicle in front of us. We wait.....and wait...and wait. After 12 minutes I notice that it  appears that the vehicle in front of us is not pulled up to the window. In fact, it is about 5 feet BEHIND the window. There were four twenty something males in the car. So I approached the vehicle and said, \"Hey...what's going on here?\" 

They explained that they were told to back up from the window from the girl inside and that they were as annoyed as I was because they had waited almost 15 minutes for 3 cheeseburgers. They offered to pull up if they didnt get their burgers in the next few minutes so we could get out of there. 

At the 16 minute mark of my wait, the guys in front of me get their order and pull off. I pulled up and paid for the burritos expecting to just grab the bag and go. After all, previews have now started for our movie.

The girl collects the money and closes the window and walks off. I looked at my friend and literally said, \"Are you F*cking kidding me??\" This is about 18 minutes in. 

I had had enough. I told the girl to give me my money back. This was BEYOND rediculous. By the time I pulled away it was 23 minutes. 23 MINUTES! Nothing fast about this food at all!

When I first pulled up to order, she should have said they were having issues and that there would be a long wait. I would have backed out and been on my merry little way. Slipping in a \"It'll be a while\" as you pull forward does not cut the mustard. 

THESE are the people that want $15 an hour??? Are you out of your flippin', ever loving minds??

Never again. That $28 soda and popcorn is much more appealing than going through this again. Hell, a root canal sounds more enticing..

1 star."}

{"text":"Came here for lunch today and stood by the front counter for 3 minutes while everybody ignored the fact that a customer was here.  I asked for a water cup with my meal and received a major attitude.   The store manager was degrading her workers in front of all of the customers.   I won't be coming back here ever again."}

Just spent 5 minutes in the drive thru trying to get my order through to the employee who either was too busy to pay attention (No one else was there) or did not understand English. She had me pull to the window and repeat the order and she STILL got it wrong! Not even the type of sauce packets was right! She almost gave us an extra drink from not paying attention, again not ONE OTHER PERSON THERE. Disappointed Del Taco, disappointed."}
{"text":"I wanted to get something special since i got my tax return back so i decided to check out The Del of Tacos on Country Club Dr. I figured this location would be the nicest since the street was named after a doctor. I walked in and sat down at a table since i didn't see a host. I sat there for 20 mins and never saw a waitress and never even got a menu or a glass of water! I gave it 2 stars cause the playland was fun and they had a hot sauce buffet but i am probably never going back there this week."}
{"text":"I had the Fish Taco Platos, it came with refried beans with red sauce and cheese, white rice topped with pico de gallo, and two fish tacos. The two pieces of fish were fried and topped with tomatoes, cabbage and lime, I ordered my fish tacos with a flour tortilla, but I'm pretty sure it actually comes on corn tortillas.  

The meal was tastier than the normal fast food fare, and the price was affordable. You can't go wrong if you're in the mood for fish tacos, and a Del Taco is near you."}
{"text":"Service here can be a little slow, especially at night, but overall it's worth the wait. The one complaint I've had about the food is that they tend to be a little skimpy on the cheese in the tacos. The ingredients are very fresh and flavorful, and the workers generally have a positive disposition, which goes a long way towards earning my forgiveness for the wait. 

On taco Tuesday, it's possible to get a generous meal for two people with leftovers for under $10."}
{"text":"Busiest in town makes it fresh.  Get some always fast fresh and friendly, its fast food, but WAY better than Taco bell..boo his...zero stars for Taco bell....  Del at least has some fresh ingredients and flavors, inferno sauce is best.    Almost a 4 star, but its a fast food place.  Service is stellar, so lets call it 3.5 stars..not 4 stars yets till they serve beer.  lol"}
{"text":"Whoever just answer that the window could barely speak English wanted to charge me for two coffees for a large ice coffee she was very rude and said that was impossible to do when they usually charge me $0.50 for a larger size. I've been 5 times and each time my food is cold but my coffee's good will never go there again."}
{"text":"Why is this place even open I pull up at 4:30 in the morning for them to tell me they don't have any coffee OK let me have your bacon breakfast burrito I pull up to the window so they can tell me they don't have that either wtf"}
{"text":"Saw all the commercials and thought I'd try it.  HORRIBLE!  I had the chicken taco which should be hard to mess up but boy did they.  The taco was so greasy and the chicken was chewy.  The \"toppings\" were not good and after eating it I felt sick.  I have never returned to a Del Taco anywhere else and do not plan to.  I had to give it a star so I can post but otherwise I would not give it anything."}
{"text":"How are you going to make me sit in the drive thru and repeat my order 2 twice because your too busy laughing to what someone said inside and not paying attention to the people who are waiting patiently. And on top of that because your laughing so hard when I get home and check my food to start eating with my family. I look at the receipt and the food on the counter and you forgot my French fries. Yea maybe not the biggest thing to worry about, but I paid for them and you didn't give it to me."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Del Taco a couple of times a week for several years and I am amazed of how when they ask you what sauce you want and you say medium, they most often give you mild. Still, they never forget to ask whether you want things you never ordered. The marketing gimmicks and upselling crap is ruining this company."}
{"text":"Fast, clean, VERY friendly - asked if I wanted a water cup when I didnt order soda. My favourite Del Taco!"}
{"text":"This location appears new and fresh. No lines. Staff and the other visitors are cheerful. No reason not to give 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my second review. I love Del Taco but this time on this location there were a few issues. The restaurant was not clean and the strawberry lemonade was overfilled so it spilled."}
{"text":"Since Del Taco is my favourite chain I have gone to most, so I can certainly say this is the dirtiest I have been to. The staff seemed relaxed about the situation though, with exception for for alittle drama with twitchers shooting up in the toilet they were eating away happily. No other guests in the restaurant, most prefered drive through. Good thing security was parked outside. If I will eat here again I better bring my gun (and cleaning supplies)."}
{"text":"Shift workers get fed the lousiest take out food. Just tonight I asked for a taco with no lettuce. yuck its loaded with more lettuce than anything else.  Same place, different night I ask for carne asada fries, no guac.....LOADED with guac when I got it home.  Wow really.  I used to think it was sort of an insult to check my bag before leaving the window, but it's gonna be mandatory now."}
{"text":"I  was curious with their tag line..DONT JUDGE THE TACO BY IT'S PRICE. lol... so I opened and checked their taco..lol... hmmm....anyway ... 3tacos for a 1$, good deal!"}
{"text":"Food is okay and most times my order is correct. Yesterday I ordered a simple Carne Asada burrito (just the burrito) with a side of small fries. So gal taking order asks if I want a drink with that. I say No thanks. She repeats the order as I said it and asks if I want sauce. I say Hot please. She gives total and it sounds like she said $8 and change. I pull up, pay, and receive the wrong order. Since I was in a rush to get back to work I didn't have the time to pull in and wait again for another order. Just an inconvenience for those rushing to get back to work. Plus, I'm not big on returning to argue the fact of someone's mistakes and risking some malice done to the next order. At least now I now the Platos meal isn't worth getting."}
{"text":"Just went to Las Vegas for some fun and found this place right down the street from where I was staying! I LOVE Del Taco! There aren't very many around where I live anymore so I was thrilled to find this place so close! It was so clean and the staff was SO fast! I went through the drive thru (ordering a bunch of food for me and my friends) and the food was ready in about a minute! Thank you Del Taco staff for the clean and friendly experience!"}
{"text":"We are now waiting in line on their drive thru. And probably going to wait for another hour because he got my order wrong! And after he took our order right this time he made a comment \"oh they'll going to love you me!\" Ahhhhh no! The guy taking the order shouldn't be taking orders! 
I love Del taco's surf and turf but this location has bad staff. Just no sense of urgency!"}
{"text":"Have eaten from here twice so far, and enjoyed it both times.  I work at one of the local medical clinics and can't leave the building during my shift, so one of my coworkers was nice enough to go pick it up for me.  Both times I had some combination of tacos and beef burritos, and had the fries once.  Both times, the food was hot and fresh and the taco shells nice and crunchy.  Del Taco is my favorite non-authentic place to get Mexican (Tex Mex / Americanized Mexican) food, and I've been to many of them on several occasions.  For all but one location (not mentioned here), the food is consistently good, and the service is usually faster than their competitors that serve a similar menu.  In all, I expect to eat here many more times in the future given its consistent quality and proximity to my work location."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst fast food establishment known to man. Okay, that's a little harsh but my experience was so awful, I will never stop by this establishment again.
First off, it took a few mins to get someone on the intercom to help me take my order. Then I preceded to ask what were the indigents of one of the menu items, considering I hardly ever go there I didn't have a clue. Then there was silence, I asked the same question again a minute latter when someone was on the intercom a 2nd time. Then there was silence, only to have this punk kid come outside and point at the menu and say something to the effect of look here, can't you see what's on this. Then I made an remark about his unprofessional attitude, then he came back outside like a gang banger and asked me \"What did you say\" .
So yeah, if Del Taco will hire an unprofessional gutter trash like this,  I won't be visiting this or any other Del Taco establishment ever again."}
{"text":"I like Del Taco for a quick bite to eat, I usually go to the drive thru at the one by my work on Maryland/Tropicana which there is friendly and competent staff. This one is on my way home so thought I would grab a quick burrito, the woman at the window was so bad I just left, but I gave it one more try yesterday on my way home, I specifically asked for an item when I got home it was left out, so I will not be back. They need to hire competent people, maybe high school students, I'm sure they would do a better job. I will not return even if they say the 3rd time is a charm NOT when it comes to what I'm going to eat :/"}
{"text":"I've almost always had good food and service here - a difficult thing to deliver consistently at the same fast food location. Staff is not the friendliest, but usually efficient and tries hard to speak understandable English. The Mexican cashier with the 10x3 inch tattoo of California behind his right ear always creeps me out a little bit though. But hey, he's in the right industry. Amazing that there is actually legislation passing in various parts of this cesspool of a country to award people in rote, entry level positions with a $15/hr wage. I digress. Go grab a few chicken soft tacos at this location."}
{"text":"Daughter likes this place more than Taco Bell! But I am the Taco Bell fan! This location is fine, I never see this place that busy? Food is OK, i do like their combo burrito and chili cheese fries! Daughter loves their tacos. We will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Decided to hit the drive-through here just a couple nights ago. Never got a chance to leave a review till now. But I was honestly truly impressed. As far as it being so late and it's fast food does the customer service was exceptional. The young man helping me, I wish I would've got his name, really knew what it meant to perform great customer service. Made my night and it was much appreciated."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst Del Taco in town. I've been to this location prob 20 times and now drive to a different store further away. I get shorted food almost every other time I've gone though the drive though."}
{"text":"good location near Red Rock if you need a snack after/before a show.

clean store.

quick friendly service. 

When I mentioned that it was very cold in the store (the thermostat was set at 65'), the cashier asked another employee to turn up the heat a bit which I was so grateful for.

Food was cooked to order."}
{"text":"Today around 130pm went to this location because it was close to my work and  ordered food with a rude order taker through the drive thru and to top it off the way we prepare our Dog food looked more appetizing then how our food looked.. It looked messy just threw it together our burritto look like it was in a world war beef and sauce everywhere except in side the tortilla..smh..thats why Taco Bell will always be better..Never eating here ever again...and pricey as hell...unprofessional customer service and the food sucks"}
{"text":"I've been working the fireworks booth in the parking lot and we've been using this place for the bathroom and food quite a bit. The first day wasn't that bad. It was great food and an amazing customer service. The only reason I give it a two star rating. This morning was crap. The we're running out of everything. Which is cool. Today's probably truck day. But then they forgot our hash brown sticks completely. Then my friend and her son went over there. She watched the kitchen crew person pull her phone out of her pocket with gloves. Then grab tortillas with the same gloves to make her food. Her coffee had coffee grounds at the bottom and she didn't even eat the food she paid for. If they're using gloves while texting and making food, what's stops them from doing something worse? Plus the bathroom are disgusting. There's a tea stain on the counter by the soda machine that's been there for 3 days. Same stain. It's just gross. Beware."}
{"text":"Carnitas burrito was good. Nachos a-ok. Tater tots a-ok. My stomach doesn't like the beef tacos."}
{"text":"I can get a burger, a taco, and some fries with chili on it in one shot.  Seriously, who doesn't love that?  Their burgers aren't bad, either.  I have to say, my favorite thing at Del Taco isn't their tacos, although they're good, but the chili cheese fries.  I am totally addicted."}
{"text":"This is my first ever time trying this chain.  I am pleasantly surprised!!! MUCH better than \"Taco Hell\".  My fixin's were fresh, the meat was well seasoned.  I was afraid to try it because fat Mexican food can be really gross.  I'm not opposed to pulling into another one of these drive thrus in the future now! Food is 3/5 but with their affordable menu pricing I added a star.  Where else can you get lunch for under $5!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big deal taco fan, this del taco was a huge disappointment, the food was super par the restaurant was unkept and dirty and the manager was very rude to me when ordering, surprised if it'll stay open long if things don't change....."}
{"text":"A few hours ago we went through the drive thru and placed an order that should have been around $20 but were told it was $46. When we got to the window, she asked us to repeat our order and gave us a receipt with a bunch of items we didn't order voided out, and a total of $17. She told us to wait up front, so we did for about 15 minutes. She comes out with half of our order (a quesadilla and a taco) and claimed that she didn't charge us for the rest of the food and would have to run my card again, but we proved that we paid $17 and she said that was only for those two items. She disappeared for a while again (with the food and receipt) saying she would get the manager, but the manager never came. 

After about 15 more minutes, we went inside and asked to speak to the manager about getting a refund. We paid most of it on a gift card, so if they issued a refund it would only put a couple bucks back on my debit card and we wanted to explain this so that we didn't lose $15. Before we were even able to say this however, the manager (I believe his name was Jose) was clearly overwhelmed and didn't want to speak to us. He said, \"look, I'm going to call the cops. We are too swamped to get you your order, we'll just refund it. I have the right to refuse service to anyone.\" I understand that you can refuse service to anyone, but we had waited for 30+ minutes for food that we never received, we never got an explanation as to why, we were not going to get our money back, and he had the audacity to threaten to call the cops? No one was getting loud, cursing, or causing a disturbance, there were other customers just as upset waiting for their food as well, and we honestly just wanted to make sure we got our money back. 

I never write reviews or complain about service, because I get it...sometimes you get a rush and mistakes happen, but I have never been treated like this. Clearly they were having issues with the ordering because initially our order was combined with someone else's, but we understood and were fine with pulling up front to wait for our food! Even when we had waited 30 minutes for our food and/or the manager to come out, we were okay with having to go in and ask for a refund on both the gift card and debit card so there was no confusion. What we were not okay with was being told that we would not receive our food because they were too busy, and that they would call the cops on us despite the fact that it was completely unwarranted and unprofessional. 

Luckily, another manager stepped in and understood what we were trying to say about the gift card. She took over and made sure that we got the full amount refunded onto both cards, and asked if we wanted a medium drink to compensate. We declined but thanked her profusely for helping us. She was so calm and composed compared to the other manager, that I wish that we just had the opportunity to speak to her in the first place.

The incompetence Jose showed as a manager is unacceptable. I have no idea what was happening at this location tonight with so many orders going wrong, but it was just a mistake during a simple dinner rush. A good manager does not handle this by claiming they're just too busy to make the food, let alone that they will call the cops on you if you ask for a refund for the food they are too busy to make."}
{"text":"I guess their \"open 24hrs\" sign is just for looks, or maybe they were too busy checking facebook on their smartphones at 2:30am on a saturday night, it's all good cause jack in the box ALWAYS has prompt service..

maybe next time huh?.."}
{"text":"Like Taco Bell, but not as fancy. Thirty-nine cent tacos apparently don't provide enough income for decor."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed at this Dell Taco. First of all the cook Frances had her fingers in her mouth. Perhaps she should wear gloves at all times. I'm sure Nevada Health Department would be more than interested in Dell Taco Store #728. The French Fry's were very old and Fried in old grease. Totally gross. And the young man in the drive through doesn't listen very well but was very nice .As I told him twice that I wanted Root beer and ended up with Cherry Coke.  More than anything I'm shocked and appalled at the cook Frances. I didn't even eat the food and I love Dell Taco."}
{"text":"Came through the drive thru after piccing up my girlfriend late after work. Placed my order with Brian, super fast and very nice. Repeated every item that we ordered to us at the window down to which tacos had what sauce and were in what bag."}
{"text":"I came to this Del Taco and ordered some Tacos and a burrito. Everything was tasty and the owner and staff were quick and friendly. I recommend this Spot!"}
{"text":"The shake machine is never working or they are cleaning it. And the strawberry lemonade is always watery."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and I'll never go here again. I went to the drive-thru and sat and waited and waited about five minutes. Finally, I pulled up the window and finally somebody poked their head out and asked what I was doing there. I explained that nobody had taken my order at the speaker. He looked at me like I just killed somebody. He took my order and I got it quickly. I came back another time through drive-thru and whoever it was had difficulty understanding so I pulled up to the window without being able to complete the order. At the window, the person who appeared to be a manager took my order and said with a sulky attitude that \"it helps if you speak up.\" Clearly a speaker problem, not me. The third time I had to go inside and make change for the bus. This they could handle without a problem. It seems that that's all they're capable of doing."}
{"text":"Have to say that Del Taco is more often good than not. I guess it just depends when you go and who the cook is.However it's fast food Taco. So for the fast food standard the food is not bad. The prices are low. It's open 24/7 ad it has a drive through. I LOVE the fact that they're open 24 hours. Number one destination for my early morning after party drunken quest for a hangover cure."}
{"text":"I like the mini bacon quesadilla very much,it's so fresh and delicious,only 79 cents for 1.I go to the place almost every morning.Although they often give me something wrong, but their food is really delicious and cheap, so I still like to go there to buy breakfast."}
{"text":"At my last visit to this place, I had the #7 (Two Fish tacos with fries and a drink) and chili cheese nachos.

The nachos were decent; they were hot, cheesy, and had a good chili flavor to them. Not a bad deal for only $1. The left over chili/cheese sauce went well with my fries. Nothing special, but it worked. The fries I had been given were pretty delicious. They were salted, crispy, and hot.

The fish tacos come warm wrapped in foil. Upon opening the foil, there is a single slice of lime before full uncovering the taco, which I thought was pretty neat. However, all thoughts of ingenuity vanished when I learned that the limes I had been given were dry and incapable of producing any significant amount of lime juice what so ever. Upon opening the rest of the foil wrapper, what I was greeted with was a decent sized fish taco on a flour tortilla. Unfortunately, the fish taco was void of any taco-like flavor. No flavor of fish, cabbage, nor salsa was present. However, any condiment I added on the taco, whether it was the few drops of lime juice I was able to produce or hot sauce, would become the flavor of the taco.

A typical Del Taco experience. Fast service, low quality food. I have enjoyed the other items on the menu, but I have learned not to expect much from a fast food joint. This was one of my less enjoyable visits."}
{"text":"Got home and found no mild sauce in my bag... Ugh!!!! The girl at the window has major attitude. I specifically told her I needed mild sauce and ketchup. I get home and no mild sauce. Honestly there's so many unemployed people that need jobs... Hire people that want to work!!!!!! When going thru drive thru please check your bags and your food as well!"}
{"text":"For a fast food chain restaurant, this location does it right.  Fast, friendly service, they always get my order right, and its filling food at a super economical price."}
{"text":"Asked for and PAID FOR extra cheese on my quesadillas & it was like they purposely put less cheese than normal. It was basically just warm tortillas. So disappointed.
Extra cheese is not a difficult order"}
{"text":"Don't come to this location. Go to the one on Charleston/town center instead its not that far. 

Always gets the order wrong
If it's right they have to repeat it 100 times to get it
NEVER have the total before you get to the window
Poor customer service"}
{"text":"Well I finally learned my lesson. DO NOT GO TO TJIS LOCATION EVER AGAIN!!!!! How effing hard is it to add an extra scoop of green chili to the cheddar green chili quesadilla. EVERY TIME! This time it came dry. Enough said."}
{"text":"Have been a customer of this location since 2004 but had not been up ver here in quite some time, that is until tonight. 

Same friendly, quick service as I remember. Great location, quality food, just as I remember it to be. I knew w I will be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE DEL TACO! Easy to get in and out of although their drive-up is designed rather weird. Service is excellent and I will be back for future visits!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service despite it being a bit tricky to get into their drive-through the way it's set up. This Del Taco is inside of a Circle K, sort of attached, if you will.  This one is on my way home and on Tuesday nights, we take advantage of Taco Tuesdays, where their tacos are 3 for $1 and bean and cheese burritos are 50 cents. Great cheap meal and delicious as well."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple times and haven't had any problems. They've been quick with the food, gotten my orders right, and very friendly and accomodating upon each visit. 

Best part? They're on my way back from my bank so on payday I can swing by and grab lunch on the way back to work!"}
{"text":"Smelled like complete shit inside the place, I couldn't stand being inside for longer than a couple seconds."}
{"text":"Very good service, friendly people, and hot, fresh food are what it's about for me and I got all of these both times I've gone to this location. I really like Del Taco and for the money, they are a good value. 

The only downfall I see to this location is it looks a bit trashy outside due to lightrail construction and scattered shopping carts here and there. You see the occasional strange character outside the restaurant but otherwise not bad. Easy to get in and out of as well, despite the lightrail construction."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco...with all my heart...but this location seems so \"ghetto\" compared to other locations I've been to. People wearing sloppy t-shirts and not proper uniforms. Workers acting like total slackers when you order and when you get to the pick-up window. Talking like thugs to customers (yes, I heard one worker talking that way to a customer at the counter the first time I went there, while waiting at the pick-up window to receive my food)

Asking for my food to be placed in a plastic bag with carry handles seems like such a hassle from the looks on their faces when I ask nicely. Then they've tried to give me cookies in small bags and NOT put in the bag with the rest of my food. What's up with that? Not acceptable, that's what's up!

I really hope they improve their work ethics and customer skills because I really like Del Taco's food and want to keep returning. It's either that or I wish they would build/open one up closer to my place (I have to drive over to Chandler and I live in Tempe)."}
{"text":"This Del Taco is in the West Valley. Pretty decent and very good, fast service. Ate there with co-worker and we had fresh fries and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Always hit and miss- but mostly miss

I rarely take the time on my days off from work to sit down for a large lunch in a good restaurant (I do for dinner). During lunch hour I am usually on a roll and I don't have the time for extended lunches.  With that in mind I am always searching for a good and quick place to eat. Unfortunately, Del Taco falls short. 


I have  said it many times before, I'm not a fan of Del Tacos food because their tacos do not have much filling in them, even when you order the double meat double cheese and the quality of food is always hit and miss.  However, my nephew enjoys the  food  at Del Taco so we decided to give it a shot. We decided to go through the drive thru.  I ordered two of the number six meals which included 2 double beef double cheese tacos, fries, and a drink.  I asked for the fries to be made \"extra crispy\" in hopes of getting fresh fries.  My hopes were crashed at least partially. As we pulled away I realized that one order of fries was fresh and hot while the other order was cold and stale. The frustrating thing beyond the cold fries was I asked the employee at the drive thru if the fries were fresh and extra crispy and she replied \"yes\".

The quality as a whole at Del Taco has seem to gone downhill fast.  I realize that Del Taco is a fast food establishment and fast food is what your going to get and I am fine with that. Howerever, I do believe the food should be fresh and made to order.  This doesn't appear to be the case with Del Taco. I have spoken to management on different occasions about the quality of food and have had meals replaced.

I will not be going back to Del Taco any time soon."}
{"text":"Del Taco is good for cheap food. Staff is very friendly. I don't like the soft tacos as much as the hard shell ones."}
{"text":"The place was dirty unclean the soda machine was broken but they gave us our drinks to fill"}
{"text":"After placing my order through the drive-thru window I was told to approach the window for the amount to be paid. the service was so bad I had to demand my money back so I could go across the street to Wendy's and received exceptional service.. Build that wall!!!"}
{"text":"Worse Del Taco of Las Vegas! Waited 12 minutes for a chicken soft taco. There were people ahead of me waiting almost 20 minutes. Get more people that know what the hell they're doing. Unacceptable! The staff member Sonia was bitching the whole time about how Julie got change her schedule from 6pm to 1am to 4pm to 1am. Its not any of my business what the schedules are. Get it. Your customers are important whether or not they're in the lobby or drive thru."}
{"text":"This is solely based on this store location only.  The quality control on their food is terrible.  The way the burrito was put together was gross. If you love Del Taco, go to another store.  Overwatered rice and over sauced burritos."}
{"text":"The service is awful. Very rude females working here, definitely will drive an extra few mins to not have to go to this location."}
{"text":"Hey, you know....It's fast food.  I don't expect a 5 star joint when I go to these places.   This place happens to be cheap, fast (usually), and better than average fast food eats.  

I've sometimes been a little impressed, sometimes a little let down but this place is overall worth coming back to and while not as good as some, its decent food, quick and on the cheap (and I think better than that other national chain)."}
{"text":"We came to this location after 10 pm and went thru the drive thru. There were  3 of us and we wanted separate orders. They said no, only 1 order per car. We had to seriously go thru the drive thru 3 times. There was no one even behind us. It was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times and it's definitely not consistent spotty one time you will have hot fresh food with great friendly service then next time things are horrible missing items or cold dryer out food or things not correct as ordered and everything is just tossed in the bag knowing this before going you will be OK just be sure to check your items before leaving"}
{"text":"I like Del Taco for fast food. I always get the same taco which is the Del. Pretty good for a good price. Not all the stores are clean though"}
{"text":"Clean. Hot food & a nice location. Very quiet inside. Bathroom was clean too. Not all Dels are the same quality. This is a better one."}
{"text":"We were the 2nd car inline at the drive thru, it took a while for us to get to the window and pay, my husband and i had the chicken avocado burrito and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Food was good typical del taco but service was slow I only got my food because I went up and mad dogged the girl who took my order. I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I have had great friendly cashier she was in a cheerful mood.  Their $1 menu, I had one item if each. Half lb bean & cheese was my favorite. I like they chicken & beef soft Tacos. Real fresh like they say."}
{"text":"It's not the best service, sometimes it's hot and fresh other times it's ice cold food.  I come here Thursdays for 3 chicken tacos $2.29 from 3 - 11 PM.  Tuesday they have 3 tacos for $1.29, 3-11 PM."}
{"text":"The food was fine - just as good as every other Del Taco (maybe better?).  The drive-thru service was very fast, HOWEVER I only received three pieces of an item that was supposed to be four pieces.  I would rather my order be filled properly than get to me quickly, hence the reason I am taking the time to review a fast food place."}
{"text":"It's Del Taco! Came here a few days through drive thru and was told to hold on because the battery in the headset was dying. Then to just be told to pull around and order at the window lol. Gotta love fast food druve thru mishaps... You have to make sure you use the coupons they send out in the mail because if you are like me and don't like paying full price for something you can get for half you will enjoy them :-) I have somehow switched over from loving Taco Hell I mean Taco Bell.. to Del Taco simply because of the deals they always have. Plus Taco Bell doesn't sit well with me... literally lol. Listen they are both crappy for you however I prefer the Del Taco. They have more options and better ones at that. If you like chili cheese fries they have some killer ones on the menu. Just stay close to the bathroom afterwards and you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"Is it bad that the only reason I come to dell taco is because they have really good chili cheese fries?! I couldn't tell you a thing about the burritos! But what I will say is that the fries are so amazing and also they have this deep fried cheesecake type of desert! Yum! It will cost you about a million and a half of calories per bite but very worth it! The drive-thru at this location is always insane! If it's late night on the weekends then forget about it! Just this past weekend I was in line for over 20 minutes no exaggeration! It's a good thing I had nowhere to be seriously! The little boy that runs the order taking is a trooper because I could hear how he was getting cussed at from the drivers in front of me! I didn't even want to go there with him I took my fries and went about my business."}
{"text":"This Del Taco location is what you can call fast and efficient! It's a bit out of the way for me and I usually go to the one located on Tropicana and Fort Apache whenever I am in a Del Taco kinda mood. They have been pretty generous with sending out coupons and yes yes yes I am all about a deal! You kidding? The drive thru here moves super fast and I really appreciate that they don't mind parking you if they feel the food needs to be made fresh. Hell I will wait 20 minutes as long as I don't get nothing that's been sitting in a tray for the time past expiration!"}
{"text":"Let's see where should I start about del taco? It's not my favorite but it's convenient! I only order 1 of two things from them and that's the Epic Scrambler burrito off the breakfast side and the infamous cheesecake bites! That's about it.. Everything else has made me throw up in the past so... I stick to what I know whenever I decide to eat here. The drive thru usually moves pretty quick and the staff seems decent. I haven't had any issues with anybody nor the food."}
{"text":"This place is going through some renovations and it looks a bit beat up inside but...the jumbo shrimp taco was delicious! Monique who took my order was quick and friendly. They offer a $1 off survey for your next order of $3+"}
{"text":"Missing items from my order. No offer of sauce, no napkins. 
This location stinks. Not going back."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean. Clean tables, no visible dust, stocked condiments. You couldn't smell funk from the kitchen. 

Jamar (our cashier) was very charming and our order was correct. He even checked on us! Very nice considering how many TIP based restaurant servers don't. 

Food was clean and tasty. Fries were crisp, tortillas were fresh. Nothing felt old or heat lamp-ed. 

All in all, Fast Food doesn't have to suck and Del Taco is one of my go to's."}
{"text":"Still love the food for what it is. Service is friendly but it's been a consistent long wait whether its inside or drive thru for over a month now. Please hire more night staff! This is frustrating!'"}
{"text":"This location was filthy, rude man behind the counter and loud, obnoxious girl working.  Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm finding that Del taco is really a decent place the more I explore the menu! Most recently they have a promotion running where the UNLV Rebels score 21+ points .... I get free chili cheese fries! For some reason, I'll attribute it to skill, I keep getting free chili cheese fries! Making lunch on Del about once a week! I will say that the fries are pretty good, if they'd just cook them a little crispier they'd be very good! 

Yesterday, I actually tried the epic chicken queso burrito. It was huge! It had chicken, queso, fries, and I believe some pico de gallo. I will say it was bursting with flavor... the queso was spicy and creamy, the potatoes were freshly cooked, and the chicken was bursting with flavor!!

I'll definitely be back when hunger strikes for cheesy goodness!"}
{"text":"Nothing special but their pack deals are perfect for a family of four. We have gone through drive thru several times with no issue.  But they have problems when we've gone inside. They have gotten orders wrong. At least they figure out the mistake as they're handing the food to us but we still have to wait for the corrections."}
{"text":"Stopped in here recently to grab a bite on the way home. 

The young man working the window was great. Very upbeat and friendly.

Food was about average for Del Taco."}
{"text":"Good breakfast menu, good tacos, nachos, fries are a nice surprise. Breakfast is good stuff."}
{"text":"Soft. Chicken. Tacos.
I swear that stuff is so addictive. Just the right amount of blandness (which you can spice up with the mild or hot sauce packets).
Some days there are sales on where you can buy 10 soft chicken tacos for $10.
That stuff is usually gone really fast when I buy all 10..
Also great as hangover food, and for lining your belly before a party.
Even breakfast!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday...got food poising."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco for fast food when I have the right craving. I usually come to this location if I have a class to teach. I highly recommend the Tacos Carbon (chicken) mm tasty. This location is not the easiest to get in and out of. I recommend getting out at Shadow Ln and waiting for the light as opposed to trying your luck with traffic."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco but this location by far is the worst one I e had. They can't get an order correct. If you ask for extra or minus anything expect to get the opposite of what you asked for. Ask for not tomatoes get double tomatoes. It's a shame, the good news though if you like Del Taco just go to the one on Blue Diamond, better service."}
{"text":"This del taco has especially fresh and tasty food. The staff is always friendly and fast. Even late at night it has a line and it's still quick."}
{"text":"Well it's Del Taco... if you don't mind your butt exploding then this place is great!  Haha, seriously though, one of my favorite late night, and I'm super drunk places to eat.  A crazy large menu means you will find something to grub and I love any place that carries Mr Pibb.  Try the bacon and egg quesadilla."}
{"text":"I have just been on a deluxe chicken salad fix lately & it only tasted even better at this location for some reason! Also got the NEW chicken avocado burrito which had fresh avocado & black beans. 

Service was quick & fast in the drive thru. With even a line of cars we were in & out within 10 minutes. BRAVO =]"}
{"text":"DEL RAT since 2003 as we called it in High School.

I used to eat del taco 5x a week for lunch for couple years in my teen years because it was affordable & tasted delicious plus chicken soft taco Thursdays which used to be 1.09 back then 

Anyways went through the drive-thru as it was one of our stops & our cashier was nice & helpful especially when I couldn't get the name of the salad right as I couldn't remeber the name & couldn't find it fast enough on the menu being on the passage side.

DELUXE CHICKEN SALAD BOWL $4.89 - the bowl itself is made with some crispy fluff I assume to be flour & filled w/ thinly sliced lettuce w/ grilled chicken chunks, tomatos, cheese, guacamole, & sour cream(also comes w/beans but i opt. out). They were pretty heavy on the amount of lettuce & way too little amount of chicken to go w/ the pile lettuce. Still good just need to even out the portions...

CHURROS $1 - made to order so it's deliciously hot & fresh

SM. CARAMEL CHEESECAKE BITES $2.39 - oozing out soft cream cheese & caramel wrapped in a small tortilla like a chimichanga & deep fried! xP *DROOL* just thinking about its simplicity."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes this place is one of the best. Their food is always hot--unlike Burger King, for example. In my case, they are very vegan friendly so I like that! But even before I was eating a plant-based diet, I always thought this place was better for even burgers and fries than most of the other fast food joints. This particular store is better than other Del Tacos I've been to, too. Very good service here!"}
{"text":"Do not mimic someone if they can hear you on the speaker.  Other then that chips are stale but tacos good."}
{"text":"I've been going here for months now and the staff is always nice and the food is always good, they also have great fries and have generous sizes for the price on their drinks."}
{"text":"I should have known better, I figured hey it was good in north Phoenix so why not?

Ordered a burrito and it was tiny, the guy behind the register couldn't explain the menu to me, much less run the register.  Basically it feels like a ghetto Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Delicious food, it's truly hard to go wrong with their menu. Would be great if they expanded their breakfast hours (like, expand to 24 hours!), but that's not an issue specific to this location. 

This location is notorious FOR SCREWING UP YOUR ORDER. It's a running joke at work and with friends. Check your bag, check your bag. If you use coupons, prepare for a fight if you go into the store. Assistant managers seem incapable of making even the most basic of decisions so if the coupon doesn't spell things out step by step, they will become confused and refuse a simple accommodation like \"Green sauce instead of red\".

There was a Taco Bell right in the same parking lot, it was heaven to have them both side by side. I'd go into Taco Bell and get a buffalo chicken griller and eat it right in front of the employees while I waited for my spicy chicken burrito. I was the envy of the day. If I had to pick, I'd rather have Del Taco so I don't miss Taco Bell much."}
{"text":"I'm partially tipsy. On the strip. On a holiday. And hungry. Del Taco who serves french fries, tacos, and nachos sound like an amazing idea, right? 

But as Josh Q says, this Food Court is terrifying. The odd combination of overpriced fast food that is available in 99% of the rest of America for like 1000% less than is sold here is disgusting. 

After waiting in line for what felt like an eternity, the less than chipper young chap takes my order of 1 carne asada taco, 1 chicken asada taco and chips/cheese. You know I'm a high roller when I get the $3.00 taco! 

I wait...and wait....and wait....food finally comes out. I was really hoping they were back there slicing the carne asada to perfection for my delicious feast I was awaiting. Turns out, after one bite, it was more suited for the little doggies in Mexico. 

On the first bite of taco #1, I can't identify the meat which was room temperature. NO WAY it was steak! It was a gelatinous square chunk. The texture was one that makes me cringe when thinking about. 

So, I push the first to the side and ravenously bite into my second taco...chicken, that should be better, no? WRONG. Same texture, different color. They must have some machine that is manufacturing meat pellets, made with two different colors (yellow for chicken and brown for steak). 

Even after a few glasses of champagne and feeling what I can only describe as Ethiopian hunger...I threw that nasty stuff away! I couldn't even choke down 1 bite. 

YUCK! Del Taco, Mexican for \"Trash.\""}
{"text":"I don't know what it is these tacos but I've eaten here twice and each time I've gotten sick. I don't think its food poisoning but I think there is something in the taco that just doesn't agree with me. Their chicken taco is pretty tasty and it's nice to try something other than beef."}
{"text":"I looked up this locations hours before I made the 15 minute drive at 11 pm. I arrived at the location at 11:14 and they were closed. Apparently they close at 11 despite the website and the posted Yelp hours being midnight. This is not the first location I've experienced closing earlier than posted. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PEOPLE... UPDATE YOUR BUSINESS HOURS! Why is this so difficult for Del Taco?"}
{"text":"As a regular patron of Del Taco for many years, I have come to expect certain things. Among them are the always fresh and amazing caramel cheesecake bites, perfectly carbonated Mr. Pibb, an oddly satisfying combo of burritos and fries and the ability to get all of these options late night. 

Now, I don't like to complain and I refrained the first couple of times, but the third time has done it. I pulled up to the drive thru menu at 1:13 am and waited... nothing. Several minutes later I pulled up to see if the speaker wasn't working and I waited at the window to place my order, but no one was there... so I waited. I waited because the posted hours were clearly listed as closing at 2 am. As I previously stated, this was not the first time that I had visited this location around this time and no one was working. The second time there was a girl sitting on the front counter on her cell phone and she waved me on mouthing \"We're closed\". This time I decided to wait to see if someone would come talk to me so I could fund out why they were not helping me. Eventually a girl came to the window and said they were closed. I stated that the hours said they're open until 2. She then said we close at 1 to clean up so they can clock out by 2. Really? Is that how hours of operation work these days?

It has always been my understanding that if the posted hours state that you're open from 6 am - 2 am, that I can get service during the hours that the company said they would give me service. If you want to close at 1 instead of 2, please, be my guest, but change YOUR posted hours. This is a not science, but it is poor customer service."}
{"text":"Del Taco right on the strip?? and open 24/7? Equals Satisfaction!"}
{"text":"If you feel like sitting in the drive through forever, then this is your place.  Clear your evening plans because you'll be here a while.  

I had the audacity to ask for ketchup for my order of medium fries...yes, the 150 packets I was handed should suffice - until I get home & notice all but 1 packet is ketchup and the rest is mild sauce."}
{"text":"Honestly every single time I come here the customer service is beyond horrible. 
If you honestly hate your job THAT much then quit find something else being rude to your customers isn't gonna be good for your business. 
I shouldn't have to feel bad for ordering food. That's your fucking job.
Please take my advice quit. 
And for people that plan on coming here DONT.
I will never come here again.
Good job"}
{"text":"Tortilla wrap tapers off at the end; which is where I began my utensil-free meal.  One third into the burrito I finally bite into what I paid for.  At this point I'm projecting my star rating cuz I wasn't exactly glad with how my bites into the inconsistent burrito filling of the jumbo shrimp burrito started.

It turns out to be one of those things where expectations shouldn't be had.  The thing is the Del Taco commercial asking \"would you rather have jumbo eyebrows or jumbo teeth?...\" sent me a subliminal message.  I swore there's something else behind the strange ad.

And there was!  Seven jumbo battered shrimp later - hugged up in cabbage shreds, rice, and pick de gallo, I'm full, I'm satisfied, I stand corrected by my earlier presumption about the tapered tortilla wrap.  If there were anything I'd add to the pretty good flavor, it would be cilantro and maybe three slices of pickled jalapeno."}
{"text":"Food was good at this location but the service had me reeling when I went to buy a drink cup right at the front counter while these two ladies just stared at me and didn't come to help me then when the person who was working cash register came out from the back she had a conversation with the others before figuring out if I might need some help"}
{"text":"I went to this location surprised with how clean the kitchen looked only to go see a filthy dinning room. The food made me sick afterwords which brought it down from a 2 star to a 1."}
{"text":"Been going to Del Taco for over 40 years, this is one of the worst ones. I walk in and two employees were sitting in the corner being loud and their choice of words during their conversation was offensive. I was the only one in the place and they still could not get my order right. I had to tell the girl twice it was to go, and this was her response \"What\"?
She had absolutely no customer service skills at all. Again no one in the drive through and I was the only person in the place. Of course I should have checked the bags before I left, get home and a complete #4 was not even in the bag. The food was horrible and cold. Thanks for the waste of time and taking my money. Maybe its time to change management have you read the reviews for service?"}
{"text":"I realize this isn't a \"real\" restaurant and doesn't even deserve an actual review, but my experiences at this particular location are SO consistently terrible that I have to post.  Been eating this stuff since they took over Naugles in the 90's... a handful of their items are wonderful when you're in the mood - burger, fries, chili fries, green burrito, soft chicken tacos and hard shell regular tacos are staples.  The problem is that this location seems to underperform every single time I stop in.  The one in my neighborhood almost always serves fresh food, regardless of the hour.  This location, on the way to work, almost always serves measly portions and old, stale food.  Worse, at night their drive thru is ridiculously slow - it's like they're competing with McDonalds for shittiest late night drive-thru experience.  I've even had slow service in the afternoons with few cars in line.  So whoever owns and/or manages this hole needs to start giving a damn, start kicking their employees in the ass to pick up their pace and stop being  so deathly afraid of putting some damned cheese on their tacos!  Yes, it's cheap food.  But other locations have no problem serving edible food after your 15 minutes in drive-thru; this one is a joke."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes without getting to place my order. Went inside to see wtf was going on. Apparently they were short staffed with 3 people. I can't blame the girls for it although they could have put a sign up or something, they seemed overworked. I completely 100% blame the STORE MANAGER!!! Awful!!  awful!!!  management!!!! FU for wasting my time del taco management, I'm also letting corporate know about my complaint."}
{"text":"The general manager James is so nice every visit. When ordering food at the drive thru he took the time to actually ask how are you instead of the sad and miserable \"what can I get for you today\" and when taking my card at the window addressed me by name to have a great day. What little things someone can do to go above and beyond in customer service."}
{"text":"Staff not very friendly our last trip. Service was very slow? and it was not during peak eating time. Little to no cheese on tacos (as usual for this location). Order was incorrect (as it is s lot here), and they made it right. Dining area clean, but restrooms could use some work."}
{"text":"Smaller location and a bit cramped, but overall a very nice place. Very friendly staff and my order was perfect, as usual. Very clean dining area and restrooms. I Love this location because of its charm."}
{"text":"Employer was nice but it was so cold in the dining area. Too cold to stay and eat. I told them its too cold and she said everyone has been complaining about it. She told person in charge but she refused to make it warmer."}
{"text":"Quick meal through drive thru started great! Got home to find taco sauce all mild when I asked for mild and medium. Packets stuck together with I can only guess is sauce as well. We ordered tacos hard and soft. Hard tacos were inconsistently made. Some with contents packed to the brim of the shell, and some with the contents barely at half the shells height. I get it...its $.69 a taco...still a profit for the business though. #2Stars"}
{"text":"This breaks my heart to write. I was so excited to move to Southern Highlands and live so close to a Del Taco. I'm a Del Taco addict. There. I said it. Time for the healing to begin. 

This location is hands-down, no-contest the worst Del Taco in Las Vegas. I've gone here about a dozen times in the past couple months and EVERY TIME they forget something or screw something up. I don't order anything weird or make strange requests. I'm a straight from the menu sort of gal. However, something always goes wrong. 

I still go, because I'm a junkie and have no self control. But I always have to go through my contents before leaving because they always leave something out or give me something other than what I ordered. They need new management ASAP!"}
{"text":"I was generous with the 2 stars because the food was absolutely great. With Del Taco it usually is, of most fast food places.
Totally weird that in one of the two entrances here you end up passing the bathrooms before dining room and counter, very weird layout. Here's our bathrooms before you try our food?

Dining room was gross. Every table I went to sit at was dirty. No one has cleaned in a while. Staff had plenty of time to laugh and be slow behind the counter but not clean the dining room? When you are over staffed like they were this shouldn't be an issue. Dirty trays all over, used napkins, crumby booths. For the amount of locations there are of this place I will not return to this place. 

The service was mediocre at best. From the walk in to walk out I wasn't happy. Food again was really good. Great flavor. I asked for my fries well done/crispy and they weren't. Luckily their fries are always good no matter what."}
{"text":"Popped in while I was in the area and this place was good and bad for a few reasons. Customer service was good. Only 3 employees working. Girl was friendly who helped me today around 2:30. Order was right and fries were crispy like I asked for.

The soft shell chicken taco was juicy and flavorful and not too much to eat. A lot of cheese on it and I like that!

I went up later for some ranch. They said .50 cents and then the girl in the back was like it's ok just give it to him. Appreciate not being charged for a small side of ranch. We all know y'all got an abundance back there.

One male employee and only one working this time was touching and changing all the trash out on the floors and outside and wiping all tables. I appreciate that, I don't appreciate him NOT washing his hands before getting back to work. Even if you don't touch food you wash your hands while in a food prep environment. Basic Nevada health code.

Always be aware anyone can see this in an open kitchen. Besides that. Good experience here. Some staff may need to learn health code a little more."}
{"text":"Drivethur sat there for 20 minutes no one answered the drive thur what a waste. How are you doing."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews for fast food chains but Tommy was so great! Amazing late night service. His attitude and overall demeanor makes him a valuable asset for this location. Thanks for making our night and hooking it up with the extra sauces we asked for :)"}
{"text":"I went to the drive thru, and they have their normal scripts but she didn't even finish, she said would you like to try ----- and never finished and I said no thank you, I placed my order, drove up to the window and I was a little far but I took my seatbelt off and placed my car in park so I could hand her my money, as I moved towards the window with the money in my hand, she didn't accept it and said \"there's no one behind you so you can back up and get closer to the window\" I was already annoyed at that, and less than 2 min from ordering I received my food. She gave me my food by handing the bag out of the window carelessly. It's as if she held it there to get my attention. And to top it all off
my food was cold and she asked me how many sauce packets I wanted (as if there was even a specific number) and I said 10 because I felt rushed and only got 6. lol never coming to this location ever again."}
{"text":"I have always loved this particular Del Taco location more than the others I've tried around town. I've recently had to move away from Vegas and will miss the crew here. Being at this place is very close to my house I'd stop by for dinner a few times a week. The food is always great, served warm and tasty and price is decent.

During the night when I'd come by, sometimes 2-3 in the morning, it is extremely slow in drive-threw, it can easily take 20mins from ordering time to eating. This is my only complaint.

Epic Burritos are to die for."}
{"text":"Excellent service with great food and fair prices.
Didn't forget any of my order either"}
{"text":"Good mexican fix when I'm looking for a quick note at a fair price. Love the shrimp tacos!!"}
{"text":"Now I know I can not expect much from a fast food establishment but this location has usually always been fairly decent. I have never had a wrong order from this location, always polite, give you cutlery,  ask if you need sauce etc..... not sure if it was new staff as either of the two cashiers I usually would see were at the register or I just went later than usual but I am not sure how my asking for a deluxe chilli cheese fry with no chilli (I don't eat meat) extra cheese ends up being a box of fries with only cheese. Then I realized I forgot to ask for sauce and he didn't offer or just throw some in the bag so equal fault their. Then I get home and I received 3 not one, not two, but three spoons to eat my cheese fries. It's like they tried to mess up my order."}
{"text":"Came here can't remember when but it was like 2 weeks ago. I waited in the drive thru for 30 minutes start to finish.... then my order was missing items so I had to go inside and get my missing items...  i didnt even get offered free fries for all this inconvienence... And by the time I got home to eat, all my food was cold... they sent me a 5 dollar VIP voucher.. So I decided to use it... Well I guess the lady taking our order was the one that sent me the 5 dollar voucher so she made that snude remark.. then proceeded to ask me what happened that night? (shouldn't you know if you sent me this voucher... why do I need to explain myself a 2nd time) so I told her and she goes well was it a Tuesday or thursday? My sister and I looked at each other and when we go into the car later both said it doesn't matter what day it was, I get it's your busy days but you never have a customer wait that long and then have missed items that does not make it ok just because it's Tuesday or Thursday.... then she goes well it s gonna be another wait tonight just so you know... we have new people... I just didn't like the way she vibed me with 21 questions like thete shouldn't be any questions... the customer is always right... I'm done with this del taco.. even the manager was rude...."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times in the last month and the manager (I'm asumming) has consistently given me poor service. Mr. Castillo does not seem to be focused on customer service not even in the least. I ordered a number ten (macho combo burrito) and requested that it be made with carne asada instead of ground beef. At that time he rolled his eyes looked down paused and said, \"What do you mean? We can add carne asada but that's not what you said.\" This surprised and confused me as it was totally out of left field. I then went on to firmly but rationally express to him my recent experiences dealing with him and how his attitude and demeanor suggests maybe he should find an alternate line of work that does not require him to interact with people. At that point I repeated my order to him and said, \"I would like a number ten with carne asada, no onions, and no sour cream.\" He then took my order without any hesitation but with a false sense of customer appreciation. Overall, the restaurant is clean and I've never had any problems with any of the other staff here."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Del Taco! They have a great menu. This place is close to my work so it's very convenient for me. Staff is friend and food is alway great!"}
{"text":"I love del taco but their not particularly bright at this location. Make sure to check your order and receipt especially in the drive thru."}
{"text":"I dont expect the world, or much at all from Del Taco, but Jesus.... So last night I stopped by Del Taco on the way home from the Knights game. I ordered 9 value tacos and 4 del tacos (all hard shell), with some fries and drinks from the drive thru. 

First off, the rat bastard working drive thru didnt want to add my Taco Tuesday discount until I mentioned it. She said \"Oh I forgot, oops\". Then, it took over 6-7 minutes, with me being the only car in drive thru. I asked for light ice, drive thru gave me heavy ice. I asked for mild and scorcho, I get scorcho and del inferno. I asked for napkins, drive thru lady gave me 3 napkins for 3 orders of fries, 9 value tacos, and 4 del tacos.

But here's the kicker. How come I got home and EVERY SINGLE TACO SHELL WAS CRACKED?!?! Talk about pissed!!! Taco shells looking like puzzle pieces."}
{"text":"I dont live by this Del Taco. I don't work by this Del Taco. I just happened to be hungry, and Del Taco was right there. Yay! So I ordered 2 turkey del tacos w/no tomatoes. Soft.

My taco meat was burned so bad. The meat was non existent in my tacos. Both tacos filled with a little bit of taco meat, not the \"double the meat as our value taco\" meat. I've never been more pissed in my life."}
{"text":"It is 11:45pm..there isn't anyone in line! A friend and myself went through the drive through! The guy did a great job at up-selling us! I ordered two tacos and he somehow managed to get two desserts out of us! Needless to say we had a few drinks and this guy really set the tone for us. We pulled up to the window everything came in a fashionable manner. We exchanged a few funny words and he was quiet the comedian! Anthony was his name btw..what a great experience threw a drive threw."}
{"text":"I ordered chips and salsa and they only gave me chips; the chicken burrito was cold and tasted really gross and I couldn't finish it and it made me feel nauseous. Super bad food."}
{"text":"On 7/29 at 10 pm i pulled up to the drive thru and the employee asked if i could wait a moment and i said yes. 10 minutes later and nothing. I asked the drive thru guy if they were still open and he said yes and what can he get for me. He didnt offer an apology for forgetting me. I gave him my order and drove to the window.  He didnt say anything to me but what i owed. I paid they guy he gave me my soda without my receipt.  He asked if i wanted any sauce threw it in the bag and didnt wish me a good night or thank me for coming in. He must not of wanted me to have my receipt so i didnt know his name. But for those out there he was white, balding blondish hair with glasses. This guy should learn what customer service is about. I go to this place at least 2 times a week and have had great service in the past but this employee has made me want to switch places. How do you just forget your customer and i made sure to talk loud so he could hear me. Plus there was 2 cars behind me. Your lucky  i gave you 2 stars because your other employees are nice but this guy sucks."}
{"text":"There really isn't a whole lot to say about Del Taco. It's like a low end, more authentic version of Taco Bell that kind of wants to be Roberto's, but also wants to be a Mexican McDonald's. The tacos aren't THAT bad and the fries are ok. I think it goes without saying that you should avoid the American food, burgers and such, at any Mexican eatery. It's a good place to grab some food if it's 3am and you only have a few bucks."}
{"text":"Our first time at Del Taco. We walked in to who I think was the manager talking very loudly to the employees. She is very rude and unprofessional! We ordered our meal which included a chocolate shake. She quickly informed us that she was having a slow morning and hadn't got the milkshake machine up and running. They had been open for hours!! 
The food was great! The lobby was spotless! The employees were very friendly, professional(despite their training from her) and the young man(the receipt said Cannon) that helped us was great! We will go back as the food is much better than Taco Bell. Just hope she isn't there!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for many years and I have to say the most recent visit left me very disappointed. The person that took my order at the drive through was very rude and sounded annoyed for having to take my order. After I ordered I pull up to the window to wait almost 5 minutes for fries and a burrito I kindly asked for hot sauce and when I got home I see that they only put one packet of sauce in the bag and one packet of ketchup when I didnt even ask for ketchup, when I took a bite of my fries they werent even cooked in the middle at all, this place is very poorly managed!!!"}
{"text":"Came here at 2 am and everything was bomb.com 

Which we all know food is usually sh*t when you come to drive thrus this late at night. It hit the spot and I would definitely come again. 

Ps. I got the veggie burrito (delicious) and they hooked it up with the hot sauce. Oh and I got those cream cheese things for dessert. My only regret is that I didn't get more. See you later Del Taco."}
{"text":"Queso nachos with beef is great. The Veggie works burrito needs lots of work. More flour tortilla than the middle beef and bean thats just ploped on the bottome leaving the middle with nothing but lettuce and tortilla."}
{"text":"We got out of the Thomas and Mack Center parking lot faster than we got through this drive thru. Been here 20 minutes and there's still two cars ahead of us? Seriously, what's the hold up? If people are ordering too much food they should go inside but according to some of the other reviews this is a common thing."}
{"text":"this location has awful customer service all around/any shift

no salads & no del cheeseburgers at this location constantly.. so annoying"}
{"text":"Warning:This place has mice!

I used to go here years ago, because it was close to my house.  I was waiting in the drive-thru one evening and I witnessed 2 mice running alongside the building.  Chills went up my spine and I totally lost my appetite!

**I will not take any chances going back.  I will make the drive to the Summerlin location."}
{"text":"I know it's just Del Taco, but their chicken soft taco is so good. They have great service and quick drive thru times. 
For fast food, I have to give it a 5 star... Nothing wrong, and I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Having been through the drive through before, this was my first experience with the indoor dining area. There were seven in our party and we were ready to grub. The dining area was very clean and the service was more than adequate. Most everybody got a fish taco with their order and was impressed with the freshness and flavor. I opted for beef nachos. No skimpy portion size here. 

Less than fifty bucks for seven people (including my two man children) is pretty darn good. Everybody left full and satisfied. Friendly staff, cleanliness, and good, cheap eats is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I bought a chicken burrito here about a week and a half ago. The epic avocado burrito with chicken rice beans.. It was early about 1.p.m an hour after I started feeling really dizzy and sick.. I had to run to the bathroom and threw up my food!!! I turn paor and started sweating.. all this happened  while I was at work .. So I got sent home.. FOOD POISING!!! I was sick for a few days!! It was awful! Never again will I eat at a del taco.. old chicken??? Terrible!"}
{"text":"Okay one of my first visits to this del taco and it was the worst, and most disgusting. First i go through drive through to order two grilled chicken burritos with NO TOMATOES, (i also got a queso crunch taco.) when i got home you wouldn't believe it, THERE WERE TOMATOES in both my burritos. Thank goodness the taco didn't come with any tomatoes because i was starving, so i ate that taco and went back. AFTER i take a trip back to this del taco to get what i paid for originally. i'm greeted with the longest drive through hold up line then when i get to the window i see the employee who eventually handles my two new burritos digging through the GARBAGE!!!! I'm so fed up and disgusted at least he gave me fries, should have asked for my money back smh i honestly threw the burritos away!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I have to make a confession... Del Taco has some of the tastiest Chocolate Fudge Cake around. In addition to the nummy little thing being just the right amount for under $1.50, you can get it at 3:00 a.m. when there is no hope of finding such a treat elsewhere.

You will never catch me having a crispy shrimp taco (the idea of seafood from a fast food place makes me want to hack), but holy bajeebus... that cake is like crack!"}
{"text":"I mean it's fast food so I don't expect perfection. 

The wait time is ridiculous. From the time I pulled in to place my order, until I pulled out with food, was 20 minutes. The guy didn't punch my order in when I placed it and had to enter it when I reached the window to pay. This meant I had to wait while they prepared it, after waiting an eternity already. 

The food itself was mediocre, but it isn't gourmet ever so that's not such a big deal. Even so, $10 seems steep for two tacos, a quesadilla, and a drink with a huge side of spending your life waiting. 

I won't be back to this location. Life is too short.

Worth noting, I had this experience at night (after 11pm) but have been back during the daytime and it was slightly better."}
{"text":"I constantly go here with my spouse when we dont want to cook . Almost evey week and ever since the first time i went ive never had horrible service the lady that is usually there is always in a good mood and has excellent communication. I dont have one complaint about this location"}
{"text":"I was told my brother in law is always eating at this place. We needed a late night bite to eat. We bought some spicy quesadillas, it wasn't that good. I barely tasted the cheese but more green taco sauce. My lady didn't care for the chicken taco either. Maybe we got the wrong choice."}
{"text":"I just endured the worst Del Taco experience of my life.

My family pulled into the Drive Thru just to order a kids meal.  We ordered a hamburger with ketchup and lettuce, fries and a chocolate shake.  I had to repeat my order 3 times because the complexity of a burger with just ketchup and lettuce on it was just too much.  

I pulled up directly to the window because there was no one else in the drive thru.  I sat for 172 seconds according to the electronic timer before I was greeted with \"our shake machine is broken, can you pull you the back?\" I said \"can I at least have my food?\".  She went back and looked and apparently it wasn't ready which she informed me of.

I pulled around back and waited 5 minutes and nothing.  So I went inside.  I could see my shake sitting on the counter, whip cream melting,  there was no one at the counter and 5 girls were working in the back.  One of them asked \"can I help you?\"  My response was \"I am still waiting on my kids meal.\" She said \"oh\" confused.  Asked all the girls \"where is the kids meal?\"  They all had a dumbfounded look.  After a few minutes she handed me a kids meal.  The receipt inside was to a red burrito.  I checked the burger and all it had on it was cheese.  I told her it was wrong.  After she explained it to the cook several times, I finally received my burger correctly.  

I then noticed my shake was not stirred and you could still see the chocolate  syrup separate from the ice cream.  I decided to stir it myself.  At the end of the 20 minute ordeal, my kid got her food and she said it was good.

I was never offered an \"I'm sorry\" or any sort of apology.  Just looks of irritation like they did not expect to have customers who actually wanted food.  Also when I  was standing at the counter a female patron had to return her tacos because they were incorrect.  

This is the worst Del Taco and the worst set of employees I have ever seen.  I will never be back."}
{"text":"Just stopped by in the drive threw to get a couple burritos and when we got up at the machine to take our order, the guy was extremely quiet and it was hard for me to order when the guy sounded like he was mumbling. Anyway after several attempts another person had to take my order instead. Once I got the food everything was fine and the food was great, 4/5 just because the lack of good costumer service."}
{"text":"This location is the ALL TIME WORST DEL TACO in the entire USA. Wasn't too bad a few months ago but new employees I guess? Tacos are horrible and always problems with the credit systems ... only cash most of the time and it's a daily problem at this location . They need to close this store.  I used to eat here a couple times a week . I live close but I'll drive 15 miles to a different one than ever use this store again. I advise everybody to do the same . Management needs to be fired and start fresh. Either that or just shut it down."}
{"text":"Been in the drive thru line for 30 minutes. What the hell and it smells like weed. I don't know if it's from the cars or the employees. I don't know what is taking so long when ive seen the staff hand people their food 5 minutes ago but no one is moving. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Today I used Postmates to order food because my car is broken and my son needed lunch. I place an order for my food and get a kids quesadilla which comes with fries and a kids drink. When the meal arrived all I got was a few fries and the drink. No quesadilla!! I literally just paid $4 and a crazy high delivery fee of $5.99 (higher than anyone I've ever seen) to receive maybe 20 fries and a 4 oz drink. NO. I tried contacting the driver and have called the location multiple times. Both have failed to answer or get back to me. I know it's just a quesadilla but it was the whole reason for the order in the first place! And how do you forget the MAIN item for a meal?"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend and craving Del Taco as I haven't had it in forever. We pulled up to the drive thru and no one said anything. We thought they were closed because the parking lot was rather empty. I told my friend just to say hello and see if anyone answered. She did, in no way rude  at all. Just a simple hello. Girl came on and responded with major attitude \"yeah can you give me a minute?!\" Friend replied \"sorry but if you had said something so I knew you were even there I would have def given you a minute\". Girl then said \"ok then now you can give me three minutes\". Wow! Talk about shitty service. I decided to take my business elsewhere. I live on the East Coast and love Del Taco so much but that girl made it so not worth it to me. I mean, I'm from Jersey and I have never experienced such ignorance. Really, just disgusting."}
{"text":"I'm honestly sad to say... I was horribly let down by this location. I used to work at Del Taco and it's definitely my comfort food. Last night, Monday March 12 @ around 9pm, I went and got chili cheese fries and a regular strawberry shake. About an hour later, I had begun to experience stomach pains. I had gotten food poisoning.. I couldn't get any sleep due to the fact that I was in pain and in and out of the bathroom. When I called this location to inform them of what happened, I was put on the phone with a woman who claimed to be the GM. She was completely unprofessional and uninterested in what I had to say. When she got my information she clearly wasn't listening because even though I spelled my name out she still got it wrong. Even though I told her more than once what I'd ordered, she still got it wrong. She made me feel as if she didn't believe me and she said she'd had no other complaints."}
{"text":"Its really bad , i know that people who cant graduate high school have to work SOMEWHERE , but if they are working with handling money ... they should at least have a GED.....     My wife was not feeling well and left work early but she was nice enough to pick me up lunch on her way home even though she felt like sh*t.. 

Well here is the funny thing , not only did they screw up the order .. she asked for my chicken burrito with extra sauce no tom , they put no sauce extra tom ..  but they screwed up SIMPLE MATH on the change.   

The bill was 13 dollars and 12 cents ...  my wife gave them 20 dollars and 12 cents ... they gave my wife back  5 dollars and 96 cents ... in which obviously is WRONG.  Then the cashier decided to ARGUE with my wife about the change ... really ?  

We have spoken to the manager and our food is getting replaced , but you REALLY need to either make sure your staff is trained mathematically .. or teach them to use the built in change thing on the computer. 


ugh.  *facepalm*"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. They are always on point and friendly. 

The food is fresh, hot and good. They make the food as your request and do not cheap out on the quantity."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at a Del Taco. I wanted three tacos, a couple churros and a milk shake. First they tell me the fryer is off so no churros. I'm okay with that, then I get to the window and the rude woman comes to me laughing as she tells me that she didn't know their shake machine was off too. I canceled my order and left. Never again at this location!"}
{"text":"Worst del taco ever. Minus the lagging wait, thanks for not making the burritos taste like normal, and forgetting our fries."}
{"text":"The food here was subpar I don't think the cashier even looked at me. The food was not tasty at all. It was actually cold when I ate it. The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because on the way out the guy who makes the food told me to have a good day."}
{"text":"Lived in this area for over 4 years now and did not realize that it's here. Chicken quesadia is the only thing I order here but theirs a lot better than Taco Bell's version"}
{"text":"Last time we went (December) there was a band aid in my friend's taco so we decided never to go back. Decided to give it another shot today and went through the drive thru today for something quick and easy and waited approx two minutes before being greeted, lengthy pauses when items ordered were confirmed with a lot of \"ummmms\" as well so I thought the girl was new but was read back exactly what I ordered. Pull up to the window, the person taking drive thru orders was on their phone while taking orders apparently so explains all the hesitation and dead air space and the person at the window was ringing up someone from the front counter. He eventually opened the window, the person taking drive thru orders still talking on her phone, and took my payment. Even though I asked for and the girl confirmed light ice (even on the receipt), I still got normal ice. I received no napkins and my food was room temperature. As I was handed my food, the girl finally got off her phone."}
{"text":"Long wait for a to go order to place and pick up that consisted of 2 chicken tacos and 1 bean and cheese burrito. Bad customer service. Dirty restaurant. Better to drive to Centennial center del taco or go across to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad customer service. Will never return. Had great service in the past but, they treated my mentally ill friend badly and, didn't have patience. She was attempting to order herself. What horrible people. We were the only customers inside. Food upset my stomach all day afterwards."}
{"text":"I went when it was kind of late, but the food wasn't good. Our tacos were old and the fries were just OK and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and it was A-OK (to use yelp's metrics).  Ordering was quick and simple and the folks manning the drive thru were friendly. Fries were awesome - piping hot fresh from the frier. Del Taco always has the best fries. My chicken burrito? It was ok I guess. I had the chicken burrito and it was decent enough, although a little on the skimpy side to be honest. Tasted fine I suppose. So yeah, A-OK is where we are at."}
{"text":"OK food. The soft tacos were sad. Tortillas over cooked, when I said something about it they acted shocked."}
{"text":"I watched two of the workers put their blue food handling gloves in their back pocket (!) while they took the garbage out to the dumpster, then put on the SAME gloves that were in their back pocket, that they removed with their bare hands after taking out the trash and handling the dumpster onto their hands to prepare food. The cashier kept rubbing her nose with her bare finger- I thought she was trying to give me a signal of some sort? No, she kept using her finger to scratch her nose as she took my order. I watched one chubby worker sneak sips of a drink and food while she was working at the counter. She had black curly side-burns hair that she curled with a curling iron. Her stomach was fat and protruded further out than her chest. The whole restaurant feels dirty and old."}
{"text":"Two times in a row they have given me the wrong food.  Once a shredded beef burrito when I ordered chicken.  I cannot even eat shredded beef.  Today they put lettuce on my tacos when i said no lettuce and the receipt even says n lettuce.  And i asked for a bean and cheese burrito and i left with egg and some weird looking meat in my burrito. Makes you wonder what would have happened if I had a severe egg allergy and bit into the burrito.  And they never pick up the phone when you call to complain and no answering machine.  I'd give zero stars if I could"}
{"text":"Oh my GOD!!!!!! Thee slowest service I have ever experienced. Don't bother going to the drive-thru if there is more than 2 cars. Consistently messing up orders, but don't worry, they make up for it with 20 hot sauce packets for your order of 2 tacos."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever clients keep talking to each other and laughing. I waited 35 minutes in a drive thru with 3 cars including myself."}
{"text":"I just ordered 2 tacos and a burrito and even asked for sauce when I was ordering, I got my food drove off and no sauce. Gotta check everytime now. Del Taco yall do this more then often."}
{"text":"Horrible service. 

Ordered a double del combo to go. There was two people ahead of me before I ordered. Took a while to get my food after I ordered, 16 minutes to be exact. In fast food standards that's slow. I could've gone to drive thru and received my food quicker (maybe...)

Host: Sandra
She first took my order and she was friendly and customer service was on her mind. She then had Vincent take over when I was handing my money over. 

Host: Vincent 
This particular cashier is rude and acts like he hates his job. Go work somewhere else if you don't like it!

SLOW service. I won't return to this Del Taco, I will find another location to go to. I've never had a bad experience at a Del Taco before. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill for sure. The last few times I've been there I've had to wait foooooorever, in Park, for either the wrong order or like this morning when I'm STARVING to have to wait forever and then get a cold egg and cheese burrito with the cheese not even close to melted. Really not a great start to my day. I won't be paying for this type of thing again. I guess they gave up since a new one opened down the street. Sad because I've been going here for nearly 20 years."}
{"text":"I was semi-hungry that I decided to go somewhere nearby and get a snack/nibble. I rarely get fast food for many reasons and this confirmed never to do this again. I haven't had del taco for more than 6 years or so. I got the simplest thing on the menu. A breakfast burrito (eggs and cheese). I took a bite of it and I didn't like it. The eggs were really mushy, almost undercooked or just too watery or something. If I can't figure it out, I'm not eating it. I felt like if I ate the whole thing, it was going to come out the way it looked, mushy and watery... Bleh. I can't complain, it was under a buck, so I get what I paid for."}
{"text":"This is the second time this location has horribly disappointed. Today around 12:20 am I pulled in to the drive thru and after waiting was told it's going to be a while they have a very large order and I'll have to wait long. They made sure to let me know I would have to wait since they didn't want my business I assume. I asked them so you telling me this means you don't want me to order and hey did not respond. I like Del Taco as. Whole but this location makes me go across the street to tAco bell."}
{"text":"Pretty much every time I go here they take forever and something is wrong with the order or the food is cold. This one is right down the street from my house we were happy when it opened but we don't go much because they suck at this location. They really need new leadership or new workers

UPDATE 

I GOT FOOD POISONING FROM HERE"}
{"text":"Gross Nachos! Why can't they use nacho cheese on nachos. the sauce they put on everything it's so disgusting. This food doesn't taste good at all I got the cheese fries and they looked like vomit"}
{"text":"This restaurant is horribly run by the manager named Cesar! I have never gone in there where I have seen Cesar greet people or seen him smile! His customer service sucks how? Ok! I don't know where to start I have so many bad experience! For starters-I placed an order with Cesar last week,I ordered chicken quesadilla! When I got in my car drove for couple of minutes! I looked in the bag & realized, it was quesadilla with cheese only no chicken! I went back & showed to him! He said we will make you another one! Not only he didn't apologize for my inconvenience! But he told me to pay the difference in price for the chicken! I told him will you pay for my gas & inconvenience For me coming back because you screwed my order? I told him he'll no I won't pay the difference!
The other think I want to mention is that Cesar skims on the meat portion from customers! You would never know this unless you go to another Del Taco restaurant! Which I did today I went to the one on 59th ave & 101. & again I ordered my favorite chicken quesadilla! I honestly could not Believe my eyes when they handed me the bag! I immediately noticed something different! The weight of the food gave me the impression that they mixed up my Again! But when I pulled it out! There was so much chicken & cheese in stuffed in it! That's why I felt the heavy weight instantly! Than I realized I have been getting cheated out of meat & cheese at Cesar's location! I will Never eat there again! Not only you don't get good customer service! But you get cheated out of your food portion!"}
{"text":"I love del taco but why is this one different?The people are courteous but it doesn't make up for the food.Every time I go I have to wait about 5 mins in front after I go through the drive thru line.Every time I get a quesadilla it is old and cold and is more like a cheese crisp.Oh well I could take it home and give it to my dog as a rubber toy....at least it smells like cheese so for that I give it at least a star."}
{"text":"This Del Taco is SO slow. I come here to get my food quickly and go, not wait in the drive through for 40 minutes just to get my food. I've been here twice but never again. If I wanted to wait this long I'd go sit down at a restaurant. At least give people some compensation for waiting that long. I've tried to be understanding but this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"This location is the worst del Taco I've been to. It takes almost 20-30 mins to get my food from the drive thru. Then when you finally get your order, the workers have absolutely no remorse and don't even apologize for the wait or greet you nicely. They just hand you your food without saying anything.

I went inside one time because there was no line and I didn't want to wait in the long drive thru line. Inside was just a slow, if not worse! I was watching the workers and they move at a snails pace. Avoid this location if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Everything is great, but those 1/2 pound bean and cheese burrito with red sauce on the side..... YAAAAAAAS!"}
{"text":"Was literally there at 6:51 my order was taken by LARISSA tall female red hair when I approached the window she told me I total said it then I asked to add a coke she made a second order for it I said I need it on the same order not split she said \"I could do that\" then proceeded to not do it then told its X amount and that she couldn't do math so I had to pull my phone out and do it for her she definitely shouldn't be working there she should be in school. Everyone else was great though"}
{"text":"I understand that when you go to a ghetto fast food place like del taco you shouldn't expect much in terms of customer service. But these guys have given the term \"horrible customer service\" a whole new meaning. Here's been few of my recent experiences:
-I go to the drive-thru and order 2 sausage breakfast tacos and emphasize twice that I want them with sausage. The cashier gives me my total and Instructs me to pull to the window to pay. I get to the window and I double check my order and the cashier with attitude, Richard, tells me I ordered a regular breakfast taco without sausage. I go to tell him that's not correct and he cuts me off and says \"I was going to ask you what kind but you drove off.\" Drove off?! He specifically asked me to pull to the window telling me that he's got my order!! After that Richard was full off attitude and essentially threw my order in the car. No thank you no nothing! 
-Today I go to the drive-thru order breakfast with hash browns. I come home and there's a SINGLE hash brown stick in the bag. Really?! That's like ordering French fries and getting a single fry in the bag! I go back and they replace the order.
Called del tacos customer service line and of course no one bothers to pick up!! 
Done with this place!"}
{"text":"I think its more like a tradition I come here when in Vegas.  I mean...they have tacos and french fries.  Free refills on drinks.  I've only eaten here sober once but I have woken up many a time at the MGM with Del Taco bags all over my room.  I'll see you next time Del Taco.  I miss you"}
{"text":"I thought they did a good job with my food, and surprisingly the fries were actually pretty tasty. My son enjoyed them and had a good time in the kid's play area. He even met a couple of friends:) My overall experience was positive. The place was clean and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"This has been a consistently good Del Taco location. Inside is clean and the employees are friendly. The drive-thru can get busy, but it's always moved pretty quick even on taco night. They don't skimp on filling up the tacos which I appreciate. My hubby likes his Macho Burritos double-wrapped and they make it that way no problem. Most people have been to or know what DT is, so I don't feel going over the menu is necessary so long as you know this is basically a pretty solid location. I did recently try a new menu item that was simple yet impressed me and that's the Queso Crunch Taco. I can't say the Queso and Chips were a fave of mine, but the queso on the taco added a nice flavor.  

Queso Crunch Taco ($) - Queso gets spread between a crunchy taco shell and a soft flour tortilla that is then filled with beef, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. This is made with the \"classic\" taco shell, so it's bigger than a regular taco. I really like this taco and hope they keep it on the menu for good. I am a fan of both crunchy and soft tacos, so this is like the best of both. 

The half pound red or green burrito is always a convenient grab late at night and I also like the cheddar quesadilla with del scorcho sauce. Check the bottom of your reciept they have a brief survey you can take that will get you a discount on your next ourchase."}
{"text":"One of the worst DT locations. They've been open long enough now to not have so many problems. The wait time in the drive-thru is not acceptable and going inside to order doesn't help you get your food quicker either. While I do like Tuesday Taco Night (3 tacos for $1.29) and a few other menu items, it's usually bean and cheese burritos and cheese quesadillas that I order. This last time I went inside and placed my order and then a customer came up and said their order was wrong. They stopped making my bean and cheese burritos leaving them open faced and just sitting on the counter to remake the customers food while offering her a free drink etc. I asked for my burritos to be remade and they did, but they ended up not putting the extra sauce or sour cream on them that I paid for. This wasn't noticed until I got home with my order and at that point just ate what I had. Also the employees need to learn what a half pound bean and cheese burrito is because the size the last several times have been more like the size of their value bean and cheese burrito. I really hope this location gets things together however I won't be back for a long while. Looks like I have to go to 95/Jones or Centennial Center DT if I want fresh, hot, tasty and consistent food since those are the only locations that know how to make a bean burrito right and also still make menu items from the old school Naugles and Macho menu as long as they have the ingredients."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Del Taco locations.

The service is always excellent and my food is always piping hot. 

I love how quick they make the food to making it a great breakfast/lunch/dinner spot if you are in a break from work. 

We get coupons like every week in the mail which is nice because they are coupons that are actually worth it and make it easy on your wallet. Not that there prices are high anyway but it is just a bonus.

They have had their \"Tuesday Taco Night\" for years but recently added to it which makes me super happy. You can still get 3 regular tacos (hard or soft) for $1.09 but now you can even get 3 \"Taco Deluxe\"  (soft or hard) for $2.09. It has lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and salsa. So it is basically a baby \"Macho Taco\".
You can also on Thursday nights get 3 \"Grilled Chicken Tacos\" for $2.09.

I am a sucker for their \"Del Scorcho\" cause it is a must when I get a Cheddar Quesadilla. 

They have a e-club and if you sign up you automatically get free Grilled Chicken Quesadillas and other coupons from time to time.

You can't go wrong with Del's prices and taste!"}
{"text":"This is a great location. Inside the store is clean and the staff is very friendly. They are very fast and the food is correct and hot and tasty! 
I love the Cheddar Quesadillas and Buritto Deluxe. AND they have Cherry Coke!!!"}
{"text":"This deal taco is horrible...waited at the speaker for 5min before someone even said hello, then waited another 10-15min at the drive through window. The \"cashier\" as she claims although her tag says manager, gave me three orders of chili cheese fries at the 5min wait then the rest of the food at the 10min time mark..got home all the food was cold and, fries seemed
To be cooked multiple times. I called the store and the \"cashier\" tried blaming the cook for being new however she was just standing their the entire time
Not even helping him. She gave me attitude when asking for a manager, apparently there's no managers at night shift? Left my name and my number for GM to call back."}
{"text":"We like their fish tacos for a quick dinner.  
Have only used the drive thru and never had any issues.  They have always been polite."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this Deal Taco. The service was great, friendly and fast. My gripe is with the quality of the food served. I did not complain to the staff or manager because I shouldn't have to. It should be done right the first time. My food was lukewarm at best and I was served rotting avocado on top of my wet burrito plate. Was I supposed to not see that or just eat it or what? Is there no pride in what you serve the public? I have been to many Del Tacos, it's one of my favorite fast food restaurants. I was beyond disappointed with this food. The fact that they felt it was ok to serve me this says a lot about this location and their food standards. I didn't eat the rotting avocado. I was pissed and if I would have said something to the staff, it would have come out all wrong."}
{"text":"Went there at 2am. They gave us a free smoothie that they said theyve been trying out just coz they have a new blender. It has fanta on it,whipped cream and vanilla. It actually is not pretty bad. For someone who does not drink soda vey much, it is actually very light onthe stomach. And on the tongue."}
{"text":"All I can say Del taco is always good hot fresh and friendly but I'll tell you this Del taco is in the ghetto side of town so lock your doors keep the change in your car you can't go wrong by this bill taco even though it's on the bad side of town"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is slow in the dining room has been dirty the last two late-night times we have been here."}
{"text":"Your typical del taco if you ask me... Went for lunch during the lunch hour and was in and out fairly fast. Also they use the store that is connected's fountain drinks machine which has both Pepsi and coke products (extra star)

Also a plus that it is adjacent to the convenience store :)"}
{"text":"It's so funny reading all the reviews about del taco because...well IT'S DEL TACO! I'm stationed down in sierra vista where we only have taco bell....which SUCKS!!!!! and if any of you reading this knows where that is, no need to feel sorry for this guy because I will be moving up here in a few months. Literally everytime I visit Phoenix i stop at this del taco because it's close to where I stay. There food really must have crack in it because I can't stay away from this place everytime I come up.

Del taco in general is always clean. The staff is kinda slow at this one but it's Sunday and everyone is at brunch/church whatever lol.  All in all thank god for del taco, and there delicious big fat chicken tacos!!"}
{"text":"Cheap tacos, nice quick snack!   My tacos were done so fast, I didn't even get a chance to check in before they told me my order was ready!  
For fast food, I can't complain too much!  I give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Co - worker sent me on a taco run.   This time just regular tacos for me.  The regular tacos are good.  I don't think you can go wrong with that!  My co worker, said his fish tacos weren't that good this time either.  So I guess there fish tacos are hit and miss.   So I think I will stick with there tacos and hamburgers only!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit unpredictable.  Sometimes it's really busy and service becomes very slow.  During lunch rush I've spent over ten minutes in the drive-through.  When they are busy, quality sometimes is lower.  Tacos are poorly assembled, etc.

For some food or snacks during non-rush times, they do a very good job.  Fries are always fresh and perfect.  Tacos are well assembled (again, not during peak times).

Employee friendliness varies greatly.  Sometimes excellent, and sometimes it is clear that the person simply does not give one damn about your food or business."}
{"text":"It's a Del Taco...enough said!

I typically pick up large quantities of tacos whenever I need to stop by a job site so my guys can eat. Plus, it makes me look really nice when I buy lunch for everyone! I'm typically a jerk ;) lol jk

I mostly choose this place because they are cheap!"}
{"text":"Fuck this place.

A few months back I placed an order in store and watched them make it.  They made it wrong, putting items I am allergic to in the order.  They caught it and said \"oh, pick that out\" and then tried to give it to me.  I immediately asked for a refund.  I contacted corporate about this and they never replied.

A few months later I tried to give them another chance.  I went through the drive thru this time, ordered a combo and a couple of additional tacos.  They didn't include the fries with the combo, which I caught at the drive thru window.  When I pulled up to check my order it was, again, wrong.  I went inside and got another refund.  They seemed to be a bit confused as to what to do regarding a refund when I paid with a gift card but eventually just gave me cash.

It's clear that if you want to specify anything about your order (no tomatoes, extra lettuce, whatever...) or are allergic to something, this place absolutely does not care.  Corporate also does not care if you have any sort of issue either."}
{"text":"cust service sucks here. they are nice, but do not listen to the cust.  so if u want turkey tacos u might not get them.  and if u do get the tacos they will not be portioned properly.
too many people that don't care work there.  also they are slow.
when u mention something is not right they stare a blank look at you.  they really don't know what to do."}
{"text":"Worst location in Vegas, if your going to come to this location make sure you have time to sit in the drive thru for 30 minutes no matter what time of day

*updated to 4 stars because I love deal taco but still think it's ridiculous to wait 45 minutes in a \"fast food\" drive thru"}
{"text":"My husband order some taco today and to salty.We just throw them away wasting money!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and there are no Del Taco's in our home area.  The 39 cent taco special caught our attention.  They have them on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday evenings.  The taco was crisp, flavorful, and tasty.  Certainly nothing exotic, but basically a good taco at a good value.  Line moved a bit slow, but they were busy.  Overall, an OK experience."}
{"text":"Fast service, came here on 6/24/15 at 8:35 fresh and hot food!  Lady was very sweet and recommended the chicken tacos I never had before, amazing!"}
{"text":"Today, I waited in the drive thru for 40 min because there was no dedicated cashier for both the front and drive thru areas....Daniel Ocampo is the general manager of this store #903...apparently he is the incompetent person who is stupid enough to not adequately staff his store. I guess it's the reason for the poor quality of staff, poor customer service...it's a reflection on him as manager...up the ladder we go till something at the corp level is done to correct the problems this store is having...I would have drove off but once you're in the drive-thru you're locked in and have to wait for cars in front to leave...when I arrived there were only two cars in front of me...never would have thought I'd have to wait 40 mins...find a different location"}
{"text":"3rd time in a row I have been disappointed in this location.. When they opened, things were good. Last time I went through the drive through, my order was all wrong. Went today and the fries the Manager / Supervisor put on my try looked like they were sat under a heat lamp all day. On my way out, I asked her how long fries had to sit around before they looked like this, she said \"not long\". She did offer to replace them, I declined. The point is, that's the shift manager that served those fries, so clearly she doesn't care.  Oh well, another food place off the list!"}
{"text":"Too beat to cook, and looking for quick, cheap eats, we stepped into Del Taco for the first time. Surprising to see that they offer more than just tacos. Pretty decent burgers as well...you get what you pay for and never leave hungry....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Love paying for food that I order in the drive thru and don't get!!! Yes I should've checked the bag...but that's what they get paid to do!! Plus providing a receipt should be part of the job as well!"}
{"text":"Worst crap ever!!! I can't even describe how cold the food is....until I found my thermometer!!! Just received this from the drive-thru. We live less than a quarter mile away and drove straight home. You had one job!!! Server hot food, at least hot enough to pass a health inspection! Photos included"}
{"text":"Cool manager (shaved head). Good food, quick friendly service."}
{"text":"I come in to place my simple order and as I wait, 4 cars enter the Drive-Thru and their orders are all delivered as I stand there watching, waiting.
Piss-Poor Management, plain and simple."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. First off they completely forgot my burger... Which was 1/2 our meal... Then the only thing they left me were my fries.... Which were cold and soggy...

Horrible location. Second time they've messed up my order. Never going back. IT WASNT EVEN BUSY. We were literally the ONLY people in the drive thru.. With 2 cars in the lot (had to be your workers). How could you guys possibly be that stupid?

I'm bringing back the receipt tomorrow. This is ridiculous. Never felt the need to leave s negative review on Yelp for fast food. 

But you earned it."}
{"text":"probably the only time I've ever been disappointed in del taco. I got two chicken tacos, both of which were cold. I also got an order of fries. also old and fried in very old oil. they weren't busy at all but it took a good 15 minutes to get the food."}
{"text":"this place does not even deserve one star.  i went here on my luch just to get some simple nacho cheese fries. the manager there took my order and gave me chili cheese fries. i kindly went back from the drive through, as he did not give me a reciept for my order and gave me the wrong order, to ask if they can please fix my order and just give me regular nacho cheese fries. the other manager there had an attitude, and as i am watching the cooks, they just throw my food together, with barley any cheese on the fries, and the manager tosses the bag on the counter and says \"here\". at that point im pissed off, but i still ask nicely for my second order of fries that i had ordered in the first place but they had not given me. they then tossed shredded cheese and nacho cheese on the fries (which, by the way, the nacho cheese fries do not come with shredded cheese) and again threw the bag on the counter and said \"here\"! so being beyond pissed off, i simply just asked for a refund, and one of the male manager there said \"what was wrong with the food now\", i simply said \"my order was still not correct and i did not like my service her today, and i would just like a refund\". the female manager then told me that they would have to throw out the food, and i told her i did not want the food and i just wanted my refund. the male manager at that point went back to the drive thru register and yelled out to me that the refund would be back on my card. i told him i used a debit card, he could have just given me the cash, but he said he already did the refund to the card so i now have to wait. i asked for a reciept for the refund and the female manager said there is no reciept for a refund. i asked her how can i get proof of my refund if i didnt even get a reciept from the drive through. she then said \"well it's now deleted, so there is no reciept to give you\". by then i wanted to jump over the counter and bash both their heads into the register, make my own food and take my refund money back! but instead i just asked her to give me the main number, and i left. i waisted my whole lunch there over some stupid cheese fries, and i left without a proper refund and no food. i will never ever come back to this place, and i do not advise anyone to ever ever come here! i have never had such poor and rude service from anywhere else other than here!"}
{"text":"I came here about a year ago, it was my first time ever trying Del Taco, and I was sure it would be the last. My first experience was horrible, ordered the cheap chicken tacos and they were absolutely disgusting. 
Today I decided to give them a 2nd chance and I was very impressed. I didn't order anything cheap, but instead used Yelp to look up their menu and found a couple of their specialty items to try. They were delicious.
Staff was very friendly, shop was very clean and the service was fast and accurate.
I think I will start coming here instead of their (will not name) fast food competition.
Their food definitely tastes and feels a lot more real."}
{"text":"It was ok!  Service and food.  My husband loves the place."}
{"text":"I usually come to this Del Taco during the week. The middle aged lady that works the drive thru always has a negative attitude. I swear she hates her job. 2 thumbs down, I'm going to Taco Bell for now on."}
{"text":"Who ever the lady was working the drive thru today at 9:50 AM is so AWESOME! Her politeness and awesome personality made my day. It's people like her, I wish most people in customer service were like. She did such an awesome job! GIVE HER A RAISE! Thank you"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I have always loved Del Taco. This particular location that I stopped into today was very clean an the service is an A+ the gentleman behind the counter greeted me in a genuine way, took my order and thanked me. I walked over to the soda fountain filled my drink where everything was fully stocked and very clean. I sat down and the man who took my order brought my food to my table. It's nice to see the employees here going above and beyond for being a fast food joint. I will be. I will be visiting this particular location again."}
{"text":"Probably the worst de taco to go to. The drive through people are extremely rude and tell you to back up so they can take 10 mins to make whatever you've ordered , i received fries on a nacho platter instead of chips because they ran out and found out when i got home. They sopposedly never have a manager on duty to help you and they never have a store manager , I've waited maybe 45 min in drive through on a Tuesday night. Don't recommend this one"}
{"text":"I know, I know! But this place was so good, cheap and convenient! They were open 24 hours and had a pretty good selection. Plus, their prices were pretty darn good! I think I ate here more than I did at the hotel. I loved the beef burrito so much that I started making it at home! Wish they had some of these places in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this location if you want what you actually ordered and don't want to spend 30 minutes just waiting for your incorrect food order. Is everyone that works there on drugs? Because there's no possible way you can be that slow and incompetent. Horrible."}
{"text":"Not great, it is fast food after all, but their  tacos do have more cheese than the other fast food options. Their prices are better than their competitors and their drive-thru is open late,it used to be 24 hours, but I don't know what their current hours are. Try their churros. I'd give them two and a half stars, but that is not an option. Pay attention to your order though, tonight was correct, but they often screw it up."}
{"text":"I've only had a problem once here.  I know that's not the best line to start with for a Yelp review, but in contrast to other reviews, I guess I'm pretty lucky?? I had a custom order concerning six tacos and they forgot to change up two of the tacos.  Good thing I caught it only a few miles down the street.  I brought the order back, went to the staff and informed them of the error, and they promptly corrected it.  Plus, they let me keep the \"mistakes\" and I gave it away to someone else.

Staff is usually pretty nice and accommodating.  Food isn't that great but what do you expect from a fast food joint? Overall, not too bad in my book."}
{"text":"DEL INFERNO, MI CORAZON

This DT caught my eye one night while we were driving back to our room. Had I been driving, we surely would have been rear-ended because I have a tendency to slam on my brakes when I see their happy signs.

Note: I only order crunchy tacos. Whether I'm at Del Taco or Taco Bell, I do not stray from my simple order: between 3 and 8 crunchy tacos. I usually prefer them with light meat and extra lettuce. They have to have 3 packets of hot sauce (I like to use one mild, one medium, and one hot) and a half-packet of salt. 

So here we are in Vegas and I see DT, so of course (!) I made my husband park even though we'd been on our feet all day and were exhausted. We found a parking spot several blocks away and walked through a detour for construction and around some dark corners until we were finally back on the strip and headed up to the food court. 

A polite employee gave me my tacos ($1.59 each) and the night was complete. 

Del Taco - please come to Walnut Creek, CA :)  xoxo"}
{"text":"Just avoid this craphole.  We've lived in the area for about six years, I know it's fast food but over the years the quality has degraded to the point that my dogs run from it.  I'd go into detail about the crap we got but I'll save you the sickening details.  Worst part is I actually filed a complaint with their corp and still haven't heard back.  Take the time to drive an extra mile if you really need fast chain Mexican and get Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying if I could give them 0 stars I would. I seen a cashier handle money and move on to grab and dump fries in the grease. VERY UNSANITARY it was disgusting. NEVER will I go back there."}
{"text":"Horrible food!!! We have been there three times and the food is not cooked or cold!!! This last time the beans were burned!! Won't be returning I'll drive the extra five minutes and go to Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Shotty area, Connected to gas station.  
The food's good, for the cheapness!  & Wonderful Staff!! 
I had a \"lose my engagement ring\" experience here. The awesome cashier lady saved it for me! Thanks"}
{"text":"Nice, funny staff.  Clean restraunt.  I enjoyed taco-thursday w/3xChicken tacos for $2.09 (theres taco-tuesday too, but w/beef)!   Gotta love the hot sauce, it burns!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst experience of taco place I have experienced.  The service was mediocre, the food was barely edible.  When I complained about the filthy rest rooms the manager said I'm sorry but I don't have enough help."}
{"text":"Awful!!! Sit in the drive thru almost 20 mi utes with only 2 cars in front of me and then when I got my carne Assad fries they barely had anything on it and she didn't give me napkins and I had to ask 2 times before she understood what I said and I also ordered a soda and I ask her for a straw and she said it was in the bag and it wasn't so I'm upset I'm in a drive thru for a reason"}
{"text":"Del Taco on East Sunset Rd. Henderson NV, STEP IT UP.... Yes its 6 am, and few choices at this time of day. However, your open 24 hrs. I spent $12.00 on your \"EPIC\" Carne asada burrito and a med coke.... The meat was like a dried scab, it was cold and tasted as good as shit! If its not something you would eat ,,,, DONT SELL IT, I MEAN Come on!!! Food costs should be after quality of product. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Why is it that every time I go here I fool myself thinking it's going to get better. It doesn't.  A one-star rating is super generous for this location.

Went through the drive-up about 7:30pm Friday night, they were holding all the cars back from ordering by announcing \"we'll be with you in a few minutes\" over the speaker.  Well, a few minutes turned into about 15 considering there were a couple of cars in front of me.  After I ordered and rounded the corner to the window, I realized what the hold up was.  They are timed at how long cars sit at the window and didn't want a line of people waiting and messing up their numbers.

So, I was extremely specific on what I wanted, and again like an idiot I got all the way home to find out it was wrong.  So back in my car I get and drive all the way back to have it corrected (knowing that by the time I get home everyone else will have finished their meal and I will be eating alone).

I walk in and immediately the night manager Sergio gives me a bad attitude.  I showed him the receipt and asked him to remake the item and to give me a refund for my time, gas, trouble...whatever.  He cops a total attitude with me and says I can have a refund or item re-made but I'm not going to get both.

You know, for a couple of two dollar tacos (that probably cost them a nickel each to make) you would think they would do what they could to keep a pretty regular customer coming back a couple of times a month.

There are way too many other options out there for me to ever go back to this Del Taco.  Thanks to Sergio and his lack of customer service skills."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Taco Bell so that shows my taste for Americanized mex food.  Never been to a del taco but it was very good. Prices cheap, outdoor seating and tacos - what more could you want"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant! Good fast food with generous portions! Low prices! Haven't been to a Del Taco since a bad experience with one in Colorado. This was a pleasant surprise. Glad we gave them a second chance! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best double cheeseburger you will have! It sounds stupid but believe me! Don't mock it till you try it! Del Taco has the best Del Double Bacon Cheeseburger here in Las Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Gave this location another shot. The QC of what left the window was horrible. Double Del looked like somebody had sat on it. All the sauce was squished out. Kids just don't care and the manager must suck as well letting suck crap go out the window."}
{"text":"Ok.   I will admit it.  I'm not big on Mexican food or fast food.   That being said ETL taco is an occasional guilty pleasure.  Big menu and everything doesn't taste the same like Taco Bell    There are actually quite a few thing I like on the menu...  Enough to make it hard to choose some times"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! Do Not go Thru the drive thru! I was in line for 47 mins! When I got up to finally get my food the staff never apologized for the wait, she was rude and I will Never come here again!! This Del Taco Sucks!!"}
{"text":"Food prepares with gloves on playing with cell phones and then preparing food without washing hands and changing gloves. Who knows where that phone has been. They got upset at me for asking them to change gloves and wash hands and to please remake my meal. I asked for refund and they would not give me anything. I left my meal on counter. And WILL NOT BE BACK EVER."}
{"text":"it's hard to find a fast food place at night that isn't a complete wreck. This crew rocks at night! No issues with the service or food. I'd actually prefer to go at night!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. What I hate most about this location is EVERY TIME I come here. For YEARS now they always ask me to back up (in the drive through) so that their time re starts! 

I think it's extremely inconvenient for the customer and if you want to improve your times... idk maybe just try to do better! 

The last couple times I've went around 1-2am the deep fryers have been down which is half of their menu 
They substituted frys for chips which to me didn't seem comparable.

But customer service is never a problem everyone I've encountered has been pleasant."}
{"text":"The employees here must be from the bottom of the gene pool. Simple tasks seem to confuse them and halt all operations. What's really scary is that these \"hard working\" fast food workers think their worth $15 a hour.  LOL
Do yourself a favor and keep driving past this location."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time, got a burrito with beans rice and cheese and ended up eating a chicken bone. This was obviously unappetizing. This curbed my appeal for del taco for a while. Tonight we needed somewhere open late at night and close, resulted in going to del. I regret it 100%. I jokingly said hopefully I don't get an extra topping of chicken bone this time (I finally got over my previous chicken bone incident grudge). GUESS WHAT. I got another CHICKEN BONE in my grilled chicken taco. GROSS. I wanted to give them another shot but man, this is just out right laziness. I do not want to have to think about what I am going to bite into upon eating something. BE AWARE!"}
{"text":"good service the food came very fast I ask for no cheese and that's how it came. some places that I went before they didn't get  what I ask. 
The graveyard chiefed people are very good I appreciate. 
I do recommend that plays if you looking for good taco place !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yep it's a chain, like all other chains. Food is pretty good and cheap, fries are the best, soft chicken tacos on corn tortillas yummm!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food for Mexican fast food. new cheaper than dirt menu is enticing. Decent location & the employees are courteous. Keep on keeping on Del Taco"}
{"text":"This Del Taco is usually bangin' but tonight they skimped out on my \"The Del Tacos\" double meat and cheese? It was the same amount of meat cheese and lettuce as a value taco. But I paid for two \"The Del Tacos\". Too disappointing! My two SAD tacos in the photos."}
{"text":"Nothing exciting about this place, but it was great to grab a quick bite of something before heading by to the hotel.  

If you are looking for something simple, this would be the place.  Since we only went through the drive thru, I am only writing my review based on that.  The person that help us, we OK.  It looked more that they wanted to be out of there, but I can somewhat understand.  The food was OK, I am not going out of my way to come to this place, it just happen to be on the way and open at the time.  

Again, it is OK."}
{"text":"Normally I'm not one for fast food but I decided to stop in here on my lunch break to re-experience the Mexican-American fusion chain of my childhood. I was not disappointed. 

When I first walked into the store, I was greeted by a friendly and cheery guy behind the counter -- Clark was on his nametag -- and he took my order attentively. He seemed to be very customer-service oriented and interested in the overall quality of my lunch break. I could tell he really cared. One of the nicest people I've seen in a restaurant, fast food or otherwise. 

I ordered two half pound bean burritos -- bold, of course, where they add their signature crinkle fries and that oh-so-mysterious secret sauce I'm always craving -- and I received my food within minutes. Hot and delicious as always, it was truly a treat to eat here. 

While the food is similar to any other Del Taco location due to their standardisation, I can say that this store is set apart by the amazing staff. They all seem to be genuinely nice people and they are both service oriented and friendly. A really top-notch team of professionals that I've seen unparalleled in my dining experience. I think it was just as good to interact with them as it was to enjoy my food; they truly made my day.

Store is incredibly clean and well-kept. Seems to be like a flagship store, the decor is modern but incredibly clean, and I can tell the store is exceptionally well-maintained. 

Clark, and the rest of the Del Taco staff at this store, thank you for defining my eating experience. I'll definitely be coming back regularly."}
{"text":"I came here around 3am and ordered a grilled chicken street taco plate. I waited about 20 minutes to get my food with a car ahead of me. I got my food home and saw my beans look like they are at least a day old. Also there was hardly any chicken in the tacos. I understand this is late night but why would you serve this to a customer. Completely hard and inedible. I would have rather them offered me a double serving of rice in place of day old beans. I'm not expecting a five star dining experience here. I'd just maybe like the food I order to at least be edible."}
{"text":"Tacos didnt have enough meat to fill the shells, burritos tasted like they had been microwaved chili cheese fries had no chees and were drown in some nasty chili. When we got home our food was completely disgusting, no napkins in the bag, and no hot sauces. Terrible service. This store should be shut down."}
{"text":"Del Taco is my favorite fast food joint, ever.

Service is pretty speedy and the food is dangerously addictive. (If the drive-thru looks ridiculous, I don't mind heading inside to order bc the staff are pretty speedy.)

Out of everything I've tried on the menu, the Macho Burrito is probably my fave. I get it with the beef and beans combo (bc you can choose either seasoned beef, grilled chicken, or a combo of beef and beens). This Macho Burrito is exactly as it sounds... Macho. It has your choice of meat filling, red + green sauces, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, cheddar cheese, and sour cream.

The Deluxe 1/2lb Bean & Cheese Burrito is also a good one. It's packed with beans, cheese, red or green sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream. It's pretty ginormous, so I don't recommend putting it down once you've started on this guy. And I also recommend keeping it partially wrapped while you're eating to avoid a mess.

Another really awesome thing about Del Taco is that they have crinkle cut fries. Yes, crinkle cut fries!!! (Crinkle cut) fries at a taco joint is pretty freakin' awesome. 

BTW - Where can I buy Del Taco's Inferno Sauce?!!! It's dang good for fast food hot sauce and it actually has a kick.

{"text":"I live around the corner from this location and used to eat here about once a week but never again. This location asks almost every car to pull into a parking spot after they charge you so they can falsify their drive-thru time. Not only do they falsify their drive-thru time but they can never seem to get my order right. I wouldn't mind waiting if the food was decent and the employees checked the bag before bringing it to my car. It has gotten to the point where I lose $5 every time. The quality of food is on the decline. Not worth the frustration or $$ to eat at this location."}
{"text":"I went here the night of Oct 28 at like 2am. Now granted, this is not prime evaluation time for any business, but not much is open. A couple of things you might take into consideration before judgement is rendered:

1) In general, my reviews are overwhelmingly positive.
2) I really like Del Taco
3) I am fine with indifferent service/minororde r issues
4) I eat a lot of fast food because 'Merica.

The guy in the drive through exuded \"f*ck you\" from the moment the speaker came on. He said everything he was supposed to, but it came loaded with battling quantities of creepy and douchey. Real simple order with a no ice drink. Clarified specifically no ice (in a very nice way). Got drink with tons of ice less than 10 seconds later. Food came out shortly after and the body language/tone coming off that dude was nothing short of a master's class in hostile and condescending body language. He ended with the worst \"have a wonderful night\" I've ever experienced.

I went home, inspected the food for spit and fed it to the dog. It might just be one terrible employee, but I wouldn't come here late at night when management isn't around."}
{"text":"They have the slowest service I have even encountered. Especially their drive through. They seem to be very understaffed and the staff that does work there are very young and seem to spend a lot of time chatting and not hustling to fill the orders."}

This store is beyond pathetic the service is a joke there food handlers cannot put a taco together without breaking it, and there all lettuce hardly no meat or cheese.  I used to remember when this was a quality establishment with good food and reasonable prices but it's just gone all down hill ."}

When she asked for hot sauce they gave her ketchup and they made fun of her for not noticing then decided to finally give her the right sauce.  About after 2 hours after we ate we both have been throwing up since going on almost fours now of on and off vomiting this place sucked for customer service and this place gave us both food poising avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I come here primary for the Tuesday and Thursday Taco specials and based on that I give it 5 stars! Never really a long wait in the drive thru. Crunchy Tacos on Tuesdays are always packed full and has that fresh crispy taco shell. Same goes for Chicken soft taco on Thursday's. Grilled chicken breast always tastes fresh with just the right amount of white sauce. Cashiers are always generous with the hot sauce. Good location in my book!"}
{"text":"Always quick and excellent customer service and smiling faces. 

We have never had an order screwed up here. The food is always hot and tasty for being fast food."}
{"text":"It's Del Taco - I expect dirty, delicious tacos, fries that I'm certain are clogging arteries and cheesecake bites that melt in the mouth.  I got exactly what I expected.  

Store was clean, cashier was friendly and the food was served up quick.  It's definitely a step up from Taco Hell.  If you go in expecting anything other than the afore mentioned things, you'll be disappointed.  If you order something other than tacos from a place called \"Del Taco,\" you'll also be disappointed.  

Overall: A-  
The location is a bit off the beaten path of places to go, but it's clean, staff is friendly and sometimes you just want a dirty taco and fries!"}

{"text":"So my Son comes to me the other day and says.....

\"Dad, I have to go to Del Taco and buy 34 Tacos for a school project\"

....I said \"What are you trying to pull?!  What class is this for?\"

....he says \"Health\".

....I laugh my ass off and ask him if he's serious.  Apparently, he was.  They were studying the nutritional contents of Fast Food and if he brought in 34 Tacos for the entire class he'd get extra credit on his project.

Of course, this was too funny to pass up so of course I agreed to do it.  So we left for school a little early this morning and I called ahead to ask the employees how long it would take to make the Tacos.  They said they'd start working on it and that they would be close to having it ready when we arrived.  10 minutes later we arrived and they were 1/2 way done with the order.  We waited another 5 minutes or so and we were on our way.

34 Tacos ($14.33).....extra credit for kiddo, priceless.

Will I return?  This Del Taco has their act together....of course!"}

I heard her say 4 soft tacos and the price so I asked at the window if it's value tacos and she says yes. When I left I opened the bag and there's 4 SOFT tacos. No receipt was in the bag therefore I had no change back. Cashier didn't even ask if I wanted sauce or not, she just threw mild in the bag. Ughh... not cool when you're beyond hungry."}

The food was fresh and tasted good....although I'd skip their Carne Asada and Pollo Asada Tacos....it's their attempt to be like a real taco shop....and it's not even close.

The food was good for a Del Taco, you don't expect it to be top notch.  It did take a little while to get prepared.  I don't know why either, they weren't busy when I was there.  I'll chalk it up to fresh food.

{"text":"I haven't been here in quite a long time. This Del Taco is conveniently located on Rancho Drive near the North Las Vegas Airport and just past the Texas Station and Fiesta casinos. 

It's always directly on my way home when returning from appointments, running errands and engaging in other activities in simply fabulous Las Vegas.

This used to be a fairly regular stop of mine specifically for the occasional taco salad fix in either the beef or chicken versions served in a large crunchy shell.

Service was usually quick and good although I did experience food that was disappointingly cold on at least one occasion. 

Such unfortunate incidents are likely a function of which employees happen to be working at the time - the competent or the incompetent.

All things considered, this is a worthwhile stop for fans of Mexican food who may be looking for something slightly different from what is available at the other major competitor in this type of cuisine, Taco Bell.

The current 2 for $4.00 and 2 for $5.00 Mix 2 Menu items are defintely worth a look."}

I just went through the drive-thru. I ordered a breakfast combo. Very slow service, after I paid , still very slim. I saw the cashier handle my food, I could see her fingers touch inside the little pouch for the potatoes. I did not see her fingers actually touch the food, but the surfaces that would my food would likely touch once the bag shifts. Next she went into the corner, coughed into her hand. This was no just a slight cough, it was a muilti-cough type of cough. She then wiped her hand on her chest, went back to my food and bagged it up. Again picking up my potato bag while touching inside the potato bag.

What happened to washing your hands?

I confronted her about it, and she started to be a bit rude, but I think she realized her mistake and changed her attitude quickly.

I can not afford to lose work and get sick because employees don't want to wash their hands.  

I got my refund and left hungry."}

A few minutes later she storms to our table and slams down our tray with the missing burrito and points at another burrito on our tray and yells, \"See there it is right there!\" She then stormed off and glared at us and gave us a dirty look.

I was told they don't make them any more but that I could pay 40 cents per taco to get it added. I declined. I ordered and paid for the del taco tacos and took them home. Once home, I noticed I had the \"value\" tacos instead. There were no tomatoes and hardly any lettuce, cheese, and meat. All of the shells were broken.

{"text":"This is another establishment (along with Jack in the Box and In 'n Out) that East Coast residents are not so fortunate to have available.

Now, this may sound like utter blasphemy, but... out of the three above that I tried, I have to say that I liked Del Taco the best.  It reminds me of an upscale Taco Bell, if there is such a thing.  The burritos that I tried were very fresh, well made and quite filling (though I was a bit puzzled by the fries that they're paired with - somehow a burrito and fries don't mesh well in my mind, you know what I'm saying?).  The prices are about on par with the Taco Bell establishments around here... but, yeah, the food at Del Taco is definitely better-tasting.  

The countergirl was a sweetheart.  We had a brief conversation about how we over here on the East Coast didn't have such luck and how I was going to miss them when we left Vegas, heh.  True story.  She's probably heard it all before, though.

Eventually when we move out West (which we're planning), I'll have this deliciousness all of the time."}

To the kid working the drive thru on 3/12/18 at around 3:45, maybe you should stop talking over the person ordering and asking questions so you can actually get their order correct.

{"text":"This Del Taco is the most unorganized restaurant in the chain that I have ever been to. My experiences have never been stellar at any Del Taco thus far, and I consider them a sub-standard chain because of it. This one takes the cake.

The restaurant is awkwardly placed in the parking lot, which makes gor an interesting time getting in, waiting in line, and getting back out.  When I finally get to the ordering station, it seems that for once, all is well. My order is read back and is correct.

I reach the window and the guy reads me back the order, which is not at all correct. He looks confused and closes the window. He comes back and asks me what I ordered. Ok. They are obviously running amok inside. The manager comes to the window and asks me what I ordered and then adding a few items if his own to the dialogue that were not correct. I tell him again my order. He repeats it back. 

I pay and receive my order. I check and it looks correct. Until I get home, that is. I paid for (2) four-piece caramel cheesecake bites. I received(2) two-piece. My hamburger was a mess and the quesadilla cheese seemed rancid or something. It smelled similar to gasoline. I loved the fries. That's it.

{"text":"Let me just put out into the universe that Del Taco is not my first choice for a meal. But they normally have pretty decent french fries, and it works late night.

This is the first time I have patronized this Del Taco. There wasn't a very long line, so that was a good start. Then came the bad news: the grill was being cleaned, so there were no hamburgers available! What?! 11pm on a weekend and your grill is down? How the heck are you making quesadillas or anything else for that matter?

My husband ended up with some turkey tacos that were pretty good. You couldn't tell they weren't beef. Good in my book, maybe not so good for others. I got a beef and bean burrito and the fries. Loves the fries, hated the burrito. It was a sloppy mess and reminded me of a worse version of a microwave burrito. With the grill out of service, maybe it was microwaved! Who knows.

The cashier was not at all apologetic for the inconvenience,  and was actually pretty short with us. I mean. It's YOUR fault! Who cleans the grill before during peak night weekend time?"}

Two of them walked right by me.  Did any of them acknowledge us? No.  None of them said a word to us.  So we wait and wait and wait.  A good five minutes go by.  The man working the drive-thru walks by again, yet never says one word to me.  So I said something.  I mean I've never had such rude service in my life.  I understand when they are busy and cannot stop to take an order, but to not acknowledge a customer who is clearly standing there to make an order is just inconsiderate and bad customer service overall.  By that point I didn't even want their food and I told them that.  Maybe I was the wrong shade of brown for them, who knows. I'll never go back to find out."}

{"text":"4am drive thru challenge!

Actually, I had just finished up another late night & thought I needed a burger (or something).  So this was a flashback to my Sonic experience.  However, I didn't hate myself in the morning, this time.

Ordered a Bacon Double Del (an underrated burger, IMO) and a breakfast burrito.  Drive Thru at 4am was surprisingly steady but they were pretty quick.  You should know, burgers are grilled fresh, so they take extra time. I actually like the food a lot.  It is my #3 fast food joint (#1 being CJ & #2 In-n-Out)

This particular store is usually clean and the staff is pretty competent.

My food items were tasty, as only a $3 bacon burger & $2 breakfast burrito can be.  Cheap, tasty & quick.  Also, they have a hot \"hot sauce\" that doesn't taste like battery acid unlike their ringing taco competitor.

One last thing, the taco meat is identifiable as beef & the beans actually taste like frijoles refritos.  The other place just makes me think, \"Ah, cat food in a tortilla.\"  Hopefully, I didn't offend a cat food enthusiast.

On multiple occasions when I have come for the Thursday grilled chicken taco deal, they always \"forget\" some of the tacos I ordered. Either they just forget  and not give me a bag or they count the tacos wrong.
 Also the del scorcho hot sauce is my favorite and I only ask for that and they still end up giving me only two of the black packets and four of the orange packets of sauce and I just end up throwing them away.

{"text":"Wow...what luck!  I got one more 'First to Review' reviews!

Being at UNLV was the first time I was ever away for a long time from my permanent home on Maui.  It was gratifying to have my own independence, to make decisions on my own.  It was also pretty scary at first, not coming home to a cooked meal, not having your laundry magically done when you come home from school, not having an allowance for stuff you want to buy.  Del Taco right across the street was one of the first food comforts I had as a college student at UNLV, and also one of the reasons I gained the Freshman 20, not 15...20.  
I was such a lard!

This place brings back some great memories with newfound friends, and the feelings that I could do anything at that time.  Needless to say, I still visit this place frequently.  I think I've visited at least half of the Del Tacos in LV, and the one on Blue Diamond across from Target is the newest.  The decor for all of em' is almost the same, bright red all over the place, light and airy.  You walk in and you can smell the beef (I think it's beef) being mixed in the warmers, and the crinkle-cut fries being cooked in the fryer.  The sight of the Coke machine with Cherry Coke (I love Coke *sigh*), the sound of a cheese quesadilla being made in what looks like a Panini press.  I know, I know, it's not gourmet...but boy does it bring comfort to this chubby eater.

This one is fairly new (maybe a year old) so it's pretty darn clean.  The one back on Maryland Pkwy. wasn't as clean, but it never stopped me from eating there!  I just LOVE this place.  The food here is so CHEAP, and for what it is...very yummy.  I occasionally miss when we used to partake in 'Taco Tuesday' back in school.  For those not in the know, 'Taco Tuesday' at Del Taco was 3 tacos for 99 cents.  99 cents!  That was the cheapest I ever saw for tacos at the time.  My college roomies and I used to walk over every Tuesday night after class and stuff ourselves silly for less than 5 bucks!  For a brokea$$ college student this was a godsend.  We used to have contests to see who could eat the most tacos.  You would think a fatty like me would have won, but I always got out-ate by my roomie.  Little Asian guy, you wouldn't think he could eat that much.  His record stands at about 16 tacos in one sitting.  I still go now for tacos on Tuesday, but the price has gone up a bit, I think it's $1.19 for 3 tacos now.

Besides usual Mexican fare like tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and nachos, they also serve burgers.  A burger at a Mexican place?  Believe me, with the fries, it's not half bad.  I prefer their burgers over McDonald's.  They also make a burrito and a plate of nachos that's 'Macho' and come in at over a pound!  That's a lot of food for the dollar.  They also got a Value Menu and some combo meals too.  My absolute favorite is combo #12.  It comes with a Spicy Chicken Burrito (chicken, beans, rice, cheese, peppers...it's SPICY), a Chicken Soft Taco, fries,and a drink.  I usually add on a quesadilla with Spicy Jack cheese.  And an extra soft taco (hee hee...me's a piggy).  Yum-O!  Sorry Rachael Ray.  

They also serve breakfast.  They got this $2.00 breakfast deal going on right now that has 2 Egg & Cheese Burritos, and 5 hash brown sticks.  Great if you need a quick meal in the morning for minimum moolah.  Oh yeah, and they serve premium milkshakes too...and they're not half bad!  My fav is strawberrry.

If you've never been here, you don't know what you're missing.  They possibly serve the best 'not-really-Mexican-but-somewhat-close-but-more-Americanized' Mexican fast food out there!  And for all of you college students out there carrying on the Del Taco legacy...I salute you!  Eat with pride!  Don't worry Roberto's I still love you, and deem you as the place I will most likely have a heart attack!

Try Del Taco!  Es muy delicioso!"}
{"text":"Can you say cheap three times fast?  CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!

For some reason we often end up here for a quick bite after a long Sunday morning grocery shopping at the nearby Walmart & Sam's Club.  Sometimes you just don't feel like a friggin' hot dog or crappy pizza.  I'm talking to you Sam's Club!  Take a cue from Costco for better cheap eats.

The newly renovated Del Taco is pretty clean as wellas bright and inviting with it's new color scheme.  The menus have been changed up a bit and some new items added.  Guess change can be good sometimes.  One big change is that now on each table there are baskets that already have the condiments arranged nicely in them (mild, hot, habanero sauces, ketchup).  I guess the goal is to make it seem like you're more at home for a meal.  

But the quality of food (for the cheapness it is) sure beats that other taco place (*cough* Taco Bell *cough*), at least in my opinion.  The food here at Del Taco tastes much fresher and settles better in my tummy.  I dunno about that other taco place, those damn Doritos Locos Tacos always leave me feeling gassy and light headed.  Perhaps it's the artificial ingredients in that shell??

The Classic Taco at Del Taco is one of my favorites.  The crunchy shell filled with seasoned beef, fresh shredded cheddar cheese, lettuce, and tomato?  For only $1 each?  Yeah, I'll have 5.  And wrapping it in yellow paper?  Ooh...almost authentic Mexican!  When these tacos are fresh, they are greatness.  I will eat like a cheap, happy man.  I also like their plain old Bean & Cheese Burrito (with red sauce).  When the beans are from a fresh batch made in store, it's pretty good eats.  Another favorite?  Their $1 Chicken Soft Taco.  I can eat a dozen of these easy.  But, and I say that critically...only when they are freshly made.  I don't want mine made with old flour tortillas, or with old grilled chicken.  Nope.  Gotta be fresh made!  If you're nice and are buying several of these Chicken Soft Tacos with your order, you can ask them to cook a fresh batch of chicken for you and they will sometimes oblige.  Trust me, don't go for the ones sitting there.  Del Taco...eat FRESH!  Hmm....copyright infringement ensues...

Another big reason I like Del Taco over Taco Bell (there, I said it) is because they serve friggin' Coca-Cola!  It's a big factor over why I visit Del Taco over Taco Bell if given the choice.  It just seems to go way better with a semi-Mexcan meal that a Pepsi.  Call me whatever you want, Coke is it!  I really am getting in trouble with these copyright laws...

I will usually get a decent meal at Del Taco for two at under $9.  Thank God the wifey likes a cheap meal more often than not!  Either that, or she just puts up with me.  I have no qualms with my usual order:  Combo #1, make it a medium, double-cook the quesadilla (me likes it crispy), 1 Bean & Cheese Burrito with red sauce, and 1 Chicken Soft Taco.  If I don't want that with my Combo #1, I'll add on two Breakfast Burritos.  Yes, Del Taco serves breakfast as well (24 hours in most locations)...and they started this way before Taco Bell's 'First Meal'!

Staff here is friendly, and very quick with your orders.  Prices vary a little bit depending if you're going with a combo or going off of the value menu.  But you can usually get away with feeding one hungover person at around the $7-8 for a complete meal.  Don't forget, Del Taco also serves burgers, shakes, and fries!  I'm not sure about a burger in a taco joint so I've never really tried them.  But the fries?  Not bad as they are a standard crinkle cut.  Get the Deluxe Chili Cheddar Fries (add jalapenos if you're feeling HOT HOT HOT), wow, explosion in a tray.  Get your TUMS.  You will either LOVE these, or HATE these.  Chili bomb!     

Late night?  Del Taco will treat you right."}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain, I'm aware of that, but my goodness they're incredibly good!  If you've never had Del Taco then expect to be wowed by their freshness and flavors!  This is not your Taco Bell by any means, but instead a fresh closer to authentic version of fast food Mexican!  

The Fish Tacos, my personal favorite, are large chunks of fried fish with some cabbage and incredibly good sauce! The same can be said for the Carnitas Tacos with their fresh deep fried pork chunks!

Fast food? Yes!  Taco Bell?  Hell No!"}
{"text":"I don't know why Del Taco doesn't get better reviews than it does? When your stuck on the East Coast with Taco Bell, this is fast food Mexican manna sent from the heavenly El Chapo gods themselves! I absolutely love the beer battered fish tacos that are crunchy, warm, topped with lettuce, and a avocado cream! Wrapped in foil with a lime wedge and your in  some remote Mexican village eating some kinda goodness! The prices are all very reasonable and not a overwhelming menu! You'll have your standard tacos, along with some seasonal specials their running. If you can ever catch the carnitas taco, hit the manager over the head and take off with every one he's got! This southern gentleman is loving some Del Taco!"}
{"text":"So I went to del taco today and order del nachos with no red sauce add turkey and no salt on the chips I get it like that all the time from the other del tacos the cashier was nice but the GM was super rude bout my order. She didn't even want to do it she was like next time I'm not gonna do it and just so u know ur chips are going to be super oily. I was like ok I just want the chips no salt cause I have high blood pressure."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service experience of my life. Literally the worst. I am appalled and insulted by the behavior of the \"manager!\" We asked for a special request on an order (nothing any fast food place wouldn't normally do) and we were told no. Just no. When we told the manager that we have had it this way before he said, \"no, that is a lie!\" Then we told him no, we got it this way last time and he said, \"no, I have been the manager here longer than you have been keeping up with that lie!\" Managers are supposed to de-escalate customer service issues not create new ones and add fuel to fire of existing ones. Tonight my friend and I were called liars by a del taco manager barks versed in the language of his residence. I'll just say, that's $10 an hour well earned sir!\""}
{"text":"I just had the best customer service from a awesome young lady named Ciera. She had a great attitude and she offered me a cup of ice water while waiting for my food. She definitely went the extra mile and she had a smile in her voice and on her face the entire time. Thank you again Ciera for the best customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Love when their coupons come out.  Saves a bunch on money.  This Del Taco is clean and new.  Staff are pretty cool and efficient.  I just don't like the wait in drive thru"}
{"text":"In this review, I won't be able to tell you how good there meal was, how cold their drinks are, or how hard their seats were. The reason of this is, even though I was next in line to give my order, the counter lady was talking to a person on the phone about a kid who showed up to work, meanwhile the drive up person had helped the couple before me take an order only to approach them and ask for the change back because she told them the amount do from the drive through order. Back to the kid who showed up to work, apparently he didn't have a Del Taco t-shirt because the person on the phone was the manager, who was running late due to a flat tire. Therefore the counter person was told by \"flat tire\" person to tell the kid who showed up to work to come in tomorrow. The kid had to call his mom to come back and pick him up. Now by reading the story, you may think three things 1) I'm patient 2) I'm fair and 3) I eavesdrop a lot.
Well you would be right on all three, honestly  I waited for at least 10 minutes just to be acknowledged. Finally I simply decided to go next door to Jack-In-The-Box."}
{"text":"Ate at this location for the first time, the employees seem very dedicated to the customer by putting them first. Had to wait in the drive thru for food but it was 3 am and needed tacos after the club."}
{"text":"Great little Del Taco has such good food for a snack at lunch time. They serve fresh style food that is low cost and taste great. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was so very clean too. On their front door they have special deals on tacos or Taco Tuesday so one can celebrate that ."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews on places but I actually liked this Del Taco. The lady at the drive thru is a little hard to understand but she's sweet and smiles and is polite. That goes a long way in my book. It's clean, the wait is pretty short, and it's close by."}
{"text":"This is the fine dining version of drive throughs, yes slow but you can always count on this spot being open...  NYE 4am and you want grub, they got you...  epic breakfast burritos, fish or shrimp tacos, chicken n avocado burrito...  can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure spot when I'm in Vegas! Cheap cheap food and really good. Reminds me of taco bell except this is a chain I can't get on the east coast. Great spot for a cheap bite to eat while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"They are still new I guess.  But very slow service.    They now have taco tuesdays which is good cause It was disappointing when i first went there and they didn't.  We had to walk out and go back to our other one on rancho."}
{"text":"This Del Taco location is right off of Boulder Hwy which makes it very convenient to pull off the street and cruise right up to the parking lot or drive-thru entrance. On this day I got Del Taco's Chicken Bacon Avocado Salad, I've had their burrito's, taco's, hamburger's in the past so I wanted to try something different for a change. Needless to say I'm now a newly fan of their Chicken Bacon Avocado Salad. It was very delicious and prepare quite well for a popular fast food chain.

Most of the time when I go to Del Taco, maybe by luck, but I'm either usually the first one going through the drive-thru or if I do have to wait it is not a long wait at all. This drive-thru at this location is fairly speedy and have good customer service. I was greeted and treated good with condiments offered as I was departing. For these vary reasons I like going to this location. I've been to other Del Taco's throughout the valley and this one seems to be the better one that serves well with a good experience. :two thumbs up:"}
{"text":"Worst Del Taco location.  The men's room has no trash can at all.  Makes me worry they don't wash their hands.  There were actually live insects on the counter by the register.  The floor is a mess.  I don't think they've mopped all day.  Graffiti on tables.  

The dude couldn't work the register so I was checked out by a girl with a crappy attitude.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Drive-thru employee is rude and didn't get my order right even though I repeated it to him at the window"}
{"text":"Went for tacos after the movie around 9:00 p.m.  Sign said they were open until 11:00 p.m. But chairs at several tables were already stacked.  Service was less than stellar.  No one in the place but still had to wait.  Food was fast and good!  Went back to order those delicious little caramel bites and waited....and waited while manager talked on his cell phone.  Finally made a comment regarding his being on the phone and too busy to wait on customers.  Then the guy who was taking drive thru orders finally took the order but with an attitude.  Another couple who came in after us received the same attitude.  We probably won't return to this Del Taco!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. During dinner they only had three employees working. The young guy working the counter was clearly overwhelmed. With only two in the kitchen our take out order took nearly 25 minutes. C'mon Manager, staff the place correctly. These employees could not handle the business. Not the fault of the folks working there!"}
{"text":"Better than taco bell! Sauce on chicken soft tacos is delish! My late night go to spot!"}
{"text":"Order ALWAYS wrong - smaller items than other Del Tacos and NEVER give NAPKINs."}
{"text":"The worst drive-thru experience ever. It took over thirty minutes to get my order with just 6 cars ahead of me. Then, they forgot my drinks and I had to go back. 45 minutes later, my family got to eat cold fish tacos and cold fries. Yum! The employees could not care any less if they tried. Nobody offered up an apology for the slow service or any show of appreciation for waiting."}
{"text":"Went to DelTaco for the very first time this week and boy was I ever hungry. So, I ordered the \"Macho\" sized combo. Whoa, was that ever a mistake. My first clue should have been that it was a MACHO combo, which I am clearly not. :) The fries came in a large soft drink cup and the macho sized soda was as big as my head- took 2 hands to pick it up. My main advice, stick to the small!

As for the food, I had the soft chicken tacos which were pretty good. I wouldn't say they compare to an actualy sit-down mexican restraunt, but were good considering I only paid a couple bucks and was eating within a few minutes of ordering. I'd go back again if I needed some tacos in a hurry.

Side note: Don't use the stuffed animal grabber machine... it stole my money :)"}
{"text":"The gentleman running the drive was rude and kept interrupting... I drove right through I'll take my business else where. I'd Forget this restaurant. I went to jack in the box next door."}
{"text":"This chain of faux-Mexican fast food joints will always hold a special place in my heart. After a night on the strip, my buddies and I were looking for something quick and good. This is not what came to mind for everyone else. I couldn't wait to have some chicken soft tacos! They had Raising canes in mind.

It was in sight and only after we arrived at the drive-thru and they were closed, we proceeded over to Del Taco.

We ordered $30 worth of food and scarfed it down licketly-split. The \"beef\" is sub-par but the chicken products are outstanding. Spicy Jack Chicken Quesadilla, the Chicken Soft Tacos, and Chicken Burritos. Brilliant!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite here today and I was impressed.  I thought this place would be like a Taco Bell but was suprised that the food was actually pretty good.  They mostly have a simple mexican fast food menu but, they also sell burgers and have a small breakfast selection available all day.  I didn't have any problems with my order however another customer from the drive-thru came in with a complaint.  They fixed their mistake quickly and without hassle.  Prices are good and the portions are huge.  They also got an A from the health department, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered twenty minutes ago... still waiting on my food. Saw two employees arguing about break time. Where is my darn food DelTaco!"}
{"text":"Best place to go too when hungover, there food is pretty bomb! Highly recommend it when having a long night!"}
{"text":"If you have 30 minutes to spare in the drive they go for it. It doesn't matter what time of day this is the slowest del taco in the valley. Ok going on 40 minutes now."}
{"text":"If you have never eaten at a Del Taco, eat there when you go out west. They are all over Vegas and Los Angeles, and for fast food-- awesomeness and yumminess. Cheap and fast, as expected. I live in Virginia, and Del Taco haunts my dreams."}
{"text":"A great Del Taco with good food, friendly staff, and clean restaurant! What more could you ask for in a fast food chain?"}
{"text":"Expedited, hot & fresh, Del Taco quality food. What more do you ask of a fast food chain?

Note: every time I am at this particular DT they go cheap on the package sauces ie: DT hot sauce or ketchup. Be sure to ask for a specific quantity or else your food could end up being free of DT hot sauce, and thats always a sad day lol:)"}
{"text":"Expedited, hot & fresh, Del Taco quality food. What more do you ask of a fast food chain?"}
{"text":"Throughoughly delighted! We asked for fries well done, and they arrived as asked and delish. The fish tacos, which were abslutely tasty, were piping hot in our togo bag with lime slices for squeezing on the tacos. They took the time to toast the tortillas for the burritos in our order. And our coke was a perfect mix of syrup and carbonation (this is kind of a big deal to me, I love soda, and if its bad it can ruin my meal).

Note: parking lot is a pain to get in and out of, not recommended for large trucks!!"}
{"text":"Meh. We were hungry after a long night of dancing at a wedding at the Grove just down the street, and figured we would drive through before our long drive home to Pahrump. When ordering we asked for fries well done, soft tacos, and sauces, what did we receive? Cold food, fries that were soggy, hard shell tacos with very little filling, and zero sauces. The worst part is that we didn't start eating until we were already on the highway home, which means we would not turn around to correct it with Del Taco. Leaving a restaurant still hungry is the absolutely worst way to leave.

Why 2 stars? When we got home we were able to re-heat a singular bean burrito that turned out to be tasty, which saved the review from being 1 star."}
{"text":"Meh. Not my favorite Del Taco, but it will do. Food was hot and just ok. For fast food its decent."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place 5 stars to manipulate the average rating into being a bit higher. Couldn't live with myself.

It's nothing special in and of itself. The parking lot is a bit awkward to enter if you're traveling west on Sunset because you have to circle around almost back to the street. The seating is awkwardly designed as compared to other locations. I figure they probably inherited this place from somebody else. Also, the interior was renovated a few months ago and they do have sufficient service and condiments and whatnot.

I definitely don't mind stopping by here every so often because it's a convenient lunch spot."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Hasn't let me down yet. It's easily accessible off Boulder Highway and is open 24/7. This is one of my preferred spots to redeem the BOGO coupon for the Double Del Cheeseburger, $3.00 each, and I don't recall having any issues. They also aren't upselling jerks who pester you about trying a new item or asking 3 times whether you're sure that you've concluded your order."}
{"text":"Why does this location stall the drive thru so bad to boost their metrics for faster drive-thru? You people are so rude and hold the line for so long it's ridiculous. Concentrate your efforts at being more efficient on the taco bar and worry less about wait times. You hold the line so long that your fries are old and taste bad."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star. This places lacks customer service and food is unbearable. I drove to this location because it was closer and got disgusting tacos!! The shells tasted awful like they were old already!! I threw it all away. You're better of driving to the one on Serene. They will have much better tasting and fresh tacos for you!!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this location I give the lady (Miriam and Everett) who took my order last night around 730-8pm (she just started her shift) a A+++. I have been to a few deal tacos in CA and had one where I use to live not offer me great costumer service like she did about the chipotle tacos they took off the menu. She fixed them right up for me :) thank you!!! I will be going back to this location. Hoping she is working!"}
{"text":"I always go to that Starbucks and saw they were finally opened. I saw them crowded last night, not sure when they opened. So, I decided to check them out tonight. The lady was super nice who took my order. She asked me if I wanted to try a burrito and the cheesecake bites. So great customer service :) they made my food correct and tasted very good. I'm glad we finally have a good del taco around."}
{"text":"$1 mini shakes are actually pretty good, was impressed. Churros are delicious. Excited to try the new queso."}
{"text":"Drive thru is sloooooooow. How slow? I had enough time to create a yelp account and write this review. I have two cars in front of me, c'mon Del Taco!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Mexican food, so I don't  frequent those types of places. I made a run to Del Taco for a family member. I decided to give their tacos a try. Are they serious with those taco's. If I were a three yr. old child the tiny taco woul be suitable. I'm an adult, so make your tacos for ADULTS! Nope, I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I went through the drive through and once I got to the window I was treated quite rudely not to mention rushed. As I inquired about the sauces I was spoken over, given whatever she wanted to give me, then had a window slammed in my face."}
{"text":"Went to del taco a couple of nights ago with my son. and when we got there around 7:20pm the doors were locked and was told the dining room was closed. Reported it to corporate and just got a call from a manager that treated me like an Idiot and didn't know which doors to use. Saying she advises her managers to lock all doors at dark so no customers can eat in the dining room. Don't know whats going on with this del taco. or its managers. Something needs to be done about this. Managers should never treat customers like they're idiots."}
{"text":"This Del Taco is near and dear to my heart. I can clearly recall it's initial construction in the Fry's  parking lot across the way from Burger King. My heart boasted with a glistening excitement that a young 11 year old boy couldn't possibly contain. 

Flash forward to modern day and this Del Taco is surprisingly adequate. Parking is rather  accommodating, and the drive-thru is very easy to navigate. Inside, bright colors line the walls and plenty of padded booths are available for seating. There's a soda fountain and small condiment bar to one side with an impressively large menu and order counter. A front patio is also available. 

Pro tip: when ordering, if you ask to \"go bold\", your order will include French Fries and Diablo Sauce in it! Of course there is an additional fee. Using your imagination, you can probably surmise a few palatable \"Bold\" concoctions of your own. 

Interesting observation: the drive-through orders are very loudly played back via an intercom system. When you're sitting inside, you can hear each customer's orders that are in the drive through. It's kind of fun and intetesting. 

The employees here are fair and friendly. I haven't had an unpleasant experience here once! And throughout the years, I have noticed that the operation hours have changed. They are no longer open 24 hours. 

7am-3am Monday - Sunday. 

Random fact: I always ask for El Scorcho Sauce. It's the same exact thing as medium, I just like to refer to it by Del Taco's official Sauce title, which often goes overlooked. 

Updated breakfast hours: 7am - 3pm! 
Their breakfast dollar menu rocks my socks!! :P or maybe that's the $1 Breakfast Rollers talking.."}
{"text":"It may be fast food but customer service should always be #1 priority. I listened to the female associate give attitude to the customers ahead of me who were asking for certain things off here foods, then when I got up there that same associate was speaking in spanish to a male associate and rolling her eyes. I don't speak spanish so I don't know what was said but an impression of negativity was left in my eyes towards a customer. She walks away and the male associate huffed and puffed walked over to me and asked \"Can I help you Sir?\" I am 100% woman and 100% pissed off! My reaction was Did you really call me Sir?\" and he asked \"what's your order\". I walked out. Disrespectful! Never will I step foot in a Del Taco again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try the \" NEW\" Queso Crunch Taco  it's a crunchy shell overlapped carefully with a soft tortilla with cheese melted between the two items. I requested no tomatoes on my tacos which by the way was a buy one get one free."}
{"text":"This del Taco is the f**** worst every time i go there the food is awful and badly made. But atleast the guys that work there are cute, especially the ones that work the drive through. The two black ones and the Mexican one."}
{"text":"I am going to give Del a bump up to 4 stars today.  Service was strong and fast.  More importantly it was accurate.  Del Taco has updated their menu adding many new items like the Jacked-up BRC Burrito, the Spicy Crunch Burrito and the Chili Cheese Fries Burrito.  Way to go Del Taco.  You have some awesome new food and I am now encouraged to come back and try it all."}
{"text":"I'd strongly suggest Taco Tuesdays and/or the shredded beef breakfast burrito.  It's greasy, Mexican fast food so don't go here expecting anything but that.  Their drive thru is super fast and I've always had friendly service at this location.  Don't forget the \"Del Scorcho\" hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Jason was one of the best nicest drive thru dudes ever !!!

yay they have 8 layer veggie burritos !!! all about the vegetarian !!!

fast good service and hot yummy food !!!"}
{"text":"The worst. First off the old black dude doesn't know how to talk to people and his tone is just wrong. Honestly made me lose my appetite. Thanks, guy. Get better employees."}
{"text":"This is the best del taco is vegas! Always quick and the good here just seems better than other del tacos. I go here way too much and I am always satisfied with the price and the quality

Good thing to know: in the last few months, late night food (10-12pm) has been really slow. If there is people in front of you, it's been averaging 10-15 in drive thru"}
{"text":"Waited twenty minutes for our food. After fifteen, the manager came out and yelled at the staff. A better idea would be to help them get caught up.
On top of that, the tortillas were drier than a popcorn fart. Next time...taco bell."}
{"text":"Came here to take advantage of the free food day and my hubby and I made out like bandits: 3 chicken soft tacos, 1 bean & cheese burrito, & 1 chipotle taco. 

Plus the eating area was clean and individually stocked with ketchup and taco sauce.

Del Taco gets my nom nom nom!!!!

When you're ballin on a budget Del Taco is fine dining!"}
{"text":"This del taco has been nothing but mediocre. My boyfriend and I always get things \"bold\" where the sauce and French fries inside whatever we're ordering. This location is the ONLY chain that say they \"don't do that no more\" or that its not a thing. And always with so much rudeness and attitude. We have gone to this one, asked for bold, been told it wasn't available and then two weeks later gone to a different on while on a road trip and gotten everything done bold. I understand if they just don't do it at this one but the people being so rude is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Made my order in drive thru, was told to come to window, then ignored for 3 minutes, guy took my card,never said how much it was, I asked for a receipt, was told he needs to finish putting together my order, guy is super rude. I come here all the time and the service gets worse every time. First thing I got out of the window was my shake, I didn't get the straw with it so half was melted before I could drink it. When I got my order with my food I checked receipt and it came out to 14.33$ for 3 value tacos, mini shake, double del and carne asada fries. Very upsetting the service keeps getting worse"}
{"text":"Out of the two times I've been here I've had to wait over 20mins and they got our order wrong and the employees are rude. Even though it's farther away I'll drive to the serene one instead, I've never had issues there."}
{"text":"Ok, don't know what the deal is. I ordered my meal at 9:26am and here it's 9:45am and am still waiting on my order as well as 5 other customers and the drive through is backed up! Are they short staffed? Not a good impression for a new Del Taco!"}
{"text":"So's, and only my uncle from New Jersey starts a sentence with, \"so's\". 

So's, I went to Del Taco one day, one beef taco, so very delicious. $1.50. God, that was good. Beef was flavorful, good and greasy.  Lots of cheese. 

I do not like the hot sauce at Del Taco. At all. It's not flavorful; it's waaaaaaaay too bitter.  Spice is ok, flavor not. 

So's, I go back 2 days later for TWO TACOS and the beef had no flavor. None. A COMPLETE WASTE. 

So's, I'm not going back. And even if I do, I'll have to bring my own salsa."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. I have never written a negative review on Yelp before but this Del Taco location certainly deserves it. Me and my family eat Del Taco very often, at least once a week and this new location is right by our house. Ever since they opened I have had something gone wrong literally every single time I've gone here. I've given up and have decided I will be making the farther drive if I do decide I want Del Taco because there is NO WAY I'm going back to this one. My fiancé has found a long black hair in his food on two separate occasions. One in a burrito and one in a tostada. We called to complain and the manager acted as if this was a normal thing, brushed it off and just offered to give us a free burrito. On another occasion I was stuck in their drive thru for 45 minutes. I am not exaggerating. It was nearly midnight and they were obviously training someone new in the back but 45 minutes is excessive and they barely even apologized for the wait. And if they're not taking a lifetime to get your order together or putting their nasty black hair in your burritos and tacos then they're getting your order all wrong and messed up before anything. Seriously the WORST Del Taco I have ever been to. These people should be ashamed of themselves and really need to get it together. I love Del Taco overall and I'm surprised this location hasn't absolutely ruined it for me with their shitty fast food experiences I've endured time and time again."}
{"text":"We were out shopping, and something quick and simple to bring home sounded great.
I ordered the Bean Crunchtada...and I always ask for green sauce to replace the red taco sauce as my preference. We also ordered a Beef Crunchtada the same way, and then two additional regular crunchy tacos. 
Drive through was very quick. Probably the fastest we have experienced at a del Taco. We asked for the extra hot sauce on the side, and were given about 6 packets.
Food stayed hot for the drive home, and everything was pretty tasty. The only thing that I was slightly disappointed with was the amount of toppings on my bean crunchtada. There was enough of the beans and the green sauce, although there was not much lettuce or cheese. Not a big deal though, as the flavor was good."}
{"text":"This place is always such a disappointment. Eaten here a few times, and only once was the food something to be happy about. 

The del Taco was pretty good once. Stuffed full of meat and cheese. Oh, and the Mini Vanilla Shake for $1 was actually really good. You get a lot for that dollar. 

Went this week on 'Taco Tuesday'. Got three of their regular tacos, and tried the 2 for $5 Burritos. One del Beef and one Combo. 

The burritos were in the wrong wrappers. Each had the name of what the burrito was supposed to be, but the wrappers were on the wrong ones. They were okay though, once my husband and I switched with each other for the ones we actually wanted. My crunchy taco also had a broken shell. I can understand if the piece was broken and in the wrapper. That would mean it was cracked when put into the bag, or maybe I squished it by mistake. But no piece of broken shell was in there, so that means they simply used a broken shell and knew it all along. 

I will avoid this location from now on. Too many chances, and most of the time the quality was poor."}
{"text":"Best Del Taco experience to date. I like that the crew was older, and not all teenagers. This crew seemed to really care about the food, and its presentation. There were full baskets of taco sauce on each table, and the kitchen area was clean. You just cannot beat the fresh taste of their food, and the low price."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. We are here every week...it has become a sort of ritual for us, and we have never been disappointed. Well, with the food anyway. 
We are aware of the 'game' they play when ordering in the drive through, but it has gotten so much worse recently. Each item of your order is repeated back to you as you order, with MANY pauses in between, as well as repeated in its entirety again at the end. It is so slow that they actually sound rather incompetent. So much time is wasted placing your order, that when you drive around to the pick up window they immediatley hand you the order and ask for payment. This sounds great, but they don't even give you a chance to put your car in park, or gather your money in order to pay. At first we were pleased with how quickly the order is ready, yet now it has become rather annoying. 
Just know that if you see a long like at the drive thru, do not worry. Once you get to the pick up window, everything is ready."}
{"text":"This was an excellent experience. This location was clean. Our food was hot and filling. I got two value items, each under $1, and I couldn't even finish them. 

Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Ordered the two fish tacos for $4. special which was advertised today and was charged the full retail price, which was over $6. with tax. When I asked them why I paid more, they said the special started tomorrow. There was no date on any of the ad signs inside or outside the store, and they confirmed this fact.
They said they can give me a full refund, but I cannot have the tacos.
Last time you will see me at Del Taco! Say Bye!"}
{"text":"Advertised as a 24 hour drive through. Drove out of my way. Closed up lights off. You suck feel taco"}
{"text":"This Del Taco is the best in town :) 
We have been to this one 3-4 time .
1. The staff is friendly 
2. The order was always correct 
3. Food street tacos , bean burrito & tostada was all filling made fresh 
We have been to other ones in town not as good as This one mmmmm"}
{"text":"Lately when I go to this location the drive thru line takes longer than usual. Not sure if they're shirt staffed or what. And then to say that you stay in line all that time the food isn't fresh."}
{"text":"Stood at register waiting to order. Person working  there, getting trays ready. Never acknowledged me. She looked my way twice. Five minutes later, I sat down to use their air conditioning and type this up. And she said she was the manager when I called. 

I'm going across the street to Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"It's a Del Taco, so just remember that going in. You can't really expect anything extraordinary, but this facility is pretty good.

Clean inside, clean and stocked restrooms, and fast service. They readily get you whatever you need both in the drive through and in person, so it's a quick, pleasant, and crunchy experience. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL and the meat they use is not fresh! I've only been here twice and both times were absolutely awful. 
My first time here, I ordered two of the mini shakes to go with our meal, and when she handed them to me, they were so watery, they looked like milk. I politely asked her if they could remake them and make them thicker, because they are so runny. She looked at me like she wanted to hit me, said nothing, rolled her eyes as she shut the window and leaned in to her coworker to say whatever she said. She then opens the window and says, \"that's just the way they come.\" I then handed them back to her and I told her, that I didn't want them because they were definitely not shakes and I'd like a refund. She snatches them out of my hand and huffs and rolls her eyes and shuts the window. She then goes to get the manager, and as she is explaining to him the reason I need my refund, she is mocking me and holding one of the shakes up and rocking it back and forth and rolling her eyes to him. He then shakes his head and rolls his eyes as he glances towards me and then proceeds to refund my transaction at the micro and then walks off. She grabs the receipt, opens the window, pouts her lips together like a mom does when she is scolding her child and then slings her arm towards me to give me the refund receipt. She never even said a word! WTH?! I was so offended by her AND the manager, I swore to myself I would NEVER go back. 

Well, I should've listened to myself! Time heals all wounds right? .......Wrong! Fast forward a couple months and I'm heading home too tired to cook for me and my son, and I really want a burrito and a taco for dinner, so I think, \"okay, I'll try this place again\" because I really was so exhausted and didn't want to fight the traffic to get over to the rainbow Del Taco. I go through the drive-thru again. I order 2 Beef Del Burritos and 2 Del Beef Tacos. She says sarcastically to correct me, \"we don't have Del beef tacos.......(long pause).....we only have DEL TACOS.\" I said \"oh okay well, your menu says beef or turkey, so I just wanted 2 Del Tacos with beef and not turkey.\" Then I hear her and her coworker talking and she then says, \"we don't have any crunchy taco shells, we only have soft tacos\". I'm like \"?\" \"Uhhhh, okay. I will take just the burritos\". She says, \"so you want the soft tacos?\" I said, \"no, I'll just take the burritos\". I pull up and I smile and asked her nicely, \"how does a taco place run out of taco shells?\" as I giggle a little.  She looks at me and says, \"we are crazy busy.\" I'm like \"oh okay.\" As I'm looking around and there are no other cars or patrons anywhere to be found. So she hands me my bag with two burritos. Now, this Del Taco does not fold both ends of the burrito, which is typical of some fast food taco joints, however, it is food to go so I would think you would, at the very least, put the wrapper on them fully? Nope, both burritos were wrapped to leave one end fully open in an open bag. Now, if I have to slam on my breaks as I'm driving home, this meat will definitely come flying out, so I show her the bag and and say \"you guys didn't even wrap the burritos up all the way?\" She looks at me like I'm deranged and says \"uh, I'm sorry?\" I was like, \"can I just get a couple of hot sauces please?\" She proceeds to slam her hand in the sauce bin and grabs a handful of 13 (I counted when I got home) and hands it to me as if she was going to throw them at me. Now I've got to take both my hands to get all this sauce. She didn't even ask me which hot sauce I wanted. To top off the experience, when I got home, the kitchen staff had apparently wrapped the sides of one of the burritos so hard, their thumb went through the paper and poked a hole in the burrito and the sauce inside it had leaked everywhere. AND the meat in the burritos was cold and tasted old. Mind you I went through at 6:45 pm. when you would expect it to be fresh for the dinner rush. I also found my receipt crumpled up in the bag. I've never had anyone crumple my receipt like it's trash and throw it in my bag. I've also never gone through a drivethru that didn't put a single napkin in the bag. 
I've been to many other Del Tacos, locally and across the country, and I have NEVER been treated with such hatred by their staff. I will absolutely NEVER be back to this Del Taco. EVER!"}
{"text":"Had not eaten Del Taco in like 10 years. Decided to give them another try. Had the fish tacos and they were great. Like the options here that other fast food Mexican food chains don't offer."}
{"text":"It Would be nice to sit in a del taco that doesn't have employees screaming and cussing at each other about keeping their \"shit together\""}
{"text":"Rude rude rude!! What is up with fast food joints?? Too hard to find people willing to work who are happy and not just plain miserable?!"}
{"text":"Can't understand the drive thru teller. So I try to go inside to order, it's 6:40 the front door is still locked and the hours say dine in 6:00 to 2:00 AM. They tell me things are not going as they should I'm like well why not they say everyone was late. I can understand that but Now I'm waiting 15 minutes for my food"}
{"text":"I love me some Del Taco but unfortunately, I'm going to have to go along with the two star rating.  The food was the same as any other location but it was definitely not up to par in other areas.  First off, the screen in the drive thru doesn't work so you can't tell if they got your order right or not.  Knowing this, you would think the staff would read back the order...nope.  After placing a pretty large order, we were given our total, which seemed pretty high, but we were hungry and had been in the car for 6 hours so we didn't think about questioning it.  When we pulled up to the window, we were asked if we wanted any sauce.  When we asked for hot, we were then told they were out of hot.  Great.  So after paying, we looked at our receipt and realized that we were charged for four extra street tacos, which equals over $9. No wonder it seemed so high.  But again, we had just driven from California and just wanted to get home.  We were too worn out to explain the mistake and worry about a refund so we took the extra tacos and left.  Not the best experience.  I'd just ask that they maintain the establishment and the customer service a bit better..."}
{"text":"I recommend checking yelp for feedback on this one! Ordered surf and turf burrito - good idea bad execution. Carne Asada w/ shrimp (fried) should be grilled little more al fresco. Not recommending this at all and ordering drive through is a pain!!"}
{"text":"My husband went to get food they were so rude! Got a quesadilla with chicken and it was like they dipped it in grease then fought with him about re making it. Will never return here. The one in Peoria is perfect every time it's sad this one is horrible"}
{"text":"Had my 1st (actually had 4) Kim-chi soft shell taco(s) today  and I am here to tell you, this is the taco for the southwest."}
{"text":"Yup sucks ass... this is the worst del taco ive eaten at based on the taste... beans sucked..,not fresh hella skimpy...one reason i go to del taco is because i hate taco bell and today i felt like i went to taco bell... everytime i go to fast food and theres a latino manager and workers the quality is careless and sucky... sorry but sick of getting crappy ass service and food!"}
{"text":"Del taco is always my number one food choice outside of cooking at home. When I'm in California or Vegas the service is great but as of the last time service was horrible and the front desk did not care at all."}
{"text":"No complaints.  49 cents for a taco in insane, but I'll take it.  Staff was friendly and service was prompt.   A quick lunch for two for less than 6 bucks.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"It's rare to get the right food at the right price made well here. Last time I was here the quesadilla had blue stuff on it which they told me was marker. If you need a del Taco in this neighborhood go to Silverado and LV Blvd. This one is no good."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco, just not this one!!! Once I went to this one and it was BLAZING hot inside probably 86 degrees. I asked them multiple times to turn on the AC and nothing. Finally I told what I think was the owner or manager and he said he would do it. I guess they think the 3rd time is a charm. Another time I went there and had a coupon on my phone. They would not accept it unless it was printed out. Get with the times, everyone has a phone. I then left angrily! They have no play place either. Big draw back. I end up making the drive to one of the ones on Val Vista."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location before but we happened to be driving by. Price was a little more than we expected but we are willing to pay for convenience and today was convenient. Also noticed they have 3 tacos for $1.29 Tuesday's!...that's a great deal. Noticed they have \"Platos\" now. Didn't try it though cause didn't want beans and rice. Anyway, service was super fast, easy and we got exactly what we expected so BAM!"}
{"text":"Seriously, do not bother with this location. Service was very slow and unbelievably RUDE!  Came home with our order of a burnt black cheese quesadilla maybe a sprinkle of cheese inside and 3 soggy chicken soft tacos that had no chicken, too much sauce and wilted old lettuce. Looked as if it had been sitting out for who knows how long. Had I eaten this I'm sure to have gotten sick. I would've thought I was the person who served it me worst enemy.  Tried calling manager and she was just as rude. What's the deal, is there no expectations with businesses anymore?"}
{"text":"I wish there was something lower than one star. I asked for a burrito with no meat and it took then 4 times to get it right. The employees are so stupid at this location. I will never go to this location again. I definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"We come here for the 49cent tacos, but if you're looking for customer service that's above and beyond your expectations, you're barking up the wrong tree. They don't even smile at you. Just saying ;)"}
{"text":"My beloved macho nachos didn't taste the same as I remembered here. The chips were a bit stale. 

Their green chile chicken bowl is pretty good. But you might get the runs soon after. I still like it though since it's a healthier alternative.

Of course, how can you refuse the crunchy taco Tuesday deal. Good junk for the stomach. 

I'm a definite Del taco fan over Taco Bell any day. Oh yeah, cheese cake bites are more like a fried egg roll with cream cheese inside. Not too shabby at all, and much more \"gourmet\" than I had anticipated. It costs a pretty penny though..."}
{"text":"Thursday is 3 chicken soft taco for $2.29. Very good and abundant chicken in each taco. Plus I love their crinckly fries. So a side of medium fries with the 3 tacos under $5. 
Staff very friendly. Restaurant and restroom very clean. Prompt service."}
{"text":"So why 3 stars? Well, we ordered the Epic Chicken Chipotle Burrito and the Epic Carne Asada Burrito. I think I expected Moe's or Qdoba quality for the price. It was more upscale than Taco Bell but not as good as Moe's or Qdoba. Our burritos were decent but just seemed to be lacking in flavor.

On a positive note, the churros were excellent! So if anything, I recommend the warm, cinnamon sugar goodness that their churros bring."}
{"text":"Omg.. Where do i start. Well first off everytime i come to this location it is always a line. About 10 to 15 mins. Service is never that great but tonight was an all time low! I decided to get a del burger which is usually good from the other locations. But this time they gave me just a bun with lettuce and tomato... To my surprise, after i got home and very comfortable mind you, i opened  box to basically nothing. I had to go back to he del taco and complain. Then they didnt even want to give me a refund! THEY complained that i  not bring back my quesadilla! Really guys?! They also refused to give me their names after seeing how upset i was. I dont think ill be going back."}
{"text":"Ran in to use the restroom because we were getting sandwiches at Capriotti's, which does not have a restroom.  There was a grumpy old guy guarding the restroom, who insisted that I buy something.  Ok I get it, they are there to serve food, but I kind of felt pushed into buying something. I got a medium fry to eat with the sub and all I can say is yuck!!  And I'm really a fry junkie, I can't turn them down.  Never had them from del taco before, and I will definitely not do that again.  They were soggy and room temperature. I think a McDonakd's fry that's been under my seat for a month would still taste better."}
{"text":"So what awesome things can I say about Del Taco? Well its cheap! And they have yummy crinkle fries!! So normally when I go I get the number 1. Its 2 classic tacos (minus the tomatoes) some crinkle fries, and I usually get a diet coke or a cherry coke! YUM!!

I've tried some other items, the quesadillas are ok, and the chicken soft tacos are yummy. But if youre like me, simple, but want a little more taco get the classic!! Its only .99 and it has a ton of meat and cheese!!

Its great thats its open late and they have a drive through!! Also, they ALWAYS have coupons!! Alas, I never use them : (

Its cheap, yummy, and something quick when you're hungry : )"}
{"text":"Taco shits? I gotz them!

Ok I know its gross, but I literally got sick from the food here! FYI I'm watching the HBO Beyonce documentary and am starting to feel sick again.

Sooo this place is like a mini Del Taco, the drive through is usually where we go. Its like oddly placed as well. Sometimes the cashier ladies are nice, but mostly theyre not. They have your typical cheap Del Taco fare, and I always go for the fries. Today though, I was feeling like a renegade. I got a small beef taco and a chicken taco. The chicken wasnt like it normally tastes so I think that may have been the culprit.

Word of advice, the drive thru has a sharp turn, so dont mess your car up!"}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch, very fast service and temperature, quality, and preparation of food is alwaysgood!! I like the fact that all the sauces are in baskets right on the table."}
{"text":"This place was decent. It was my fiancés and I first experience and Del Taco, and while some things were, some things were also very Meh. We did the drive through, and sat in our car eating it. One thing that all items had in common were that they just felt heavy with grease. we didn't want to put anything down in the car because it would get grease on it. 

The staff was very nice that we interacted with, and I'm sure if you pick better things, maybe you would enjoy things better. We went because of a coupon we received, but honestly...when I saw it pop up in my places I checked into list on Yelp, I could not remember going here. I jogged my memory, and then remembered we actually did. That's what I think of this place.

I personally will most likely not go back, I just love Taco Bell too much!"}
{"text":"This place completely sucks. Worst Del Taco I have ever been to! Placed my order and the girl taking the order repeated it back so fast. I told her I did not understand what you said and she said \"I got you\". I got you? This is how you talk to customers now? Waited a bit for my food and when I got home the order was completely messed up and items were missing. This is not the first time this happened either. Glad I spend my hard earned money at this place. Stay away, much better out there."}
{"text":"I love their chicken soft tacos!! The best ever. They are good for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Yum."}
{"text":"I usually have a good experience but last week I ordered three burgers and they were all burnt, even the bun!"}
{"text":"Fast food? Tasty? Occasional quick lunch or dinner?  Yes to all these, and the place is clean, to boot. 

The staff is friendly, and helpful - they even asked how many salt packets I wanted, rather than guessing and coming up short.  This I appreciate!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Del Taco nachos but today not so much. I usually get the ground beef nachos and today I decided to try the Carne Asada Nachos.  The Carne Asada tasted like boiled meat. The meat had no seasoning what so ever and wasn't even grilled. The white queso was bland too! I should have taken it back and got something different and I wish I would have.

Unfortunately we don't live anywhere near a Del Taco and when we come home we look forward to eating there. We will hit a different DT before heading back to NC and I will get something else"}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes to get my order.  When I finally got my food items were missing, and the cashier was unapologetic.  But their prices are cheap, and I'm addicted to churros so I'll go back."}
{"text":"It shouldn't take 20 minutes for what I ordered, and when I got my food finally items were missing.  The cashier was also  unapologetic.  But, I love their very cheap prices, and I'm addicted to churros, so sadly, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Worst customers service ever. Trying to take my order before I even get to the intercom and when I do finally got there no one says anything till I say hello and they reply with ya. I'm like wow really."}
{"text":"I already knew when ordering from here that the food would be disgusting. Sure enough my assumption was on point. I ordered a breakfast burrito that had mysterious brown clumps mixed in with the eggs and black charcoal specks all over the tortillas. Enough said. That was it for me. Never again with this nasty ass fast food chain."}
{"text":"Came at about 9pm and I was the only person in the drive thru. That being said, our esteemed Del Taco employee somehow managed to mess up the order despite everything being correct on the receipt. How one does this I am entirely unsure."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab my daughter a quick dinner and asked about a new nacho item. I asked the guy if he knew if the cheese sauce was gluten free (highly unlikely but it never hurts to ask), he didn't know so he asked the manager. The manager went above and beyond finding and reading the ingredients list for me!! Turns out they are not gluten free but I appreciated that they went so far to find out."}
{"text":"I ordered a epic carne asada burrito from this location and what I got was more like an extra large bean and rice burrito that i paid $7.there was a teaspoon a literal teaspoon of guacamole in my burrito and it was all the way at the bottom there was like 5 pieces of steak in the burrito barely any pico de gallo I am very unsatisfied with the service, I would not recommend this location at all. they really need to work on their burrito making skills honestly I just want a refund for my wasted time and money I'm never going to eat this location again."}
{"text":"This place beats Taco Bell in the face with a baseball bat. I have a guilty love for Del Taco and I come in whenever I'm in a hurry or on a road trip. The fish tacos are delicious and truly rival some of the ones I've had from real Mexican places. The other favorite menu item is the Big Fat Steak tacos. They're wrapped in a pita and come with a spicy white sauce and finely shredded cheddar."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how anyone after eating here goes back.  The refried beans here are the worst I've ever eaten, they taste rancid and diseased.  If you really want del taco drive the extra couple miles to 83rd and bell, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"When I eat at Del Taco you would think I would order a taco but think again... I order two cheeseburgers but the key is to have them add jalapenos peppers to the burgers... It is one of my favorite fast food burgers a must try for burger fans."}
{"text":"My family and I have a serious Del taco addiction! However this specific location has made me actually leave a negative review. Which I never do! I am one that utilizes yelp to show the positive reviews because most people only take the time when they are pissed. 

Anyways!!!! EVERY single time I come to this del taco after 8pm I am told that at least one of my items are not available. I usually get the same items and I go at different hours between 8pm and 11pm.
I get told the girl is currently off. There are no shakes and I've even been told their are no fries because they are cleaning the fryer. I run 6 restaurants that are open till 4am. This delta i is 24/7. Why would they clean any equipment during these hours??? This should be done between 3-5am when they are dead. The worst part is they told me they could sale me the meals but I wouldn't have fries, I also wouldn't be discounted and there was no substitution. What kind of bs is that??? 

Anyways I left every time and went to marks st because they are never out of anything and always have what I want. 

Now I start my order at this deal taco by asking what equipment is off or what's unavailable... lol ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Lol super rude and horrible customer service. Pretty much threw the bags of food in our face and said have a good day. Okay, we didn't even pay you yet so thanks for the asshole attitude and free food"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, even though it was crowded. The bathroom was super clean! Which is always a plus! The dining area was super clean and well taken care of, considering that I noticed at least two transients coming in and out of the restaurant. They upgraded their food menu which is actually for the best, and still retaining some of the \"old\" favorites."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! Not sure what Del Taco did to its menu but the replacements are terrible! The Tacos Del Carbon are replaced with Street Tacos. The meat is boiled soggy meat. The onions, seem also boiled and soggy! The Carne Asada burrito...again, boiled soggy meat with seemingly boiled soggy vegetables. FRICKEN DISGUSTING!"}
{"text":"Small staff. Took to long to serve the meal.meals were wrong.  Must be on a a sever portion control."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Del Taco. This review is not not in regards to the franchise but this store.  This is twice in a row now that I feel like they treated me like I was an inconvenience to them using their Drive-Thru.  The first time was with a young lady who just seemed like she wanted to be anyplace but on the other end of the speaker.  Yesterday was much the same with a young man, I will say that once at the window things were a tiny bit better.

I think a bit more training would help with the staff but the food is always fantastic compared to their competitor.  Anywho, food good, staff needs work."}
{"text":"This place rules, the best fries on earth, the cheap tacos are delicious. The staff is great, very polite, the place was spotless."}
{"text":"Compared to all other Del Tacos, this location offers the smallest classic chicken burritos. The customer service is similar to to the chicken burritos - non-attentive and even unfriendly.  For example, I discovered that some of my meals are missing.
So, I went back to the restaurant asking for the missing meals. Instead of saying \"sorry\" and pass me what I just paid for, a worker raised its voice and started arguing with me and blaming me for...cheating!?!?! I received nothing, no matter I asked the supervisor to check the camera records. 
To be honest and fair in my review need to say that the place is clean, the floor is not covered with handkerchiefs and leftovers.  The food here is cheap and tasty.  
The orders are usually ready by the time you finished paying."}
{"text":"Being an OC native, home of Del Taco, I've been hooked on it for a long time.  Love their fries more than all other places with the exception of In-n-out.  Value can't be beat. This location is clean with friendly service."}
{"text":"I hope the Corperate Store Sees this Post because thee kid that they hired in the last few weeks is Costing them Money he continues to Close this Store 45 to 60 min prior to official close and Citing Short Staffed and has to Clean the Lobby FIX THIS NOW!!!"}
{"text":"I like the quality of the food much better than Taco Bell. I went through the drive thru. I clearly asked for 6 sauces, 2 for each taco. Once I drove off I saw where I was only given 3. I had to go back for the other 3. Otherwise my tacos would have been on the dry side. Their meat doesn't have a sauce like Taco Bells does. Also, my shells were cracked. (sad face)"}
{"text":"There's a guy that works over night here. I don't know his name, but it's currently 2:45 AM on Monday 8-01 if that helps. He works the drive thru and I just love him! I work nights and have a limited choice for food when I get off (pretty much McDonald's, del taco, jack n the box) I always come back to deal taco because of him and the chipotle sauce lol! He's just the sweetest guy i don't know how he is so happy at 3 AM every day but I love it! And he's never gotten my super complicated order wrong ever. Anyways, keep up the great work del taco rocks"}
{"text":"The finest Mexican food, will not be found here, but hey you what you were getting into when you walked in to this joint, and if you didn't please contact me, I have some land in Florida I would like to sell you. That being said, this place was pretty good as fast food goes. I signed up for the Del Taco email club, and got a coupon for two free chicken soft tacos. the rest of my order consisted of what felt like 3 pounds of food, and the bill came out to around $5. That my friends is what we call a bargain. So So if its late at night and you have had a touch of the creature, or at least wish you had,stop by and spend a buck or three. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"As far as fast food taco establishments, Del Taco is so reasonable and tasty enough for their prices! They have a generous array of taco sauces to choose from. Pal likes the new turkey taco recipe. This day the cook seemed especially generous with the ingredients. Love the nacho's because it seems every chip is covered with beans, meat, sour cream and cheese. Oh yeah, its topped with a ton of jalapeno's!! Not killer hot, but vinegared perfectly."}
{"text":"My fave location! Always clean and no cutting back on ingredients! In and outdoor seating. There is a drive thru. Easy parking. 

My fave of the taco fast food chains! Like that they have new recipes and seasonal ingredients."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this particular location at 2:30pm was pitiful. All the tables in the restaurant needed wiping, no plastic forks or knives in the bins and they were running low on their sauces on the tables. Had to stand up so many times to get stuff they were out of. Even their iced tea is in the back counter.

Drive slowly in their parking lot as there are a lot of confused, wandering and slow cart pushing people around. Felt relatively unsafe here."}
{"text":"I decided to finally give Del Taco its dues! For someone who worked in Mexico for a year and half and who's a diehard fan of everything Mexican, I always looked somewhat down at such a restaurant chain that can never rival in authenticity with a true Mexican food joint. But today I was in hurry and needed something good, quick, nearby and inexpensive, and I have to say that Del Taco was a perfect solution. Their Epic Carne Asada burrito is very good; and the Epic Chicken Avocado burrito had nice chunks of real avocado and cilantro, although the chicken was a little bland, but still a good burrito. This location in particular has a friendly staff and is well maintained."}
{"text":"Ordered a few burritos through drive through. Checked the bag & wrappers for everything. Arrived home and found out the gave me bean, rice and cheese burritos- what a waste of money and time. Whose making the food in the back and wrapping it wrong- smh"}
{"text":"It was 11pm and we had just gotten back from the PHX airport.  We were on a mission for some late night tacos.  I've never been to a Del Taco before but hey, they're open late, so why not?

Pros: 
- cheap
- open late
- drive through was fast and cashier was friendly
- we got a bunch of coupons and hot sauce

Cons: 
- way too much salt in that beef
- just not that good (I actually think Taco Bell's hard tacos are better... can't believe I said that)
- random person hanging outside of the front door prompted us to use the drive through"}
{"text":"This is the stupidest del taco ever.  They dont let you use more than one coupon even though, coupon clearly says one per person.  They forget to give you the drink, also don't know what extra crispy fries are.   Once we waited 20 minutes for a taco al corbon.  I'm going to write corporate today to complain.  Totally unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Hours are insane. Don't open until 9 am on weekends. Ever hear of \"breakfast burritos?\""}
{"text":"Sometimes I go to restaurants to see if they are like I remember.  Well...this one is just like I remember. Upon our arrival, the Mr Pibb was low on syrup.  After they fixed it, it tasted flat. The iced tea had an earthy flavor to it. The macho burrito we ordered didn't taste right. The meat tasted old. We complained about it. The person behind the counter asked if we wanted it remade. We asked for an alternative order, which they made right away. We appreciated the good customer service. The Double Del Burger was bland but the fries were just like I remembered. 
Overall, this was a forgettable experience and more than likely will return in several years when I have a Del Taco craving."}
{"text":"Usually better than not. We have complicated burrito orders and they tend to get them correct.   They're always polite and friendly.  It's one of our usual haunts."}
{"text":"Another new Manager things running smoothly. Taco Tuesday is always a good value, Check it out. All is well.

{"text":"When it comes down to fast food tacos the choice is clear for me.  This Del taco location is the best in the Mesa area, the crew here always does it right.  The fish tacos are great and the regular beef Del taco reminds me of they way Taco Bell used to be back in the day, more flavorful and more filling."}
{"text":"I ordered 8 double meat tacos for 99 cents each and they gave me the 49 cent tacos...Believe me I called back and the gentleman on the phone was nice and next time I just go in and give them a confirmation # and get my 8 double beef tacos....:) Happy ending or I would have become a rude bitch!"}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible.  Snotty attitude from drive thru attendant.  They never get orders right. Missing items almost every time we've ordered. Done."}
{"text":"I ordered the cane asada burrito. The guac and refried beans inside the burrito had the consistency of liquid. The burrito was advertised to have 3 times the carne asada in it. There was hardly any in it. The chunks of meat I did find in there were overcook and hard to chew. 

I'm sure I would have a better meal in a North Korean prison, and they hardly feed their people. Not looking forward to pissing out of my ass from the internal distress this is most likely going to cause me. 

The only good thing going was the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Maybe you shouldn't tell your customers their orders are less important than the drive they! Every time I've gone here it's gotten worse! No more, bring on Don Tortaco!"}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't waste time reviewing a Del Taco but the sign says open at 7 am and it's literally 8:12 and the doors are locked and nobody is responding at the drive thru despite the fact we can see the person who owns the red Dodge Journey that has been here the whole time... so he opens the door has a damn attitude so I pass.... then re-locks the door as I drive off nice job.... my job would fucking fire my ass but hey I guess all that talk about $15/HR. For fast food workers was never based on quality of work right......"}
{"text":"Waited twelve minutes in the drive-through. Took five minutes to place a three-item order. There were no other customers, either in the drive-through or in the lobby. There were at least two people working. The burger was cold, and squished. I suspect it was old. The fries were cold, soggy, and unsalted."}
{"text":"Nothing too elaborate or profound to speak of here.  Above average \"fast food\" restaurant when you want Mexican food.  Prices are great with many options."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. My father and I had purchased two meals at a Del Taco at Nellis & Craig, and then continued on our journey which took us to Nellis & Stewart. Upon getting back to my fathers car after our errands, We found it wouldn't start (common issue with his vehicle in the heat). So normally He just has to wait for the engine to cool before it can driven again (simply vapor locks). Either way, We took our water bottles into this Del Taco and asked them if we could simply get some water and explained the situation. They told me the water was for paying customers only (I assured them I only wanted water) and even presented my receipt from the other Del taco down the road. She still didn't care and refused me water. In the end, I'm fine with it but she didn't have to have such an attitude. I had even offered for them to fill it if they were concerned about if I was going to take soda, but they just ordered me to leave. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone who's looking to be treated as human. I respect that they may have an issue with people abusing the soda machine in the area but that doesn't mean they should feel empowered to be rude about it. But this is only my opinion so take it at what it's worth to you."}
{"text":"I wish you could give negative stars on here. We've been to this del taco before and they've been slow but never this bad. We stood there at the counter for 10 minutes and were not even acknowledged by anyone working there. The employees filled drive thru order after drive thru order as more and more people got in line and NEVER EVEN HAD AN EMPLOYEE LOOK AT US. It's going to be a very long time before we will eat at any del taco and will  NEVER go back to this location."}
{"text":"You know what's awesome? 

Chili cheese fries for breakfast to nurse a Vegas sized hangover."}
{"text":"This is what the chicken soft taco looks like... ugh nothing there! 
Not worth the little $.. nothing but a tortilla basically.. drive thru was not busy, workers don't care when making your Food"}
{"text":"have run into the manager a couple times. guy treats you like a valued customer and makes you feel good about coming back. reminds me how customers should be treated. still prefer over taco bell, give the fish tacos a try....tasty...."}
{"text":"Since we moved this is the closest Del to the house. Have had positive experiences and of course del taco food is del taco food...not authentic but we prefer over Taco Bell. A couple experiences to share, went by late one evening and the door wasn't locked. The dining room was closed but they let us hang out while they were getting food. Another time we had a bit of a wait and the manager gave us a comp fries because we were cool to them about the wait. One thing I have noticed is now that they have released the app ordering sometimes people place a huge order...or go through the drive thru and do the same. That sort of goofs up their flow for a bit but not really any thing they can do. We eat here often and are yet to have an unfortunate experience. Bottom line, food has always been good, place is new and clean and you know what, even if they are under pressure they will joke with you if you are in a good mood. Cheers..."}
{"text":"Well, I would have given No Stars but I didn't want to penalize the workers who weren't there today. So my friend and I walk in shortly after 11AM for lunch on a Friday afternoon. We proceed to the front counter and stand, waiting for a cashier to come over. No fewer than 5 employees make eye contact during the next 5 to 7 minutes and not one smile is registered, nobody says \"Welcome to Del Taco, somebody will be with you shortly\", nobody says a word to us and nobody changes his or her facial expression. It was almost as if they were hoping that we were illusions. We finally turned as I let out a chuckle and left in disbelief. After almost 30 years working in customer service I am still stunned at the complete lack of giving a poop displayed by these employees. I would let them all go and start over with a new crew and limited hours if that's what it took to get a store that actually seemed to care about customer service. Horrible, horrible service. Three thumbs down if you know what I mean!"}
{"text":"My 5 stars go out to Taylor who was very thorough. She maintained eye contact as we were ordering and entered things very efficiently. She even read the order back to us to ensure everything was correct. She has very good customer service."}
{"text":"Terriable service nasty AF.!! The girl was on the phone that claimed to be the manager with her hand under her shirt itching her self and then would serve me when there was no one here: then she is itching her back and hands me the cups I almost gaged she claimed she had no oinons and was taking to another store or whatever the fuck. The shit was nasty!! NEVER AGAIN!! no wonder no one ever comes here"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food place EVER. This particular Del Taco did not disappoint either. I always order a bean burrito with extra cheese and extra red sauce. Every once in a while they don't put enough on but this Del taco did. I was very happy."}
{"text":"Thanks for the sour cream fries in place of the deluxe chili cheese fries I ordered..."}
{"text":"Just about the worst Del Taco I have been to ever.

Unfortunately this Del Taco is directly across the street from my housing complex. Moving in, I thought, hurray -- when I want greasy tacos and the morose feeling that comes with eating fast food, I'll go here!

I'm being facetious - kind of - but I have actually enjoyed Del Taco in the past. The tacos aren't terrible and are usually quite cheap. Quesadillas usually have lots of cheese and the spicy chicken burrito is one of my fave indulgences.

BUT my husband and I came here on a week night and sat in the drive-thru FOREVER. On top of our horrendous wait we got sub-par food (even for fast food standards). My chicken burrito was half-filled and barely warm. I asked for a crunchy taco in place of what was a soft taco in a combo meal, and they gave me - nothing! Yes, nothing. They just didn't bother to give me the crunchy taco I asked for.

Very bad experience here. Oh, but they do give a GOOD military discount."}
{"text":"Del Taco is always a great cheap and quick meal. It's always fast, usually no real wait unless it's taco Tuesday and even then I'd say they are able to able you pretty fast. I've been eating at Del Tacos as long as I can remember growing up in Southern California...back when it was originally called Naugles. This Del Taco falls short of the great ones for example in Barstow California or even in Blythe, Ca. I hate that the Del Tacos here do not make Taco Salads or even know what they are anymore. Their buck menu is great and the 1/2 lb bean and cheese burritos will fill you up quick. My new favorite are the street tacos, but they are a bit pricy for what you end up with. I wish they'd bring back the classic tacos. Overall three stars is all I can do for lack of customer service and every time I come there is usually something left out of the bag."}
{"text":"There's not too much to say about this place . It's your basic fast food if you're looking for a cheep lunch. Growing up in California Del Taco is a staple. You can't go wrong with Red Burrito, classic tacos, or my favorite chili cheese fries. The service here usually lacks, but today we had the nicest woman help us in the drive thru."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco. Some think that's crazy, but I've been eating at Del Taco since I was a kid growing up in California all the way back to when it was originally named Naugels. I was put off for a second by the reviews, but decided to give it a chance anyway. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a smile and a hello. We ordered quite a bit of food and sat down. It was very clean inside. All the hot sauce containers were filled on every table which never happens at any of the other Del Tacos I frequent. Our food was out within minutes and everything tasted great. The tortilla shells were soft and the tacos were filled to the brim. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Super fast thank goodness because I'm starving today. No one in the drive thru made it easy for me to get in and out on my way home from the office. Great service as well."}
{"text":"New menu has everything a the family could want. Burgers and Mexican WOW!
Super clean friendly staff can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Del Taco in a while. I will not be returning to this location any time soon. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito with no red sauce and hash brown sticks. My burrito had no bacon but it did have red sauce. What a disappointment. We all know bacon is the best part."}
{"text":"just had to make stop for quick bite to go on road back to LA

I know it's only fast food and just a Del Taco, but it's close and convenient
I do like their chicken soft tacos, pretty good and inexpensive

I like them a lot better than competitor Taco Bell, but guess that's just like McDonalds vs Carls vs Burger King, right?

they have added quite a few new menu items, but I usually stick to the basic tacos here.....why change if you like something!

still prefer red sauce vs all their newer hotter varieties, again, if it ain't broke, why fix it!

they still have taco Tuesdays and chicken soft taco Thursdays too, YAY!
even those of us without EBT can afford that!"}
{"text":"Just went to the drive thur, I ordered a chicken cheddar and a chicken spicy pepper jack quesadillas and got no chicken is both of them. Disappointed. 

And there Yelp account has no phone number to contact."}
{"text":"So far every time I've been here I've gotten very quick, pleasant and responsive service. Food here is pretty good, even considering it's fast food. And in addition to that, it's cheap. To me, the Mexican food here is better than Taco Bell. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Wish Yelp had a worse rating then one, as this Del Taco location would get it. Saturday night, no one in the drive thru except me. I would be a little forgiving if they had been busy. COLD double del burger with enough thousand island for 4 or 5 burgers.  Cold burnt fries and crappy service from some dude name Regina. No napkins or reciept.
Do your self a favor and steer clear of this place and go somewhere else where at least the employees might somewhat care about thier job.."}
{"text":"Went in today 7/28/17 ordered my favorite meal 2 for $5 carnitas burritos! Huge upset burritos were nothing but cheese and they sprinkled berly any meat on it will never go back took for ever on my order really bad service also full of bums place is smelly!!! Bathroom is dirty as hell"}
{"text":"The meat was hard and disgusting. Definitely not like they used to be. I loved the carne asada flatbread.  The sauce was amazing. I would never  try this again.  It was that gross."}
{"text":"The WORST Del Taco Ever!!! They didn't even wrap my burrito.  The thing flew all over my car!!! Total waste of money.  Couldn't even eat it!!"}
{"text":"I'm annoyed. I LOVE Del Taco. It wins by a mile over Taco Bell and the like.

FOOD: Mexican-American. Tacos, burritos, and nachos all mixed in with hamburgers and fries. Confusing, yes. I love their Macho Nachos best of all, they have great toppings (unlike typical \"fast food nachos\") and the serving is ample. 

PRICE: slighlty above your average fast-food joint. They do have a 99 cent menu, but not much on it. Most of the combo meals are in the range of $6-7. 

SERVICE: ohhhh boy. Here it comes. I went through the drive through one night, craving some Macho Nachos. I ordered and the cashier didn't repeat my order back to me (which I thought was weird). I get up to the window and I'm waiting and waiting. My car idled so long I thought I'd run out of gas. What takes so long? It's nachos... The cashier guy collects my money and hands me a small bag. Now, these nachos are big and couldn't have possibly fit in this puny bag. I opened it up and sure enough, there are two TACOS and an order of fries inside. I politely say, \"I didn't order this. I ordered nachos.\" The guy replies... get this...\"NO, you ordered fish TACOS.\" I'm pretty sure I know what I ordered. I only order fish tacos south of the border. I would never order them from a fast food joint. I protested, but he wouldn't back down. He never offered to change my order to nachos. I drove away with my fish tacos. And they weren't that great. No flavoring, completely bland. Nice crunch , but no spice or flavor. It was like eating packing peanuts. But the fries were ok.

I'm annoyed that their customer service sucks. For this very reason I'm boycotting this location and will pout until someone freakin sends me a coupon for Macho Nachos. Hmph. :)"}
{"text":"I like del taco in general but this location struggles a  lot. I ask to please make the food is hot and fresh...  Putting the fries back if the oil does not make them fresh.  I know this because the fries (be it hot) they are crunchy and hollow inside.  I'm lucky if the fry container is 75% full.  The stale tortillas make for a leaky burrito.  The lunch time manager who I have seen many times is more concerned about getting you in/out fast than the quality of the food.

So an update today 10/13...  I ask for a steak, egg and cheese burrito.  Extra cheese. Large fry.  When I'm handed the bag, I reach in and feel a fairly large burrito!  I conformed with the girl my order.  She said yes plus the burrito had sauce.  Ok.  I drive out and reach for a fry to eat...  no fries!!!  I drive around again stating she forgot the fries and I again confirm my burrito has only steak, egg and cheese.  She said yes.  This is what I got!  See photo!  I'm over it."}
{"text":"its del taco.  the food was alright but ive had better.. prices are higher which is a given. service was good. ehhh good place to get late night food or a quick cheaper lunch. =/"}
{"text":"Okay it's a fast food joint, but Del Taco saved me a lot of headaches by offering free wireless service! I left my cellphone at my friend's apartment and couldn't remember my lawyer's phone number. 
All I had was my i-touch device, so I opened up the wi-fi settings to look for wi-fi in the area and lo' and behold there appeared Del Taco. 
Cool Beans! 
I pulled over, ordered a healthy burrito and used their free Internet service to google my lawyer's address. 
Yes. I'd hate to admit it, but I'm a fan. But seriously they need to clean their bathrooms. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"It's not a 4 or 5 star place, but the girl behind the counter was very sweet, shy, but very sweet and the food was actually delicious! For a del taco I was impressed! It actually seemed like the lady makeing the food cared a little bit about what she was doing! Don't get me wrong. The place is a dive but I would eat here again!!"}
{"text":"the real strawberry lemonade isnt real and there food is aways cold its soooo nasty!!!!! i dont know why but maybe they leave it sitting there ready, i will go to the other location the foood is fresh and hot there this place is grossss"}
{"text":"Let's face it, I go to Vegas at least twice a year sometimes more, sometimes more than that...but there are a few places i absolutely MUST hit while I'm there---and strangely enough, this is one of them.  Why you ask?..It's just a lowly fast food taco joint in a food court.  Call it nostalgia, call it late night drinking hunger, call it your rebound hangover food---whatever you call it---just make sure it's in my belly.  Del Taco is a unique joint in that it is a marriage of two great types of food into one spot.  It's like going to a taco bell/kfc---you get the best of both worlds in one location.  A fast food mexican menu + a fast food burger menu = a great opportunity to chow down.  Don't get me wrong---the food I've had here is always on point---hard shell tacos are my thing, and I can down a good plenty of them here.  They use a slightly larger hard shell with just the right amount of fixins and their hot sauce is actually..dare I say--hot.  What really wins me over is their choice of fries--crinkle cut...which weighs in highly on my list.  What's more is that they're 24 hours.  In case you didn't catch that the first time, yes, I said 24 HOURS....meaning you can go anytime Stomach has a craving---granted you can get there---but an easy walk as it's located right on the strip near MGM.  I beg you, nay, I IMPLORE you...if you like tacos and you like Vegas--give this spot a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Slowest. Drive-thru. Ever. 

I'll never come back. It literally took me 15 minutes to get through the drive through and there were only three of us in line. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Compared with other del tacos this one is really good. always friendly service. I sometimes have to wait quite a while for my food but In their defense I do often order a lot for my whole family. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Our cashier, Deandre, took 15-20 mins to take our order (no one else was in line. It was 3 am) i don't know where he was at but there is no excuse. Even the cook was embarrassed and took our order before the cashier took our order so at least it would be ready quickly. When the cashier finally got back to take our order , we did not receive a apology for the wait  , a greeting , a f-ing hello . He asked the cook what did we order (didn't ask us) and all he said to us , literally , was \"$6.50\" . When we finally paid , he didn't say thank you or ANYTHING. I know this isn't a 5 star place but at least have some manners. Get it together."}
{"text":"Had our receipt showed that they did not add a soft taco. Manager came out and wanted us to show him the soft tacos he gave us. We showed him the amount and he refused to give us the soft taco that we paid for. For a manager to actively walk to our vehicle and ask for us to show him all the items is a bit much. We had our receipt, we paid for the item. Been here previous times, they always forget to pack something. Manager who refused to give us the soft taco is named Heraurdo."}
{"text":"Usually this place is a go-to because the price is right and the food is pretty good, but lately the food has been getting sloppy. The service is good but the food lacks consistency. I just got some food in the drive-thru and there was burnt grill stuff on my quesadilla. If they don't get it together I'm going to have to find a new late night place to eat. I'm only giving 3 stars because the service is always good."}
{"text":"Listen, I don't know anyone who goes to Del Taco over other food choices. I mean, given the choice between other food places and DT, I'm probs gonna pick the other food places. This location is convenient for me because it is about two minutes from my house, but is this place worth the drive otherwise...?

The last two times I've gone to Del Taco, I've gotten the fish taco combo. Seriously, it's the only reason this place is getting three stars and not two. Speaking exclusively about the fish tacos -- great. I mean, really good given the price point. No complaints at all. I almost want to drive over there right now just for that. NOM. Why they think it's smart to serve french fries with fish tacos is beyond me, though. Everything else I've ever gotten there? Meh. Like you get it and you eat it because you're hungry and you're in a time crunch, but it's not like it's amazing. It's ok. 

The service here has never been bad. It's good and quick, so no complaints there. The place, also, isn't dirty or anything. So no complaints there, either. 

All in all, this place isn't bad. Some of the food will leave you wanting for more (in terms of delicious, not volume) but the fish tacos, I think, are totally good. Get them."}
{"text":"Their burger is the best thing on the menu. I think. All menu items are decent and because it was my first time, armed with a company card, I tried to try as much as I could. Good stuff. Taco Bell is better, if there is a way to distinguish poop from poo. 

I like Taco Bell better than Dell Taco. But Del Taco has an awesome cheap burger! Who wins?!

You decide."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is Taco Bell and not Del Taco. Because this is the worst Del Taco ever. I have been 3 times and they have struck out on receiving my services again... Until I see better Yelp reviews. The wait is always over 10 minutes long and they don't put anything in the tacos. I even ask for extra lettuce and they put in even less lettuce just to spite me. 
I have been to the 1st Del Taco restaurant in Barstow and over 100 Del Taco's from the states of California, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada. Every Del Taco I have ever gone to has the most incredible 10 star customer service. I will literally be still paying for my tacos and they are already giving me tacos with tons of extra lettuce, cheese and meat! 
I love Del Taco... But this 1 Del Taco I am convinced is secretly run by Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Slow service. People who arrived after I ordered received their food before me. I watched half of my order sit for 5 minutes before someone noticed I was staring at the food on the tray. Only then did they offer the food that was sitting there getting cold while I wait for the rest. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly. Food is always hot and fresh... For fast food. One of the few 24 hour late night options in the valley unless you want one of the \"Berto's\" or Amado's which personally I find not any better than fast food. So when nothing else is opened, Del Taco it is. Only critique I will say is that every time I have went there late night, their drive-through is extremely slow.  That part definitely could use some work."}
{"text":"Been visiting this location for about 3 years. Normally, the staff at this location is great. Tonight, however, very different. I went through the drive thru and the woman immediately had an attitude, scoffing when she found it hard to hear my order. I'm sorry you work for Del Taco, but this is your job. Treat your customers with respect from start to finish for the sake of your company and your pay check. A note to the manager, perhaps make sure the person taking the orders for the drive thru gets some customer service training."}
{"text":"This is the only place that I know of that I can get turkey tacos. The food is actually good, but you can NEVER leave without checking your food. We have only been 1 time when the food wasn't messed up or something wasn't left out. It's a pain to have to unwrap and take everything out of the bag before driving away, but that's the only guarantee you're going to get what you ordered. The French fries and nacho cheese sauce, and the Carmel cheesecake bite things are worth the hassle. If the employees cared just a little more about the customers it would be great. But, it's a fast food taco joint with decent food so I will keep going back to get my fix."}
{"text":"This is the best Del Taco in Las Vegas! The service is always great and the food is always hot and fresh. The only complaint is that it is in the flight path of the airport so occasionally a 747 will fly overhead and make your drink shake..."}
{"text":"Oh I forgot David and matt always get it right thanks guys"}
{"text":"Not real authentic tacos. Just ok. I mean, what do you expect from a fast food chain. Way too understaffed. Made a mistake for my order. The cashier was in the middle if taking my order then say to wait a minute and went to the drive thru to finish their order. Then came back in a couple mins. The cook was fast but too fast. Needs to take a bit more time into making correct orders."}
{"text":"i loved del taco at one point but it seems like the tacos have gone way down hill idk what it is..."}
{"text":"24 hours and burges and chicken soft tacos and chili cheese fries! No complaints. Its hard not to stop after a night of alcohol and drive right by Del Taco."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours! The chicken soft tacos are great and so is the double del with chili cheese fries. Never really had something else.

But a late night with a bit of alcohol, Del Taco hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here to A Del Taco in awhile.. Glad I stopped in as I was hungry & in a hurry.. They got 2 Classic Burritos for $5! Got the 8-Layer veggie & Spicy grilled chicken burrito. Smashed them both & was good size & hella good! This place is clean & the workers behind the counter are all on point & friendly! Don't know why they have a low star rating but It's way better than the ratings!"}

{"text":"Can't help it, I love their chicken tacos! This location is usually pretty empty, so the drive thru goes quick. I hate that their hours have changed from 24-hours, but I understand. Why stay open when you have no customers? Lol."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst experience I have ever had at this location.   My order was simple two tacos with extra cheese. I got extra cheese alright but no meat. This is very unacceptable and sad that now we have to check our order before we even walk out the restaurant."}
{"text":"What I wanted to order was unavailable, but I was offered 10% off for the inconvenience without even asking.  To me that's great customer service! And it made me not so upset...Thanks Christopher!"}

{"text":"How is this place still open? 

We decided to try them since we don't have them in nyc. Biggest mistake. It was our last day and we decided to have dinner there. Big mistake!!! I had the shrimp taco combo platter, which I assumed it came with chips like in the picture, I guess not. Rice was a weird consistency, it felt like plastic, the taste was super bland. The retried beans tasted old and the portion was super tiny. I felt sick instantly after trying my refried beans, which is not good considering I have stomach issues and was boarding a plane in 2 hours. I don't even remember what kind of tacos my boyfriend had but the avocado was already turning rotten and he also got sick instantly, and his stomach is a brick house. We didn't even finish our food, we literally ate our tacos and left. NEVER AGAIN!!! It's not wonder they were empty and Taco Bell is growing. I will never betray the bell again. 

Also the bathrooms were disgusting, I literally opened the door and didn't even walk in it was so bad. I had to hold it and drive to a casino to go. 

Bottom line, if you like fresh food, decent portions, and a clean bathroom, don't go here."}
{"text":"So if a customer orders a nacho and a small soda but you ran out of small and medium cups, why in the world would you think it's ok to charge me for a large soda?? 
The drive through is only 4 cars deep. Acting like it's wrapped around the building.. lol..instead of yelling at your coworkers/employees,help out a little.. piss poor service, crappie attitude and quality of food.. pretty hard to screw up nachos!"}
{"text":"Yes, when I want some quick hot cheap food, I go here.  I love their fries!  OMG!  I get suckered in every time.  Their chicken soft tacos are the BOMB!  Their iced coffees are good too.

Open 24 hours!  Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"The food here is always really fresh and tastes just as good if not better than Taco Bell! The staff is always friendly and the service is fast and efficient! I always order a ton of tacos and quesadillas and this place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Never have I been to a Del taco that's so friendly and inviting! The food is hearty and flavorful, they never skimp! Destin and Jamar make this place very fun and treat me very well each time!"}
{"text":"Always fast and thorough at this location. Food is what you expect from a Del Taco. No complaints. Consistent location."}
{"text":"Oh Del Taco, when I lived in California you were a saviour for those late night munching feasts..

And you prove to be the same for those late night Las Vegas nights on the drive back from the casino to our hotel.. I love you chicken burrito WITH special sauce and your crinkle fries.. And don't forget the Mr. Pibb! Sigh.."}
{"text":"If I'm craving a dirt cheap bean and cheese burrito than I ALWAYS come here.  Their beans are made from scratch and you can taste the difference.   Just head over to taco bell after eating a burrito here and you'll never go back to that nasty place again."}
{"text":"This Del Taco is possibly the best location I have been to in Arizona. Their customer service is fast and friendly. Also, the seating area is kept clean and wiped down. If you haven't tried the new mini shakes, you're missing out! They're only a $1 for such deliciousness, so be sure to add one to your order. Overall, the family enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Drive thru staff usually nice.
- What you get of your order is usually right.

Cons:
-Actually getting all of your food is a continual problem. Whether they are busy or not. Oddly, they never forget to charge me for the food they subsequently forget to give me.
- Their iced tea is horrifically bad. I can't decide if it tastes like cleaning solution, like it went bad two weeks ago, or like it hasn't been cleaned in 6 months. This specific location is one of the few places I will NEVER EVER get another iced tea ever again, because it is ALWAYS so so bad.
- Portions are a crapshoot. Case in point, see photos of my fries from tonight... That was it. I hadn't eaten any yet, there were no bagglers, nada. Don't worry. They also totally forgot two things out of my order to boot.

2 pros, 3 cons. 2 out of 5 stars, I guess? Too generous? Probably."}
{"text":"The worst drive-thru! I've come here on several occasions and each time I've had to wait for at least 20 minutes for my food. I feel like I've been hijacked into this line . No Escape . The slowest service ever!"}
{"text":"I surrendered the idea that I was getting any help today as the disgruntled work-shy employees meandered carelessly. What a waste of a good business location. If Del Taco continues to hire the  'sense of entitlement' employees I expect another fast food company will make better use of the building in the near future."}
{"text":"Walked in in the morning and nobody was there. I waited at the register for someone to come out and nobody did for about 3 minutes. Nobody was I  sight so I thought maybe they were busy throwing away trash or something. Then I saw the silhouette of someone through their one sided mirror. I walked out, I wasn't going to pay money for what most likely was going to be poorly prepared food."}
{"text":"I much prefer this place to taco Bell hands down. This particular location, food is still good just don't forget to check your bag, you might not leave with everything you ordered"}
{"text":"This review focuses on the shrimp & fries meal:

Just now I ate here. I was not impressed. I just got off work, and was running errands at McCarren Center. I was hungry and exhausted, and could not wait out the walk to the Walmart McDonald's.
  So there in front of me was a Del Taco sign promoting a shrimp and fries meal. I can tell you that this was in reality average tasting fries with a few small fried shrimp. I should have taken a picture of it. As far as taste, I rate it on a par with a frozen dinner. 
  I have been to Del Taco in the past. In my opinion their cheeseburger is tasty. In general I will eat here when I get in the mood for their cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Del Taco is a fast food chain that serves American style Mexican cuisine. It has been serving delicious American style Mexican cuisine since Ed Hackbarth opened the first Del Taco in Yermo, California just east of Barstow on September 16, 1964. Fifty years later, if you were to drive approximately 140 miles from the first Del Taco up I-15, then east on I-215, and north on Pecos Road there is a Del Taco that keeps the name going strong. I will share my experiences at this location. 

   This Del Taco is located at the busy Green Valley crossroads of Pecos Road and Windmill Parkway. I often drive by it. However, it was hiking that led me inside the building. This very Del Taco is also a hop and a skip from the Pittman Wash Trail. As a matter of fact, the large parking lot it shares with other businesses is where I separated from my car for a couple of hours. After hiking the Pittman Wash Trail I thanked Del Taco for the complimentary trailhead parking by making it my choice for the post-hike dinner. 

   Del Taco is more than just tacos. They serve a fantastic cheeseburger that is severely underrated. I walked inside the building expecting to order their mutant cheeseburger, take a picture then spread the word about it in my Yelp review. That didn't happen. If I had visited on any day but Taco Tuesday this would be a different review. There on the door was the advertisement announcing three tacos for $1.29 on Tuesday from 3 to 11 P.M. I'd celebrate Taco Tuesday and add a small Coke and medium fries that added up to less than a $5 bill. 

   The man working at the counter was friendly. He greeted me and was the first impression of this location. My second impression was the cleanliness of the large restaurant. This is the first Del Taco where I saw the Taco sauces and ketchup packets stored on little plates on every table. 

  Immediately after ordering I took my small soda cup to the Coke fountain. The deal with Del Taco drink sizes is they are Big. Here small means medium and large means super sized. This isn't one of the fast food restaurants where a small cup is a step above a water cup. The fountains where you fill the cups are Coke products including Coke Zero. 

  Around five minutes later, I'd pick up the food. The three hard shell tacos were tasty and filling. I topped them off with the Del Inferno sauce. As far as spiciness 2  stars. With the three tacos, I'd enjoy the crinkle cut fries. The fries were good, however, in my opinion Nathan's Famous is the King of crinkle cut fries. 

  I enjoyed Taco Tuesday so much that I returned to this location a couple of Tuesdays later. It's that good that I just might return here at a later Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Del Taco is more than just tacos. Del Taco also serves a good double cheeseburger called the Double Del. Several hours into a hike on the Las Vegas Strip taking in the Christmas decorations that took me from Mandalay Bay all the way north into the Fashion Show Mall and back, it was time to get off the trail and enjoy a quick bite. 

    This Del Taco is the only location on the Las Vegas Strip (as of 12/27/2015). It is located upstairs in the Showcase Mall Food Court. This is a popular food court that frequently fills up with people. By the time I reached the Showcase Mall I was hungry. I was undecided on the food court's Panda Express, Wendy's, Popeyes, and Subway. When I saw nobody on line it was a spontaneous decision to make my ultimate meal of 2015 on the Las Vegas Strip Del Taco. For years I was cognizant that they serve the underrated Del Double burger. 

     The woman that took my order was friendly. So was the price. The Del Double Value Meal (number 4) with  fries and fountain Coke up sized to medium came out to $7.35. This is a similar price that I have paid in the local Del Taco locations. Kudos to Del Taco for not price gouging. 

    Fortunately there were a few available tables. More fortunately this was a good fast food experience. The double cheeseburger did the job. What is unusual about the sandwich is that the tomato was in the of the meat on the bottom bun. With that flaw aside, the double cheeseburger featured the right amount of chopped onions, cheese, and flavor. The cup of fries was a good but not spectacular tasting compliment to the sandwich. 

  Del Taco is more than just tacos but less than some of the new generation fast food chains such as Shake Shack just across the street. Following hours of walking on the Las Vegas Strip, a quick Del Double combo accomplished the job of satisfying my appetite."}
{"text":"Props to this location for being friendly and timely with our food @2am this morning. I had a car full of 5 inebriated friends who made it a little difficult to order our mountain of food, but they handled it very professionally and without that attitude everyone at 2am seems to have. Also, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This Del Taco is awesome! I usually go once a month to satisfy my craving and get the cheesy deal. For $4 and change its pretty good! The quesadillas are on the greasy side but not bad. I've always gotten good service sit-in (seeing their employees eat here during their break is a reassuring feeling) and through the drive-thru. Plus their churros are my fave, hands down."}
{"text":"Their jumbo shrimp tacos are pretty bomb. Christian the order taker made my late night drive thru such a fun one...\"just throw it in the bag\" lol"}
{"text":"Worst exerpience I have ever had at a fast food place. Not only was it almost a 10 min wait to order in the drive thru with only 2 cars ahead of me but then they have me park the car out front and say they will bring it to me. I can understand if there is other cars behind me that have small orders so they can keep the flow going, but there wasn't any. I had to wait for 25 mins for them to bring out my food. I will never come back here again unless I bring a book with me to read while I wait for thus food to come out"}
{"text":"Don't get the so called epic carne Asada burrito. Added cheese and sour cream and had light salsa on it. However, no cheese was on it. Barely any meat. Had I not been so lazy I would've went to Roberto's but no drive-through. Waste of money"}
{"text":"I go to del taco mainly for the heavenly caramel cheesecake bites and steak street tacos! That's it. Lol. This is the location I go to most of the time since it's the closest to my house. 

Drive thru customer service is always good. That being said, it's a hi-order-pay-bye service. Not so much interaction at the drive thru, and I don't mind! As long as they don't mess up my taco and my cheesecake bites, im good! =P"}
{"text":"My friend Robert Ponce the said this some nasty ass food and we some some ghost activity wack ass place"}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would!! We decided to try this place out for the first time and when we ordered our food the person that was taking our order was in such a hurry to get to us to finish.. We arrived at the window and there was no service for about 3 min. The guy came to grab my card from me to pay and gave us our food. Once he was done he closed the window and walked away. No \"Thank you\" or anything!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Will not be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a try. I love Taco Bell and heard this place was comparable. Well, I think I'll stick with Taco Bell. At del taco you have to order sour cream and pay extra on your taco. The quesadilla was a greasy mess, the tacos were bland and their sauces definitely have nothing on taco bell's. 

For fast food and the cost. Stick to what you know. This isn't my place to go."}
{"text":"Worst Del Taco. Rude staff. Wanted to have 2 separate orders but Josh who was working the drive thru said they could not do that since \"they still have to clean and only have an hour left, there's no time.\" This is a 24 hr location so that reasoning made no sense at all."}
{"text":"I hate to be the one to write a negative review . However, it is necessary to do it. I've been here 3 times and all those 3 times I have  waited way to long to get my food. Not to mention it is cold by the time I get it. Also the staff seams to be lacking training they are all over the place and not as efficient as other Del Tacos. And lastly the food is not consistent with the other Del Tacos in town . I really hope they get it together soon."}
{"text":"I always have issues with the drive thru, wrong order, not greeted in timely manner, overcharged, it's always something. The inside is great though."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Yes it's cheap but you get what you pay for. Actually, you get LESS than you pay for here. The mini bacon quesadilla is inedible.  And def MINI. 

The rice burrito w green sauce had no green sauce.

The 'half pound' bean burrito was 50% tortilla.

While the 'inferno' sauce does in fact pack heat, it contains HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP as the 2nd ingredient. Shame."}
{"text":"Regular retail price $7.50. Paid $0! Totally free!!! It was hot outside so I drank most of my free birthday shake on the drive back to work, had to do two transactions to use both my birthday shake coupon and my two free tacos coupon. The service was fast and at par in friendliness with other fast food places in the area. The food is what I consider to be four stars, it wasn't anything special and if it was not free I would not have tried this place otherwise."}
{"text":"Yes, I'll be honest - you'd really have to screw the pooch for me to mark down a Del Taco.  And while my chicken quesadilla lacked chicken, the matter was promptly corrected, and the cheese-only offered up to keep (for the kid, use as a frisbee, whatever).

Restaurant was tidy for a hair past the lunch hour and across from a UNLV campus, restrooms were clean (singles, but not a big deal), and with full tummies and a topped off soda, we were off to take the Dependent to M&M World."}
{"text":"I like coming here, the customer service has always been amazing. The food is good, everything we have tried is always good. My favorites are the carne asada fries and the sweet cream churros."}
{"text":"Kid / man at drive through (must be same as below) called me names under his breath? Countless others have had same / similar experiences and reported it, yet he stays? Unbelievable! Write CORPORATE or complain to BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.  The end must be near for this location. Saw the one at superstition go under years ago......"}
{"text":"For about the prior year, this Del Taco went through a phase of being pretty awesome in a sleazy way. My orders were correct, the tacos were filled with meat and cheese that's better than a certain bell-themed rival, my burritos ordered with green sauce actually came with green sauce 90% of the time, the service was fast, and so I started coming here a lot, as by fast food standards, this was excellent food on the cheap. I was almost at the point of adding a few stars for improvement when...

They put Sneering Boy on the register. Sneering Boy is too good for this. Sneering Boy is too good for you. Sneering Boy won't make eye contact, enters orders wrong, and very openly believes all customers are here to rip off the place. Unless you like your cheap tacos with a side of judgment and some mistakes, move on, move on."}
{"text":"I just left there and I'm upset not only did they mess my order up but the person that took my order had no idea they had a veggie burrito .. furthermore I order a small fry. Can I get more then 5 fries please!! At the Del Taco on Tatum where I live they at least fill the bag up!! This is terrible the manager should review who they hire. Also the person didn't wear gloves who bagged my order, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"After tonight, f--- del taco! First of all, the workers were acting sketchy right off the bat.. After buying my meal, i get half way through when i bite into a nice big piece of hair! So i call the location about 3-4 times, no voicemail available or anything, probably shaving someone's head for the next person who orders some food.. I will never go to this place again"}
{"text":"They take wayyyyy to long. They need more staff members or quicker people. Every time I come it's slow. I'm not kidding, there was a whole line of people. That would've made me hurry up a little."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I don't care what time I go to this place, day or night, I'm always greeted and asked how I'm doing. They have yet to break the routine. As I mentioned yesterday, most places I go to say, \"Go head with yo order.\" I never get greeted at the other places. This place has my respect for being different.

I've never eaten a full meal from this place. If I do eat here, I'll grab a quick burrito or a few chicken tacos or even a order of Jalapeño Potato Poppers. I've had different experiences with the food. I can't say that I've consistently had good or bad food.

The Chicken Tacos are decent. I really enjoy them when I get them for a little of nothing, on Thursday. They're nothing special but they do hit the spot from time to time. I like them a lot better than the ones at Roberto's Taco Shop, but me cooking them, trumps all.

The Potato Poppers are usually pretty good. They usually serve them hot and fresh, but recently I had an issue where they gave me a order that was burnt and cold. They were horrible. I haven't ordered any since.

When they did give me the terrible Poppers, I took them back in to get my money back. I noticed that there were only 2 people working. I guess that's why the food was mediocre that day. Maybe they were overwhelmed.

I am here daily for drinks though. I love how large the large drinks are. The cups are extremely flimsy, but they are huge, nonetheless. I can also appreciate that they are only $1 too. I will never go to McDonalds for drinks if they keep them at $1. That, I am a fan of!

This place was already added to my, \"Greet me kindly, Greet me Daily\" list."}
{"text":"This is a horrible Del Taco. I have been here three times, just to see if it was bad luck, bad timing or just bad food. It is just bad food. Blah. I'm not allowed to go there anymore."}
{"text":"Owner you need to QC the evening shift. Fries are always cold today I went inside ordered my food got home. Everything was cold and gross. I'm tired of having to drive to Signal Butte to get good Del. Please address this issue and I will change the rating and praise you."}
{"text":"I ordered a bean burrito with no cheese and they messed it up.  I even repeated the order and STILL got cheese.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to eat it and had to figure something else out.  What a waste of money and time.  They need to pay attention when people are placing orders!  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I eat at Del Taco for the Taco Tuesday specials during my work week. The staff are busy with orders, and the staff assisting at the counter warm up after the order is placed, which is a bit backward to the way service should go. Staff should be trained on customer relations specifically that they engage at the first moment of contact not the delay that I have experienced on at least 3 occasions. The kitchen staff crank out orders constantly during the times that I visit. With the way the store is managed there is not a sense that their is a clear division of responsibilities, in other words, a lot of people working and doing a variety of jobs, rather than a lot of people working with clearly defined responsibilities.  This does make a difference in how cleanly a fast food restaurant feels to the customers.  The reason they get 2 stars are their bathrooms, they are sub par, and the Del Taco corporation should take action to update them across the board if they are all as sub standard as this one.  Del Taco has an excellent product line, and the food is respectable.  As far as how they measure up to their competition they have a tremendous opportunity to excel beyond their competitors when they invest in bathroom and facilities modernization.  I look forward to seeing them advance to the 3 and 4 star rating in the future when the corporation takes this much needed step in their corporate operations."}
{"text":"Don't advertise that you have a 24 hour drive thru and not be open at 11:00pm. This location lost a customer for sure!"}
{"text":"The last review I wrote was for Pane Bianco... now I move on to DEL TACO, cuz that's just the type of guy that I am! 
Why 4 stars for Del Taco? For a chain taco joint, the taste, value, and service are unbeatable. 39c tacos, everyday! That's less than $4 for 10 tacos!! Quite the meal if you're broke! I've always loved the Del Classic Chicken Burritos, as well as the chicken soft tacos too. There are always spectacular deals, and the staff members at this location are particularly friendly and efficient. Also, this location is much cleaner than other Del Taco's I've experienced!"}
{"text":"Worst Del Taco in the city!  Their iced tea smells and tastes like sewer water.  You are lucky if you get what you actually ordered. We went through the drive thru today and out of 4 items ordered we got one correct, one was missing, and when I pointed this out the employee argued with me about what I ordered vs. what she bothered to key in. She also refused to give me my receipt so I couldn't even do the survey to say she sucked.  Go to a different location, avoid this one."}
{"text":"Well this definitely doesn't look like much from the outside but I can say this is better than Taco Bell! Enjoyed the spicy chicken quesadillas and chicken taco. Has a little kick to it, but nothing that us too spicy and won't make your nose run.  Great place to grab a quick, but enjoyable, meal!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst location. Just ate there it was so old and disgusting and i was so hungry...i feel cheap now"}
{"text":"If I could give this del taco a 0 Star I would. Awful drive through and a awful staff"}
{"text":"Perhaps the most deceitful and lazy staff I have encountered in any restaurant. They tell people they don't have anyone who can operate a cash register, then have 4-5 employees just sitting inside shooting the breeze with each other. I literally parked outside, sat, and watched this for 45 minutes. (They told me they had cashiers coming right in)... and there they sat, on the clock, doing no work. Generally, the cash register position is one of the first positions one learns in a fast food restaurant, and for none of their five present employees to know how to use a till is preposterous. If I could leave a zero star review, I would."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I've ever experienced. The food is horrible and the cashier at 11:00am on March 7 is a doucher.  I will never go here again and I live right down the road."}
{"text":"Wait time is unbelievable. Waited 30 minutes in the drive-thru. Not to mention the food was horrible, and ended up having to throw it all away because I didn't trust the way it looked. The burger was old and hard and appeared to be sitting out way too long. Overall bad experience!"}
{"text":"Food is actually pretty good. Go there maybe every other month. I took off a star because one time as I was ordering the cashier told  his coworker \"This fool wants to use a coupon\" in spanish. Guess I don't look like I'm fluent in spanish. Not a big deal, but it was a little annoying to be referred to as \"that one fool\" while trying to order."}
{"text":"Too cold inside.  Food was ok, but employees were too busy and inattentive for a speedy, enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"Super delicious and quality food! The service was super nice and fast. This is a popular location so even the drive through has a small wait just because of volume."}
{"text":"Come here quite often. Customer service is usually good as well as order accuracy and speed. Restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Horrible service I've literally been sitting in my car through the drive thru for longer than 20 mins it's ridiculous.!!!!!!!!!! Will never come back to this slow place.!"}
{"text":"Del Taco is our late night go to. Food is good, but sorta expensive considering it's fast food tacos. 
I would like to specify that Ivan has provided excellent customer service, and improves this location Tremendously."}
{"text":"Super Cheap and Great Deals! 

The food is not the most flavorful but oh it is cheap. Tacos for .49 cents and burritos for .59 cents you cannot beat the price if you are hungry and on a budget. They have good deals too like 12 tacos for 5.88 and trump Taco Bell on food size. Also they are the only Fast Food place I know or that offers Mr. Pibb!"}
{"text":"I wish to preface this review with the disclaimer this is a fast food restaurant and this review is based on that fact.  The service here was pretty shoddy after they first opened up. There would be long waits at the drive-thru and at the counter. Service has picked up as volume has decreased but it's still takes a little bit longer as they are making each order fresh. Personally, the trade-off of a little time for a freshly made product is acceptable. Tuesday's is taco night but my favorite is Thursday's which is chicken taco night. Good place four a better quality fast food."}
{"text":"Ok Im giveing Del Taco one more chance....

I go in what is your best chicken Idem....

um Burrito or taco? he asks

Have you had the Burrito?

no....I haven't had ethier...

Have any one eaten anything here? I ask the rest of the resturant crew....they All shake there heads no....

ok so even if the food was discounted or free no one should ever eat del taco.....regardless I did eat a burrito.....

and my worst fears where confirmed....I could have dumpster dove at a taco bell and gotten better food......

Feed me bad food once, shame on you.....Feed me bad food 4 times Shame on ME...."}
{"text":"I was a customer in the drive threw, id stopped at this location because it was the last location prior to getting on the freeway heading to my final destination. I ordered 3 street tacos with sour cream. I was charged $.50 per taco for the sour cream. I was not happy when i opened my first taco and could only see sour cream at the top of the taco. I thought of course they didnt just give me a bite of sour cream for $ .50 maybe its hidden behind the avocado. Wasnt there either. Therr wasnt even enough to spread o  the taco... All my tacos were the same. Have some dignity when youre preparing your customers food. Its fine that you charge, but then you should make sure we get our monies worth. Nothing worse then getting ready to enjoy your food to be dissapointed with no other options."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of Del Taco....especially since it's one of my first fast foods stops when I'm in Vegas -- we don't have Del Taco here in HI so that's where the novelty comes into play.  But when I lived in Vegas, I always loved stopping at Del Taco for a quick bite and for the 3 years I lived there I would have eaten Del Taco over Taco Bell anyday. I didn't see Taco Bell for at least 3 years...now that's all we have here in HI for quickie Mexican fast food. Boo."}
{"text":"Went inside and ordered to dine in.  The place was pretty clean, and the table sauces were mostly stocked.  

The food is pretty Del Taco; it is what it is.  Our food did take a bit to get, but hey. 

The 2 stars is for the patty on the hamburger.  I didn't know we had the option to order 3/4 of a patty and not a whole patty.  I should have gone up and shown them, but my boy took a bite before giving me a chance to."}
{"text":"Straight garbage. Sahara and jones is the best in town always good service and better quality. My chicken jack quesadilla had very little cheese and chicken. My 1/2 bean cheese burrito was more like a a value. I should of used my gas and time to get the good stuff instead of the one right down the street from my house."}
{"text":"Maria and Manuel always give the best the service. Always take excellent care of me as a customer."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to my house and I love a late night snack. My boyfriend and I went for a late night run over the weekend and when we got in the drive thru, we immediately knew it was going to be bad. Elizabeth (her name is on the receipt) turned her mic on while giggling and having a full blown conversation with some inside (I image it was the dude behind the counter who is normally there when we go and normally gets everything right) and she proceeds to tell us she needs a moment. That's fine, so do I; a few minutes later we're ready to order and I order their new Del Fuego Shrimp tacos (which are actually pretty good for a fast food place) and she repeated it back incorrectly as soon as it was ordered. We repeated the order three times and she finally repeated it back correct. My boyfriend gets his burritos and wants sour cream too, we ask her to repeat the order, and she leaves out the sour cream so we tell her again. We get up to the window and she repeats the order again, everything is correct. We get home, which is easily a 7 minute drive and I sit down and low and behold...she still gave me the incorrect tacos. How do you mess up an order that you repeated back several times? I was too annoyed and just chalked it and ate the tacos I was give (not bad but not what i wanted) but feel that at it should be that hard - this location is slow every time I go, and the dude who she was flirting with NEVER gets my order wrong. She's too busy being a chatty cathy and not enough time focusing on her job that requires little to no effort so its baffling. Lesson : next time she is the one taking orders, I will definitely check my food before getting all the way home."}
{"text":"Del taco is great for eating on a budget.  You pay a reasonable amount for the food you get and i can never finish it all.  Great place for food after a night of drinking.  Definitely thumbs up from this guy!"}
{"text":"First off had a horrible experience at this location. Ordered steak tacos through drive thru and when I got home I unwrapped the foils and saw that all the tacos were chicken tacos and not steak like I ordered. Called this location and \"manager\" by the name Albo (I think he gave me a fake name)  told me that I was lying and that he made the tacos himself and was sure he made steak tacos. I was shocked at his response. He then told me to come in tomorrow with the tacos if it was true and that he'd take care of it then. I was so upset that I decided to drive back anyways with all the tacos. Not only did he refuse to let me in but said I had to go through drive through. It wasn't even supposed to be locked inside. I went through drive through and gave the cashier the bag n told them it was all chicken. The cashiers name was Jonathan. Jonathan then told me that the manager said he made steak and didn't wanna take the bag. I told him check for yourself it's all chicken and gave him my receipt and everything. He then took the bag and told me he'd make the steak tacos. I got out of my car while my boyfriend stayed inside at the drive through to make sure they didn't put anything on my order. Manager was not wearing gloves and when he saw me recording he quickly put gloves on and had the worker stand next to him so I wouldn't record. Not only did that break sanitation rules but manager grabbed his phone with hands and continued making my tacos. I asked the worker for manager name and he kept lying saying there was no manager and that the worker was threatening to call the cops on me. He did not want to give any names and just kept saying he was new and didn't know anyone's names. I called corporate already n I really hope they contact me back and handle this situation properly because this was not right."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a breakfast burrito. Wanted to know what was on the Steak and Potato burrito. Cashiers response \"uh steak and potato, I don't know, I'm not a cook\" wow really!!!?!? What if I had a food allergy and needed to know what was in it for that purpose? A better response would have been. \"I don't know, let me find out for you\" I guess I shouldn't expect great customer service from a young punk working a fast food window."}
{"text":"Not particularly a Del Taco fan, but was on the strip and was hungry so I decided to stop by here and pick up a breakfast burrito. There was no one in line so I was able to order right away. The lady taking orders was very helpful with the questions I had about the items on the menu and was very friendly. She took my order quickly and had my food out in just a few minutes. 

I ordered the Bacon breakfast burrito which is a tortilla filled with crispy bacon, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, pico de gallo salsa, zesty red sauce, and hash browns. It was pretty good tasting, not as good as other locations, but still was good. My girl got the Carne Asada burrito, however, she wasn't fond of it. It wasn't what she was expecting from the Carne Asada. 

Overall I would come again, maybe not come so much at breakfast time. As I do enjoy their lunch burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"They had me wait in drive thru 20 minutes to get a simple 3 tacos and 2 iced coffees. They are slower than molasses and I can see them in the window just talking to each other and standing around."}
{"text":"Great food like always... Anywhere in town... Great service ... I gave 4 stars Because this location is a little run down and needs a make over... Might even get more business afterwards because it will appear clean and new... :)"}
{"text":"Came here twice on my vacation for New Years. We have Del Taco in Utah but this is by far the BEST and I mean BEST location I have ever been too!!!

The drive up guy was hilarious! Super friendly was patient.... We may have taken a minute or five to order everything lol. 

I got the hard shell tacos and seriously I don't care who you are those are the best darn tacos ever! Their food is so yummy especially at midnight!  love love love this location will for sure be coming back here when we come back to Henderson."}
{"text":"First they messed my order up. I order a grilled chicken burrito, he gave me a chicken avocado burrito. I repeated it a couple times cause the guy never read my order back. So when I get home 1st I'm mad cause you messed my order up. Then both my boyfriend and mine burrito are basically falling apart when we open them. Then I open up my chicken tacos (I wanted the chicken burrito to go with the chicken taco) it doesn't even look good or fresh. I usually like Del Taco but I'm never going back to this one."}
{"text":"Today.... wait for it...wait for it. I went to del taco and it was good. I even ordered food huge shocker."}
{"text":"Super friendly even at 1 am. Clean place too and of course awesome food. We went there after Frankie's Tiki Bar"}
{"text":"I don't get what everyone's deal is. This place is spotless and the food was super good! I got the carne Asada street taco combo which is not clearly listed or have a photo but it's the best thing u can get!! Give this place another try."}
{"text":"Yes I know they are new but I wanted to give another try/chance.  First time in the store waited over 20 minutes for our food. The store wasn't busy. Second time which was today I went through the drive through. This time waited over 30 minutes. . They said sorry and gave me a senior discount. Manager was Danny and didn't come to say anything. The teller was new and at least he was nice. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"never going to this place again!!!! I found a huge clump of hair inside of the taco I ordered and the hair clump had a bug attached to it. I got my food during the graveyard shift. Pure disgust & a waste of money.  Not to mention, the other food I ate, upset my stomach. I'm NEVER going to this place again and will post this anywhere and everywhere I can!!!"}
{"text":"This location has a 100% record of getting orders wrong. Allergic to tomatoes? Here! Have extra! Every. Freaking. Time. 

Then there's the, \"Do you want any hot, medium, or mild sauce?\"

\"No, thank you.\"

\"Great. That will be $11.98 at the window.\"
...pull up to window... \"That's $11.98. Do you want any hot, medium, or mild sauce?\"

\"No, thank you.\"

...Brings food to window... \"Do you want any hot, medium, or mild sauce?\"

...sigh...

So, since they are so fabulously good at screwing up the order every stinking time, I actually check it before I leave the window. Now they're getting more and more sneaky about it. This time the tomatoes were hidden under a layer of cheese. You know, the tomatoes I went out of my way to say please do not put on my food? Yes, those tomatoes."}
{"text":"Normally I love Del Taco, so I figured I would try out their breakfast burrito before a road trip up north. Bad call.

First of all, I had to repeat my order three times. Breakfast burrito meal with coffee. Not a tough one, and no special order.

When I get up to the window, the guy tells me they are out of hot coffee. WHA? It's 9am. However, he said they can give me an iced vanilla coffee instead. Sure, fine, whatever.

I hand over my debit card and what do you know, they are charging me to use it. Great. I am now paying 23% more because they are cheap-scates.

I get my bag of food and pull away, only to find out that I didn't get the meal.. I got a coffee and the burrito, but no hash brown sticks. BOO! Well, I am certainly not going back to try and explain myself, especially since I already scraped my tire trying to get closer to the window that is 5 feet away from the curb.

Oh, and to top it all off, the burrito and the coffee were gross.

No way, jose."}
{"text":"Drive thru Is ok. Decent service. Surprised though tht the chicken burritos doesn't have any beans in it. It wa just a giant chicken taco... But ehh anyways it's not disappointing. Quick grab an munch."}
{"text":"Wife and I just moved to AZ from Seattle area where there were no Del Taco's.  What a pleasant surprise!  The food was better than we anticipated considering how great the prices were.  It was so good that we tried it again a few days later and we were equally impressed.  The service was excellent as well. Del Taco is an excellent value for the price!"}
{"text":"This location is in a major shopping venue.  Service has been consistently friendly and efficient.  The menu offers many choices and the self-serve beverage station offers Hi-C fruit punch.  Wish Hi-C orange was also available.  Dining area is consistently clean."}
{"text":"Good for fast food.  I prefer the food here vs. another major mexican food chain.  They offer Hi-C fruit punch as a beverage.  Wish they offered Hi-C orange as well.  A lot of choices on the menu keep me returning to try different items.  The cheese potato poppers are addictive.  Nothing better than a good ole original taco."}
{"text":"It's convenient and I think their food tastes better than the competitor Mexican fast food chain.  The cheddar potato poppers are too good.  The burger and fries are surprisingly tasty as well.  They offer discounts \"daily specials\" on certain days of the week.  For example, they have \"Taco Tuesday\".  This location is convenient to other shopping.  The dining area was clean and the service was friendly and fast.  There is a self-serve soda fountain area.  If I were to add anything to the menu it would be more carne asada options, shrimp options, and Hi-C orange & horchata at the soda fountain."}
{"text":"This del taco was actually pretty good as far the time and service, usually I get soggy food, and in tacos, that's the worst thing u can do to a taco lol. But they actually we're pretty good, they just don't like giving sauce when u ask for more. I understand a lot of people prob just toss it, but still it does reflect negatively on the business that u get so much kickback on that.but this one I'm particular was pretty good compared to the other del taco. Queso fries were awesome!"}
{"text":"40 min drive in!! At all times!!! Has to be a new hire spot. Please fix!! Fuck you!!!!!"}
{"text":"Deluxe chili cheese fries after a long night of drinking and partying is a good go to .

Bring back the Big fat crispy chicken tacos ! Those were amazing ! I miss them ! 

Otherwise , it's Del Taco ! It is what it is ! 
24 hour go to in a 24 hour town ."}
{"text":"The semi new salads are amazing ! I was so surprised the lettuce was fresh and the chicken was tasty and its pretty big for $5 .Please don't ever dis continue these they are bomb"}
{"text":"This is the slowest del taco I have ever been to. I waited 15 minutes for 1 car in front of me that had one bag of food. Let's see if they mess this order out for me too"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's been redone recently, but the inside of this del taco looks nice! The only downside is that you have to get the workers to unlock the bathrooms, but they have a button at the counter, so it's not a big deal. I don't think I've ever had any issue with my order being wrong. I forget if they do it at this location, but often in the drive-thru, the workers will tell you what's in the bag as they hand it to you, which is nice, since it seems to improve the accuracy of the order."}
{"text":"Good service, if they mess up or you dont like it,  theyll give you a diff thing or at least they did with me. food is hot and fresh, i like the menu also."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had the pollo asado with avocado bowl.

Came out to be $5, not bad for a quick lunch at an inexpensive price.

The bowl was decent, but nevertheless it's still fast food so don't expect any more. 

The place was clean which is a big plus for me."}
{"text":"Decent fast Mexican food - predictably solid. Convenient location near 515 and Sunset in Henderson, NV. In Walmart parking lot."}
{"text":"Avoid if all possible. Horrible service, rude managers who talk bad about you in Spanish to everyone else thinking because your white you won't know what they are saying... Too \"busy\" to fix the soda machine when your the inky people in the restaurant because they are all wanting to go on break and no one will fix it (also talking about that in Spanish). We used to love coming here 3 years ago and let's just say since moving back we will never come back here."}
{"text":"For some reason this location always takes forever to get food. And it's probably a 50% chance your order will be correct. I've ordered from here many times since I live less than a mile away. Tonight I ordered 2 del tacos no meat sub black beans and I ended up with someone else's order. 

Every time I come I do notice they always have new staff. I understand it's fast food and not to expect perfection but consistency is key. The staff is friendly every time I've come, so I think it's more so training and retaining employees correctly."}
{"text":"I only gave them one star because I couldn't give them less. I ordered my food at the drive through the way I wanted it (tacos with no lettuce), got a receipt that confirmed I ordered the way I wanted, only to get home to find all of my tacos had lettuce. I tried calling the store, but no one answered. I tried calling the mail line, no one answered and the mail box was full  Guess next time, I'll run for the border."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru on July 1st. 
First time at Del Taco..
Ordered the Mex. Chopped Chicken Salad & the Macho Nacho along with a small tea.
Miguel was our assistant through the drive thru and was very friendly.
The salad was really good for a fast food joint! It had sliced avocado and all, the traditional fixings atop the salad. It also came with a side a salsa. Presentation was surprisingly nice for a fast food place! Macho Nacho's were tasty and a good portion for the price. We had a coupon towards our meal too! So-for the Salad, Nacho's & a small drink it was $9.71!!"}
{"text":"Went to del taco tonight on farm and Durango. Noticed there were pills by the food station! Asked the manager why they were there. She proceeded to ignore me like I was a piece  of trash! When she brought us our food I asked her again why they were there? She said I saw you videoing me why does it matter? Maybe somebody didn't feel good! Well, if somebody didn't feel good, why are they working a food station. She said \"well your still finna eat it!!\" First of all I don't know what Finns means? Do you mean I'm going to eat it? Then I asked for a refund and she turned her back on me! Don't eat at del taco! You may be getting roofied! I will be contacting corporate and the news. You're welcome #donteatdeltacoyourfinnagetsick"}
{"text":"I don't eat fast-food much but I tried this place recently & used the drive-through.  It was way better than I thought it was going to be. The beef burrito I had was good for it being fast food. The fries were the real star here.  They were crinkle cut & were cooked perfectly. I also tried a double cheeseburger & I felt like it was overpriced for how small it is.  To me, this place is way better than Taco Bell. Customer service was great."}
{"text":"Just to say that I have had \"Del Taco\", I made it a point to have lunch here.  I had the fish tacos, which were OK.  The fish was more like fish sticks you would make for your kids, and that put me off a little.  It tasted ok.  I washed that down with a diet soda and some of their soggy crinkle-cut fries.  Saving things slightly was I ordered a plain beef taco, and that was pretty good.  
The service was actually really good.  Definitely a step-up from some of the other fast food establishments.
Well, I guess I can say that I have had Del Taco now."}
{"text":"My father is dying of cancer.  I've brought him through the the drive-thru before without a problem.  Unfortunately my father is bed ridden with pancreatic cancer. 

I told the fellow taking my order that I needed a senior discount.  Jonathon took it upon himself to DENY the senior discount because My Dad want in the car.  Then he had the audacity to say that he remembered me, but still denied the discount.

Guess what, I'm a repeat customer with obvious needs.  (Crying) I've never been treated this way before and cannot empathize the hatred that was felt when pulling into the window.

I cannot succumb to the level that Jonathon has brought me to.  To deny a Vietnam war veteran a food discount.   That's right, my father what was in Vietnam and is dying of cancer was DENIED a senior discount from this establishment.  Enough said.

How dare you treat a repeat customer this way.  Shame on you Jonathon for not adhering to the policies that are I place.  

Words cannot explain how upset I am.  May god have mercy on your soul."}
{"text":"Got the order wrong, then didn't give us the whole order. Should have checked before we left, but assumed it was fine. Still lame. They seemed too busy, like they were understaffed."}
{"text":"Food was ok. It's good for the price you pay. Service, however, this time around was subpar. I usually deal with a friendly member of the staff but this time it was not the case. I was ordering food for my gathering of friends and so I decided to get 2 fiesta packs(6 tacos and 6 burritos each). They were not terribly busy but the man behind the counter taking my order questioned me and let out an audible sigh. After a few seconds I reduced my order to one pack. I was considering leaving after that display, but was out of the way of an affordable meal deal. I'll make a return to other Del Taco locations, but this one may have lost my respect and patronage. I also understand the amount that 2 packs would've been, but I'm paying for the service and it wasn't packed. Heck, this is at 9pm and there were no more than 7 people in the restaurant. I would appreciate it if my server didn't show any sort of unhappiness for something they're being paid for."}
{"text":"This is a decent place. The food is decent for the price, but the service is a bit sketch. They aren't always the friendliest people when ordering. Taco Tuesday is a good day to go, 3 tacos for $1.29."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. First of all I ordered deluxe chili cheese fries which is the only reason I wanted to go there. There was nothing deluxe about it. Second, I opened the box when I got home and it looked like someone threw the box of fries against a wall before they gave it to me. I posted a picture of it.  Worst presentation of Del Taco I have ever seen!"}
{"text":"One of the scariest Del Tacos that I've come across...probably due to its location...not the best...but not the worst.  That shopping area -- you'll find a lot of transients.  But in the end, you still get the same GREAT and yummy Del Taco food.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The usual Del Taco...inside and out.  Fast and efficient service.  A good location.  Del Taco has amazing and cheaper food...try it!"}
{"text":"They repeated my order 3 times and somehow still messed it up. I'm very upset because I ordered a cali steak and guacamole burrito with no steak and no sour cream yet somehow the burrito in my order has only fries, cheese, and bacon. When it was repeated 3 times? A 6 dollar burrito I can't even eat?  I'm already having a bad day so you can imagine that this kind of put me over the edge. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Stinks that this is the closest Del taco to our house. They're always so slow and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Great variety and prices. Chicken macho burritos are a fairly routine item I order and consume normally at home since it tends to get messy. 
Taco Tuesdays and Thursdays are very busy at this location and drive thru tends to back up during peak times."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick thing to eat that was inexpensive and not overly filling. We walked over here because even a hot dog was outrageously priced inside the casino. That, and del taco isn't available where we live, so we wanted to try something new.

Price was reasonable, the food court seemed good for tourists who also didn't want to pay casino prices, most of the businesses were 24 hours. 

I can't help comparing it to taco bell. Price and taste, it felt similar, but del taco might have been more bland. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but also wouldn't object if someone else wanted it."}
{"text":"Super random to write a review about a fast food place but I have to complement them because every time I go in I get the same service ... I get my car washed next to this Del Taco so my daughter and I always walk over to grab food while our car is being washed ... every time I come in the people working are always so friendly and helpful and even bring out the food to you ... this is by far the cleanest fast food place I've ever been too ! Every time we come in it's always spotless and even all the different sauce packets in the trays are always so neatly displayed."}
{"text":"I've waited so long in the drive thru line and the worst thing is there was no one even in front of me I've waited 15 minutes just to order my food at the drive thru....and the food tasted like crap."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Walked in at 10am, hours after they have since opened,  with two workers working behind the kitchen area. No acknowledgement or even a hi, I stood there for at least another 3 minutes before someone said there was a customer there waiting. Food is lackluster and I've definitely had much better from other Del Taco in better areas. Wish I can say with customer service it's hit or miss, but they've actually been consistently bad. Reason why I still go sometimes is it's near me."}
{"text":"Asking for fresh fries here is like asking for their firstborn children. After completely messing up my order, I called back and was told I could get a remake. That's all and fine so i returned the next day with mt bag of uneaten food. 

And yet?

My deluxe and REMADE fries were still old and cold. Seriously? You put frozen potatoes in a fryer and let them cook it's not complicated. Both times I offered to wait for fresh since I was in no hurry?  What are they charging by the individual fry Now? Are potato costs high??  I'm a manager for a fast food establishment not too far away so I know how these things are done. Will not be returning to this location, I'd rather make the trek to the one on blue diamond, without asking  my food  always comes out hot and fresh. This is the worst del taco ever save yourself the trouble and avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"Saw that Del Taco wasn't voted favorite or second favorite taco place by Las Vegas Review Journal readers.  How can taco Bell be more popular than Del Taco?  69 cent basic tacos and $1.09 for three on Tuesdays is an incredible bargain.  And better yet, they taste really good.  And BTW, the crinkle cut fries are awesome too."}
{"text":"A nice, clean Del Taco location in one of the less-busy parts of this usually-busy shopping complex.  Unfortunately, if you park near Del Taco, you'll probably want to move your car to do any real shopping at Walmart or Office Depot because of the size of the shopping complex.  

The food is as good as you would expect from Del Taco, so if you like Del Taco, you'll like it here and if you don't, you should go elsewhere.  The service was quick and friendly - no complaints there."}
{"text":"I was given the wrong order in drive-thru, but I was more mad at the person whose order I got. Who the hell orders a grilled chicken soft taco and a grilled chicken burrito together? They're the exact same thing! Worst lunch ever. To whoever ordered that, you suck!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Del Taco location in all of Las Vegas.  It is often my second stop (after Starbucks) after landing at Mccarran and picking up my rental car.  The staff have always been polite (even if not fully friendly) and the food has been consistently fresh.  Never a problem using a coupon or offer here either.  My favorite: they have crinkle-cut fries.  Yummy with their macho nachos (even if quite the fat-laden meal)."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating Del Taco, pulled up before the ordering board in the drive thru, decided what I was going to order and then get to the speaker box and I was told they were closed because they didn't have a cashier.  Not what I was expecting to do.  Okay, two days later I called the store and spoke to the General Manager.  He explained to me that their cashier did not show and they had to wait for the cashier they called to come in.  Since moving to Arizona 10 months ago, I have had nothing but bad experiences with all Del Tacos and not just this one.  As I continued to speak to the General Manager I conveyed that I will never return to any Del Taco...in Arizona.  His lack of accountability and passion has only reflected on his company.

Sorry Del Taco...good luck...you'll need it."}
{"text":"I know how difficult working drive thru is, but being very hospitable and delightful while working the drive thru is what Alissa does best.  Thank you for your great customer service.  I will continue to go to  this Del Taco to get my taco fix!"}
{"text":"Worst del taco I've been to. I prefer the one closer to my home. The lady didn't mind yelling at (into her speaker) at the counter. I actually thought she was rude to me, but obviously she was just rude to the vehicle in the car drive through. Odd to have to whitness that. Then she changed her mind and didn't take my order at all. Total psycho looked at me all happy. \"she'll be right with you.\" All sweet and polite like. At least she stayed in character right? Poor guy at the drive through...."}
{"text":"Love me some Del Taco! And this location is my fave! Yes, close to home, but it's more than just convenient. My food is ALWAYS fresh and warm, and my tacos are always full. As a semi-regular customer, that makes all the difference! And it'll keep me coming back for all my late-night drive-thru needs!!"}
{"text":"I recently visited this Taco Bell location during my lunch break. It is one of my favorite places to go to because it is close to my job and very convenient since I only have a 30 min lunch break. I went through the drive thru and ordered a crunch wrap. As I'm driving off I take a bite and the first thing I see is a HAIR. Still staying calm since I had to go back on my short lunch I turned around and  I walked in and discreetly let the cashier know that there was a hair in my food. She took it and saw it and apologized. She said they would make another one. So I waited and as soon as I got my food I rushed out the door since my lunch was almost over and wouldn't have enough time to eat. As Im leaving I pull out my food out of the bag and my SECOND Crunch wrap was completely burnt on BOTH sides!!!! I couldn't go back because I was already running late since i had already gone back. So I paid for food that I couldn't eat due to their mistake and instead of them fixing it, i was left without a lunch. My job is down the street and I was a drive thru regular but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love this del taco. They are fast as hell. Every time I go through the drive through I order my food and by the time I am pulling up the the window, even if I'm the only car in the drive through, my food is bagged and ready to go. We alway double check our orders for accuracy  and the kids at the window get visibly annoyed when we do. But it's right like 90% of the time. Just don't get huffy with us for checking. Most other fast food places mess up orders lol."}
{"text":"Every time we go to this location the wait time for the drive through is long.  Usually 20 minutes before you get your food, but tonight we had a record 30 minute wait. 

Won't be coming back to this location. Please do something about this management!"}
{"text":"Very nice people workin here. The food was well prepared and the inside is clean. You can tell they take pride in there work here"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that when I review my visits, I always rate the location based on my experience at that very moment.  It could be the most common restaurant chain ever, but ends up getting 4 or 5 stars from me.  That's because my my experience and my satisfaction was a 4 or 5 star at that very moment in my visit.  I wanted to preface this review since I will be giving them a great rating.  

I literally find myself going to Del Taco after every drunken night.  When I visit this drive through, there's only one thing I get and only one thing I will ever get.  That is the soft chicken tacos for only $1 dollar!  I usually get 3 and that does the trick.  This taco is packed with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and the most flavorful chunks of grilled chicken.  Top it off with their mild taco sauce and I got the best taco fix at 4am!

Being that this drive through is a block away from my apartment, I KNOW I will continue coming back to get my soft chicken taco fix.  If you haven't tried it yet, you are definitely missing out.  What are you waiting for?  Log out of your computer now and get your butt down there!"}
{"text":"Great place for burritos, even if its not authentic (as being told).
I tend to enjoy the the burger ffom hete and never go wrong with the cjhili cheese fries.
However, do not recommend the milk shake."}
{"text":"GreT fast food place in yhe neigjborhood for a quick meal. Enjoy the burritos znd the burgers. However, do not recommend the milk shake"}
{"text":"Great fast food place. In all honesty the only thing I like from here are the caramel cheesecake bites, I get my Americanized mexican food from Taco Bell but can only find these delicious snacks here. When I was in Iraq I ate cheesecake bites once every other week and I would count down the days to the next time they'd be available. I am so happy that I am back in the states and I can eat cheesecake bites until I'm sick of them. Friendly workers, fast service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I only eat the $0.39 tacos from here. Craving them as I type this review. I still think it's weird that they have burgers and fries available, but to each his own. :)"}
{"text":"I'm so bad for coming here after my boyfriend talked me into getting turkey tacos! Lol. I've never had a bad experience at this place. They have never messed up my food the 4 years I've been coming to this location and all the staff are usually nice. Thank you del taco for keeping me full and my wallet happy."}
{"text":"Okay, maybe Del Taco is not what I remember it being when I was when I lived off of it in LA, but overall this food court is terrifying.  It feels like your ship has dropped anchor in a Disney Pirates Of The Caribbean ride port. 
The guy that walks around with the parrot on his shoulder was even there.
The woman behind us, at 11:30 on a Thursday night, had her 5 week old baby with her, that was about the quality of the food, facilities and people all around."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru this morning. I was the only one in line or in the restaurant and it took over 10 minutes to get a burnt burrito and the wrong meat. I was at work and couldn't get back to return it. Definitely not a good start to my day"}
{"text":"Whew! I didn't get sick! 

Years ago I became majorly sick from a Del Taco. Then a few months after that at a different location I got sick again and it was probably one of the worse food poisoning I've had. Sad to say, I've had a handful of food poisoning experiences, but it's because I'm food adventurous and it's just a hazard of travel. 

I've avoided this plague for years. My BF avoided it as well because of the 2 times he also got sick. 

Leave it to kids to not cook your food right....specially when dealing with chicken.

I saw on Yelp though when it comes to talking about fast food, this kept popping up. I know that fast food is nothing great, but in my area I have very few late night choices and one is a Del Taco. I got curious if it was maybe better than I remembered?

We decided to give it a try again. 

I got some del carbon tacos and a chicken burrito. Not bad at all. It has real chunks of chicken instead of that \"cafeteria\" style chicken that was minced and reconstituted into a chicken strip with fake grill marks which is a plus. 

I can't quite say I'm a \"fan\" yet, but it's A-OK. 

I'll leave them a positive rating though for not poisoning me though."}
{"text":"After a bad experience 9 months ago I decided to give Del Taco another try tonight. Huge mistake. Cashier acted like she had never seen a cash register before (first day maybe). I do not have her name. She was friendly just had no idea how to ring up anything. I repeated my order many times carna asada wet burrito plato. Every time she called it back as chicken. So finally she got it right. We paid. We sat down, looked over receipt, and realised she had still rung it up as chicken. Went back up and told her. Okay resolved. 5 minutes goes by, 10 minutes goes by. The cashier is now mopping and there is a HUGE line of people. She finishes mopping goes back up to cashiering again. Did I mention she didn't wash her hands. 15 minutes goes by. I can see drive thru cars passing by at a steady pace. Bunch of people inside still no orders delivered. 20 minutes goes by. I ask the manager if they are only serving drive thru tonight. She looks up then away and smartly says were out of steak. What? How do you run out of steak on a Friday night? She then hollers they are cooking more! She never apologised or anything. Her name is Aylssa. She should not be the manager!! A young man by the name of Ernesto came over and tried to calm the situation by offering me a free milkshake. I can't believe I was spoken to so rudely by the manager and then a young man comes over who is not the manager and tries to make it all right. That should have been the managers job! He apologised several times and was trying to make everyone happy. Del Taco, Ernesto should be the manager! He's cool under pressure and all about a happy experience for his customers. When I did get my food there was 2 peices of steak in a very poorly wrapped burrito (see photos). The lid looked like it had been melted by something hot, and my boyfriend's fry box was ripped. At this point I just ate my mostly bean burrito and left. I watched numerous people leave without ever getting to place an order. So to sum it all up Ernesto Rocks and should be the manager!! Alyssa isn't a people person and not very friendly. Not a great experience at your restaurant this evening. I will not be back! Do not recommend this location!!"}
{"text":"Just went to Del Taco for the first time and it is truly the best tacos anywhere, will be coming back later tonight!!!"}
{"text":"They didn't know what \"go bold\" meant. Tried to tell me I was making it up; I've ordered it here before though... Either way, the exchange tonight wasn't pleasant. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This location is inside a gas station/mini mart.  The parking lot is often full so be careful when manuvering through it to get to the drive thru.  Or you might just go inside and sit.  There are pleanty of tables to accomadate the lunch rush.  The thing about Del Taco is that if you order a combo, maybe a taco and a burrito, you get fries with it!  Kinda weird but who doesn't like fries right?  It's filling and cheap.  The other two reviews here are from 3 years ago.  I've been here a few times and customer service is fine, even at the drive thru.  You can't beat 39 cent tacos when you're on a budget!!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's fast food.  But if I had a choice between McD's and Del Taco, I would choose Del Taco every time.  They have a special of some sort.  This location is clean and I've always had good service weather it's in the drive thru or inside. If you are on a tight budget you can eat here for just a few dollars.  Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Very good Del Taco location.  I have been coming to this location for many years and never messed up on orders and food came quick and just right.  My only complaint were the days I asked for the hottest sauce they had (inferno) and they gave us all mild sauces when I ordered at the drive thru.  They need to learn which hot sauce packets are mild, medium, and hot.  That's why I gave them 4 stars and not 5.  Other than that, I recommend this Del Taco location."}
{"text":"I won't even comment on the ordering process and how horrible that was, but when a customer orders a bowl, it would help to include a fork. I got across town and had nothing to eat my bowl with. Oh, and napkins are nice too"}
{"text":"Not much to really say about del taco. It's like a step up from Taco Bell but still best while inebriated lol. 

The two times I've been to this location (both times drive thru) I've had poor customer service. 

The food is good enough, as I mentioned lol

I'll probably eat here again if the craving hits me on my way home from work"}
{"text":"This is a commendation for the guy working the drive thru window.  I called when I got home to compliment, and found out his name is Albert.  At the moment I drove up, I was greeted and advised it would be a moment. When he came back to the speaker, he genuinely apologized for the wait and thanked me for my patience.  He took my order, verified it, and when I got to the window to pay, he had a smile as genuine as his voice.  I don't know if this is the training Del Taco provides, or if this guy Albert is just a spectacular person, but this experience won me over for life. As I told his GM Johnny, you don't encounter service like this at a fine dining restaurant, let alone at a fast food drive through. This young man is destined for greatness and I just couldn't let this experience go unmentioned.  I was sincerely touched and impressed by his attitude and service.  In addition, my bacon, chicken, avocado salad was AWESOME. I know this is fast food, but it was quality ingredients, nicely put together, and tasty. The cilantro dressing is just so good."}
{"text":"Before all of you band together to burn me at the stake, let me explain.  I have a reason for wanting to review a chain such as Del Taco!

I went here the other day and was shocked.  The staff is nice.  And I'm not just talking fake friendly.  They were genuinely kind and seemed happy to be at work.  In fact, the guy at the counter asked me how my weekend was, so in return, I asked about his.  You know what he said?  \"Perfect.\"  He said his weekend was perfect.  I can't remember the last time I had a perfect weekend.  Lucky him.

The food is pretty good too and I especially enjoy their spicy jack quesadilla.  My nachos did not come with any cheese though- not sure if that was a mistake or not.  Just chips.  False advertising. 

Anyways, everyone who works there was exceptionally nice.  Why?  This has never happened to me before.  Was I their first customer of the day or are they really just nice people happy with their jobs?  They must pay well there... Is the secret to being happy in life working at Del Taco??"}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru to grab something to eat in my way to work. The woman at the window dropped an F bomb after she gave me my change. Wasn't sure if she was talking to me, someone inside or commenting about something else. Very unprofessional!!!  I did not receive a receipt so I don't even know what her name was. But I do know she was Hispanic and middle-age"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here tonight and I just thought I would commend this location on being one of the best Del Tacos we have eaten at! The food was good, especially the Caramel Cheesecake bites and the employees were very friendly to us."}
{"text":"Love the food. But. Constantly closes early. Right now it's 10:45. Yelp and the restaurant doors stay they're open till midnight. But the restaurant and the menu board are both dark and there are no employee vehicles to be found. So tired of trying to eat here only to find there not even open."}
{"text":"1star cuz I had to put something. I JUST NOW went thru drive thru & guy said to wait a min. No 1 in line   I waited forever!!! Drove thru & left. 
They have no customers wth!?!?
I left! Nice taking care of ur $$$$"}
{"text":"fast, friendly, cost effective, get it right, close to the office and never has a long line.. I cant say anything better about Del Taco. I come here to pick up taco packs for the office and a few tacos for the hubs when he cant leave the office. It's priced very well and I can drive off with a lot of food for under $5 for 3 people.. I cant cook for less that that!"}
{"text":"Very nice ! Friendly staff and very good Mexican food. You have to try its \"Taco Tuesday\"."}
{"text":"I love del taco. It is 10x better than Taco Bell. The people there were SO friendly. They said they loved us and gave us quality food. The chirps were to die for and the lemonade was so good. I can't wait to go back and devour some meat."}
{"text":"So my fiancee and I were looking for places to have our wedding dinner with our new joint families... We looked at all the usual suspects, Joël Robuchon, Prime, Twist, etc...

What we realized was... why go fancy when you can go big, and big Mexican style. We are both S.Cal kids and we realized that for the $1,000+ that our parents would spend on dinner for 7 or 8 at one of those places we could have 2,041 tacos... so we did that instead.

SO TOTALLY AWESOME. I suggest if you ever can do it, SPEND THE MONEY AND WITNESS 2,041 tacos. 

We are now looking for a lap band studio to help us with the weight we gained.

LOVE LOVE LOVE the \"Dell\""}
{"text":"The woman working the register was nice when we came in to order, but she must have been out on the register before she was fully trained. It took quite a while for her to enter our order and in the end we had to bring up some tacos that weren't made the way we wanted. Out receipt didn't show the changes we had told her, so I'm not sure what the failure on her part was.
My son was super happy about those tacos though. My 5 year old was thrilled and stuffed. 
The store looked really bright and clean after I took a look around. 
The food is good, the ordering process needs addressed."}
{"text":"This Del Taco is in a convenient location on Boulder Highway, and has been there for well over a decade (my first visit here was in 2004 when I moved to this side of town). The neighborhood isn't the greatest, especially at night. They've remodeled this location at least twice since my first visit.

The prices are pretty good, however, especially if you opt for tacos on Taco Tuesday. There is also a nice variety of unique menu items that are worth trying.

Some people wonder why a taco place would serve burgers and fries, but to me this makes sense - especially when I'm with a few people and we can't decide what type of food to eat. Having the option of burgers and tacos on the same menu is actually helpful in that situation.

I've never had a problem with the taste or quality of the food here. Service can be hit or miss, and I've learned not to leave the Drive Thru without checking my order first, because they seem to get it wrong more often than most other places.

That said, Del Taco is a nice alternative to Taco Bell. I wouldn't say this is the nicest or most efficient Del Taco I've visited, but it's nearby, cheap, and the food isn't bad for fast food."}
{"text":"I come here because its cheap, but these people have no idea how to fold a burrito. Most of the time they have already fallen apart when i open the paper."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.. I think this place hired a bunch of high school drop out delinquent morons.. I've never been more pissed off with a restaurant as I was on the night of December 21, 2017. I went through the drive thru and ordered 5 soft tacos and a double Del.  When the girl who took my order reiterated it to the rest of the workers.. I heard \"OMG.. ANOTHER DOUBLE DEL?\" so I go to the window to pay.. And proceeded to pay for my order.. And listened and witnessed horseplay and childish antics while parked at the window.  I was then told to wait up front for my order.  I wait.. And wait.. And wait.. Until a confused worker comes out and asks me what I was waiting for.. I reply \"MY ORDER?\" and she had the nerve to tell me sorry.. She accidentally gave my order to another costumer and would I like a complimentary taco for all the trouble.  I said NO I just want my order.. What I paid for.  So I had to wait another 15 minutes before she finally brings out my food.  Never offered to give me a discount.. A refund.. A coupon.. Nothing only a sorry ass free taco.  Unacceptable.. Stop hiring goof off high school kids to be shift managers.. I'm sure I'm not the only customer who has dealt with this kind of service from this particular restaurant"}
{"text":"You must always check what they give you.  This time I didn't and they gave me ketchup with my taco.  So glad min wage went up."}
{"text":"Zero stars! My aunt was starving after a long horrible day and we drive up through the drive thru to do two separate orders and the teenager in an annoyed voice says sorry I can't do two separate orders. That annoyed us so we said never mind. We drove  out of the area and we see him just sitting on a counter laughing at us. Worst customer service ever! I'd like to say it was some kid with glasses working the Saturday shift at 1am."}
{"text":"I've  been an avid Del Taco fan for many years and been to many locations in many cities and states. Yet, I've never hated a Del Taco like this one. I rarely complain and I have given them several chances this past year since they are closest one to my home but no more. They NEVER get my family orders right. We have had to return there almost every time when we get home and unwrap our food. They not only get the orders wrong, they are NOT Consistent with the food quality or ingredients! No Chicken in the Avocado Chicken Fresca Bowl but plenty of soupy black beans overload, No signature white sauce in the soft chicken tacos and very little chicken, asked for 2 2-packs of their cheescake bites and get only 2 in one sleeve and have to repeat it several times until I literally had to count out to them how many I ordered on my fingers, missing items happen too often, no napkins, forks, etc. They make you either back up and wait or sit in the parking lot so their timer doesn't count your wait time every time, even if no other customers are there! and the wait time is one of the longest I've ever had to wait anywhere nearly every time. This time 2 people in line almost started a fist fight because the one in front of everyone was 4 feet back from the pick-up window and would not move forward which everyone in line assumed he was doing to be a jerk so honking and yelling ensued until 2 men got out of their cars to have at it. to stop the fight My husband had to yell at them to explain how this Del Taco makes you stay back a few feet to wait .  Each time my frustrated husband has returned our terrible food or returned to get the missing items in the orders, they could care less. Not friendly or offer to make it right or correct their business practices to keep it from happening so often. nothing but robots who really don't care about their customers or image. Maybe ordering inside has better service and food prep but I'm not really willing to try after these several chances through their drive through."}
{"text":"Went up to Vegas to help my son move back to his old home. Stopped here for a late snack before we headed out on the road.. What a SLOW Del Taco   this has to be the slowest and worst managed Del Taco I have been to in quite some time. This place needs to be avoided if at all possible unless you have a long time to wait for your order.... WOW a long wait!!! we sat here for 15 minutes after we ordered. it seemed like they got confused and were making each order before starting the other... not like Del Taco"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Mtns Edge area.  
Very clean, friendly staff and your usual Del menu.  They were smart to put some fast food restaurants on this side of Blue Diamond.  Biz should be poppin' as there's no competition.  

Great food!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have to admit, I was bit disappointed...

No slot machine in the Las Vegas Del Taco ?

Come on ! who you trying to fool ? ! ?

I know behind closed doors there is some sort of strip club next to the tortilla deep fryer, I saw the reflection of a stripper pole. No bright lights or loud circus noises...WTF ?

I though I saw a midget dressed in the American Flag running around in the parking lot, but it was only my imagination..."}
{"text":"There's nothing spectacular about this place except that serve food that is cheap,filling,and is somewhat tasty. Cashiers are friendly, and they keep the place relatively free of troublemakers."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the world when I'm drunk at 3a.m. My favorite? The chicken cheese burgoco. You take the chicken taco and place it inside the cheeseburger. Best thing you've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Best Del Taco I've been to in the city since I moved here today. Good service and the guy \"accidentally\" gave us a large iced coffee when we paid for a value size"}
{"text":"No, you are not hallucinating. I am reviewing Del Taco. Actually, consider this an extended quick tip.

Scenario: It's 1:20pm. I haven't eaten a darn thing, and I have a meeting at 2:00. This is when I end up at the Del.  I order up a bean burrito with lettuce, onions and cilantro. These are the goods you can add for no extra charge, so .99 and I have acceptable sustenance. Don't forget the Del Scorcho!

This is exactly what happened today, and this location delivered superior results lightning fast. The burrito was ready before we had time to pick out our hot sauces. 

Remember: lettuce, onions and cilantro are free. If you get greedy and ask for tomatoes, they're gonna charge you like .70. I don't understand the vegetable hierarchy. I just know how to work the system. When we ordered, the cashier gave us the nod and said, \"That's the way to do it.\" Looks like I am changing my \"Don't Tell Anyone But...\" to \"I know Del Taco's insider secrets.\""}
{"text":"The place seems good to me. I had no problems here. The food was good and cheap and the workers were friendly and polite."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of del tacos food but their strawberry shake os super delicious! Drive thru line was long and slow like always, but overall I love their shakes :)"}
{"text":"They charged me for 2 tacos and a burrito and I only got the tacos. I tried calling them and the line has been busy for 7 calls. It's crap!"}
{"text":"The food honestly isnt bad here...when you finally get it.  They either need to staff better or someone from corporate needs to train them how to work more efficiently because sometimes the drive through takes 40 minutes.  Most del tacos in vegas are super fast.  3 stars because the food is usually prepped correctly."}
{"text":"Went for a late night snack. The food was edible. The guy who worked there was nice."}
{"text":"Refused to serve me because it was 5am and they had to reboot the system. Went across the street to the real Mexican food place"}
{"text":"Achingly slow. 25 minutes for breakfast, 29 min at 11pm. Food aside, this is hard to stomach. Always seem short staffed."}
{"text":"Its Del Taco.  
Better than Taco Bell by far, and really good.

This location in particular, is awesome.  They are always fairly quick, and have never messed up an order...and we do a lot of \"special\" things, like \"no special sauce\" on one taco, and sour cream on another...

I love the value menus...this is a great location."}
{"text":"'not very spicy going in, coming out was another story' 

After a long morning meeting, my coworker and I came here to get a bite.  And boy did I make a mistake coming here.

This was the first time I ate here, and it was a little dirty but the staff was friendly and fast.  I ordered a spicy grilled chicken burrito, and I didn't know they put beans in it, and as you know, beans and I don't get a long.  

I was starving so I couldn't waste it knowing beans was in it, so I masked with with their del scorcho hot sauce.  Wasn't bad at all, not very spicy going in, coming out was another story though.. more on that later.

The burrito was soggy and looked nothing like the pictures I seen, it was mushy, the chicken wasn't grilled, it was more like boiled chicken.  It was cheap though... anyways this burrito gave me the Hershey Squirts Effect for 3 days, 8 hours, 15 minute and 27 seconds.  And the scorcho sauce was scorching alright! 

Overall a scorching experience,  never getting their spicy grill chicken burrito ever again."}
{"text":"Ok, so I am a fan of fast food tacos :P  Del Taco has the market on that.  Considering this place compared to \"other taco fast food\" the tacos shells are always crunchy.  I like  the texture of crunchy tacos mixed with cilantro, sour cream, tomato, lettuce, and meat.  The ultimate is the way to go in terms of tacos here.  That is if you like the above ingredients.  Other places seem to have soggy tacos from the ground beef oil getting into the shell.
If you want crunchy tacos eat at Del Taco.  I always get the correct order at the Surprise location and they actually give you napkins and sauce, not the norm at some fast food.  BTW I generally enjoy the sauce, but not on my ultimate tacos; hides the cilanto flavor."}
{"text":"I love del taco! They have the best food and low prices. They are so fast and friendly! If I could give more stars I would. Their food is always fresh. They also have great deals 6 tacos for 3 bucks not bad at all. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I still like the food, and LOVE the sauce. The problem on the last trip was their new computer system doesn't allow them to upgrade the taco deal on Taco Tuesdays. You can't toss in an extra buck or whatever to get The Del Tacos. Yeah,  that's a great computer upgrade. As a former POS (point of Sale) Technician I can tell you that's either managements fault for not paying attention to the POS instructions, or a really crappy POS company.

However, the Del Scorcho Inferno sauces still rock and The Del Tacos along with the Del Beef burritos are great. So are the jacked up quesadillas, and the \"mini quesadillas\" are dirt cheap if you just want a quick cheesy snack."}
{"text":"The service at this location is TERRIBLE. I was in the drive thru for 15 minutes, and there were only three cars ahead of me. The line behind me wrapped around the building. They were taking drive thru orders and fulfilling them one at a time. There were zero cars queued up between the memo board and the window. When I got to the window, there were five teenage girls in there, three of which were just standing around talking. Not one person cared about the line of cars outside. I ordered seven items. I asked for no tomatoes on the Del tacos. They both had tomatoes on them. I was also missing one item completely. I won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Don't go through the drive through unless you have at least 30 minutes.  Nothing fast here."}
{"text":"Best Fast Food Mexican on the West Coast! $1 for Double Beef Taco, and $1 for strawberry lemonade. Can feed 2 people for under $10 easy!!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the neighborhood which needs more food choices...fast food or not. They have just opened and one must be forgiving of a mixed up order. I was here during their training week and got a free meal. It was a great surprise and was tasty as expected."}
{"text":"This is the worst Del Taco location.  I have visited this location on multiple occasions and the food is always terrible here.  The service is awful too!  On one occasion, I went through the drive thru, waited for the car in front of me to get their food (which took forever) and when I pulled up to the speaker, no one greeted me or took my order because there was no one working the drive thru!  It was the middle of the day... Epic fail!"}
{"text":"I mean it was taco Thursday and I'm a cheap skate, I i MUST have my chicken tacos.  I prefer the corn tortillas INSTEAD but, hey flour will do.  Now, this location is not the best.  UMC is right across the street and there were a couple of homeless guys that came into the restaurant while I was there. Oh well.  I didn't visit the bathrooms at all.  Customer service was ok."}
{"text":"I love when they have taco night Tuesday and Thursday.  After 3pm.  Their chicken taco are like crack and I HAVE to buy at least 6 tacos!!!!  Now,  on Tuesday they have the beef hard shell tacos which are cheaper. Like $1.09!  And have coupons!  LOL"}
{"text":"Super rude service. Her name is Latauique Patterson. The cashier was really rude as I was just asking why the price rung up was 13.99 when the board said 7.99. she said because of tax. Im a local here and I know tax doesnt make it go up to that high. She continues to say because youre impatient and she fixes it to the right price. She didnt even serve me my drink. I know she was tired but youre a service company. At least explain to me nicely that shes still ringing it up and that wasnt the final price yet."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner on our way home from Tucson. When you want french fries and pseudo-Mexican food, Del Taco is the place. There were a couple of random tires in the parking lot. I ordered my usual Del Combo Burrito. They were out of iced tea... *sigh* Second time of the day that happened. I settled for Sprite. I noticed the dining area was larger than other locations. When our food came out, we were missing an order of fries so my friend had to go back up to the counter. We realized the first order of fries was a large instead of a medium, so we had a lot of extra fries. The second order of fries was hotter and crispier, so we had a good mix. The burrito tasted as it should."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for a bacon, egg, and cheese burrito with hash brown sticks and an iced tea. The burrito was big and very filling! I think the smaller version would have been a better option for me. The hash brown sticks were very oily. I placed them between two napkins and both top and bottom were soaked in oil. Probably not the best thing to start your day with."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for 2 bacon breakfast tacos and queso fries. The lady behind the window was all business and had zero reaction to my dogs in the car. The queso fries were good but spicy. They were really filling so I only ate one breakfast taco and saved the other for the next day."}
{"text":"staff was nice and friendly and organized. restaurant was fairly clean. a couple of messy spots but nothing out of the ordinary in a fast food place at lunch time but the men's bathroom was kind of destroyed. food was quick, hot but the fries could have been a little more fresh and the turkey tacos were tasteful."}
{"text":"I just witnessed a food handler come and run register twice. handle money twice all with gloves on and then go right back to making food without changing his gloves. how disgusting is that. what's the point of even wearing gloves. this will definitely be the last time I come here. this del taco sure become ghetto over the years."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times since they opened and every time it has taken 15 minutes or longer to get my food only to be incorrect. You think after a few months if being open they would get it all figured out."}
{"text":"Their drive through is horrible, we heard the person on the intercom say \"crap\" and called us \"bro\"... and they don't know how to make a burrito, BOTH ENDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOLDED INWARDS SO THAT THE STUFF IN THE BURRITO DOESN'T FALL OUT ALL OVER THE PLACE...
Horrible experience I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for  soda after being at the hobby shop next door. It was late but the girl at the drive thru messed up the order for a soda twice. When I pulled up I gave her my debit card. She came back and said declined. I told her to run it again. She told me again declined. I gave her cash. Good thing I checked my bank Mobil app. Both charges went through. I went back in and demanded my money back and showed the head cashier and the drive thru clerk the charge on my phone. The head clerk asked me not to talk this way to the clerk. I asked for my change back again, strangely enough I had to repeat that they ran the card twice and she only was going to give me the first charge. I've been to drive thru windows that play games with charges before. Be warned at this location. Cash only! Don't give them a debit card!"}
{"text":"Wow! No one answered at the drive-through so I pulled to the front and they insisted on me waiting in the parking lot for my food because I was on their timer. If no one answered and I didn't see where else to go then why do I have to wait in the parking lot when fries are so easy?  I'm 5 seconds from The window anyhow... Why do they have to be so rude? And I look at the ratings see why. If the readings are that bad I'm glad I didn't order.   I don't believe I have ever been treated so badly fast food restaurant.  Plus there was no one else in front of me or behind me. Incredible. Can I give a zero?"}
{"text":"You'd think the fast food industries would hire people with some sort of education.. At minimum someone who could follow a list of ingredients as simple as (cheese chicken & and tortilla) Everything comes ready, all you do is warm it up and serve it out. Fries from my chilli cheese fries are barely cooked; they sit in my bowl like a limp noodles. My spicy chicken jack quesadilla, \"Lets just leave the chicken out completely, they don't want that in there\" they must have thought as they prepared my order. Why would we? I mean it's only in the name!! I tried to call the location and they have yet to update their number because the line is disconnected. I've had a long day and don't intend on going back seeing as how I live a bit of a ways away. I wouldn't recommend del taco to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"So I pull up to the window and start to order. As I order Mia the girl in the headset cuts me off to review my order. I told her I would like to also add a sprite and before saying anything else she gives me my total. Just blurted out some numbers. At this point I wasn't finished ordering but since she cut me off twice I felt I was rushed. I got to the window and asked if I could add on a grilled burrito and she said they can't do add ons in the window that it'll mess up her timer. So I asked her if I could back up and go back to the order area and she said yes (which would of taken more time) then she said she'd ask her manager and came back and said he said no so I then asked to speak to him. I explained to him how she cut me off twice while I was still trying to order and that I'd just like to add a burrito. He then spent a good minute and half explaining how me ordering my one burrito was causing the wait to be too long for everyone else. Him explaining this probably took longer than just getting me the one burrito I asked for. He then handed me my burrito and said \"here's your one item everyone's been waiting on\". This was order #60 at store #1095 5/16/2017 @5:57. I wasn't able to get the managers name but I figure if I'm wanting to add something to spend more money at your store you may not want to interrupt your customers and just give them their order without issue. I work at a restaurant and even if the customer is an asshole a manager is there to smooth things over so they leave happy. Yeh well me, the customer, didn't leave happy at all."}
{"text":"This del Taco is like all the others. Except they screwed up on my quesadilla, I ordered one with chicken and got cheese only. I know it's typical to get orders wron at the drive through but I was looking forward to to it."}
{"text":"Tried their chicken chipotle burrito and I remember rice taste only (which was not soft & even looked undercooked)"}
{"text":"I was going to write a long review about the customer service, and Markie down here at 19th ave and Union Hills 
Wholly crab this itch, Markie is the worst 
Ive ever seen blatantly just straight up rude she is usually on at night and this is my second run in with her.
1st one I was given a verde chicken burrito plate thru the drive thru 
So when i got home everyone else eat I opted to go get what I ordered, OH MY
This itch Markie insisted I ordered it quite rudly other than just make it right this big argument erupts over a verde burrito 
I was so flabbergasted about What just happened I let it go bad night whatever.
So two months later which is tonight i go inside to order this itch Markie still hanging in there obviously upper management doesn't read yelp.
I ordered but I accidentally ordered wrong 
I said carnitas street taco meal and I needed to specify plate this is the wholly shit factor I was talking about DAMM.
I truly did it by mistake void it out lets move on  yeah??
Oh no itch Markie wants to school me on what to say next time I come in and order from her again   Im thinking after tonight you going to be lucky to take anyones order, because Im taking this and all these other bad reviews to corporate this is a horrible way to do business and its time the higher ups heard about this store 
Im making it my mission to see itch Markie relieved from a job that even she doesn't deserve"}
{"text":"Taste wise I love del taco, and maybe it was just this particular one not sure, but there food made me incredibly sick after eating it."}
{"text":"Opens at 7:00am. Doors still locked at 8:30am. No way to run a business."}
{"text":"It is a fast-food, chain, Mexican restaurant. My review is based on the assumption that you understand that first. I mean, you're not getting haute cuisine here, right?

They have tacos, burritos, and other typical Mexican-inspired fare alongside burgers and fries. Yes, you can get a combo meal that is a burrito, a taco, a drink and... fries. I don't judge. They do a good job with the fries: hot and crispy. 

Their chicken is tasty and I really like the chicken tacos. My wife had a steak burrito and let me try some of it. There was a chipotle cream sauce on it that was unexpected and complemented the rest of the burrito ingredients nicely (the one she got had fries in it, too).

I like the Medium sauce here. The hot is fine, but I feel that the Medium has the best balance between heat and flavor. They also have a Mild and Ketchup -- yeah, for the burgers and fries ;)

For the price, this is a good place, and the employees at this location were friendly. I don't go here all the time, but it feels like a step up from Taco Bell... a change of pace if nothing else"}
{"text":"Del Taco isn't the best tasting food but for the price paid for it is well worth it. I love their Buck & Under menu. Their tacos are smaller and this location is skimpier with the ingredients than others. The employees are always friendly and quick. I tried one of their dollar iced coffees for the first time and it was decent for a buck. I tried the regular order of nachos and also the cheap one and they were both disappointing. I do like that Del Taco carries burgers as well as tacos for when I can't decide. The location during busier times is also a pain to get to."}
{"text":"Fast food, not much esle to say, was clean and great prices."}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars!!!! Fucking 4 eyed mixed bitch gets my order fucked up everytime I go there!!! And I swear it's on purpose! First she doesn't give me my fries.. then I go back and order 6 chicken tacos and 6 beef and the Bitch still doesn't get my order right!!! I'm done with this place!! Unless you fire the girl who works late nights!!! She cannot do her job!!!!! I said 6 chicken tacos and got 2!!!!!!!!! Bitch can't count!!! It's happen more than 1 time!! I'm making sure this del taco gets no business.
WORST DEL TACO IN LAS VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really do like Del Taco on occasion.  The tacos are pretty freakin' good AND cheap!  Disgustingly enough, I totally love that, unlike Taco Bell, Del Taco offers fries on their menu.  

This location seems to have updated their decor a bit and are more modern to fit with the times now.  

Service is good and quick, food is always hot and satisfying.  Oh fast food tacos, how I love thee!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick meal when we flew in. Got a macho machos and spicy jack quesadilla. Everything was acceptable, but only because we were hungry. Cheese was cold on the nachos. Same for the ground beef. Half the quesadilla didnt have cheese, as if they missed where the put it! 

The only good thing about the meal was that the chips weren't stale. And they were playing good music."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco, the food came out fresh. The employees were friendly and making jokes since it was April Fools. Though the Soda Machine went down so i couldnt get refills. Hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Its better than taco bell. You get more meat. The menu has more diversity and they shakes are delicious."}
{"text":"Del taco, well that says it all with expectations.  Cheap eats, OK meal.  I do wish this place would get a face lift.  I think they try hard keeping it tidy and clean in the dining area, but its OLD!"}
{"text":"I originally ordered a number 3 and recorded a number 5 after driving off and being on my lunch break I called back and an employee stated come and order and I will fix this issue.  So today I went back and they tell me they can't fix my order unless the owner is there.  Rightfully I was upset but all in all, these employees do not care about customer service and I will never spend another dollar with del taco.  Keep your meal I rather eat with the competitors then a company that steals for people that support there franchise and there kids college tuition.  If I could rate this company it would be -5 stars.  It's so ratchet the guy taking orders is eating foo while talking on the microphone.  When I pulled up to the establishment the shift leader and her employees were outside smoking cigarettes. Del taco you need more professional involved with your company."}
{"text":"This place has been remodeled and is super nice! Ignore the previous reviews and pictures!! This place is clean, the food is fresh, since they grate their own cheese, cook their own beans, and shred their own lettuce. It is WAY better than Taco Bell!!!!"}
{"text":"Bought 2 tacos,1 soft 1 hard. It was Ok, The price is right thats for sure. $1.06 for two tacos. its kinda like taco bell but the meat seems a little more suspicious.i wouldn't come back here unless i was broke and hungry or very intoxicated. taco bell is a better choice"}
{"text":"I don't expect much from fast food chains, but a Mexican restaurant that runs out of beans? Really? 
The non bean items looked like the line workers literally threw the ingredients together. The tacos had a tiny amount of lettuce, so I assumed the lettuce was about to run out next, and the tortillas were stale."}
{"text":"Ripoff alert! Went through the drive-through, and ordered the Thursday taco special for $2.09. Paid with a five, received 56¢ back, and no receipt. Hmmmm. Not only a ripoff, but the food sucks too!"}
{"text":"For a Del Taco this one is pretty good. People are usually friendly, and the service is quick. The food is typical chain fast food, but they do seem to throw it together a little more carefully than other DT's. The stars are based on comparing other Taco Dels, Bells, Smells, and Hells. It's fast, cheap food not to be compared with a real restaurant."}
{"text":"What can one say about a single location of a chain restaurant like Del Taco besides:
a. They always get my order right (which they do)
b. The employees have a great grasp of the English language (which they do)

Well, I can testify that this particular Del Taco made one of my wildest pubescent dreams come true.

It's like this... what teenage boy hasn't mused that if he had a pair of ta-tas, he'd keep himself amused for hours.  I was no different.

Then somewhere in my twenties, Del Taco came strolling into my life, with their thick and creamy strawberry shakes, made with a generous helping of real fruit!  The key to my youthful desire lied within this sweet polar potion... it was called lipids... aka milk fat.

Let me tell you friends, the grass isn't always greener.  I'm not amused... not at all.  There's nothing alluring about a tufted teat.  They bounce; they sag; and they can percolate perspiration like Michael Vick at a PETA rally in Death Valley... on a really hot day.

And no one seems to care.  Seinfeld conceptualized the 'manzier', but I've yet to see one for sale.

I'd have to say my lowest point came while at a water park with friends, one of which brought their new baby.  While relaxing in a lounge chair under the awning by the wave pool, they asked if I wanted to hold little Abigail.  Sure, I love kids.

As I was sitting there with this little cutie, I noticed other people were gawking at me.  When I looked down to check on Abby, I noticed that her mouth was firmly latched on to my right mammary.

That's right children, come suckle daddy's sugarball.

My nonchalant extrication efforts didn't pan out, and the worst part was that I thought I felt seepage.  With pretty much nothing left to lose, I wedged my left index finger between my swollen nip and lil-miss-hoover's mouth until I heard decompression.

Baby-go-back-to-Mama.

In conclusion, I'd like to think there's a lesson here we can all learn from.  Yeah.

~Swoop"}
{"text":"I always tell myself for about the last year every time I go to Del Taco that they will change to be good again. BUT NO! 

As a regular I am over this at this point, I have to say something hoping it may change their portion habits. 
You know this trend is happening more and more with these fast food chains! I Ordered REGULAR tacos with meat from Del Taco today ate 2 bites and was wondering if their was meat in my taco, instead I got a lettuce taco with 9 strings of cheese. This isn't the first time with you Del taco."}
{"text":"Came here after a concert at MGM and chose this thinking it would be like Taco Bell. The cashier didn't greet or even ask to take our order. Just stood there and stared into space. You could tell she didn't care about her job. She was rude, texting on her phone, walking away from taking people's orders and giggling with another co worker. The food was poorly put together and cold. Just poor customer service. Will never come back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"I love their iced coffee, they don't try to jip you like other locations by putting in waay too much ice! Don't come through at 5am when they make their shift change though; I learned the hard way. They shut everything down and cannot serve during that time"}
{"text":"I'm one-upping my review from last time due to a much better experience. This time I went in and I was really craving their crinkle cut fries with all the toppings on top. This time I opted for the carne asada, which was not a disappointment. The regular size was just enough for me and it was covered in delicious sour cream, guacamole, carne asada, and tomatoes with cheese. Very good! I can see why this is Del Taco's big draw. And I also just went with a Del Taco, which is just one of the regular tacos with the hard shell. Very delicious! They definitely put a lot of cheese and meat on their cheap tacos. 

This is what gives them an advantage over Taco Bell as they are really focusing on quality and quantity over just a cheap price. Definitely something I'm enjoying while I'm temporary here in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I don't know if quality has gone down or my tastes have gotten better but there food is pretty gross. Del Taco use to be one of those late night, I'm drunk and hungry or I'm out shopping need a quick and easy bite, I think I'll get a taco kind of place. The last few times it's been gross. Meat is mushy and has a weird smell and taste. I even tried a milkshake recently, even that was almost tasteless.
I have vowed not to waste my money here anymore. It's been placed on my blacklist."}
{"text":"For fast food its pretty decent and doesn't make my belly hurt. Better tacos and better hot sauce than Taco Bell, thats why I go. Oh and its cheap, convenient and always open for me. The Pepper Jack quesadillas aren't bad either."}
{"text":"I was at this location And I have never waited longer for three cars to to be served. Molly the attendant was so slow I wanted to kill myself"}
{"text":"Overall good food. I really enjoy the Bacon Double Dell Burger and chicken soft tacos."}
{"text":"Went inside to see what is on the menu since this was my first visit. Luckily it was Tuesday. $2.24 for three tacos? Had to try that. Since I hadn't eaten anything all day it tasted great. Kind of thrown together but the shell was crispy and good still even when I got home.. The filling was tasty. The ingredients fresh and crunchy. Nice polite fellow behind the counter.  I visited the one on Sahara. I never go to fast food places ever but this was so close to my apt I broke my own rule.  Glad I did. Beats 
cookin and cleaning up a messy frying pan. I'll go again if I get a hankering for tacos."}
{"text":"This might be the slowest fast food restaurant in the history of the world!   I started my order at 10:25 and I just completed my order at 10:45 and now I have to wait for them to make my food the food server was very hard to understand seemed like she had never talked into a microphone before without a doubt one of the worst fast food experience of my life. I would recommend going anywhere and not go to the Dell taco that sits on the corner of Tropicana and Maryland Parkway please avoid it."}
{"text":"Worst del taco in Las Vegas...
Second time there and they barely put any meat in tacos and the burritos also....there was lots of workers there and they still took a long time...

Not going there anymore"}
{"text":"Poison in a bottle.. 

I have to admit this location has always been bad. Food is always cold even fresh from the oven. 

Today, today was the day I said HELL NO. 

Had a burger, fries, small drink and two burritos. YES I was hungry.

Drink had a horrible chemical taste.
Burritos tasted like salt and burnt beans.

I get it, it's fast food, but GROOOOOOOSSSSSSS

Go to any other location but this one. Sadly this one seems to enjoy making bad food. I know it's fast food, but not this bad...

YUCK!"}
{"text":"Worst del taco ever...walk in cause the drive thru line had 3 cars..being in  hurry i ran inside cause the line was shorter..get told to hold on(been waiting for 10mins at this point) the. I wait another 10..my break being only 30 mins..i was forced to starve for lunch today. Thanks guys! Great fing management!!!"}
{"text":"Sadness is opening up your taco and finding this bullshit.  After getting off work at 3am, I have no desire to drive back to the restaurant to get my money back. Make sure you thoroughly check your food before leaving. I am livid"}
{"text":"In theory this place should be gross, but I have had a great experience here every single time. The food is super cheap and the people who work here are really nice. I love their bean and cheese burrito and usually leave feeling satisfied, not too bloated, and like I got a good deal on the meal. Great for quick on the go eats, day or night!"}
{"text":"Good queso! Creamy and spicy with lots of little bits of pepper, it's really yummy. One complaint is that it is too small of a portion, I want to be swimming in that queso and it was gone before the chips :( 

Good service and food was fresh and tasty for a 3am snack run"}
{"text":"Fast food is fast food yadda yadda yadda. Nothing life changing, just cheap food to fill me up. Decent though, nothing was gross or unsavory. However, this is a great spot!

I really like the interior of this place, for a del Taco it's clean, modern and dare I say... cute. I don't mind eating in here and taking my time, so that's saying something. I also like that they have little baskets of their hot sauces and ketchup at each table so you don't have to get up to get more. 

The employees are friendly and hard workers. Today it looked like only two people were working and they handled a rush like champs. They were not slacking! We had a big order and everything was accurate and ready in a timely manner. I'll probably be back to check out breakfast or some of their specials, like taco tuesdays and thursdays. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Big thank you to the staff tonight. They're busy and understaffed with some mean moody patrons but they're still smiling and trying their best. A small team with big hearts and I wanted to show them some appreciation for not losing their cool with the rude lady with an attitude about some random thing ....lol you guys are some real mvp's!"}
{"text":"For a fast food chain, you can't go wrong picking up some of their breakfast taco's. I love the Carnitas egg taco's. 

The egg is just scrabbled, nothing fancy about that, but the Carnitas are a little bit of spice, and they put on pico de gallo and chopped cilantro and onions all  wrapped with a corn tortilla,  very good start for the day.

This is cheap, fast and flavorable!"}
{"text":"Customer service here sucks stop in on my lunch break I only get 30 minutes when I walked in I was told someone would be right with me I ended up leaving 10 minutes later because my order had still not been taken thanks for wasting 10 minutes of my lunch break I'll never come back again..."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. I ordered a number 5 and as I ask everything's in here and he says yes. So I Drive a little and then check and my two chicken soft tacos were not in the bag. So I went back in and told them and they just look at me in disgust I waited an additional 5+ minutes (mention I was in a rush)! Once I finally received my tacos I did not receive any kind of apology. Never going back that's for damn sure."}
{"text":"I haven't had any problems here. My food has been correct all the times I've been here and staff friendly. The only thing I can see that they could use on improvement is cleaning tables a little more frequent, but I have seen a lot worse. My kids love to eat here and the food is a lot better than eating at Taco Bell. Still can get cheap tacos here too."}
{"text":"I love Del Taco, but this restaurant is subpar. I have ordered fish tacos and one of them was this hard disgusting blob. I should have taken it back, but it's not worth the diesel to drive back home. I figured they had a bad day so I went back and got sick for two days. It's a shame since I have gone to the original Del Taco in Barstow and it is nothing like that one. I guess I will have to resort to eating Taco Bell and that's pretty gross."}
{"text":"So after work being the 2nd day into the new year all the stores were very busy and packed so I stopped inside to take food home, nice place for fast food employees were pleasant too even though it was very busy. Only complaint is I ordered 2 chicken classic burritos the shells we're freezer cold and wet. No classic sauce on them. I also tooknow a steak quesidlla home to my brother Wichita was kinda burnt. I also ordered chili cheese fries delux. It was okay I wasn't happy with the meat. Kinda spices dry and didn't taste good. Anyways depending on what you wanna go there for I'd recommend eating there. I won't be back for food choices on how much it cost me though, After thinking this i should've went to Cafe rio,"}
{"text":"Del taco is clean, cheap, convenient and beats Taco Bell! Pinto beans aren't cooked with lard which is great for vegetarians"}
{"text":"The only problem I've ever had here was they once gave me taco sauce hotter than I like. They always greet me with a friendly greeting at the speaker and the window. They've always gotten my order right. Good, fresh food. Can't pass up the Taco Tuesday deal."}
{"text":"I'd never eaten at a Del Taco before, and I was surprised to find that I can still be disappointed by fast food. 
I ordered the Plato Chicken Burrito.  Silly me, I expected it to be mostly chicken.
I cut it in half and found that, from bottom to top, it was about 1/3 folded tortilla, 1/2 beans, and chicken and green sauce making up the final 1/6.  In total, there might have been an ounce of chicken."}
{"text":"Pulled up to this locations drive through almost a half hour ago. 

It took ten minutes for the orders to be taken from the two cars ahead of us. 

Sitting behind one car now waiting to pay and get food and the car in front of us has been sitting for now 13 minutes. This is ridiculous! 

Seriously, it's Saturday night on a busy corner. Staff the restaurant properly!"}
{"text":"Came here for some tacos with my girls, that's what they were craving. I don't know why this location got so many low reviews, but as soon as we came in it was a good experience. Was immediately greeted. Tables were clean and had a basket of all the sauces they offer including ketchup! They took our order, and even took our tray of food to us when it was ready, we didn't wait long.

The bathrooms were decent and parking was easy since they had their own lot. The view while eating is people washing and vacuuming their cars at the car was next door. All in all a good food trip, for 50 cent tacos, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave 0 stars. The worst del taco in the country. The workers are slow and rude the food made me vomit literally. But all the other del tacos are good. This one is trash drive down to Eastern and serene if you want del taco. Decided to give this location a second chance and now I have food poising"}
{"text":"With all of the hubbub about that manager on 91st & Peoria, I thought it necessary to write a review on this location.  I try to stay away from fast food, but Del Taco really gets me. Maybe because there was one across the street from my high school, so it's nostalgic. This particular location actually makes me wish I were a business owner, because I would steal their employees away. They are always so kind and sweet. The girl that helped me today wasn't bursting with personality, but she was still kind. I have never had a bad experience here. I also pour on lots of sugar with my voice to people who prepare my food, but that's just common sense. If you're looking to get your Del Taco fix, this is the location to go to."}
{"text":"Had great food tonight. Food was very fresh. Service was good. Very pleasant for a quick meal. Good value for the price."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the fish tacos. They were just a lil OVER COOKED . I think I'll stay with the one I usually go to."}
{"text":"Guy at drive thru had hearing issues, i  had to repeat myself many times. Still didn't understand me asked me to come to window. Took forever to get my food. Ice tea had no Ice. When got home food was just thrown in bag and didn't taste good at all. Only thing thats good is their fries, lol!"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying I gave them two stars because the employees were super nice. I took a picture of my taco because there is not even a full spoonful of meat. The food is terrible! I mean I get it's fast food but really?! I expect something in my taco. Will not be back. I can see why they are dead most of the time."}
{"text":"Always fast drive thru at lunch time.  Staff are quick and polite.  Food is hit or miss, sometimes the tacos have meat and sometimes it's mainly lettuce.  Overall happy for the price."}
{"text":"For years, I have fallen victim to Del Taco and its remarkably delicious soft chicken tacos.  From my time in California, to my move to Vegas years ago, my joy was no greater than discovering that my favorite junk food would carry over with me to this new state.

Over a decade later, I still retain a soft spot for the soft chicken taco, and this Del Taco is not a disappointment in this regard.

Regarding this location, the service is polite, the lines are fast, and to date, I've never had an issue with my order.  It's located in a shopping center next to a bar, and outside of the many 'Bertos taco variants, this is the other preferred meal of choice after ingesting a few liquid libations, or late night \"I have to eat something\" snack.  This location has gotten me through a few rough nights of working late.

That said, it's not the building, location, prices, or service that I take issue with.  It's the drive through customer.  I was reminded of this just today as the woman ahead of me screamed a string of profanities at the hapless girl inside the window as she sped away.  For you see, this isn't the first time I've witnessed something like this at this location.

Maybe they're drunk from the local bar.  Maybe it's just something about the neighborhood.  Maybe these people are just stupid.  Or just mental.  Who can say, really?  All I know is I feel for the customer service, because as mentioned before, the people working here really are nice.  The only fast food place I can think of that actually initiates a brief \"How are you\" conversation, and sounds like they actually mean it.

Regardless, this is a decent location that actually makes use of a paraphrased (and edited) line from \"Clerks\": This place would be great if it wasn't for the fudging customers.

Well said, Randal.  Well said."}
{"text":"They have good fish taco.  I like the special sauce that they put in there.  It's very creamy.   If you order a value combo. You can ask chip and cheese dip instead of fried fry."}
{"text":"Tuesday night is taco night! Thirty-nine cent tacos that can't be beaten for the price. Admittedly, cheap tacos aren't a great selling point for your average Yelp foodie, but they are heaven on earth for the four and five year olds who typically accompany me to Del Taco. These picky eaters ate four and two tacos respectively on our last visit and split a churro for dessert. 

Sure, the tacos are a bit small, but they are surprisingly good quality. Much less greasy than your typical Taco Bell beef taco. Also great the way the restaurant places a basket of assorted taco sauce on each table. I'm not a fan of much of the rest of the menu, but Del Taco nicely fills the \"cheap Tuesday night out\" niche for our family."}
{"text":"It's Del Taco, so really, what can I say? The food is greasy, and heart killing. The prices can be ok, but you will get mostly lettuce with that 15c taco there. I suppose when you don't feel like making anything, and really don't care about your health, it's alright. But really people, it's not hard to make your own tacos, and with the internet you can find the recipe for their sauces and make it yourself now. You know, if that was your only valid excuse for coming here."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was great as always. I really like the hot sauce baskets on the table. The new Del Taco Taco was great. Nice throw back. There's a great drink selection here too."}
{"text":"Booooooooo for getting rid of the Taco Burrito!!!! Best thing on the menu and now it's gone."}
{"text":"This re restaurant is the most horrible service ever they just not only  double charged my f***ing credit card but also payed for someone else's food and the manager does not want to do anything about it. She gives me the corporate number which is there comment line and it goes directly voicemail I would like to talk to somebody who is an actual person not a machine. I will never be going to del taco ever again. Now I understand why it took them so long to give me my card back. I give this place no stars but it's making me give them one star"}
{"text":"This place is not good.. The food makes my stomach hurt and have gas!!"}
{"text":"I am done with Del Taco! My boyfriend and I were starving after we went to Walmart so I suggested getting something to eat from here since it's in the same plaza and it was already 2 AM. 

We both got the shredded beef burrito and bacon break fiesta which comes with two egg and cheese burritos and hash brown sticks. The burritos tasted awful. The tortilla was hard and old. I took a bite from each burrito and I was done. The shredded beef was chewy! The hash brown sticks were so greasy and didn't even taste like hash browns. Yes, I know I shouldn't be expecting much from a fast food place especially at 2 AM.  Never again!!!"}
{"text":"For the past 5 years or so i've been coming to this Del Taco as a means for a quick bite to eat when in need. It is only now that I write them a review, as I feel this specific restraunt is at its peak! When I first started to come here so long ago the service was terrible, the employees were rude, and the lounge was disgusting. However, over the years I have come to see this change for the better. Today this restraunt has the most friendly, organized staff i've ever seen in a fast food restraunt. Their food quality is on point, and they serving time is unbelievable. Everytime I walk in they greet me, take my order, and have me on my way within 2-3 minutes.

Their lounge is always spotless, and their customer service is always amazing. Two employees that always come to mind are Mabel, and Kevin. They always make sure my experience is the best, and they are the biggest reason I continue to come back every time i'm in need of some fast food!

Thanks for the amazing improvements guys! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"When you're in a hurry and want some fast mexican food del taco is the spot. I always stop  by this del taco. I love that they keep it clean and the service is fast and friendly. My go to is the burrito and taco meal with fries. I just love their cuts of fries and burrito is tasty. I mean it's fast food so this isn't as good as going to a regular mexican restaurant but it still meets my craving.

I give it 3 stars as it's clean, service is friendly, and food is decent."}
{"text":"Slowest drive-trough ever. It literally took them 20 minutes to make a 99 cent bean and cheese burrito. There was only one vehicle in front of me."}
{"text":"The food is fine, but the driveway is incredibly slow. I spent almost twenty five minutes stuck in the drive through and there were only two cars ahead of me. I would have just left except there was a line of four other cars behind me and I was stuck."}
{"text":"Always slow service. I just left after sitting in the drive thru for 10 mins. Went to jack in the box and I am already leaving with food. This location is alwaya super slow, especially on a Satuday night. Last time I was here on a Saturday I waited for for 20-30 mins. They are simply super slow"}
{"text":"I had never tried Del Taco before.  On my way home, so I thought what the heck?  I had a regular ground beef taco.  Tasted like Taco Bell.  Lettuce seemed fresh, and they put on a lot of grated cheese.  Perfectly adequate.  Fast and easy, but not amazing.  It gets the job done if you are hungry and want something fast.  Good customer service."}
{"text":"We tried Del Taco for the first time last month after a friend shared her fish taco with me. My partner loves Taco Bell, but I was bored and wanted something different. 

There are similarities between Taco Bell and Del Taco but I think Del Taco wins- more variety is the key. I don't like the bland tortilla chips, though- gotta give that to Taco Bell. Don't like the cheese sauce, either, so Taco Bell wins the nachos battle. 

The real winner are the tacos. I love the shrimp and fish tacos- flavorful with a mix of textures to make them interesting. Those soft corn tortillas are the bomb. Now, I know nothing about \"real\" fish tacos but I thought fried fish was probably not authentic- but what do I know? It's still tasty. It's fast food so I don't expect much."}
{"text":"I have to say we have lived in the area for over 4 years and have gone here many times without much trouble, yes the staff is sometimes rude and their drive through speaker barley works but today I have chosen to give them only one star. My family loves their tacos and today while eating dinner I took a bite of my taco and this long hair pulled right out from the meat. I was disgusted I called to complain but the mgr on duty didn't seem to care too much. We will never be back to this place again"}
{"text":"Del Taco messed with the wrong pregnant lady tonight. Never in my life have I been so upset with an order I received in the drive thru that I actually got in my car to go back after sitting down to eat, until tonight. I just wanted chicken soft tacos, but instead I got tortillas stuffed full of lettuce and cheese with 3-4 little bits of chicken with an average size of my pinkie nail, the largest no bigger than my thumb nail. Soft tacos aren't that big, I can't believe it was too much to expect that I could at least get a little chicken with every bite."}
{"text":"This Del Taco location is the worst in Vegas.. My food order was wrong and I had to drive back more than once ! As much as I should just go to another location, it's so close to my house that it is disappointing that they can never get the order correct. And each time I went back to speak to the manager I got attitude from him and that's after he ignored me for about 15 minutes first. Late at night all the employees there are horrible as well. Because Del Taco is normally one of my fav's I wish they could get it together !!"}
{"text":"Taco bell is far better than Del Taco.  And Taco Bell is not good either.  Nuff said.  Oye, I ordered the Macho Nachos without meat and ick!  The beans were a soupy mess, the sour cream looks like it came out of some sort of canister and twisted around like a snake on top of my chips, and the cheese was a nasty, salt laden, festering lagoon of orange goop.  AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"Well I have been to one Del Taco before, the one up on Northern and the man wasn't all that impressed with it, and the only thing that really impressed me was the cheap prices and the grilled chicken taco which was really good. So I decided to come here because of the grilled chicken tacos and the advertisement I saw for 2 for $3 fish tacos. I love fish tacos, so I figured I would try that menu item and see how they were. Ended up getting 2 bean and cheese burritos, a burger, and 4 regular tacos for the man which he said they were good, and was happy that the cheese was melted in the burrito because at Northern it wasn't.  I got two grilled chicken tacos, 2 fish tacos and some chili cheese fries for myself. Everything was great, I had zero complaints about any of it. I think I definitely found a cheap place to grab food when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"It's a little out of the way for me, but it's always worth the drive. I always end up eating at Taco Bell, but I never know why I don't go to Dell Taco more often. The steak tacos are delicious and the crinkle fries are yummy, throw in a churro and you've got a great meal. Wish it was closer, but I'm never sorry I made the drive."}
{"text":"If this place were to hire armless, legless stumps for people they would be quicker than the current employees. I've never seen a place slower or more incompetent. When you do get your food it sucks. Other del tacos actually have decent fish tacos. Not this place they burn those. 

This place is so bad I'm writing this sitting in the don tortaco drive through around the corner. 

The drive through literally takes 5 minutes a car. I went inside and the slack jawed yokel filling the condiments doesn't even bother to acknowledge that a customer is standing there. Avoid this place like the plague which you will more than likely get eating there."}
{"text":"This place drives me nuts!  It's very convenient for me to drop in and I'm mostly satisfied with their food, it's just that they are so slooooow in the drive-thru.  On my last visit I couldn't even order at the menu.  I had to roll up to the window and give my order.  It's not that the menu wasn't working, the gal just wasn't listening or hearing me correctly or something.  I had a question and apparently questions don't fly out at the menu.  When I got to the window and asked \"can you leave a few fries w/o chili on them?\" the look she gave me was complete bewilderment - like nobody had ever asked her a question before.  Frustrating.  I'll go here again because it's on the right side of the freeway, on my way everywhere."}
{"text":"Man, it's been ages since I've been to a Del Taco.  When I say \"ages,\" I mean probably 20 years.  But there I was, standing in front of one in a food court on the Las Vegas Strip in the middle of the afternoon.

I just needed a snack, so the order was two crunchy Del Tacos and a drink.  Service was friendly (we even made a joke about how the total came out to $7.00 exactly), and the food didn't take long.  Although the tacos weren't as tasty as Taco Bell's, they were a little bigger and seemed to have better quality ingredients.  The beef wasn't as greasy, the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, and the cheese was plentiful.  By the way, they get points just for having tomatoes, as Taco Bell took them off their regular tacos long ago.  Only problem were the taco shells - while they were crispy and tasty, half the taco would shatter at the first bite, so I would have to do some remnant shell scooping action.

For a quick snack, this place was just fine."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant since its so close to home. Recently I've noticed the employees on the night shift are just incapable of operating the restaurant by themselves. Can we get them some more support or more training. I don't think I need to give any specific examples as I'm sure this is a common occurrence since I go there so often and each and every time they have got something wrong or just weren't able to efficiently handle the evening flow of guests. I love Del Taco but I feel like I'm being forced to find another go to restaurant.."}
{"text":"So mad waited in line for drive thru a half hour on Tuesday nite for taco deal, to find out they don't do the Tuesday taco deal cuz they just opened!!!"}
{"text":"This is the third time that I have been to this location and the burger is raw.  Who wants to eat raw meat from a fast food place?  Disgusting.  I added a photo of said meat."}
{"text":"Great tacos for a fast food restaurant. The meat was good quality. The tacos were good size. Two tacos were a pretty good portion. Service wasn't great but what can expect from fast food employees working third shift. I ordered the #1 del taco combo which comes with 2 hard shell tacos, fries, and a drink. Was told that the fryer, grill and other appliances were down for the next 2 hours. They gave me nachos and cheese instead of fries and they also gave me tomatoes after I said none. Despite the service quality I would go back."}
{"text":"Ok. So, a 5-star rating for a fast-food place...not something to be taken lightly. But, these guys really delivered (through the drivethru, lol).  The food was fresh, plentiful, perfectly cooked and even looked good. Fast food gets a lot of bad reviews, but this is one time that they got it right."}
{"text":"Slowest Del Taco in the Las Vegas area. In the mornings if there is on car in line we will move on. Really ridiculously slow."}
{"text":"This is the slowest del taco I have even been too.  They employees inside are having personal conversations rather than helping their customers.  The drive thru takes forever as well and they never get the orders right."}
{"text":"It took 30 minutes to get my food!  This is not the first time.  The last time I was here was a weekend and though it was a long wait, it was not as bad as this.  Avoid like the plague!  The Del Taco on Rancho is a much better and faster option."}
{"text":"Seriously, how do you rate a 24 hour place?! It's either 5 stars cuz you're drunk and everything is amazing or 0 stars cuz it's fast food. C'mon people catch up! Quit trying to be professional critics!"}
{"text":"Out of hamburger buns on a Saturday night. Unacceptable. 

I know I'm Yelping a Del Taco but you took the time to come here and read it so who is the real loser here?"}
{"text":"Do not go drive thru! You'll wait 10 min. and when you drive to the window you'll be greeted with a sarcastic \"what do you want?\" After informing the asst. manager (which answered the drive thru window) I told her we were waiting for over 10 min and now there's a back up in the line she says ok, so?!!! I said not after customer service like this, HELL NO! This isn't the first time something like this happened this is just the first time I posted about it!!!!! No more from this location let alone from a \"manager\" who is old and white so you already know who I'm talking about!!!!"}
{"text":"Lol damn Tatianna you suck. I ordered 3 tacos. And asked for extra lime. I get home all excited to eat my tacos for taco Tuesday, hello! And my \"extra\" limes were the only 2 that already came with my fish tacos.  Pftt man. I'm all disappointed. The other del taco on ft. apache is better. They always come through."}
{"text":"Del Taco corporate needs to come into this store and clean house.  The drive thru is unbelievably slow and they never get orders right. Tonight they were actually taking an order....then serving that car before they would take a second order.  Seriously?"}
{"text":"Oh how I love the  steak el carbon tacos from Del taco they are just deliciousness!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked that most people who work at fast food establishments think they work so hard, it's so stressful and they feel they deserve a raise.....Give me a break! Every time I go to this location, they screw up the order, and it's not a difficult order either (I never have a special order). I have to go back every freaking time because I get the wrong food or they do not give me all my food that I ordered. Seriously....how difficult is it to get it right the first time??!! It's not brain surgery kids, it's just a simple food order! I feel sorry for the future of our country, the younger kids nowadays are freaking clueless!! Just sad!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for 15 minutes for fast food, 2 people order after me and have already gotten their orders and have left. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"It is what it is, DON'T JUDGE ME.

I just moved to Central Phoenix and one of the first things I looked for was the nearest Del Taco (which I admit is pretty pathetic considering all of the great food options near my house). I used to live in Tempe and there was a location at University and Rural that I used to frequent on late nights for the longest time. Sadly, it's been closed and replaced by some random chicken place.

Went here twice the past weekend. Love those veggie burritos with the red sauce! I also tried some nachos-wouldn't really recommend it. Super fast & cheap, great for a quick lunch or dinner-which is exactly the point."}
{"text":"So this Del Taco is right in front of the light rail stop, so I thought it would be awesome.  It turns out the open time is more of a guess.  7 is posted on the sign, the manager showed up at 7:15 and said there was traffic.  It was a Saturday.  A gentleman more patient than I, told me that they are usually open by 7:30, only a half an hour late.  Still, I know my employer considers early to be on time, and on time is late.  She did not seen to concerned about it.  To top that off, I went back the next day (I was taking the train for the weekend),  they were not open at 7:10.  It must have been that terrible Sunday morning traffic.  I will not be going back.  A manager that can not figure out how to make it to work, probably doesn't know what a mop is to be used for."}
{"text":"Very bland, no flavor, stale taco shells, little cheese in quesadillas, poor service....and so in. If you want a cheap taco, this is not the place."}
{"text":"We waited for almost 5 minutes and nobody said \"we will be with you\" or something like that, no cashiers, no one attending, when finally placed the order The worst customer service from the manager, iced tea was slimming I asked to please make new one and she said it takes 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Gal at the resister was dumb as a box of rocks. 
They screwed up the two orders ahead of me. 
They are slower than molasses in January. 
The lady after us got a chicken bone in her taco. 
The manager was about as uninterested as a human being could be."}
{"text":"Missing item in my drive through order.. it really shouldn't be that hard to include everything I ordered and paid for.."}
{"text":"I forgot how good the quesadilla is here or maybe it reminds me of growing up and having them I don't know but either way yum!"}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE customer service! The saying customers come first doesnt exist here! We waited while the cashier ordered her \"called in\" order from family/friends. Front of the house girl was very unprofessional, talking about personal issues loudly. Not sure if she thought the attention was cute or that we were amused but we weren't. We will definitely not being going back to this location. It is a shame because the times I've gone before the staff was different and they had better customer service. And to wrap things up they messed up our order... round of applause."}
{"text":"Their drive thru takes FOREVER!! The last few times I have been here I have been in line for more than 20 min. This is the worst!! Annnnd they don't even apologize for the wait."}
{"text":"never coming back here...i should of went to jack in the box... this place is near to my place.... the services was long of a wait both taking orders & getting the foods...also they got my orders wrong. i went to drive thru so when i got home to find my foods not correct. i am disappointed cause how could they mess up a pollo bowl plus on ice tea!?? it was late at night but still just two orders! a bowl n an ice tea. i could turn back n ask for the right orders but i was lazy. so always check your orders before leaving the place. i won't return to this place but fair warning cause it's ridiculous. or maybe it's just that one night or something. not returning."}
{"text":"They believe gloves are optional. Definite health concern but the manager doesn't seem to notice or maybe doesn't care, not sure which but bad anyway you look at it. The staff becomes offended when ask them to use a glove. For some reason they just don't like wearing gloves when making the customers meal. The staff also eats on the job in between making the customers meal & doesn't wash their hands before working again. They eat right in front of you as you place your order. Again, another health issue. The last time I was there. One of the employees played with his greasy baseball cap before making a meal. Again, without a glove. Another employee went to the bathroom & didn't wash his hands! Don't go here. Call the health inspector. Get a new manager who cares about the consumers health in this restaurant. If I could give them a negative star I would. Filth!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up for the 50 cents - 1 dollar menu. Just got a 2 full bags of food for 2 and two drinks for 8 bucks. Taco bell's menu of cheap items are left in the dust here. Food is fresh for fast food."}
{"text":"I'm a little frustrated. The last two Sundays their 24 hour drive thru has been closed. The lights are on but no one is home."}
{"text":"Cant never come her late yall service is trash your staff is trash how tf you gunna look at me sideways cuz i walked up to your window dont for get my fucking straw simple... then yall dont give no chilling on my chilli cheese fries how fucking stupid yall niggas is retarded everywhere at all del tacos worldwide"}
{"text":"Just horrible seems like everywhere i been lately just trash azz service. You got a totally of 3 people working in this bssshh... like come on got a bissshhh sitting down on her phone while drive thru and inside is backed up like get back to work"}
{"text":"The food here is really greasy and salty, especially compared to Pollo Loco. It is cheap, though. I've ordered the chicken burrito, chicken quesadilla and hamburgers. Only the burgers were acceptable, and they were average at best. There's something about the food here that doesn't smell or taste right; I can't put my finger on it. 

The only plus at this Del Taco is that it's open 24 hours. I'd avoid it during the day if you have to get back onto 19th Ave going north, or Northern heading west. The traffic in this area is fucking terrible with lots of methhead-tweakers staggering around, too. I've actually seen 2 accidents at this intersection, one with a car/pedestrian (guy's ok, his shopping cart was not). Lastly, I don't think this location takes credit cards."}
{"text":"This del taco is one of the worst I've ever been too. I have been here three times. Ive waited to review because I wanted to give it a few chances. 

The employees are not the friendliest, we always have to wait a few minutes before we are greeted and able to order. 
The food is always cold. I'm so confused by this. Why is it every time I come we are served cold food.? The fries have never been fresh.  
Today's visit I got a quesadilla, the cheese wasn't even fully melted. It was gross. 
My husbands rice was hard, stuck together and not fresh at all. 

Today we ordered a kids meal and didn't receive one. So weird. 
We won't come back to this particular del taco."}
{"text":"Our food was good deal taco good!! It was put together in a timely manor.  

My review is for the awesome young guy working the register.  He was super friendly, outgoing and a great pick for the front!!! I can't say what is name is because I don't see name tags. To bad but we came in today (November 20, 2016; 1:00 pm)"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I hesitated to go in, we love del taco!! 
Our food was warm, minus the fries they were warm. Everything was delicious. 
The customer service was awesome.  The guy working the counter was super friendly and nice.  
The facilities were super clean.  I am glad my son and I stopped it. Was a nice snack after a long day of playing."}
{"text":"You have a choice here. Jack in the Box or Del Taco. Del Taco is great for breakfast, when you need something quick, or when there are 5 cars in Jacks drive thru."}
{"text":"I guess when you are really \"hungry\" and \"thirsty\" just about any kind of food will do. I always worry about heavily processed gas station style food anyway, you know, what is actually in the food you are about to bite into? But heck with enough hot sauce and high fructose soda it helps to smother out any questionable nuances. I just cross my fingers that the part time agitated looking employees don't take anything out on my particular bean and cheese burrito. It is what it is. Del Taco has it's moments. After a while most of this type of food all tastes about the same to me. It gives you just barely enough of what you need at the time."}
{"text":"This is the new 4th meal baby! Kick that taco bell out the curb and order some chipotle soft/hard tacos. Even them carbon tacos aka. street tacos. I'd take this over Taco Bell any day. I'm not really a fan of fast food, but I like this place alright! Bean burrito with green sauce FTW over taco bell's bean burrito thas fasho."}
{"text":"This place is just like the other place I reviewed. Nothing different about reviewing this place like the other one so I'm just going to copy and paste my other review from another Del Taco just a few miles down from this one.....

This is the new 4th meal baby! Kick that taco bell out the curb and order some chipotle soft/hard tacos. Even them carbon tacos aka. street tacos. I'd take this over Taco Bell any day. I'm not really a fan of fast food, but I like this place alright! Bean burrito with green sauce FTW over taco bell's bean burrito thas fasho."}
{"text":"Update! I haven't been in a awhile but it's as good as I remembered! I love speedy service with a side of nachos! 
The cats are still around- hanging out between the back fence and the drive thru menu. They seem happy just prowling around the premises. -see photo!"}
{"text":"They have a great dollar menu. Several items for a buck makes for a cheap lunch. This place is average for fast food Mexican. I liked the 1/2 pound bean and cheese burrito for $1.10."}
{"text":"I very rarely eat at Del Taco, but today I had a craving for fish tacos and this was the closest place to get them.

The staff is always friendly and helpful when placing your order.  However, the drive-thru has to be the strangest I have been through.  It's a weird angle and a tight turn.

I am always confused by their menu - Mexican food and hamburgers? Huh?  If it weren't for the deluxe chili cheese fries, I would probably never eat here.  And this was my first time trying their beer battered fish tacos.  They were decent, especially for the price.  But not the best I've ever had.

Overall, this place is A-OK.  Nothing spectacular, especially with a brand new, 24 hour Robertos just down the road...."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Clean.  Outdoor seating too.  Thursday chicken tacos 3 for $2 are delicious."}
{"text":"Thought I would give them another try. Still a lack of training for the kids that take the orders up front. This one was told by manager after my order was placed that he messed up my order. Instead of the manager adjusting the order once the mistake was caught, the over-charge of my meal left me ticked. Will NOT be back. Massive #fail on many levels!"}
{"text":"This place is not 24 hours. Not sure why it is advertised as such. Just got done working an 19.5 hour shift and all I wanted was a taco. I was told they can't do any transaction because it's the end of the day. But it's 5:15am so really it's the beginning of the day. This is the 4th time in a year this has happened. I don't usually eat fast food but when working long hours it's a quick fix. Thanks for making it even easier to swear off all fast food. On a side note the employee who told me this looked like he was just hanging out and not actually doing a dam thing."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful new location of Del Taco. I have to agree with other people that have reviewed them. They are very slow. There wasn't anyone in the drive threw and we were the only people in the dining room and it took 12 minutes to make 4 burritos. There was 6 staff members, all young, not working and just laughing and taking. It is great to have a good time at work but not when guest orders are pending. They should have made the food while taking."}
{"text":"I personally love Del Taco and their food.

But the service at the Drive-Thru at this location is slow, and terrible during late night.  They always ask you to wait when you pull up to order, sometimes for up to 10 minutes.

The last time I ordered just 2 fish tacos, and I got charged for some other customers meal.

They need to get it together.  They need training, badly."}
{"text":"This is my fav del taco. Also quick and efficient. I don't mix meat and dairy so I always ask for \"without meat\" and they never get it wrong. They give me as much fire sauce as I want. And for those in know, the pretty black lady who works at night has an amazing voice and used to sing at a lounge downtown."}
{"text":"Dude. I can't even call to cuss this place out! The phone is busy ALWAYS.

Your order will ALWAYS be wrong. Always.

I don't know how many times I have asked for a \"bean and cheese burrito with NO sauce\" and ended up will a sauce explosion. Nachos with no cheese, ask for a side of secret sauce... Get sour cream. 

Flour tortillas should be soft, not crunchy. Also, why are you hoarding the cheese? Put some on the tacos. 

Will drive the extra miles to not give them my business. 

Done."}
{"text":"Went yesterday through the drive thru.  I'd only been to Del Taco when I was inebriated and remembered it being amazing.  
Got a deluxe taco salad with beef ($4.59) which was good.  The shell was nice and crispy and it was full of shredded lettuce, refried beans, salsa, guac, ground beef, and sour cream.  
Also got a chicken quesadilla ($3.31).  It was amazing...the outside was crunchy and the inside was hot, gooey, melted cheese and chicken.  Loved it.  
The food came out quick.  The area is a little sketchy...I wouldn't want to park and go into the location but the drive-thru is okay.  Lock your doors!"}
{"text":"I am currently sitting in the drive thru waiting for 30 minutes because there is one cashier and she does not know how to multitask having a drive thru should be convenient if I had the time to get out the car I would have now I'm late to work because they are to busy talking and I called and no manager is present so they have no structure"}
{"text":"This is the only Del Taco I've been to and I dig it. I've never been much a fan of tacos, but for $2 I can get a nice, quick meal. I've only been inside once and it's fairly dirty, but the food is fine. I'll continue to enjoy the craving for cheap lunches."}
{"text":"Thanks guys working today for saying yes to 150 tacos in 30 min for a non profit event. You guys were awesome!"}
{"text":"New location. Still learning their way around the back of the counter. I counted 9 employees vs the typical 3-5 at a normal del taco location. Clean inside as expected being new. Food was fine no issues other than the wait for the food. They really stuff the tacos with cheese. Did I say cheese ? Seriously. Cheese !"}
{"text":"Well I've been here several times it's usually ok and food tasted ok. I happen to find myself in here the other day and had ordered a dell taco plain. Meaning no lettuce no tomato Cheese etc just meat. Well you can't make this stuff up. I got an empty hard shell. No meat nothing. Who orders a shell ? I also ordered one dell taco with cheese only. Guess what I got. A hard shell stuffed with cheese only. No meat ! I don't think whom ever was
Making dine in orders that day didn't understand English enough to make the tacos to order. Needless to say visiting this location going forward is not an option anymore. Just not worth the laughs anymore."}
{"text":"Needed something quick so stopped in for a burrito, Epic Ranchero Burrito.  Large very full burrito.  Received bean, sour cream, avacado and egg and a minimal amount of sauce.  It definitely could have used more.  It lacked overall flavor, just not very tasteful.  It could have used some pico de gallo, or at least salsa.  It did fill the stomach, just didn't satisfy the taste buds.  The one good thing about the burrito is that the way it is wrapped, It can be eaten while walking down the strip."}
{"text":"Always clean, always quiet. Employees are very chill/friendly 100% of the time. The place gets busier than normal during Taco Nights (Tue/Thurs) but even then it's a comfy amount of people and not a horde which is a plus in my opinion.

Soda machine has Dr. Pibb MAX which seals the deal, I love Del Taco so much."}
{"text":"My first and last time rating here ... I got some tacos and now I can't get out of bed !! I was up all night getting sick.... The food didnt taste right but i figured cuz i was used to taco bell... but i guess not.... I wanna feel better already!!"}
{"text":"Can't say best Mexican fast food but for quantity & $, plus taste, ok. Beef tacos are small when you buy the 12 pak, as the burrito deal. Tuesday's & Thursday's, they have specials for above mentioned. Fast, friendly but expect to wait at this location because every time we pass or go to this location their is a long line of cars/drive thru and inside same. Would of given higher rating but some of the tacos didn't even have anything on them. Definitely would recommend to ask for sauces."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with 59 cent tacos and now they have turkey tacos for that leaner protein treat. Add in some so called fresh guacamole an ice tea and Boom, quicky meal."}
{"text":"This was the worst del taco ever! The chips in the nachos were totally stale. The fries were cold and the service was VERY mediocre! Being from out of town and getting such poor food was SO DISAPPOINTING!"}
{"text":"Went through drive thru. Service was horrible. He had so much attitude because I wanted my order right. Was very rude. He told me i was ordering stuff  that was not on the menu. He just wasn't listening."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that the nachos no longer have nacho cheese and instead they now have queso blanco. Ended up throwing away an entire plate of nachos tonight after only two bites. I thought the main ingredient in nachos was nacho cheese?! Luckily there's a Taco Bell up the street. Please bring back the nacho cheese."}
{"text":"This place sucks. It is raining and it's cold I tried to place and order on the drive through and it took 3 tries because the person taking the order kept saying give me a second. Wait give me a second. Really!!!!! I order two tacos waited 30 minutes. Asked why it was taking so long and the person on the drive through closed her window very fast. Very rude. From start to finish.  
Del taco you need to train better your employees, or hire more people. better yet if your people can't handle the night shift get some one that can or close your facility early:"}
{"text":"I can't believe I am bothering to write a review for a Del Taco, but I cannot tell you how bad this location is. I don't go often, but they get my order wrong EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Today they only gave me half my order, and the half they gave was wrong. I am so over calling that place to fix my order, it's really close to my house, but I will not be back. Employees are very whatever when they \"apologize\" too. They don't even seem genuinely sorry that I had to make to trips for my food. The food is also lower quality than other locations. Not enough cheese in their quesadillas, mostly crusty tortilla. I got a taco from here one time that was practically an empty taco shell. I asked them explicitly if something had sour cream on it, they said no, it did and I couldn't eat it because I hate sour cream. They are a hot mess over there."}
{"text":"Let's stop lying to ourselves.  

You know I want you.  You know I can't stop thinking about you.  Sure, there are many more that are much better than you but whenever I see you pass by, I just gravitate towards you.  My eyes may wander to a more authentic sort but I always find myself paying and anxiously waiting to get my hands on the goodness that only your Macho Nachos can fulfill.  Pop the top off and I'm in Heaven.  You're a minx in ribbons of flowy golden cheese, adorned by rings of jalapeños. 

\"Just one more chip and I'll stop...\"

Foolish.  One becomes two, two becomes ten, and suddenly I'm staring down an empty paper plate feeling ashamed.  Why do I let myself be a slave to your processed cheesy goodness?  Why are those canned jalapeños so addictive?  And more importantly, why do I feel my jeans getting tighter?!

One day I'll quit you.  For now, here's the dough, get me another Aline Special...

[Yeah, I wrote a review for a chain.  Get over it.  I wanna be cool like siSTAR Aline N.!  Written also in celebration that my picture of the \"Aline Special\" is now the main picture.  Woohoo!  On the real though, great location and gets orders right.  That's all.]"}
{"text":"This location is really close to my work, and a group of my coworkers go here pretty frequently at lunch.  I'll go along with it as to not be left out.  I usually am a big fan of Del Taco, but this one is whack.  The cheese tastes old and moldy... just not right.  And there's not enough Del Scorcho sauce in the world to cover it up. And the ground beef they use has a different texture and appearance than I've see at any other Del Taco I've been too.  There's just something off about this Del Taco... like they get the unused leftovers from a better, more glorious Del Taco."}
{"text":"This Del Taco is by far the worst store  in the world. This particular franchise is so slow that It can take a half hour to 45 minutes to get through the drive-through the people that work in the franchise are lazy and not customer focused.  The manager Karen should be fired.  Would never recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"No one in line, no one inside and yet i still had to wait 5 min to place my order in the drive thru, another ten to finally get it. The drive thru guy does nothing but mumble. Got a bunch employees standing around doing nothing. Very rude unsanitary."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday for the taco special. I also ordered caramel cheese cake bites. When we got here the place was empty, with a few ppl in the drive-thru. 10 minutes later we were still waiting. When a guy who had been there for 2 min got his food, we asked about our order and saw the tacos were just sitting there and were told they are waiting on the cheesecake bites. A few minutes later they gave us the tacos and told us they'll call when the bites are ready. Well ... the tacos were cold. Cold cheap tacos don't tend to taste that great."}
{"text":"Tonight was the worst experience my family and I have had dining here. The food was not prepared in a timely manner. It took 35 mins for us to get our food and when we received it we didn't get what we ordered. Food was cold, employees were not friendly. Other patrons were complaining about the time it took and it was just an overall BAD experience. I asked for my money back and I think I will drive a little further the next time my family wants Del Taco."}
{"text":"Rudest fast food place in 89130. Don't go here unless u want horrible service and rude people especially after 10pm. Hopefully these people cheer up and get thankful for a job"}
{"text":"Went  through the drive thru ordered three tacos and big burrito. Lady asked if I wanted sauce I said yes she only gave me two packs SMH.."}
{"text":"I'm thankful they're open 24/7 it's come in hand so many times over the last few years... Menu changes once in a while and no real complaints... Everything I wanna tell you is not specific to this location... But two things are. They ran outta taco shells tonight! Guy was cool but that was funny..... Also kinda surprised multiple times at this location the iced tea did not taste fresh..... But the crew is always quality people.... Like tonignt they threw in extra taco since they ran outta shells!"}
{"text":"You can't beat it for the prices and they have specials most every day.  Sometime its just amazing and other times it's just OK.  But when two people can eat for less than $8.00 its not a bad joint."}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service I've witnessed.  I called up with a simple complaint and the \"manager\" talked over me, dismissing my legitimate concern of missing items.  He then hung up on me.  This place is pathetic and sad.  Boo, thumbs down.  Food was whatever; not as good as my normal Del taco.  Flagrant scum bags working the counter."}
{"text":"The service at this location was terrible! My husband and I wanted to get a quick bite to eat for an early dinner. Since Del Taco is walking distance away, we figured we'd give it a go. What a mistake! 

First off, this location shares a building with a Shell Gas Station so the parking lot was a hot mess. We almost got run over just trying to get to the door. 

The store had a sticky dirty feeling to it inside. We stood at the counter for a full five minutes before anyone acknowledged our existence. Finally, a man wearing a drive through headset took our order. He was very curt with us and rushed through the transaction. When I asked how big the large fountain drink was, he simply rang me up for a large drink instead.

The food was passable at best. We both opted for one of the epic burritos. More like mediocre burrito! The beans in mine are undercooked, the avocado was turning brown and the chicken was extremely bland. I'm not familiar with this chain, however, so maybe this is just par for the course. I'll give them a pass on the food.

While we were trying to enjoy our meal, not one, not two but three different people came and asked my husband and I for money. Now I understand that this is Central Phoenix but this made for an uncomfortable dining atmosphere. 

As we were leaving, I attempted to use their one and only bathroom before making the half mile walk back to the house. No such luck. I thought perhaps I needed a key to use the bathroom so I walked up to the counter. I made eye contact with the girl behind the counter, starting talking to her and she literally turned and walked away from me, and started playing on her phone. My jaw just about hit the floor! It's one thing to be too busy to take orders or help customers. It's another thing entirely to be so rude and unprofessional. I ended up using the bathroom at the Shell and walking home. 

If you want Mexican food with a side of sass and bad service, this Del Taco is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I've had okay service here but, my dad is frustrated beyond words because they never get his order correct. This place is okay but, it looks very unsanitary and run down which is why I won't return. It's really gross to think food is being prepared in here even though it tastes gross. They need to do some major repairs on the building and clean it up because I'm scared of the thought of dining in there."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have come here a few times with coupons and they are always SLAMMED! Which is totally fine and understandable since they are one of the only good 24 hour drive thrus in the area. They usually get through the line very quickly and with accuracy. Except yesterday they forgot to put in the 10 packets of Del Scorcho that I requested!! My favorite is their grilled fish tacos:) my husband likes the Double Del. Fast and friendly service can't beat that."}
{"text":"Not that I have really high expectations for a Del Taco, but sheesh..it's like nobody even works here, the drive thru line was wrapped around the building, and stagnant, so looked inside, hardly anyone inside....try that instead, nobody will come to the front counter for a looong time, at last...got waited on...while listening to angry customers on the drive thru intercom, and more angry customers inside waiting eternally for back ordered food...finally...food!! But wait... they forgot the meat completely in the burritos, and other people still hadn't gotten their back ordered food, so I give up! I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"After more then a dozen attempts and years of trying. This is absolutely the worst Del Taco I've ever been to. Food is crap, drive through took 20 min. Absolutely ridiculous! Don't do it!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 tacos and instead of the cashier offering me the deal for three tacos the girl goes ahead and just charged me. I didn't realize the deal till I seen the poster after I was leaving. Not to mention most of the employees look so lazy..."}
{"text":"Armed with a $1.00 off coupon on a combo meal that was soon expiring, I had a better than average experience here on my first dining jaunt to this particular Del Taco.  My medium-sized Macho Combo was anything but medium.  The large Macho Combo Burrito that was filled with meat, beans, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and some mayo soon became a gooey yet tasty mess in my hands.  The rippled Fries were well cooked and abundant, and an extra hard Deluxe Beef Taco overflowed with suitably red, cold, and fresh lengths of cut tomatoes.  Even my medium Coke Zero only required one refill to successfully wash down the whole repast.

Diane's generous helping of Cheese Fries, too, were laden with melted grated American Cheese, although her Cheeseburger patties were quite well done and the burger was low on melted cheese.  The dining room was rather chilly on a cold night.  But service was good, and the food ingredients that should have been hot were.

As always I had to be careful to select the right hot sauce packets to adorn my selections.  Del Taco's spiciest packets are not colored red or orange.  El Scorcho--which is very aptly named--is black!  Inferno is red.  And mild is orange.  So, if you just want to spice up your burrito and taco a little bit, don't reach for black or red packets.

Probably my best Del Taco experience to date!  3-1/2 stars overall."}
{"text":"I was initially excited for this location as it's right down the street from me. Not so much anymore. The food is almost always cold/wrong and I've received some bad service. Never had these issues with marks street location. When I do visit it's usually late at night after work. On multiple occasions in the drive thru with no one else in line I've come up to the window to pay to then be asked to back up in the drive thru until my order is ready and then pull up again?! How unprofessional is that and the only reason is for their timer for cars at the windows. They knock the order off the screen as it if was served to fake the timing number reporting to corporate. Terrible location."}
{"text":"Food is okay and service is about the same. It normally isn't so slow and it's right around the corner"}
{"text":"It sucks that this one is the closest to me. I really like Del Taco. But this location is probably one of the worst and slowest. Only about 5min away from the strip, could be why they are so dam slow.

I've been in different times of the day and it's always the same. One night, I waited over 30min at the speaker without them saying anything. I couldn't leave because there were cars behind me and a car in front. I proceeded to ask if they were closed and they said \"one minute, I'll be right with you\" after ordering we waited another 20mins before our food was ready.

They didn't even bother apologizing, and of course they messed up my order, which I realized once I was home. I called a couple of times and they wouldn't pick up. At this point there was no need to complain unless we wanted to wait another hour for \"fast food\""}
{"text":"We love this place!! We drive here from Casa Grande just to eat here!! It is our favorite Americanized taco place. The tacos are always filling and everything is always fresh.  Sadly my son spilled my drink all over. I went to get a mop or towel to clean it up and they told me not to worry about it and promptly cleaned it up for me. Good job Del Taco!"}
{"text":"Fast, convenient, and always delicious! Probably my favorite place to go either before or after work! Classic grilled chicken burrito is one of my fave items!"}
{"text":"very slow, no ice on my drink, and charged me for a wrong order so now I see two charges on my statement :("}
{"text":"I have always preferred Del taco over Taco Bell.  I had the BLT Ranch Grilled Chicken Burrito (2 for $5).  It was a good, cheap, quick meal."}
{"text":"The drive thru man had no clue how to process your coupon that was free with the purchase of gift cards at Christmas. Everyone there working a register should know how to process a coupon that is the company's own coupon.  When dining inside the lady is very good and knows how to process these coupons. But the man had no idea, and rather than just hand me my meal and figure the coupon our, I waited an extra 3 minutes at the window for him to get training on how to process the coupon.

He didn't even apologize for the excessive wait while he \"learned how to do his job\" on my time.

Very unprofessional and he lacked any concern of courteous customer service.  He should be retrained to apologize for excess delays and such, in addition to learning how to work the register with coupons.

Not sure I want to return to this location."}
{"text":"Good deals for cheap food - recently they had a $2 breakfast special consisting of two egg & cheese burritos with hashbrowns.  Hard to beat that.

This location suffers from one major flaw - that it is located alongside a busy road in the parking lot of a Home Depot.  So, this means there are tons of... let's say... loiterers.  When a patrol car occasionally makes a round through here, the loiterers all scramble into Del Taco or run in various directions.  They also stare at your car in the parking lot if it happens to be nice.

So, drive your beater if you eat here, and don't eat here if you're bothered by a lot of loiterers outside."}
{"text":"Probably the best Del-Taco within a significant radius in this part of town.  This place is the cleanest, with nicest staff, and food is much faster and better tasting for fast food.  It's the closest to how I remember del Taco being a decade ago when I first tried them.  For the exact opposite experience, go to the one on 59th ave & Beardsley."}
{"text":"Yes, they make mistakes and forget parts of the orders. Just call them and they will attempt to fix it. 
At least the Hispanic crew is not rude. They are not perfect, but then again who is. We grab a bite to eat here at least once a week because it's near our home and on our way to church."}
{"text":"Del taco is hands-down the best late-night drive-through food. If you give me this place less than 4 stars and compare it to other sit down restaurants you're not understanding the point of reviews. 

It's better than Wendy's, Taco Bell, Jack-in-the-Box, McDonald's Etc. Where else can you get cheesecake bites, strawberry lemonade, and delicious crunchy fish tacos PLUS crinkle cut french fries?

P.S. the drive-thru workers on The Late Night Shift rule :-) most places shut down their ice cream machine but not these people. They keep the frozen dairy goodness flowing."}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry for week day lunch, this is the place to go. Quick, pleasant, accurate. They know how it's done and the food is not bad, either:)"}
{"text":"I usually don't eat to much fast food but. When I decided to go I realize why I don't eat fast food. Why cause you don't know how really old the meat is specially late night early morning. Why I say that . I order 4 tacos though the drive though around 3-4am. As I pulled up to the window to pay the cashier walked away from the window and I see another guy filling up hot water from the coffee machine into a lexan (metal pan) and started mixing it. I was a little what was inside and I knew it was meat they were warming up and sifting it up to put in my tacos. I asked the cashier if that was old meat . He said no it's the hot water we put under to keep the food warm. I'm not stupid I'm in the restaurant industry since I was 16and I'm 36. I know what he was doing. After I said this comment the other gentlemen approaches the window to re assure me that he threw that away and was putting new stuff. N I said no worries. I know what was going on so I guess this would be the last time I eat Del taco late night or even for ever. I hope I don't get food poisoning out of this."}
{"text":"No surprises here. Never had a bad experience with drive thru. Their value tacos are a really good fill in, cheap and tasty. Not greasy at all!
Not saying this is great Mexican food, but it's pretty good drive by."}
{"text":"I went to this location the other night and the sprinkler next to the order menu in the drive thru magically started spraying into my window when I pulled up. And the guy at the window just happened to know about it when I pulled up to tell him. Then after I fed my kids the crap they gave me. They have had the runs since. If you don't want to do your job right. Dont. Quit so someone who wants to work can do it. I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and quick to serve me.the cashier was somewhat new, but did a good job. Restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"I love del taco, so I visit frequently. I've been sad that the past 3 times I've ordered my Deluxe chili cheese fries, they add sour cream and every time I ask for NO SOUR CREAM. Tonight I went for some dinner, and unfortunately the same thing Happened...sour cream was added to my food:( I never complain, but this time I had to. I spoke with the manager Stephanie, and she was absolutely awesome. She fixed my order and gave the kids some shakes for having to come back. I was absolutely pleased with her, and she is the true definition of a manager. Thank you again!!!"}
{"text":"Had to leave the counter and go through the drive through just to be acknowledged. Super pissed me off when all one of the four employees there had to do was say anything even kind of like \"be right there\"."}
{"text":"Honestly the slowest del taco ever! I have been sitting in the drive Thur for 30 mins! People are honking there horns it's so bad! Manager needs to gets this on wrap cause this is the worst ever! They didn't even acknowledge the fact everyone was waiting so long! A simple we are so sorry for the wait would be nice! The worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"Del Taco (insert greater than sign) Taco Bell.  Period!

Del Taco uses better ingredients than Taco Bell/Taco Hell.  Real meat vs \"proteins, which can include all kinds of fillers favored by cost cutting TB.  And hot food is served hot!

I stop by here every once in awhile, because if you want a quick fast food chain burrito or tacos, this is the brand to turn to.  It's not gourmet but still nom nom yum good.  Plus I had good memories of Tuesday taco eating contest with the college roomies back in the days when it was $0.99 for 3 tacos (different location).  

BTW, if you are going to do taco eating contests, don't get the soft shell tacos like I did.  It was like a work out for your jaw after you are only 1/2 way through your first dozen."}
{"text":"Every time I go there they forget something or mess something up. 

This time I wasn't given the nachos I ordered and paid for... And no receipt.

Great. Thanks for charging me for the lunch I didn't get to eat."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst fast food places! So disappointed.  Service is sucks. I don't appreciate how I work all day to earn $$ and go for a quick bite and get ripped off. It is not my fault you didn't finished school or dropped out and have no education and now your stuck working minimum wage . But don't rip other people off by the crappy service and crappy food."}
{"text":"Love the fish tacos. Tuesdays & Thursdays they have a great deal on tacos after 3pm. If you save your receipt & fill out the online survey, you get a deal on your next order. Love the staff that works here! :)"}
{"text":"First time having Del Taco.  The breakfast burrito was amazing!  The staff was very friendly too.  We came back for dinner, same great customer service and everything we ordered was great."}
{"text":"I hardly write reviews but I just wanted to take the time to acknowledge Silvia. She was working the drive thru. She was very nice and her smile and politeness really brightened my day. I really appreciate people who take the time to be genuinely nice and I wanted to recognize that. Thank you Silvia for being so kind and happy!"}
{"text":"The food is great when this location is open (I'm talking about their supposed NORMAL HOURS!) Read the reviews and know that they will close up to an hour and a half early. The employees here have been doing this crap for years!!! They close the store early and get paid for time they didn't work!!! I've complained at least five times to corporate and NOTHING WORKS!!Tonight we arrived 50 minutes before closing time and they were closing everything down already!One of the two workers was on her phone and we were the only ones in line, it took 17 minutes to make 3 tacos and 4 burritos!!! 
Read the reviews and wake up Del Taco!!!"}
{"text":"Want to have homeless stare at you while you order your food? Want to catch their eye and have them limp over and hassle you for change while you are waiting in line? Want to have your order messed up and even if they do happen to get it right, it will be awful? Then this Del Taco is for you.

Of all the Del's in Phoenix this one is the worst. At one time it was very very good and then it just went to heck. Maybe it was the influx of homeless and hookers that drove it down the hole. 

My final order was for tacos. They served up mostly empty tacos with just a little bit of meat on it and then covered it in shredded lettuce. I unwrapped my last taco and the final insult was a reversal with the lettuce filling the entire taco and just some meat sprinkled on top of the lettuce. So 99 percent lettuce isn't a taco, it's an invitation to leap the counter and punch the worker in the snot box. I didn't make you get this hellish job, so don't take it out on me or my order. 

One more place in this hell hole I won't be going back to."}
{"text":"These guys are slow as hell! I put my order in at 11:45 a.m. and got my food at 12:15 . What the hell are these guys doing in the back shooting craps , You guys need to get it together ! You might as well call this place future tacos, cuz you'll  get  your food in 30 years from now. Bastards!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of eating at fast food places that aren't on the East Coast, so my mister suggested this place. It's like taco bell, but they also serve hamburgers. Food is cheap, hits the spot, but nothing I'll be vying for anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yum!  A great way to recharge after hiking!  Don't forget to try their spicy jack quesadillas!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located next to Southpoint Hotel and Casino so if you're looking for non hotel food dining walk or drive to this Del Taco location.

Service is as expected with any Del Taco."}
{"text":"Del Taco is the best Mexican chain fast food ever. Go on Tuesday for taco tuesdays. It's 3 regular (beef) tacos (hard or soft) for $1. Otherwise the tacos are $.49 each. Thursday are 3 chicken soft tacos for $2. Yes, it's totally worth it. Get the Del Inferno sauce if they have it. I get 90000 packets and use it when I cook (when that happens 4 times a year). The chili cheese fries are bomb too. But don't order any of the burgers here; it's a trap!"}
{"text":"They have the most rude manager ever! They always talk rudely in the back. They tell you to leave when you don't order right away. I love Del Taco but I won't put up with these people again."}
{"text":"i am tired of spending the cost for a spicy jack quesadilla and get no cheese!!  and the times i order it w chicken, i'm lucky to get 10 small pieces of chicken and/or green sauce(even when i ask for green sauce).   aren't the ppl even trained??!!  one star!!!!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-through and I didn't get a straw and there was no chicken in my chicken bowl. Not coming again"}
{"text":"I am reviewing their French Fries- I know weird but they are really delicious! If you like fries  check them out."}
{"text":"Worst service ever from Del Taco. We were the only one at the counter and it took the guy 3 mins to greet us. Than said one moment. After 10 mins we finally got our food. Never ever to this Del Taco again."}
{"text":"This location gets 4 stars due to it's service.  I go here often for Taco Tuesday, and you can't beat the price for what you get.  But the service is always exceptional.  I can't speak for drive thru because I always eat in but my buddy and I keep going back because they are nice, quick, and will even deliver your food to your table if they aren't completely busy.  Plus the hard shell tacos are more crisp and less greasy"}
{"text":"Horrible Service Still. 

I really hate when these places fall threw the cracks. 
Will try again in another year."}
{"text":"Love this place,  Love the People. They know our Order. Kind friendly. Never screw up. Well maybe once. But who remembers. THIS is how customer service should be. Just so respectful.  It is always a Joy coming here.  The Last Del Taco was a Nightmare.

I wish I knew the Workers names. But they are all Epic here.
Thank you for knowing how to treat people =D"}
{"text":"Looking for fast service on a 30 minute lunch break!? Del taco is the place to go. Very friendly staff and food is alway fresh. Bean and cheese burrito is my favorite! Also check your mail for coupons!"}
{"text":"They refused to do separate orders because they were \"busy\", with 2 cars in the drive thru and no one behind us"}
{"text":"Although their posted hours say \"24 hours,\" this location is quite literally ALWAYS closed after midnight. Currently sitting here at 12:30 am, watching 3 workers inside doing god knows what, and the guy with the headset for the drive thru says their closed. I don't understand how your 24 hour drive thru frequently closes at night."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Del Taco.  This location is normally good but their Hard Shell Tacos have so few ingredients they should be embarrassed to serve them.  It's been like this the last 3 times I've eaten there.  Raise prices if you need to but quit being so cheap.  The Chicken Tacos are great here. Beef Burrito same thing hardly any meat."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Their burritos are ridiculously small, in the pic is a kids burrito and a 1/2 POUND red burrito no difference until you open it surprise-- no beans!! This thing definitely does not weigh a half POUND, maybe a quarter pound because of the tortilla!! And the shift manager made this meal, crap."}
{"text":"Walked in and walked right back out, it's stupid slow. It's supposed to be FAST FOOD. What the heck Del Taco?? Get it together"}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to this location for over 15 yrs. It was the best place to get your order right...BUT the las few weeks has been terrible!  They have got our order wrong the last 5 times.  There is always something missing or just plain wrong. What the heck is with them saying to not pull all the way forward, wait at the corner and they will wave you forward??  So they have crappy service and mess your order up."}
{"text":"Del Taco is one of my favorite fast food destinations due to the quality and freshness and this location met those expectations, the reason for the middle of the road star is there is no Wi-Fi.  Moving forward more locations will implement that for their business and it isn't a destination I would revisit when I can go to another location that allows me Free Wi-Fi"}
{"text":"FREAKING AMAZING!  Probably because I REALLY wanted Del Taco!"}
{"text":"Worst taco ever.  Chili cheese fries sucked!  Maybe this is tolerable at 3AM when you are drunk, but please, taco bell puts this to shame.  And it's with a heavy heart that I make that statement."}
