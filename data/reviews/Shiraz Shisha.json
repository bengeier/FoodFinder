{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this place. Service was humble and the food was authentic and delicious. Unfortunately the current owners have taken the quality of food and service backwards.   The food is old, overcooked - absolute disgrace to middle eastern cuisine. The service is unprofessional. Overpriced menu, with little to offer.   The addition of hookah to their menu is a desperate attempt to capitalize on a fad that frankly complicates what this restaurant was originally known for - it's delicious food.   Very disappointed. Highly recommend against wasting your money here."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, at long last our Persian friends across Richmond Hill are beginning to open amazing independent businesses that showcase not only their food but their culture. I had the pleasure of dining at Shiraz shortly after they opened (a long time ago) and the shawarma salad I ate at the time was as good as any other I'd had, however, given the countless places I visit in a given week it slipped my mind to review them so long ago...   That was until I noticed a sign on the road side declaring that Shiraz was now open late 7 days a week and offering Hookah's - happy days!!! As a hookah pipe owner myself, there is just something extra special about not having to pack your own bowl and clean up after - those who've had to do this themselves know what I'm talking about. So when a friend and I were looking for a chill place to hang out last night that a) wasn't a bar, b) wasn't coffee, c) wasn't too far from Oak Ridges, I was thrilled to recall the new hours and services offered (I just proved that road side signage DOES in fact work!)  Located in the No Frills plaza just north of King Road in Oak Ridges (you won't be able to see it from the road BUT it's directly behind the McDonalds) Shiraz is a gorgeous and modern looking restaurant & cafe, offering all your fave Persian cuisine options. I foresee this becoming a very busy spot once word gets out, it's cool looking enough to take a date OR chill enough for a group of guys to hang out watching the Sunday night NFL game while puff-puff-passing and chatting.  We went for the Persian black tea, $1.50/cup, (which DEFINITELY packs a caffeine wallop) to accompany our Double-Apple/Mint Shisha. The service of the hookah pipes were spot on, out coals were changed before they could entirely burn out (placed 2 at a time) and the tea was piping hot and strong - as it should be. The hookah was $14 which is fairly standard for what I'm used to paying at local competitor Mandala, the main difference? Shiraz has their liquor license while at last check Mandala was still trying to get theirs.   My only point of criticism comes from the seating in Shiraz as I found the benches in the booth to be a very hard plastic with little give and became a little uncomfortable to sit on after a hookah session - perhaps some pillows might help? Otherwise great experience, hoping they have WiFi so I can work here occasionally!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The food was delicious. A nice atmosphere and a great dining pleasure.  The kabobs were well-cooked and the rice was delicious.  The appetizer was delicious, but above all, the service was excellent.  we love the Shisha, we try something new every time we go there."}
{"text":"The food quality is always good. I once tried greek poutine, i wasnt too hungry and wasnt expecting much for the poutine, seeing as how its a persian restaurant, but man that was some good shit. No joke. Shisha is very good, had no problems.  I would definitely go back there, the only things stopping this from being a 5 star is the service and the price.  Service is friendly for sure, just a bit slow and i feel that for the amount of food you get, it may be a bit pricy.  4.5 seems more exact, would go again."}
{"text":"Worst excuse for a shisha bar. Their over staffed and they still take 20 min to get us our hookah. Not to mention their shit attitude. Food is garbage. Absolute waste of money.  A tip for the owners - find better staff who have good personalities and know how to serve some dope shisha.   Would not recommend obviously but if your in the mood for some good shisha, go buy a pack of bogeys."}
{"text":"I've eaten at most of the Iranian/persian restaurants in Richmond Hill and this one does lamb and beef better than most of them."}
{"text":"Never again  Rude staff  And infested with load obnoxious teens n owners friends"}
{"text":"Excellent kabobs. The food is very tasty.   Excellent hookah. Has some organic flavored hookah.   The service is outstanding.   Very happy with this establishment."}
