{"text":"Went for breakfast with my husband and found it to be the best priced breakfast for great value!  Finding bottomless coffee included with your breakfast is rare in Calgary.  Actually, this is the first place I've found.  The bacon is clearly deli bacon, so very meaty.  Mine was a little overdone, but I'm sure I can kindly ask for it be a little less crispy next time.  Such a friendly atmosphere, clearly lots of regulars.  I'm hoping to go back soon to try her burgers and poutine."}
{"text":"I cannot believe it took me this long to try Naina's.  We shared the special - Spaghetti stuffed burger (with side salad) and added a side of a half-sized poutine. That was a perfect amount of food for two of us being moderately hungry.  We didn't know where to start with all the possible stuffing combo's, so figured the special was the way to start. It was an odd combo, but it worked fantastically. The burger is huge and juicy, and managed to stay mostly together so it wasn't too messy to eat.  The poutine was fantastic - nice and peppery with a beef gravy.  You place your order at the counter, and then sit and wait for your food. Everything is made fresh so there is a bit of a wait, but it is well worth it. The restaurant is pretty small, and filled up fast, so I would recommend trying to go at \"off-peak\" hours.   I can't wait to try some of the other menu items - especially the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Tiny place, almost hidden but well worth searching for. It has the feel of a small-town cafe where the locals come to read their morning paper with a coffee, but while their menu is simple and homey, the food goes above and beyond.  The stuffed burger is amazing, with a soft bun that holds up and doesn't fall apart halfway through. If you get it with fries, you're pretty much full for the rest of the day. It's good stuff, is what I'm saying.    Giving it a 4 because I haven't tried all of the menu, but will hopefully be getting back soon."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews and the legion of loyal customers I may got shot for my review but, here goes! (Just pure honesty from my experience folks!)  I am really not sure what the hype is about with this place... Let me tell you why I question this.  The restaurant itself is small with nine tables. At 1:30 on a Saturday I had anxiety about whether we were going to have a place to sit. I didn't see one table get wiped down the whole time we were there and every chair in this place has one leg that is too short so you tip the whole time you are sitting down. Everyone knows how annoying this is!   The atmosphere is like going to an elderly aunts house with old china and books as decorations and the 'help yourself' command is a bit disconcerting. Like being at someone's house for the very first time and having to act like you are completely comfortable making yourself at home.   The food. I have now learned that over $30 for two people at a burger joint is the 'going rate'. Hubs and I both had the 1/4 lb burgers. Ya, not good. Thin, over done and dried out. Maybe we should have tried a stuffed burger that everyone raves about. Maybe then they wouldn't be able to over cook it. The burger bun was cold and the cheese on my burger wasn't melted (or even centered on my burger). The burger also looks tiny on these huge buns. The poutine was good and the gravy tasted homemade. Thank you!  The service was uncomfortably over friendly. Just trying not to make eye contact in the fear the very loud and gushing verbal assault may be directed at you. Some people may like this, I do not. The wait for our burgers wasn't bad, only 10-15 minutes. I feel sorry for the multiple tables who came in before us and still didn't have their food by the time we got ours. Maybe they ordered the magical stuffed burgers and had to wait to ensure the burger was sufficiently over done.   I understand this place is a tourist attraction in the city and kind of a 'big deal', with being on the Canadian Food Network show 'You Gotta Eat Here'. They also have pictures of our mayor eating there and have loyal, local customers... they can have it, it is all theirs!!!"}
{"text":"New location for the well known burger joint. I'd been meaning to try it for years, but the move to 17th Ave made it a lot more convenient.  Great burgers and nice service. Definitely better than the other 'gourmet' burger options around town and a lot less pretentious. Will certainly be going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered Chicken Curry poutine because of the Calgary poutine week  We thought curry sauce was made proportional that did not overwhelm the gravy.  We love the fried noodles pieces that was topped on the curry poutine.  It was a great décor and compensated some of the fries crispness that was lost in the gravy.  We also ordered the 1/4lb Jalapeno & Swiss burger and found ourselves indulged in mouthful of burger juice.  It is definitely a great local burger joint that I would bring friends and family to visit again."}
{"text":"TLDR: Naina's has the best burgers I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Niana's Kitchen is a tiny little restaurant just off of blackfoot trail kitty corner to the Crossroads Farmers Market.  You could drive by it a thousand times and never give it the time of day because it's in the little crap strip mall in an industrial area that looks half closed down.  If you continue to drive by it however, you'll be missing out on something wonderful.  My first visit, I got I believe the Mediterranean stuffed burger.  Anyway, it was stuffed with bacon, goat cheese and other amazing and wonderful things.  When I saw it was a stuffed burger, I figured I might get a bit of the flavor of the stuffings, however when you bite into that burger, it's bursting with flavor!  There was goat cheese in almost every bite and I was in absolute heaven.  I was also really impressed with the fries.  I'm perpetually bored with fries, even from places that have amazing food.  The fries at Naina's are seasoned wonderfully.  They were cooked perfectly and a bit spicy.  I actually enjoyed eating them.  I found Naina's about a week ago, and I've returned 3 times since.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite burger in calgary. You can stuff it with whatever you want and it's always made fresh. I love the jalapeño, cheddar, bacon and mozza stuffed burger. I wouldn't recommend the poutine or pulled pork stuffed burger."}
{"text":"Dill pickle poutine  with dill pickle gravy is amazing! !  It's all amazing! ! Best place in town"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food is great!  The owner is really pleasant and friendly and greets you as soon as you walk in the door.  The amount of items on the menu is a little overwhelming, but you're certainly not short on options.  Great service, great food.  Definitely worth driving a little out of our way to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Are you like me and love off the beaten path hole in the wall eating establishments? Do you like cramming deliciousness into your body? Do you like burgers? Well do yourself a favor and come here and order a stuffed burger. (You know it must be exceptional because a. I normally hate everything and b. I'm taking time to write about it)"}
{"text":"Had the Buffalo Chicken grilled cheese. Was excellent. Great food!! Will definitely come back again as there are so many choices of grilled cheeses, burgers, mac n' cheese and poutine."}
{"text":"This is the best little hole in the wall. You order at the front and food is brought to your table. The lady helping us was not your average restaurant worker. She had a great sense I humour, not afraid to skip the formalities. Our wait for our food was longer than average, because the server said they weren't typically as busy on Sunday, but they've run off their feet all morning. It was worth the 30 min wait. My grilled cheese on white, buttery bread was stacked with spinach, bacon cheese and sundried tomatoes, with a nice green salad on the side. The kind of salad that actually has green romaine in it,not floppy white iceberg lettuce and gross ranch dressing. It came with home made honey mustard dressing. . . . home made!!  My boyfriend's stuffed burger was a monster and he declared it was one of the most delicious he's ever had. It didn't even fit in the bun. The fries on the side were tasty as well. It says a lot about how massive the burger was because he had to let me finish his fries.  I'm definitely coming back to try my own burger . . . or another grilled cheese. . . it maybe breakfast . . . ."}
{"text":"The best burger in town!  Good quality ingredients. Hard to find places like this one. Can't wait to go back :D"}
{"text":"We hit up Naina's because we needed some comfort food, and they have that in spades. The menu largely consists of base Mac 'n' cheese, burgers, grilled cheese and poutine which can all be customized with various additions. As they are quite close to the Macleod Trail pedestrian overpass for the Saddledome and they have parking out back, coming here for pre-game gnash would be a no-brainer! We got the classic Mac 'n' cheese, and a Benny stuffed burger (stuffed with ham, hollandaise, and a poached egg) upgrades to a half poutine side. Waaay more food than we could eat. And we were hangry going in. The MnC was very cheesy and gooey despite being only lukewarm, with some busted up chips and goldfish on top. I think they put sour cream in there as it's a bit sour, which I liked but the wife wasn't so keen. The burger was good, as was the poutine with very medley curds. The only knock against the burger was the lemon marmalade on the bun, which was not bad but a bit unbalancing. The staff were very attentive, with the chef coming out to ask how everything was as well. A great local business, you've got to come and try this place at least once."}
{"text":"I have always liked burgers.... always. I enjoy finding new burger places and trying to \"top\" my best. Well.... This place takes first place hands down!!! Saw an episode of \"you gotta eat here\". Decided to give it a try .... had a Mac and Cheese stuffed burger and Donair Poutine.  Was soooooo impressed the food was ALL home made. The flavours blended and mixed to create an explosion in your mouth. The owner came by and asked us how we were enjoying our meal - OMG outta this world!!!!  A new burger AND poutine special weekly. I think I may be in love ........"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I usually go to the near-by Mugshotz for wings but one day it was closed and as we were dejectedly leaving the parking lot the owner come out side and encouraged us to give Naina's a try. We did and were we ever pleased with our choice. The stuffed burger is amazing, so much so I've never had anything else there.    It's unfortunate as much care doesn't go into the fries though, they appear to be of the freezer variety rather than home made, that one little detail would go along way. You're already going to be waiting 15-20 minutes for your burger since it needs to be hand made, why not add some fresh cut, home made fries as well? Either way it won't stop me from going back, the burgers themselves are well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The burgers are humungous, HUMUNGOUS!  And they stuff them...with pulled pork or jalapenos or...there's a list...  The fries were pretty decent too.  The atmosphere is homey and staff are all pretty awesome.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is brutal.   We waited over 70 minutes for our food, while at least 3 tables who ordered after us got their food. When we pointed this out to the waitress, she argued with us. Very poor customer service, especially considering it was lunch hour on a weekday and the place was only 2/3 full.   When our food finally arrived, the orders were screwed up. Given that they serve stuffed burgers, you'd think they would label the ingredients on the plate instead of guessing.   Our server explained that it took so long for our food because \"the beef they use isn't very good\" for forming burgers, which doesn't explain why so many other tables got their order before us.   By the time we had finished our meal (and were extremely late returning to our jobs), we got a measly 10% off our bill, which works out to about $1.80 per person.   I won't be returning to this place again and won't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Naina's last Thursday.  It's in a little strip mall nearby the Crossroads Market.  I would never have noticed if my coworker C had not discovered it on his burger hunt.  Six of us went for lunch, and to make the best use of our lunch time, we called in our orders ahead of time.  We all came for the stuffed burgers, and they did not disappoint.  For $11.50 you can stuff the burger with ingredients such as pulled pork, mozzarella, onions, jalapenos etc.  and a side of soup, salad or fries.  I ordered my burger stuffed with mozzarella, jalapenos, and mushrooms, a soup.  The soup was great.  The burger was delicious.  I was not overly full, probably because it was only 1/2 lb of beef stuffed with other deliciousness.  While we were chowing down on our burgers, I took a quick look at what else is available on menu.  There is a Five cheese Mac n Cheese I want to try and the breakfasts look reasonably priced.  French Toast server with Homefries is only $5.75, and 2 eggs with Bacon, Ham or Sasuage, homefries, and toast is only $6.  They are only open weekdays, but if I'm in the neighborhood on a weekday I would like to try the breakfast."}
{"text":"Great burger. Great price Found this place from a online review ( not yelp ). Burger worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'll add my voice to the crowd and agree that Naina's is where it's at when it comes to burgers and poutine in this city. Come prepared for a huge, delicious meaty meal and you won't be disappointed.   It's a tiny (but clean) little hole-the-wall in the Ogden Rd industrial area, with a comfortable, cheerful ambiance. Order at the counter, then find a seat in the small dining area and they'll bring your food to you. Our server was very friendly, joking around with us and giving her food recommendations.   The stuffed burgers are sooo juicy and good (and massive) -- I had the bacon mac 'n' cheese stuffed and I'm looking forward to trying other combos. The poutine was seriously some of the best I've ever had. The fries tasted super fresh and were perfectly done, and the gravy was very flavourful without being too salty. Just go, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Wow! Hidden gem here!! It's a small hole in the wall with cheap decor but the menu is mostly scratch made and the stuffed burgers are freakin delicious! You get the option of soup, salad or homecut fries and the soup and fries were both the bomb (both made in house).  It could easily get packed in there so watch out but they also have a few tables outside so that should help.  I will definitely be hitting this little honey hole again!"}
{"text":"The stuffed burger with pulled pork and onions was great.  Lots of flavour in the burger .. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I first came here a few years ago after dropping my car off at my mechanic just around the corner. I have to thank the guys there for recommending this place. I never mind waiting for my car to be worked on because I get to have a delicious meal while I wait.   I have had several meals here, and they are always great with a home cooked comfort to them. As you will read in other reviews, the stuffed burgers are amazing, but you should also try their grilled cheese sandwiches. While I enjoy the traditional, they have some awesome variations!  This is a small family owned place, so during busy times you may have to wait for your food, but trust me it is worth it. If you're looking for a cozy grandma's kitchen feel and taste, look no further."}
{"text":"Naina's is quite the hot spot before the Flames game, and being that they've been featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\", there's no question why.  Their expansive menu ranges from mac & cheese, to poutines to burgers, all of which can be personalized or you can choose one of their standards. Standards is a bit of stretch - I don't think you can called a perogie stuff burger \"standard\" lol  I went with the traditional 1/4 lb burger with a side poutine (which also came with pickles and coleslaw), and oh man, was it a lot of food! No doubt you get your money's worth here! I ended up packing up half my meal (yayyy 2nd dinner lol)  Everything tastes home cooked and the atmospheric really makes you feel like you're at their namesake - Grandma's kitchen  Tip: if you dine here before a game, display your receipt on your dash and you can park in their lot for free"}
{"text":"Great small atmosphere, friendly staff. Food was amazing ABC grilled chesse was perfect."}
{"text":"really really good. get the poutine. one downside is it takes a while but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Wow! The food is epic here! First time coming here, they just moved to this location a couple weeks ago. We ordered the eggs benny poutine, Nainalicious stuffed burger, and Mac & cheese with pork, bacon, and ham (also had chips and goldfish crackers on top). Everything was amazing, none of us finished our plates. We have to come back and try the other enticing items on the menu. They also have gluten free options too. Parking is free which is a plus. The service was also fantastic, very friendly, the owner came up and checked up on us too."}
{"text":"Been here like 20 times its always great tasting and amazing the service is good to sure it takes time to make your food but they clearly state it's not fast food"}
{"text":"I never knew what I was missing not having tasted a stuffed burger. When I tried the Nainalicious Burger I was in heaven. Sauteed onions, pulled pork, cheese and a granny smith apple slice. The apple is what makes it. That tart crunch will bring youth your knees. I am cutting back on bread these days so i get my burger on a bed of salad. It is delicious and I don't even miss the bun. Plus, since I gave up the bun, I decided that I could enjoy a few forkfuls of my stepdaughter's pulled pork poutine. OMG it was GOOD.   We will be back to this not that easy to find hole in the wall. Love supporting LOCAL!"}
{"text":"Unreal food.  Great service.  First time eating here, amazing.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My first experience at Naina's Kitchen last year was really not that memorable. We called ahead and picked up our stuffed burgers to eat at work. I was not overly impressed but continued to see great reviews around social media, so I decided to give it another go... and I'm very glad I did. I was nearby with a friend, so I took him there to see what his opinion was. This time we ate in. The stuffed burgers were amazing. I had cheddar stuffing and my friend cheddar/bacon, so the fillings weren't piled high. The meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The buns were nice and fresh. I added a side of poutine (just curds) and it was excellent too, with plenty of cheese and gravy. I have my eye on the 5 cheese mac n' cheese for next time.   There isn't much service. You order at the front, get your own drink from the cooler and then sit down where ever you can. Someone does bring your food but no one checks on you. If you need anything, you're on your own to search it out. The staff are really friendly and you can see how run off their feet they are. It seems they need more help.  Another downside is that this place is in desperate need of a make over. Overhead tiles in the ceiling are missing, dusty dead/fake plants in the corner, newspapers piled up all over. It's not pretty. But the stuffed burgers make you forget all about that!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This bad boy has been on the list for a very long time. So excited to finally get hands on one of their burgers.  The new location is awesome and cant believe how many tables they have. Plus the parking in the back is an added bonus. Found out that if you come eat here before an event at the Done, you get free parking. Way to sweeten the deal Naina's!  We went for YYC Burger Battle 2017 and tried their Canadian Sugar Rush ($17). A house made glazed donut holding a 1/2lb Alberta beef burger, stuffed with Canadian back bacon and local cheese curds, topped with Canadian cheddar. Dressed with bacon bourbon jam, pickled onions, crisp lettuce, and amber ale mayo. And it was great! Doughnut roll was just sweet enough and the bun was firmer than expected so didn't crush down like a regular doughnut would.  Also tried the Nainalicious Stuffed Burger ($15.95). Stuffed with pulled pork, aged cheddar, Granny Smith apple, and caramelized onions. Pork in the center was well seasoned and didn't overpower the beef of the burger.  Both came with ou choice of sides so went with chopped salad and turned our fries into poutine.  There was 3 of us, so we each had 2x 1/3 of each burger. This was more than enough. 1/2lb of burger would be too much for me. But without sides we could have done it.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Only thing I didn't love was the poutine. Gravy and cheese curds were fantastic, but the fries tasted like either the oil wasn't hot enough when they went in, or they were fried a second time and the oil was getting old. Not 100% sure but they just weren't on form that day.   Saying that we would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I had no idea they had such appetizing burgers. Unfortunately because of a time constraint we couldn't order them. We had a grilled cheese and a poutine with a bowl of tomato soup.   I loved my grilled cheese. The tomato soup was smoking hot but good. Trying to eat faster than normal posed a slight challenge there. And the poutine was good. It definitely wasn't the star of show nor the best we've had but it could do.   We were there on off hours so it's hard to say what the place it like when it's packed. I'd certainly like to come back and find out!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. First time in Calgary from the US, and we luckily found this place. Plenty of poutine options, customizable to what you want on it. Savory flavor, our group finished two poutines in a matter of minutes. They have such a long list of burgers that it's fun already, but add a customizable \"what to stuff the burger with\" and it's a completely different experience than any other restaurant."}
{"text":"TLDR: good food, very overpriced  I got the poutine stuffed burger because I love poutine. The burger was about as good as I expected, so good, not great. I'm impressed that they managed to stuff it in there so tightly that stuff didn't come out, while retaining a general moistness of the burger (would still classify as closest to well-done though). That being said, fries don't hold up well when they're wet, and probably because of being insulated in a patty, it was worse than stand-alone poutine which is just really saucy. So flavor-wise, it was okay, but the texture was very off-putting, though this was basically what I was expecting to be honest. My friend got the bacon mac n' cheese stuffed burger. Her comments were that there wasn't enough bacon and that it should have just been cheese in the middle.   Service was pretty slow. When we walked in (about 6 pm), there was no one at the front. It's a seat-yourself anyway, but obviously you can't get your order taken when there's no server, so we waited around chatting for 10 minutes or so until someone came down from upstairs. Once we were seated, the service was fine and attentive. It wasn't a problem for us that the initial seating was slow; we weren't in a hurry, but all the same, it was kind of strange. Fair amount of seating. It was kind of strange; there were only four other people in the restaurant when we walked in at a peak dinner hour - maybe weekdays just aren't that busy.   Pricing is steep for sure. Like the value of my burger could not have been $16. At least part of the markup is simply the novelty of having a stuffed burger with things that you didn't think could be stuffed into a burger. So while the food could be considered of a 4-star quality - the ingredients were certainly top-grade, the value is not good at all, and that's mostly why this is a 3-star review."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good reviews from my coworkers about this place for their burgers so I tried it out. They're such a small joint it's hard to get seating and it takes long for orders to arrive so we called in our order ahead of time. When we came to pick it up there weren't any tables available so we did take away and by the time we started eating the food had been out for 30 mins so it's not fair to comment on their food because I didnt think the poutine and burger was good by this point as everything was soggy and presentation was not great. So, if I could provide advice, it would be to dine-in!"}
{"text":"Somewhat retro burger place is very with it, and are confident about their creations that seem never-ending. A national winner in burger contests, they pride themselves in several key areas: 1. hand-made everything, including burgers with the spices added to the original patty meat. A rare thing but the formula to a truly great burger! 2. stuffed contents ranging from mac&cheese, perogies, and just so much more... 3. offer both signature and make-your-own stuffed and 1/4 pounder burgers: the stuffed patties easily outweigh the latter. 4. meals come with monster piles of fries, with or without gravy and/or poutine 5. nice touch with small free sides of cole slaw, gravy and sliced carrots  6. when make your own just the way you like them: the staff will flex with whatever. 7. can order corn fritters done the 'old-fashioned' way and supposed to be a real treat.  Atmosphere.  Blues and other styles of music likely to add to the AB experience as well as to give flavour to the standard expectations of a good burger diner.  Service.  Very knowledgable and forthcoming staff will work to please you with any great burger, poutine and other sandwich.  Two downsides.  1. The burger buns are standard and tasteless, doing nothing to add to the burger itself, and too easily break apart in your hands. A big fat 'mighty' burger like these need the support of a bun that's also got a robust character. As well, the extra cost of a great burger bun could be easily offset by bottomless fries and cut back on the initial offering of fries that few of us can ever hope to finish anyway... 2. No Pepsi products for those of us who would rather not bother with the syrupy Coke.  Will return to make my own the next time, and see how it stacks up with that more traditional style burger."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new so we decided to give this place a try. When we arrived there was only one other table occupied and left before we even ordered so our party of 4 decided to have a seat sit back relax and enjoy the meal. Trouble was, our food took LITERALLY 1 hour to come out and we didn't even order anything crazy. The burgers were okay but nothing spectacular, the poutine gravy tasted like it came from a powdered mix and to top it all off the staff was in the kitchen laughing and carrying on while we waited 1 hour for our food. Will never go back. The best thing we ate there was the raspberry vinaigrette. I can't imagine how long we would have waited if we came during a busy period."}
{"text":"For those who knew Nainas in Ogden, they have moved to a much better location!!!  Great parking lot out back that's free to patrons and a very cool, freshly renod building ! Absolutely excellent food!  We had a build your own stuffed burger with mushrooms, sautéed onions, bacon, mozzarella and pineapple and it was to die for!  We also shared a Mac n Cheese with Jalapeños and a poutine - everything tasted so homemade and fresh!  Highly recommended and if you go there during the evening, make sure you book a reso!  Great spot to go before an event at the Saddledome!"}
{"text":"If you want comfort food, this is the place to go. Unbelievable selection of stuffed burgers, poutines, and grilled cheeses. Extremely creative and extremely delicious. I don't give 5 stars often, but this place is worth it"}
{"text":"If there were more stars,  Naina's would earn them all!   I forgot all about Naina's celebrity until we got there, and Kirsten, so proud of her restaurant's success gave us the reviews.  I loved the clean lines and high tables, the décor was simple, yet elegant.  And clean and open.   It was after trying the Mac N Cheese at a Taste of Calgary, that I looked up Naina's online and found it was moderately priced and had a menu that wasn't going to tax my girlfriend's budget!  She was taking me out.  The Beer!  She was so impressed with the beer that I thought she could write a review on that alone.  What did we have?   Squeeze (me) and  the Pale Ale (her).  Of course we had to try the stuffed burgers!  Yes, there is a reason they win awards.   Nainalicious is just that and thick and  rich and tasty!  Me, I'm a sucker for what the chef can create for a special, so I had to try that.   I was so impressed that I will go back just to see what he comes up with the next time.   I had a wonderfully tender perfectly cooked burger stuffed with goat cheese and where lettuce or spinach would be, the crisp basil leaves melded to make my burger a beautiful combination of all the best of the garden!  It was not a heavy burger.  Feeling daring, I ordered fries.  Yup, they were Hutterite potatoes, fresh and with the skin, I received a goodly portion of them and on Kirsten's recommendation tried the gravy.  Yes, if you ask you can buy it by the quart, maybe ...   The salad looked good, I'll try that next time.   But here's the kicker.   You know you are in a good restaurant when the fresh coffee comes and it's not as hot as you'd like and the chef himself comes out with a fresh, steaming cup in place of your previous cup!     Now, if I had room,  that rice crispie square  marshmallow  ice cream sandwich would have been mine!   No small surprise this lovely little restaurant caters to some of the movie companies who work in town.   As for getting to Naina's,  let Google map be your guide 'she' got us there around the construction and there IS ample parking around back.   Are there vegetarian and vegan options?   How about a Black-eyed pea burger stuffed with peppers and spinach and topped with caramelized onions! Will I take my friends there?  Yes, each and every one of them!"}
{"text":"Sad really, I was looking forward to trying the burgers. Burger was cooked dry, really dry. I like a good messy burger but the sauce was lathered to the point you couldn't taste anything else. Both my hubby's and my fries were seriously over cooked.  We ate a few but left 80% of them - see the pics.  That was after we ate what we could tolerate.    It was lunch time and there were only 9  other people, total, in the restaurant. Do being busy was not the excuse.   Oh and I am of the opinion that $1.50 for less than 2 oz of gravy is kind of ridiculous. Taste was ok...  helped the fries go down, those that I could eat anyway. If the burgers/fries had been great I wouldn't have minded the prices but when your coke is the best thing you had... well, it is just sad.   Service was ok.   We eat out a lot but we won't come back here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a big beefy juicy burger then this is the place you can't miss. The worst thing about Naina's is that it's a little hard to get to if you are not familiar with the area and that the parking is the pits but if you can time it so that you get there before or after the lunch crowd parking shouldn't be an issue. After saying that it's hard to get to you would think I would provide directions but I'm terrible at them so I won't waste words and confuse you. Phone and ask them. I had the YYCburger and it was Strips of moist peppery steak, sautéed onions and peppers and a gooey combination of Stilton and Mozzarella cheese, all inside a 1/2 lb char broiled beef burger. It lived up to it's promise and they provide a choice of salad, fries or soup. I opted for the Italian meatball soup and it had lots of meatball in the small bowl that I had and it was tasty. Service could have been friendlier, the girl was a little peeved when I switched to dine-in from to-go when a table happened to open up as I was waiting but this is no upscale sit down restaurant, you're here for the beef and you don't have to ask where it is. Burgers, unstuffed or stuffed, with a great list of items to select from. I think that there were a couple of non-burger items but I don't recall what they were as I was just there for the burger. Worth the trek."}
{"text":"The best poutine I've ever had. I will be craving that buffalo chicken poutine for days. This poutine was awesome because the gravy was on point. Such a great value too. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"horrible.  the meat was barley cooked, The centre was cold.  the cheese didnt melt.  I was going to send it back, but then they would spit in the centre of it for you, and they lock you in by paying first....  The stuffed burgers are just a gimmick you can find on any at home shopping channel and do it yourself at home.  Never ever go here - the hype is paid for publicity."}
{"text":"Came to this little gem because of poutine week.  I'm sure glad I did.   Just looking at the menu makes my mouth water.    If you like burgers than apparently this is the place to be.  If you like your burger to be stuffed with stuff than you're in luck.  Mac and cheese with your pick of toppings. Grilled cheese heart attacks by the sandwich.   Yum."}
{"text":"Wow this place has good food. I got the Nainalicious stuffed burger and a poutine. I was stuffed! Definitely would recommend Nains's kitchen!"}
{"text":"I heard of this place after all the amazing reviews of their stuffed burgers- so after an afternoon (too many hours) of hockey, my family was sufficiently hungry enough to try the 1/2 pound stuffed burgers.  Hubs had the famous \"nainaliscious\" burger that I also tried - very flavourful!  My 10 yr old son had the poutine stuffed burger (which I also tried) and he (and I) quite enjoyed it. I had a 1/4 pound burger- nicely cooked, lovely burger flavour, solid bun that held everything in well enough.  My 7 yr old has the mac and cheese- yummy was made even more yummy, with goldfish crumbled on top.  Servers were attentive and informative.  At the end, we found this place to have delicious, creative burgers- and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Bacon Mac n Cheese stuffed burger and it came with fries, soup, or salad. I thought that it was good, but a little salty to my liking.. The Mac n Cheese was a little bland ironically.. did not find much bacon inside. It wasn't really worth the price I paid.. I also did not like how some people who ordered after my table received their order before us."}
{"text":"This place was a huge service let down.  After we were told to take a seat, no one came for the next 25 minutes.  No menus, no drinks, no service.  It was TERRIBLE.  And the worst part was that, they weren't even busy, and had 3 waitresses on the floor and not one came to our table which was right in the middle of the restaurant, yet they kept on checking on other customers who had already been served.  No one even looked at our table after we made several attempts to call someone over needless to say we left.  Worst service I've ever experienced or lack there of."}
{"text":"You will dream of their greasy burgers in a good way! Perfectly cooked anytime of the day, just a little out of the way to find it."}
{"text":"Stuffed burgers and poutine. What else can you want? Lovely warm staff,homey crowded place and the best burgers I've had IN MY LIFE and i ate burgers in a lot of countries, it's my thing! It's a bite pricey but you get what you pay for, a customized piece of art!"}
{"text":"Bring your appetite!  Naina's stuffed burgers are absolutely massive.    I ordered a burger stuffed with mushrooms and cheese and hubby ordered the Nainalicious, which is stuffed with pulled pork, cheese, apples and caramelized onions.  We also ordered a traditional poutine to share.  Naina's was fairly busy that day and it took more than half an hour for our food to arrive.  Once it did, it was sure intimidating.  The burger was huge.  The stuffed burger is a pretty idea but I found beef patty to be a bit on the dry side, given that they had to leave it on the grill longer than usual to ensure that it's cooked through.  I made it halfway through my burger before I gave up.  It's simply just too much food.  Hubby loved the Nainalicious as he's a meatatarian and it combined all of his favourite foods (beef+pulled pork+cheese).  He was able to finish his burger but we barely touched the poutine...not because it wasn't good, but because we were too full.  Maybe I'll return to Naina's if I'm feeling extra hungry one day, but for now, it's too much food.  But, I do love the new location (on 17th Ave by the Stampede grounds, as opposed to in Ogden)."}
{"text":"Really friendly service.Waitress was great with recommendations.burger was tasty and we were well taken care of even though the restaurant was pretty busy."}
{"text":"Today I had Naina's for the first time, my work ordered it as takeout for a group lunch so unfortunately I can't comment on the restaurant itself. As the actual restaurant, atmosphere, staff, etc is a huge portion of any dining experience I am not giving this review full weighting in that regard, but instead I am focusing on the food from a takeout perspective.   10 of us ordered which is a significant amount for any restaurant to take all at once, so I'm impressed that they took our order and had it processed efficiently without any problem. Everything came as promised and was packaged neatly with an appropriate number of napkins and utensils. They used standard Styrofoam and plastic containers and made sure to separate hot/cold where you'd want them to which is often overlooked (salad not packaged next to burger). The food survived the takeout process from packaging to transport to unpackaging while still warm!   For the meal I ordered the Nainalicious Stuffed Burger, this place is well known for their burgers so the obvious choice was going with one of their signature items. On the side I ordered a salad with side dressing. The salad was nothing special, standard tossed salad; a little bland and the dressing didn't add much to it, still I was happy it was a lighter dressing. The Nainalicious Stuffed Burger looked great minus being on a pretty conventional bun; 1/2lb of burger stuffed with pulled pork, aged cheddar, caramelized onions and granny smith apple.  Presentation was good and very appetizing, not a sloppy or greasy burger by any means. The meat and pulled pork were excellent and I'm glad the onions weren't overwhelming but rather a fine accent. I didn't get much from the apple and fear it may have been over run by the beef and pork. So all things considered I was satisfied, it was a good burger almost great, but not a top 5 burger IMO. I'd like to try a different option with the fries next time (stupid diet :( )."}
{"text":"Recently tried this burger joint for the first time and wow was it great! Had the pulled pork stuffed burger and it was so fresh and good my mouth was watering. Highly recommend this place as it's been named the best burger in Calgary year after year. We ended up talking to the owner and her and the staff were great. Great service! Fresh ingredients! Great burgers! A must visit. Ps. Try their legendary grilled cheese sandwiches too."}
{"text":"Great little place famous for their stuffed burgers. Fries are great and they have an awesome breakfast sandwich. Friendly staff and lots of toppings make this spot worth checking out."}
{"text":"After all the hype on Yelp, I decided to experience it myself. I noticed that their menu has my beloved mac & cheese. I called ahead and ordered the numminess. The lady was very upbeat and pleasant to deal with.  I arrived just as it was ready. I had bacon & blue cheese added ($3 a pop) and with a soda, it came out to a nickel shy of $20. Expensive, but if it's delicious, it's worth it.  It wasn't. I looked past the odd addition of gold fish crackers crumbled on top. The pasta was cooked properly, and the bacon was very good. The actual taste of the dish beyond that was bland and not enjoyable at all. There was no seasoning, and the cheese wasn't enough to make up for that. It was a mixture of cheeses that are fine separately, but together were not a fit.   I can't recommend the dish, though the stuffed burgers look interesting. Perhaps I'll give them a try, and with luck, be able to upgrade my rating."}
{"text":"Two friends and I have been going out for a burger or similar every month for several years now. Tonite we went to Naina's Kitchen and have established a new top of the scale rating for burgers in the city. I had the BOB (bacon, onion and blue cheese). It met my highest standards for taste, appearance and mouth feel.  It exceeded my \"amount\" rating. Having the owner drift over to chat after the meal was a pleasure - a place that checks to see how their clients reacted to the meal  (not just a quick \"Is everything okay\" from the server after bite one) is a rare experience in this city. Like Arnold, we'll be back."}
{"text":"To be honest, after trying the American burger (Cooked to temperature), I was not a big fan of well done dry burgers. However, the stuffed burger on Naina's menu was so tempting.   The restaurant is kind of hidden on a ramp to Blackfoot trail  (From 26 Ave). So before heading there, make sure to check the address on the map.   There is a huge array of stuffing options for the burger, even they have a puttin stuffed burger :D !! I decided to try the stuffed burger with caramelized onions and jalapeno with a side of fries.  As soon as I had the first bite, I realized why I received so many recommendations for this place. Imagine a super juicy double burger that each bite has caramelized onion and jalapenos. The stuffing keeps the burger super moist. It is fantastic. Probably the best burger I had in Canada. The fries are good but pretty standard.   This is a family owned business and please note that it is not a fast food. So be prepared to wait for your food (Defiantly worth the wait). They have other interesting options on their menu such as different type of grilled cheese. I cannot wait to go back there and try it."}
{"text":"They won 2nd best burger in Canada, whosever won 1st must be phenomenal because the burger must be eaten to be believed. An utterly unique and delicious burger, their specialty is a stuffed burger and they incorporate more flavour than you would think possible. I also had curry mayo for my fries, so good, so damn good. The service was exceptional and the overall experience made my day. An absolute must!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good! For me it was home comfort food at its finest! When we arrived we were told to sit wherever and felt the service was good to start. As the restaurant filled up with diners the service went downhill so fast honestly we left feeling very uncomfortable, never asked for water or refills and once served never saw another staff member. Will not return after being left to feel like a burden."}
{"text":"The poutine was outstanding and the stuffed burgers add unique flair to an American Classic, but the poutine definitely takes the cake here! Service was great and would definitely return if I was in Calgary."}
{"text":"Been coming to Naina's for years now and I still love the place even after the price increase because I can't think of a better burger joint in this city.  Fans know the stuffed burgers are great, but it's worth noting that the meat is never dry. A lot of places will put tons of toppings to mask the tasteless meat, but Naina's seems to be one of very few places that actually season their beef. I could be wrong about that but it just seems that way to me. In my last visit, I ordered a pulled pork poutine for the first time and I thought the pork was tender, nicely spiced with a little bit of sweet to it. Fries never wowed me at this place but the poutine was good.  $17 may seem high for a stuffed burger and fries, but compared to many places that sell burgers between $15 to $20, it's a great deal for the size and taste."}
{"text":"I was at home one day watching the Food Network and Naina's was featured on one of its shows called \"You Gotta Eat Here!\" The burgers looked bomb, so when we went to Calgary last weekend Naina's was definitely on my list of places to go to. I ordered a burger that was stuffed with ham, spinach, sun dried tomato and cream cheese. I ate all of it- except for the bread as I don't eat it at all. My husband had a burger stuffed with Mac & cheese and I'm not sure what else. We both enjoyed our meals, the restaurant was clean and customer service was good. The next time I come to visit Calgary I will definitely return to Naina's to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"Naina's Kitchen specializes in stuffed burgers. Oks wanted to take us here. It seemed like a good plan as we were heading over to the grounds afterwards.There's free parking in the back. Perfect if you're planning to eat and go to the Stampede or Saddledome.   The inside has several chalkboard walls advertising their daily specials. If you didn't make a reservation, seat yourself. We came on a Thursday (around 6:00pm) and we're lucky that a table for 8 opened up. They have a cute patio outside. Too bad their happy hour is only from 9:00pm - 11:00pm (lame).   The menu is split into mac and cheese, poutine, stuffed burgers (their specialty) and sandwiches. Service was sooooo slow and it was a pain trying to flag our waiter down for waters. Food took a long time to come out.  - Village blacksmith Alberta black ale ($6.50) - Village squeeze lemon berry helles ($6.50) - I've tried Village's beer before and can't say I'm a big fan. Their flavours don't come through and the beer itself tastes watered down.  - Nainalicious ($15.95) - stuffed with pulled pork, apples, aged cheddar and caramelized onions. The burger was slightly  dry but overall a tasty bite.  - ABC ($11.50) - grilled cheese was cheesy and oozy. ABC = apple, bacon and cheddar. Decently grilled but wish they could get it even more so. The side of tomato soup it came with was way too thick. Skip it.  - Mac and cheese ($11.50) with bacon ($3.00) - not good. Bland, bland, bland. We barely ate any.  - Bacon mac n cheese stuffed burger ($15.95) - they actually got our friends order wrong but he ate it anyways. He said it was just average.  - Dill pickle poutine ($7.95) - lots of dill pickle. The tangy dill gravy that they smothered on top looked like congealed glue. - Momma Says ($12.50) - one of their vegetarian grilled cheeses.  - Carolina grilled cheese ($13.50)  Overall, decent burgers but I wasn't blown away. Too many other spots on 17th Ave beckon to be tried."}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked to try this place out with my dinner club, but I unfortunately left feeling underwhelmed. We arrived and I was surprised to see how quaint and homey it looked inside. I was forewarned that service was going to be relatively slow due to the fact that they make each burger as ordered, therefore ensuring the freshness of each dish.  We ordered a handful of different items to share: the special of the day - the stuffed adobo burger with a side of traditional poutine, perogie stuffed burger with a side of the corn salad, the Momma Says grilled cheese with a side of the tossed green salad, and the Nainalicious stuffed burger with a side of the dill pickle poutine. We cut all the burgers and sandwiches in quarters so that we could get try a little bit of everything. The dill pickle poutine was very interesting - you definitely should order ONLY if you are a dill pickle fan and/or love the taste of sourness. It is an acquired taste for sure; it didn't taste bad, but I know I definitely won't be craving for it anytime soon. While none of the food was bad, I was disappointed that none of the food stuck out to me. The only burger that I would sort of recommend would be the Nainalicious burger, because it was the only burger where the patty was somewhat moist. I'm a bit confused, given the high ratings. Perhaps I went on an off day? The good thing about this place is that I left feeling stuffed (ha-ha! Get it?)! You definitely won't leave this place hungry."}
{"text":"Came during Stampede and even with the super busy atmosphere and the overloaded waitress I still got fantastic service and amazing, delicious food. Highly recommended the poutine with pulled pork."}
{"text":"Oh boy, what a change for me. I visited Naina's again, and what a disaster that was. I ordered the mac and cheese this time, and what was served to me was literally slop. It looked like what I imagine prison gruel looks like. there was no discernible pieces of pasta, rather just mush, and what was worse was there was no flavour. It's as if they forgot the cheese and the butter, and just used flour and water for the sauce without even adding salt. I literally could not even eat more than my first spoonful, and I completely lost my appetite.   Avoid the mac and cheese at all costs."}
{"text":"Because I am directionally challenged it took me a few turns to find this place, but I was on a mission for yycburgerweek and my kid& I prevailed.  Cute little cafe tucked into a strip mall of sorts.  Friendly people and a huge menu.  Grab a seat, place your order at the counter (or vice versa) and wait for the food to come.  My kid stuck with a simple plate of fries and a banana, I had the yycburgerweek stuffed burger special.  It was huge!  Loved the flavour combination, crunchy green apple, gooey cheese, tasty pulled pork and caramelized onions.  An amazing burger combo that was so big I couldn't eat it all.   Enjoyed the staff and the ambiance.  Must return to try another stuffed burger or offering on their menu.  Worth getting lost for."}
{"text":"This restaurant specializes in burgers, including award-winning stuffed burgers. Our meal was not overly inspiring.  The fries were overdone, service was slow & forgetful, and prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I had a really good burger, so after doing a little bit of Yelp surfing, I decided to try out Naina's Kitchen - and how could I *not* try them out after seeing the words 'stuffed burgers' on their menu? As if I needed more convincing, their burgers have earned their share of awards over the years, including winning the 2016 Alberta Burgerfest, earning a silver medal at the 2016 Canadian Food Championships, and winning the 2017 YYC Burger Battle. With all that, I'm in!  I like the low-key atmosphere at Naina's, instantly comfortable when you walk in, with a friendly vibe and really friendly staff. The folks at Naina's are really great, and my server was really personable and made sure that everything was A-OK every time she passed my table.   Some very tempting poutines and grilled cheese sandwiches went by, but I kept my eyes on the prize, ordering the burger stuffed with bacon and cheddar. (There are a number of signature stuffed burger combinations on their menu, including one stuffed with bacon mac and cheese!) With the toppings on the inside, it takes a little longer for the burger to cook through, but the wait was well worth-it - a perfectly cooked burger with all sorts of delicious goodness in every bite. The burgers weigh in at a half-pound of Alberta beef, and they're generous with the stuffing, so if you cut your burger in half, make sure to hold your burger cut-side up!  You'll need some extra napkins no matter how you bite into it, but once you do, you just won't care, going right in for the next bite.  I also ordered a side Caesar salad, and it was one of the best Caesars I've had in quite some time, with a really good (house-made?) dressing and using toast crisps in place of the traditional croutons, making for some crunch in every bite.   Naina's Kitchen knows their burgers and, for those of you who are a bit less adventurous, you can get a more traditional quarter-pound burger with the same array of options as toppings. There's definitely something for everyone on their menu, so grab your friends and head over to Naina's Kitchen for an enjoyable night out!"}
{"text":"Sunday night at about 5:15pm. What a busy place! We waited 15 min for a table and had a lovely server who was very helpful explaining the menu and popular items. Decor is fun. Crimson walls and chalk board art with an upscale pub feel.   Hubby and I both ordered custom stuffed burgers- mine with caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms and side of fries. Hubby had his with stuffed with bacon and cheese. Our son tried the dilly poutine which he found a bit tart. It's fries with sliced pickles, curds and dill gravy. I think regular gravy would have suited his palate more. I thought the dill poutine was yummy but it was very briny so be warned   Burgers are made to order so our server told us approx 35min for our order to arrive at the table and he was quite right about the timing. This is not a fast food place! The burger was deelish, slightly charred on the outside and stuffed full of yummy flavoured items we selected. The fries were a bit burnt but I still enjoyed mine.   Overall, this is an excellent stuffed burger place. You will definitely be full when you leave! They had other items I'd like to try but that'll wait til next time!   Do note that there is minimal parking so that may be a challenge on a weekend."}
{"text":"I was craving a poutine and this was one of the only places open at 9pm -- boy, am I glad I came here.  The poutine is one of the best I've ever had. It has sort of a peppery gravy with real cheese curds. I also had their veggie stuffed burger (with a black bean pattie) and it was AMAZING. I'm coming back on a regular basis because of these two items."}
{"text":"Had the 1/4 lb jalapeno and swiss burg with fries.  Outstanding.  Burger was juicy and bun was super fresh.  The jalapenos were fresh and not the pickled kind.  Fries weren't from frozen and perfectly crispy.  Tons of toppings to choose from, probably too many.  Saw the poutine that looked incredible but good chance you could die of coronary disease soon thereafter.  But hey, live dangerously!!!!"}
{"text":"As a transplanted Edmontonian, one of the first treats I had in Calgary was the legendary stuffed burger at Naina's at the Ogden Rd location. Driving by recently I was stunned to see the location move to the East end of 17th Ave.  More stunned when I decided to stop in, that it was here for a year. And therein lies the problem we need to fix. With not much of a marketing budget to advertise the new location and first year business hit by city construction on 17th Avenue, Naina is just starting to get back on its feet. So Calgary, get out here and get your comfort food fix. Tonight was buffalo Chicken poutine and Mac And Cheese stuffed burger for me an Nainalicious (pulled pork) stuffed burger for my wife. So good. Come by and ask for the beautiful Kristen to serve you. She is not only a great server but she will regale (sp?) with comedy. A great evening."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and fellow foodie local to Calgary recommend this place to me. \" Their stuffed burgers are the S#@t\" he said to me... He had me at stuffed burgers. Easy Street parking and a lot ( if you're going to a special event and you eat here they let you park for free) how cool is that? The dining room ,bathrooms, and I'm assuming kitchen we're all the same level of cleanliness which was you could eat off the floor. My server, Mitch , was informative, friendly ,passionate, and  knew the menu and made suggestions. For as many people that were here it was fairly quiet cuz everyone was too busy enjoying these delicious burgers. Don't worry my veggie friends they have what appears to be a delicious veggie stuffed burger made from a black bean patty. Price point was right on and I really can't say enough about this place. I went with the Nainalicious which is stuffed with pulled pork , granny smith apples and unicorn tears ( I'm just kidding but that's how incredibly delicious this burger is) I upgraded to the poutine fries that did not disappoint I mean after all you are in Canada. I really can't recommend this place enough come on in town Big John sent you. In the words of my former Governor I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Badass Blueberry Stuffed Burger.  Yes. You read that right.  And you have until eight tonight to get down here and try it.  Blueberries, cayenne candied bacon, and havarti stuffed into a half pound burger, with a lemon zest and mint mayo.  It was amazing.  I brought my father in law to try Naina's for the first time.  He looked at the above special for the week amd said that he thought it to be a bit too weird for him and instead got the classic Nainalicious, while I went straight for the Badass Blueberry Stuffed Burger and a side poutine.  Due to a twist of fate though my burger ended up on his plate and the Nainalicious was on mine. He got three bites in before we noticed and was already going 'oh baby' over how good it was, and then I saw the blueberries inside and asked him if he was enjoying my burger.  We laughed and then decided to cut both burgers in half so we each half a classic and half a special, and I would have kicked myself if I missed out on the Badass Blueberry burger.  Between the blueberries, the cayenne candied bacon, and the lemon zest and mint mayo, I don't think I've every been able to call a burger sweet, spicy, and refreshing all at once.  If you miss this one you may never find inner burger peace."}
{"text":"Finally our first visit to Naina's new location!  It was great!  It was very quiet - early dinner time and we were one of only two tables.  It's too bad that there's construction going on out front on 17th Ave but hopefully once that clears the business will pick up for them.  We were greeted by a very nice server who smiled and explained to us about their award winning burgers.  Being a new mom, I'm always curious to see if the restaurant is family friendly.   I'm happy to state that they had high chairs and boosters available.  Also had a change table in the ladies restroom.  Another bonus: as the restaurant was very quiet, the server volunteered a few minutes of babysitting time with my little guy while we enjoyed our meals!  BONUS and great service experience!!  The menu has a lot of variety and selection. Although they are definitely known for their stuffed burgers.  My hubby and I decided to order the corn fritters for an appetizer, mac and cheese with bacon and the Nainalicious Stuffed Burger.  Food came out in a timely manner and was piping hot.  We always order our fries extra crispy and they were done perfectly and seasoned nicely.  I love that they use local suppliers!    Very impressed with the food and service!  We will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I ordered one of the stuffed burgers and thought it was just ok. It took a long time to come out of the kitchen (about 30 minutes), and the burger was definitely on the overcooked side. I got the special stuffed burger - which at the time, was stuffed with some sort of blueberry cheese, and while tasty, I couldn't get over the lack of juice in the patty. Definitely worth trying out if you're in the area, but there are much juicier burgers out there. 3 star for food, 1 more star for the great service."}
{"text":"I've been to Naina's kitchen before in Ogden where I gave it a 5-star review.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear they moved to 17th ave which makes it much closer to where I live.  Because we were going to the Flames game I saw it a perfect opportunity to stop in for a quick dinner before the game.  As we walked in we were pleasantly greeted and brought through the dining area that was about 1/4 full to a high table in the back.  By this time it was about 6:20pm, more than enough time to get to the game to see the pre-game skate, or so I thought.  Because they're known for their stuffed burgers and my wife had never tried them we decide to go for the stuffed burgers, she ordered the Nainalicious and I order the Jalapeno popper stuffed burger.  20 minutes later we still haven't gotten our order and people around us who arrived and ordered after we did are getting their food.  We tried not to let it bother us but since we were heading to the game which starts at 8pm we were getting a bit worried.  By 7pm we start giving our server some nervous looks and she comes in and explains that since we ordered the stuffed burgers it takes a bit longer to cook.  I'm not sure how much I believe that but OK, we took her word for it.  It was nice of her to come and explain to us what was going on albeit 40 minutes later and after we started expressing some concern.  45 minutes later our burgers come out.  They're huge, and stuffed.  My Jalapeno popper was pretty good; however, the beef patty portion was quite dry.  Luckily mine was stuffed with cream cheese which salvaged the burger; although, I don't see myself ordering it again.  My wife and I split our burgers so we could try each others, I tried the Nainalicious which has pulled pork, aged cheddar and apple and caramelized onions.  I found it extremely dry and the flavours weren't really balanced.  At $16 not worth the price of admission for me.  The fries were fantastic and cooked to perfection so I'm guessing their poutine might be worth coming back for.  As for the burgers, I think I'll stick to regular burgers here.  They tend to overcook the stuffed burgers.  I'm not really sold on the new dining room format.  I actually preferred the cafeteria style kitchen from before.  I know what they are trying to do here but I don't know if the execution is all there as it seems a bit stuck in two different worlds.  Our server as nice as she was, touted the burgers so many times as they were the greatest thing since sliced bread which got a bit annoying.  At one point, the owner proceeded to correct our server on a way the table needs to be laid out.  They were beside us so we could hear everything which made us a bit uncomfortable.  They allowed us to park in their lot during the game which also was a nice bonus.  Overall I think there are some growing pains here as they want to become a sit-down family restaurant.  I'm pretty sure they can overcome these growing pains and become a staple in the area.  The food is still very good and tastes like home cooking, comfort food, how can you go wrong with that?"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what everyone says it is. This special family run restaurant has all the right ingredients to make your first time experience with the \"perfect burger\" completely satisfying.  The staff was friendly, and helpful in assisting us with choosing  from the wide variety of choices available.  I would suggest to come with an appetite as you receive a mouth watering huge portion of food. We will certainly be back to this fantastic establishment for our next burger craving."}
{"text":"I love my burger.  As my wife and I travel around in our motorhome seeing the U.S. and Canada, I'm always plotting my next burger.  I agonized over the Calgary stop as there appeared to be some excellent choices and I just had one shot at it.  Naina's won out, mainly because of their award winning stuffed burger, and also the number of grilled cheese sandwiches they offer, which are my wife's favorite.  I don't care for stuffed burgers because the meat is cooked more than I like since the \"stuffing\" needs to be heated as well.  I was hoping this time it might somehow be different, but unfortunately it was not.  I had the bacon mac and cheese stuffed burger.  It was a great stuffed burger.  But I'm now convinced I just need to get my toppings on top so I can get a juicy medium rare burger.  I upgraded my side of fries to the poutine.  You don't see much of this in the U.S. and I'd only had it once before and was not sold on it.  I am now!  I can see why it's such a big thing in Canada.  Delicious, perfect gravy and cheese curds.  My wife loved her Tuscan grilled cheese but thought the bread was slightly burnt.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We arrived at Naina's kitchen on a Friday for lunch, while it wasn't filled, it was quite busy.  We ordered a mac and cheese grilled cheese and a ramen stuffed burger.  If you know my hubby, if there's fried chicken or any sort of ramen, he will order that.  I realized after we placed our order this was not going to be a quick meal.  Here, they specialize in stuffed burgers.  Stuffed anything takes longer to cook through.    As expected, it took a while for the burger to cook. We were getting so hungry!  Finally the food arrive and we dug in.  My mac and cheese grilled cheese was exactly how you would imagine it.  A thick slab of mac and cheese put in between 2 slices of bread and put on the flat top.  Carb overload!  It was cheesy enough, but a bit bland (even for me!), so I dipped it in ketchup.  I chose a caesar salad as my side instead of fries because didn't want carbs, carbs, and more carbs!  Although I have to admit I ate some of the hubby's fries.  The salad was fresh romaine lettuce, with homemade croutons and real bacon pieces.  Dressing I think was bought and not made in house.  Hubby's ramen burger was exactly what you would expect.  A burger patty stuff with ramen in it.  It had ramen flavour, I'm sure ramen powder packet was added into either the burger meat or the ramen noodles was tossed with it.  What was disappointing was that the burger meat was dry.  Most likely had to do with how long the burger had to be cooked for in order to make sure everything was cooked through.  Maybe they could freeze some ramen stock and stuff it inside with the noodles to keep some sort of moisture?  I have to say though, the fries were pretty good, good portion and were fresh cut."}
{"text":"Had the 'Nainalicious Stuffed Buger', which is two 1/4 pound beef patties bound together stuffed with pulled pork, aged cheddar, caramelized onions, and granny smith apple. Served with a hearty side of fresh cut fries.  The biggest complaint would be that the burger was extremely juicy, however it wasn't necessarily all a bad thing. :-)  The decor is quite homely, reminiscent of a casual diner. Food is ordered at the front, and the wait staff brings it to your table.  Would I go back? Definitely."}
{"text":"The food was good though a little heavy and greasy which is fine sometimes I guess, though my friend and I were a little ambitious when ordering a burger and poutine. The wait was a little long to get our food though meeting Naina was a nice personal touch."}
{"text":"Finally made it and will definitely be back!  The options for the stuffed burgers were great. Hard to choose!  Some good Gluten free options either a gluten free bun or lettuce wrap.  All burgers are made with no binding bread ingredient. We tried the dill pickle poutine which I was skeptical about but believe me try it!  If you like dill pickles you are going to love this!!  Best part may be the parking in the back of the restaurant very key because of their location. Super cute decor as well. Make sure to visit!!"}
{"text":"We saw Naina's Kitchen on an episode of \"You've Got To Eat Here\" and immediately felt the need to pay a visit. It took two years before our plans came together that we could actually make it here, but boy was it worth the wait!! The food is amazing.   Let's start with the sides: the poutine and fries both are cooked perfectly, with that right balance of crispiness and delicate soft crunch. Add to that the rich, flavoursome gravy, and you've got a tasty poutine. There's a fair selection of drinks, including a number of craft beers from local breweries. I had a whit beer, the name of which escapes me, but was a pleasant accompaniment to my meal.  However, the star at Naina's is the stuffed burgers. We had been craving the poutine stuffed burger and were not disappointed when my son ordered one. Words cannot easily describe how delicious it was. I tried one of the jalapeño popper stuffed burgers, and was equally pleased with my choice.  There's a Wall Of Fame listing all the various specials they've had over the past years. It makes for some fascinating reading.  We mentioned to our server that we had come from Toronto, specifically to try Naina's whilst in the area. After our meal the owner came over to chat with us and thank us for visiting. She was super pleasant and made us feel very welcome. Without a shadow of a doubt, next time I'm in Calgary I will be paying Naina's Kitchen another visit. I highly recommend that you do too."}
{"text":"Drove all the way there from the south to get a burger because it says they are open until 11. I get there at 10:16 and buddy tells me the kitchen is closed. If you aren't going to serve food until 11 then don't say you are open till 11"}
