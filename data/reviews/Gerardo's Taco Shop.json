{"text":"Love there tacos de carne asada especially the Tostitos wit chili n lime cucumbers jicama n cabbage first time .. Really good"}
{"text":"my girlfriend got a carne asada burrito here Sunday and I got to finish half of it.  sooooooooooooo yummy!!!  everything inside worked so well together, making my mouth very happy!

so I stopped there on my way home and got the ceviche (shrimp) tostada (only $3.50!!) and camerones ranchero (at $10.95 the most expensive thing on the menu).  
the ceviche was excellent!  a good sized serving, I would have been happy to pay $6-7 for it! 
the camerones ranchero was also a good sized serving with plenty of shrimp. very tasty.

they have a very large menu, including breakfast and desert items.  prices run pretty cheap.  burritos for $4.95 and tacos were around $1.50 each.

good + cheap + good portions + open 24/7 = 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexifastfood place in Vegas. The staff are super-nice, the food is almost always excellent, the price is right, giant portions, it is super-clean, etc. I have three faves: 1. Pollo asado nachos. It's not even on the menu, but it's amazing. Rather than nachos with carne asada, the grilled/griddled marinated chicken is fantastic. 2. Pollo asado burrito with lettuce, chz, and sour cream. Fantastic. and 3. Bacon/chz burrito. Make sure to ask if you want the bacon crispy. Really good stuff."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill.
Very disappointed, the food tastes terrible.."}
{"text":"This place is at my budget friendly and the food is good. They have a week special for Mon-Thur. At what I think really good price. Super clean all around. And friendly service.

I just ate the taco salad (marinaded chicken) very tasty and very filling. And goes for the same price as Carne Asada fries. My sister had that and I gotta say way better then Roberto's fries. 

I'd say give it a try when your hungry for Cali Mexican food Or when you just puff puffed."}
{"text":"Taste only cumin.powder, and the worst rice ever ever tried dry and unsalty. don't go."}
{"text":"I ate at the Gerardo's near Wal Mart by Rainbow and Twain. And wow! I am from Stockton California and we have Taco Trucks everywhere and many Mexican Restaurants and I found it hard to find authentic mexican food here in Vegas! I was hungry for a burrito and thought that it was Roberto's(because I heard they were good), and I seen that it wasn't but didn't want to drive so I figured might as well give it a try. Walked in, place was empty but it was 10 at night. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito with sour cream and cheese, no onions, with salsa verde. What I got was on of the best Carne Asada burritos I have ever eaten! Not only was the burrito good but they grilled me a jalapeno and caramelized onions on the side! Wow wow wow! This was my highlight of Vegas so far!"}
{"text":"DAYAMMMMM the carne asada burrito is ON FIRE!  I moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, CA and I've been to San Diego.  The burrito reminds me of the cantina burritos at san diego.  And man, I will definitely go back here.  For Cali peeps who want a quick fix.  Check this place out.  It's authentic and the carne is so juicy, I love when the oil drips down the burrito."}
{"text":"Work close to here so I come here a lot and do a lot of my co workers.  I talked this place up.  Of course that was before they charged my $81.16 for carne asada fries that where not worth the ACTUAL price of $8.16.  I understand they messed up and the guy was really nice but the girl who was the cashier was very rude and condescending. She treated me like I was trying to steal the money they over charged me. Eventually I got my money back. They used up all my break and still charged me for the less then adequate meal.  WONT BE COMING HERE EVER AGAIN.  Also watch them they like to forget your drinks and special orders."}
{"text":"I was craving for some carne asada fries so I came here. They were great! The meat had so much flavor and I prefer the thicker cut fries they use here compared to other places. The cashier was extremely friendly and the service overall was great. Come here if you want a quick fix for your Mexican food craving."}
{"text":"WOW !!!!!!  Just a short note here on YELP  in regard to Gerardo's Taco Shop.
This place has GREAT I mean DELICIOUS  food....and variety + with GREAT PRICES.
This place is SO CLEAN one could eat off of the floor (lol)  as this expression means CLEAN AS CAN BE. 

The PEOPLE WHO RUN Gerardo's are out of this world POLITE, customer satisfaction a major +

With all of this said.....I recommend this restaurant with one hundred stars.
THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT, staff are friendly, mannerly  and welcoming."}
{"text":"Come here for the crazy murals, stay for the tasty Mexican food. Ignore the dated fast-food interior and focus on the unique guac, which is more of an avocado-green-salsa than an actual guacamole, but in a good way.

Not dissimilar to Roberto's, Gerardo's has roughly the same basic menu and comparable (if not a smidge lower) pricing. Staff is polite, but it's a one-man show so if you go with a group be prepared to wait. More of a grab-and-go kind of place.

Didn't notice a chile relleno on the menu, but they have tons of burritos (including breakfast), tacos, menudo on weekends, and a low priced daily special. My pick is the $2 3-piece taquitos, which come with cheese AND guac- most other places do one, not both."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to go. The food is amazing, the staff is friendly and it's a great place to unwind."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall place. Traditional California style Mexican food, with a good fresh salsa bar, horchata, flower tea, everything you'd expect. They got the refried beans right, and their lunch combo plates are a great deal! I will be returning, and I'm pretty picky about my Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a breakfast burrito (ham/potato)-and I have to say something was missing-no onions, tomatoes or peppers...a bit disappointed. Also got two cheese enchiladas and they were typical fare. The retried beans were very watery.
It's a mom and pops and though I prefer to support family biz-think I'll be passing next time."}
{"text":"Warning: your children may ask what the murals on the walls are, and you will probably not have an answer for them. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what to make of them; the abstract Mexican heritage design is certainly not my style, but who am I to judge what's beautiful. 

But do you know what are beautiful? Tacos. 

I'm a Southern California girl. When I'm hungry and short on time, my first restaurant instinct is naturally a taco shop. And trust me when I say--I know my tacos.
Since I was having a formal dinner not too long afterwards, I ordered a beef taco and enchilada plate combo with rice and beans. I wasn't too impressed with the salsa choices, nor the enchilada sauce, but everything hit the spot the way Mexican food always does. The rice and beans were standard tasting, but the lady behind the counter was super nice and patient as I searched the menu for my favorite dishes. 

My stomach was a happy can't-take-Mexican-food-out-of-my-life-even-on-vacation camper. The plate had no shot at survival."}
{"text":"Gerardo's taco shop was excellent! I got a tostada with carnitas, and a taco. Really loved the salsa bar that had delicious carrots and great salsa."}
{"text":"Best taco shop in the area.  Great fast food.  I had the taquitos with guacamole, and I've got to say they are very generous with their guacamole.  They also have a variety menu options and different meats to choose from.  Plus the prices are good and they are open 24/7."}
{"text":"Mmm! It was our first time here today (found it right here on yelp :) So good! We got a 3 taco asada plate, beans, rice and a drink and a ground beef taco plate also with beans/rice/drink. Everything was fresh and delicious. It was so good in fact, we got a second asada taco plate! The staff is super friendly and welcoming. This will be our new taco spot :)"}
{"text":"Dry, reheated mess! Waste of time and money. Thankful they gave me 2 nice sized cups of salsa to drown these horrible things so I could force myself to eat them. Dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Its pretty awesome here, they have well priced food that tastes really good. Their red salsa is a little bit on the extra spicy side and that's OK. :) 
They offer everything from breakfast to desert and mid meal treats. 
We had the chorizo breakfast burrito, horchata, 
champurrado and ham and egg plate for breakfast today. Everything we had was good, so we came back for some snacks in the evening.
We ordered some esquites, chamango, and agua fresca and they did not disappoint. 
I recommend this place, and we will be back."}
{"text":"amazing food.  I will eat here over Bonita and Pepe's taco from now on.  the Horchata was the best I ever had, the chicken tacos were delicious/fair priced (99cents), and all the ice cream is handmade and soo good!

me and my wife ate here 3 times in the past 2 days....."}
{"text":"I've been buying my horchata here ever since I began visiting my brother in Las Vegas some years ago. Always the first place I stop. They've got great tacos for a dollars, too."}
{"text":"Awesome food in a little hole in the wall place. I will definitely return back . We ordered 2 chicken tacos  and Super nachos and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place has THE BEST tacos I've ever had.. The are only .99, but they really could charge way more. I dream about them sometimes. They also have some seriously delicious ice cream and drinks. A little gem!! This place needs to be packed."}
{"text":"So I used to really like this place and go there often but after giving them a four star review I'm dropping them to two stars. The new owners changed the recipe for at the very least the bean burritos which were by far the best I'd had in town, I don't bother going anymore..."}
{"text":"Lets keep this little place in business. I can't even eat Robertos anymore. Cheaper than Pepe's. Love their hot sauce and carne asada burritos. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"pretty freakin good this place had good customer service the food was pretty good the test will be when I go back for a chicken torta if my husband loves it they will earn my five stars but the carnitas and carne asada and rolled tacos were great their salsa was awesome too!"}
{"text":"I had the super burrito, with no sour cream or cheese. The meat had little seasoning if any. As I ate, I tried to taste the flavor of the ingredients and mostly I tasted the beans. I could hardly taste or even see the pico de gallo or the guacamole that it's supposed to have. I bit into bits of onions, but that's not pico de gallo. There were no tomatoes or cilantro in their \"pico de gallo\".  

The meat was a bit chewy and I could tell it had been sitting around. It had the taste of old meat. It was passable if you add hot sauce to mask the flavor. But, next time IF I go back, I'd rather just have the rice and bean burrito (not sure if they have one).  BTW, the hot (red) sauce was neither spicy nor salty enough for me.   

Overall, I don't think this was worth $7+. I won't be going back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Was not even greeted or acknowledged when entering the building. The lady that made the food did not wash her hands or put on gloves after being on the phone and who knows what else. The carne asada meat was old and just reheated. Poor experience. The food did not taste good and was lacking in flavor on top of already having old meat and dirty hands preparing it. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Really good food at a decent price. The quality of their carne asada, their salsa bar and their ingredients are definitely a few notches above Roberto's or anything similar that I've tried in the area.

Really, my only complaint would be the size of my California burrito, it was kinda small, and the fact that it didn't have sour cream or guacamole.

I definitely think it's worth giving a try and especially if you're a fan of the usual fast food Mexican joints."}
{"text":"So after a few days in Vegas and doing everything we could to give the hotel/casino a shot... We simply realized that in hotel foods are just a bit too pricy when it comes to quality vs quantity vs price. Soooo, trusty old Yelp by our side, we click that Nearby button.... 
We see a bunch of thins pop up (duh it's vegas)... But one sticks out. Mexican place names Gerardo's... Decent reviews, seemingly decent price... And we are moving to El Paso Texas in a few months...why not? Let's try it. Plus they had a wal-Mart and petco in same shopping center. Needed some sundries and wanted to look at ferrets.. And fish... And maybe a rabbit... And a super cool climbing post for the cat that I don't even have. Win-win-win. 
The place was small. Bright colors on the walls.. Big mural. Black and white tiled floors. Few people inside, nothing fancy. Food was served on styrofoam plates... Cut back on overhead maybe? The tv was playing shows from a channel that spoke only a language in which neither my Japanese wife nor I can understand! What is this place?!? Who cares... FOOD WAS DELICIOUS! Wow. And fiiiiilllllliiiiinnngggg! It's been 3 hrs and I'm still full! Wow. I loved it, wife loved it... We will be back. 
My wife ordered the chicken taco with cheese enchilada. It came with beans and rice. Lettuce, tomatoes, maybe some onions? Salsa verde or rojo.. Cheese of course. She loved it. 
I'm a simple guy.. Looked up at the daily specials, Thursday says \"rolled tacos: 5 and drink for $3.99\". So I asks the lady... Hey girl, is a rolled taco a fluata? She said Si, and explained it in detail. It was a fluata, or at least what I know it as... 5 of them and a drink for $4? But wait, ya'll know I hate veggies or anything green... So I asks the lady.. Orale señorita,... Can I get sour cream on top instead of guacamole? She said Si.... Then hit me with a pregunta of her own... Oye guedo, you want beef, or chicken? 
I ordered the beef and said you know what, lemme get a cheese quesadilla... Cuz I'm white and hungry and a fried Tortilla filled with one cheese is right up my alley! 
But seriously... Place doesn't look like much... Food doesn't even look like much... But TRUST me it is very very tasty. Very inexpensive. Very filling. I finished all 5 of mine and the quesadilla... But it wasn't easy.. And I sat for about 5 before rolling out. Wife didn't finish hers.. That's normal though. The entire meal including tax cost us $17 exactly. So those of you vacationing here should know that, that is a deal. $17 to feed two people and good portion size and taste? Yea... A Vegas must! Unless you own the Wynn or Encore or Trump Towers... I mean the windows are made of gold... Pretty sure Donald doesn't give a Fuhhh about Thursday's rolled taco special. He is pretty thrifty though... Maybe I'll see him there? Hmmm 
Now being from Cali, living in El Paso, and visiting Mexico; naturally I've had better. But, my wife has had limited experience with authentic Mexican food and she said this was best she's ever had. And ya know, while I've had better, this was FOR SURE good. I liked it a lot and while in Vegas, I'll surely and gladly go back. All 2 staffers were very nice, food very cheap, taste very good. Menu selection/options hella decent. Please, if you're a tourist in Vegas like me.. Check it out... The food will fill you up so you can eat a light dinner and fit into that ridiculous sequined outfit you brought with you... And the money you save you can use to lose at the blackjack tables that you don't actually know how to play at... Winning situation all around... And it starts at Gerardo's... 
P.s. They have menudo too... So get your drunk ass down there and cure that hangover. Take a cab though... Drinking and drive is more than stupid and illegal, it's dangerous for you... And me... 
Vamos ala comer guay! 
Enjoy ..."}
{"text":"This take-out joint is delicious and fresh and cheaper and better than Roberto's. Carne asada fries are life-changing, as are the rellenos & the Cali burrito. Their salsa is fresh, and they'll include free grilled jalapeños that taste amazing."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. I ordered two beef tacos with beans and rice and a shrimp tostada. Everything tasted awful. The shrimp was not deveined and the tostada was overloaded with onions. The tostada also had no flavor. The rice had a horrible aftertaste. I ended up just throwing everything away. I lost my appetite. What a waste of $13."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food restaurant! The customer service is great! The manager is very conversational and attends you very well. It's almost like being at home. The tacos are delicious and the strawberries and cream. Their ice creams are home made."}
{"text":"I had the ceviche with all onions, and my bfs burrito was average at best. Not worth it. Don't go here."}
{"text":"5 stars for a taco shop.  Treated me with respect. They took pride in providing me a quality product and did so with gratitude.  I ate the carne asada burrito with a side of rice and beans, then ordered one more for the road."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a damn good burrito and knowing I dont like the place across the street I drove five miles to this cookie cutter replica of a fast food chain desperately trying to be an independent Mexican Restaurant.  

The food is average at best very plain and bland. The food on the topping bar was old looking and past its expiration time. 

The employees were pleasant and the only redeeming thing about this store."}
{"text":"Read the 10 reviews for this Mexican place hidden away in the giant Walmart shopping complex at the corner of Spring Mountain and Rainbow, and finally decided to give them a try after spending hours looking at fish at the nearby Petco.  It was not hard to find, if you just follow your eyes toward the flashing neon lights to the left Walmart (at night).

The place is kept clean, I saw the lady working there mop the floor like hourly.  The yellow floor might be wet hazard warning system is stationed just inside the door like a sentry.  This Mexican fast food restaurant was also not very busy when I arrived just after 9pm on a Monday. There was a couple finishing up what they had ordered, and another person came in as I was getting ready to head out with my to go order.

I glanced over their menu, which was pretty standard stuff compared to their peers and eventually settled on the Carne Asada Burrito (not a big burrito, but the taste was good and the price is very reasonable at $4.95) and a Strawberry filled Churros (fried nice and crispy and dusted with a lot of plenty of sugar, the strawberry filling was just okay). The entire bill with taxes came out to $6.43 exactly, so it was definitely a budget friendly meal without the frills. 

Their Salsa Bar is also kept very clean and the ingredients all look fresh and appetizing.  I took samples of the four salsas available and they were all decent to good. Just writing this brief review and looking over their to go menu, makes me want to drive back now to try out their Super Nachos ($7.30) or one of their soft tacos ($2.25 each).

What do I look forward to next time I drop in?  If I plan it right, I will be back on another Monday and get their Monday Super Special (Chicken Burrito Combo with a soda for just $3.99) or their 99 cents Chicken or Ground Beef Tacos on Wednesdays. For those that needs a hang over cure, Menudo are available on weekends.

Service:  Friendly and quick.
Price:  Good price to value ratio
Taste:  Good (but only based on the 1 burrito I have tried thus far)
Ambiance:  No frills, except for the nice wall mural.  If you stare at their wall mural long enough, you too can magically transport yourself to East LA with a little imagination.

Accepts American Express but not BitCoin, Litecoin, Namecoin, Ripple, and countless others related virtual currencies.

Tony's Trip Tips:
There is an Alkaline Water self serve filling station just next door ($2/gallon), you can get your Mexican fix and healthful water on the same trip.  Very time and eco-friendly.
