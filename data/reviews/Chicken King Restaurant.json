{"text":"Horrible chicken king location. I went thinking it would be just like the other one I visited, I was wrong. The food quality seems cheaper. No deluxe sides like Mac n cheese and green beans. My fries were nothing more than grease bites. The place seems unsanitary. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Wow each location sets there on price, food is decent, customer service awful, But hey its Chicken King  Oh and the online menu prices are inaccurate"}
{"text":"I hit this place up since this place was a local spot and I always wanted to see if it was one of those \"hole in the wall\" type of places. Yes, it was a \"hole in the wall\" type of place, but no the food wasn't amazing. I ordered 2 of the 8 piece wing dinner, and well to me it just wasn't spectacular. The wings came out wings, but lacked any sort of taste in it. I honestly don't know what the hype was? I guess it was cheap. It came with 4 rolls, but they only gave us 3.   Anyways, this place is marked and done. I won't be coming back here anytime soon. You'll have better luck at Church's Chicken or Bojangles with better chicken compared to this place. However, this place does have burgers and other menu items. But, come on... Chicken King restaurant, and you're not going to try the fried chicken that they named the restaurant after?"}

{"text":"Rounded down to the next star for this 2.5 star review. Came by here this afternoon for a cheap and quick bite to eat since its local to my apartment. The inside of the place was clean. I ordered the burger and fries special that only rang up to be $5. It was a pretty good size plate for the price. The burger was cheesy enough but had no seasoning and the toppings left much to be desired. I may give the place one more try to try the chicken or seafood since that's what they're known for."}
