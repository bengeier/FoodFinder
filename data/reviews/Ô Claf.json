{"text":"La salade est très abordable et super bonne, mais ils n'acceptent pas de carte de crédit ou débit. Quand je leur demande de m'indiquer le guichet le plus proche, ils me donnent des indications floues. Je cherche pendant 20 minutes avant de trouver un guichet à 5 rues de là, pendant que ma copine m'attend dans leur resto.  Je me suis pris une pizza en passant et j'ai abandonné leur sandwich. Ma copine a bien apprécié leur salade, mais le désagrément de trouver un guichet m'a gâché mon expérience."}
{"text":"Very good place! I go there a lot during my lunch hours ( hint: avoid going from 12-1PM during weekdays ) there's a huge lineup!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. You wouldn't realize this place even exists if you passed by it.. no sign, nothing. However, when you get inside you find a small low-roofed place and a menu of sandwiches in small or large sizes. Here's where it starts to get great. The large is not a bigger size, its actually 2 sandwiches! The large typically goes for $6.50 and can definetly fill you up. There are also really good quiches and even drinks are cheap. Honestly, I wonder how this place makes a profit but I'm loving this!"}
{"text":"Vous vous trouvez dans le centre-ville et cherchez un endroit beau, bon et pas cher pour casser la croûte? Le Clafouti propose des sandwichs déjà préparés (dont un excellent banh mi) ou faits sur demande, ainsi qu'une bonne quinzaine de salades fraîches et, de l'automne au printemps, une soupe du jour savoureuse. On y offre aussi des quiches et divers rouleaux et plats de sushis.  Compte tenu de la popularité de l'endroit chez les travailleurs du quartier, il vaut mieux éviter d'y aller entre midi et 13h, surtout si vous êtes très pressés. Par ailleurs, les inévitables files d'attente à l'intérieur du resto font en sorte que manger sur place n'est pas la meilleure option, mais c'est possible."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hole-in-the-wall. I eat here for lunch fairly often. The line gets long, but it moves quickly. At normal lunch hours don't expect to find a seat, they are usually full. It's better for grabbing a bite to go.  No-frills fresh sandwiches, various pasta salads and whatnot, a soup of the day, egg rolls, quiche, some bakery items, some refrigerated items, inexpensive bottled drinks... This place is cheap and good. Cash only! The staff is really nice, too."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and soup. It's a great deal if you are hungry during lunchtime. I would suggest to take-out your lunch as unfortunately it is not the greatest place to have a sit-down lunch with a friend, due to the amount of people that are coming in and out and the long, cramped line of hungry customers in a small space."}
{"text":"Considering the price, the food is perfect. If you work downtown and want a quick, easy and cheap lunch, this is your place.   The decor is awful and it has limited seating for the amount of people who get their sandwich fix on a given day but who cares. It's a cheap deli place! In and out in 10 mins and you can have a full meal for 7$.    Ultimately, this place is awesome. For as long as I'm working downtown, I will be a regular.   P.S. Bring cash."}
{"text":"\"Le Clafouti\" had a little makeover some time ago. Now it is called \"Ô Claf\", yet it stayed small and unassuming. The menu is much more compact, and the food is still as good. The hardworking ladies (all Asians with faultless French) behind the counter are as busy as ever, with non-stopping lineups during weekday lunchtime.   The crowd is a mixbag, from suit-wearing business people to students. I think customers are attracted because of their prices, which are p.r.e.t.t.y good for a downtown location (starting from 3.25$ for ~7 inch sandwich, it's cheaper than Vua or Subway). But the main reason I like Ô Claf is the freshness and simplicity of their food. They offer wholesome sandwiches and salads. Ingredients are fresh, flavours are well balanced, and sandwiches are made with good quality, crusty baguettes. I had the \"pâté de foie'' sandwich today, which was pretty generous on the liver!  There's a few small tables inside, but most people take out. In summer, it is particularly pleasant to walk up Drummond to Mont-Royal for a little picnic, or to head to the museums nearby.   Cash only, so bring your change! Note: they have good banana bread and other goodies near the counter!"}
{"text":"The food is still great and terrific value for $4, but unfortunately the `douche factor` has gone up to 11! I should have known better when I heard some fat suit walk out with three others and say `4 people for under $30, what a deal!` I was like, oh no, they`ve invaded it. I got there at around 1:20pm after the Friday lunch rush and usually it`s some students or a couple having a late lunch, now it`s full of soccer moms and cheap douchebag suits who found out about it on FB or Yelp, please stop these greedy people from making long line ups impossible to eat good food!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this roughly once a week for the last 6 years, all the way down from the McIntyre Building at McGill. Note that I have always done take out.  This is an incredible cheap and amazing place to go for lunch, with freshly prepared sandwiches. I almost always get Jambon de Bayonne + Oka cheese and end up with a bill of just over $5.40 after the tax! In addition to that, around 15 different kind of sandwiches are offered. Salads (probably around 10 kinds including fruit salads), spring rolls, and quiches are also available. I have tried the potato salad and was also amazing. However, you will be full with just a small sandwich!"}
{"text":"Best lunch place ever. If you go, you need to get the sticky rice and the pad-Thai, however they run out pretty quickly of these so try to go around noon (twice I went around 3 and they were out of pad-Thai). They have other good salads as well. I've never tried their sandwiches but my boyfriend has and he said they were very good and very big for the price! Also, this place is really inexpensive (I don't think I've ever spent more than 9$ here)."}
{"text":"Located in a small dimly lit basement property on Drummond, there is nothing glamorous about this small sandwich shop. They survive purely on decent food and large portions at reasonable prices.   The cryptic series of posters handwritten in French amounts to their menu of basic sandwich options, though the regulars seem to know what they want. The large sandwich is actually just two regular sandwiches, which are already generous. Get a large to share with a friend or to take home for later.  The hoagie rolls, similar to what you would get at the grocery store bakery, are fresh and chewy. The meats and cheeses are quite basic and similar to what you would get at the grocery store deli.  In fact, it's a sandwich almost identical to a sandwich you or I could make at home. That being said, it's still a tasty sandwich that I can enjoy.  They have a small selection of drinks in a refrigerator near the door and the counter is loaded with an odd assortment of chips, cookies and fruit. If you are hosting a group event, they also make sandwich platters.   It's not a fancy to say the least, everything from the lighting down to the Dijon mustard is simple and basic, but the simplicity and no frills atmosphere seems to work for them. At less than four dollars for a regular size sandwich, it's hard to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get a quick lunch when you're downtown. Don't settle for sad food court food and go to Ô Claf instead. The prices are unbeatable, they have a great selection and the service is quick. Don't miss out on the egg rolls!"}
{"text":"This place does really really good sandwiches and salads, and it's super cheap to boot!  A small sandwich and a large salad is probably more than enough for most people, and costs less than $7. Their egg rolls are home-made, and are a good fast (but not too unhealthy) option. The large sandwiches are 2x the small ones, and are more than enough to fill me at lunch time.  This place can get pretty busy around lunch time, so try to come just before/after if possible. Even if you come at peak hour the service is good, so you won't be waiting too long. You can get some sandwiches/other lunch options from the fridge (if you're in a rush), but I like mine freshly made.  My favourite is their salami sandwich, but they have a lot of other toppings to choose from (including vego options), and you can make your own.   They also have a range of sweets (chocolate muffins, banana bread, etc) which I think are mostly from Costco, but I still buy them regularly ('cause they're good)."}
{"text":"Excellent selection, good prices, very appropriate for lunch if you're in the downtown core and want something fresh and no frills. Family-owned business. Don't bother sitting here -- it's a grab and go kind of place. Minus one star for cash only and sometimes long lineups during lunch. I really love their bahn mi sandwich for $4."}
{"text":"Bonne petite place à sandwichs baguettes sur le pouce !    Souvent, les édifices à bureaux sont \"dotés\" d'un casse-croûte au rdc... et, trop souvent, ces endroits communément appelés \"cafés\" (pas pour \"cafétéria\", mais parce que l'on s'y rend, ou plutôt s'y arrête au passage, pour prendre un café... à l'eau) servent du bon manger au délicieux goût de cartron (que je vous entende dire mm-mm-miam !).  Eh bien, moi, dans mon édifice à bureaux, je n'ai pas de \"café\" au rdc.  Et c'est tant mieux comme ça ; je mange assez de fruits et légumes que je n'ai pas besoin d'un extra de cartron pour un supplément de fibres, Good God !    OK, to the point.  À quelque 2 portes de \"chez nous\" par contre, se trouve LE CLAFOUTI.    Le Clafouti n'est pas un 5 étoiles mais on y mange bien pour très peu et on s'y fait bien servir.  C'est un super endroit pour :    - manger frais (vraiment là, c'est pas un/le slogan) ;    - un sandwich baguette rapido-presto garni à ton goût (même si, des fois, y'a des line-ups ; les gens se sont passé le mot sur ce petit bijou d'endroit) ;    - des salades verte ou grecque ou d'épinards ou de thon ou de fèves mixtes ou de pois chiches ou de brocolis...   - une salade de fruits ;    - une soupe repas du jour (une tonkinoise anyone ?) ;    - une petite boîte de sushis ;   - des rouleaux impériaux ;    - des chips, du chocolat Côte-d'Or, des bananes, des pommes, des gâteaux maison...   - un staff super gentil.   Bon, j'en ai déjà trop écrit pour un si petit, et surtout sans prétention, endroit...  À retenir donc : le Claf' t'en bouchera bien un coin. Et te donnera même le goût d'y retourner le lendemain. Du moins, pour moi.  Mets-ça dans tes bonnes adresses ! ;-)"}
{"text":"fresh and delicious!!  some ready to eat sandwiches, rolls, sushis and salad in the fridge by the door, 1$ soda, very good soups in the fall and winter.... no interac"}
