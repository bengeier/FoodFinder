{"text":"Had this in tokyo first and was so excited it was coming to Toronto. Huge letdown as it didn't taste even close to the one there. They need to get it tasting closer to the original and I will go back. For now I will not return."}
{"text":"I am still awaiting a reply from Pablo themselves, but as this is a time-sensitive issue, and I'm wondering if anyone else is in the same situation as I am, I would like to speak up on an issue from today.   I had purchased three cheese tarts today. Two Regular (including the free one) and one Premium Cheese Tart.   I was looking forward to Pablo opening for a long time, as my family is a very avid fan of always trying different cheese tarts here and overseas to find the best one.   As expected, Pablo never disappointed with their quality. The Premium one is closer to a New York-style cheese cake. Rich, but lighter in flavour with a creme brulee top.   As advised by the employees, having it chilled is really the best way to go. The regular one was light and creamy. It was delicious, although (personal taste) I would prefer the shell to be a bit thicker.   The issue I would like to speak up on is the Premium Cheese Tart... I was #12 in line today, with proof from my number tag as follows... I may have been the first one to get a Premium Cheese Tart, but I cannot be 100% sure. I decided to place it in the fridge as my commute home was a long one, and I wanted to have it chilled. I opened the box just right now and my tart was sliced up. I thought it was supposed to be like that... Until I counted the pieces and tried to make a full tart... There were only five pieces out of six. It did not make a full tart and the lining used was like a cupcake liner. I have included a Instagram link of someone that was probably in line after me, and their tart looks completely different. It was not sliced, and it was a full tart in a totally different lining...  Question now is, is the tart supposed to be a full one... And I was just completely unlucky, or was this a mistake?  I've added photos and here is how it's supposed to look like. She was #75 https://www.instagram.com/p/BX9HaNUAw1y/  I will update this post when I hear back from Pablo...  Thank you for the quick reply. Pablo has offered a solution to me."}
{"text":"Waited for an hour and feel like it was a waste of time. The cheese tart tasted funny maybe because of the sour jam on top but just tastes weird to me."}
{"text":"line up for 15 mins to get a cheese tart and a soft ice cream cone. I liked the cone but I found the cheese tart was lack of cheese taste!"}
{"text":"i heard about the insane 4 hour line ups that occurred over the weekend and thought I would wait till the hype died before trying the cheese tarts.   But APPARENTLY go at opening time (10:00) and there was no line up ! (according to a coworker who kindly snagged a matcha tart to bring back to the office)   As excited as we were, the tart, by the time it had made through morning journey to the office, had become to what resembled a mountain of crushed jello encased in pastry.   So casting the whole concept that we 'feast with our eyes', we sampled the tart and the verdict was:   pros:  - the cheese filling surprised us with adzuki beans and mochi balls  - the crust was the best bit- nice and flaky (surprisingly not soggy!)   cons  - not travel friendly :(  - i didn't really taste any creaminess or cheese flavour ...  - it has a more custard flavour and somewhat reminds me of a portuguese egg tart but with more of a jello-like consistency  - not much matcha flavour either   worth the hype? maybe not so much - for those who haven't tried, i would definitely wait till the lines die down.  Perhaps you can satisfy your Pablo cheesetart curiosity with some egg tarts from a Chinese bakery for the time being instead..."}
{"text":"Had their original cheese tart, and it is amazing. I've been wanting to try this for a long time and it did not disappoint! The tart filling is a custard texture; its not too sweet which is perfect for me. And the crust is crisp and flaky. This tart tastes so light and airy that you won't even know that you ate half of it by yourself! Only downside is that this location didn't have much room to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Surprisingly I came here in the afternoon and there was barely a lineup. I ordered a slice of the signature cheese tart for 3.99 to try. Sadly it was underwhelming. Texture is very similar to an egg tart with a hint of cheese. There is a layer of jelly on top adding sweetness. The crust was nothing spectacular. Although it was refreshing because it was light and cool, unfortunately the flavour was quite bland. I will likely not be returning."}
{"text":"Quite good, though whether it is worth the price will depend on the individual person on how much they prefer to spend on a single dessert item.  Cost is $14.99 for the regular flavour and $16.99 for the matcha.  Right now they limit one cheese tart per customer.  Each tart is about 6 inches in diameter, about the size of an Uncle Tetsu cheesecake.  Smaller individual tarts should be available for sale soon.  I think if you brought it to a small social gathering (assuming you're willing to wait in line), it is something most North Americans likely won't have tried before and would be a welcome contribution at least for the novelty (e.g. this is the main reason Uncle Tetsu still has a line-up).  The regular flavour is better than the matcha.  When it's fresh out of the oven, the filling is a melting, gooey texture, almost like the filling in a lava cake but less dense.  The regular has a delicate cheese flavour that doesn't leave a heavy milky-cheese aftertaste (maybe due to a hint of citrus from the glaze topping?).  The matcha has some dumpling filling in it (red bean and the Asian sticky dessert dumpling).  I thought the dumpling filling in the matcha is important to add texture because otherwise eating the matcha feels like eating half-melted Tsujiri matcha ice-cream.  The pastry shell is light, flaky and crispy, even an hour after we picked it up.  It makes a crunch sound when we cut/bite into it, but it isn't like eating crumbly overdone toast.   Pablo is better than the Uncle Tetsu cheese tarts for sure (I would hope so since they mainly specialize in cheese tarts while Uncle Tetsu is supposed to specialize in cheesecake but have branched out).  I don't know that I would wait 20+ min in line for it or eat it that often at $14.99-$16.99 per tart.  I wonder how much the individual tarts will be; they may be a better value for money.  They also have a chocolate cheese tart which was sold out by the time I got there today, so I need to go back at least one more time to try that."}
{"text":"It would take a lot to upset me but I honestly had such a terrible experience on their grand opening day. The management obviously lacks experience and somehow do not know how to be considerate. The way they operate their business needs serious work and improvement. I was very disappointed. BEWARE: The other good reviews are for people that were invited to their media event. I started lining up just before 2 pm. They gave out number tags for the first 150 people for the free cheese tarts. The lady in front of me brought a young baby (who did not even have teeth) to the lineup. While the tags were being given out, this lady had the audacity to ask if her baby could get a free cheese tart as well. The staff asked the management and they happily agreed to give the baby a number tag. My friends and I were able to get number tags but we were unhappy about this decision. We asked the management why the baby could get one since it is obviously unfair for the people that trek all the way to the shop to only be turned away because a mom wanted her baby to count as one. I just felt like this was highly inconsiderate, knowing that this baby's free cheese tart could have went to somebody who came all the way to line up for one. It was obvious that they were trying to get an extra free one for their family and friends which is absolutely unfair for the other people. This lady bragged about her extra number tag on Instagram LOL.  From Caiwei's review, it seems like the management failed to mention to the others how the free cheese tarts were all given out. FYI Caiwei, this lady was the reason why you could not get a free cheese tart! This is another example of some of the inconsiderate decisions made by the management. I would highly not recommend. Also, the cheese tarts have a high markup. They sell these things for $10 in Japan but in Toronto, they're 15.99!"}
{"text":"I came here after hearing lots of hype about this place. My experience can be summed up by one expression....eh ¯\_(?)_/¯.  Wanted to try the deluxe because it as the crunchy creme brulee toping and i love creme brulee. However, when I got there around 2pm, they said it was already sold out, even though there wasn't a long lineup. On top of that, I just wanted a slice of the cheesetart, but because I was not buying a whole one, I had to wait in the dinning area and I couldn't take it to go. Fortunately, there were seating and didn't have to wait long.   The cheesetart reminded me a lot of the portuguese / chinese custard tarts. Soft, creamy, light custard and flakey crust. Did I like it? Yes. But did I find it overpriced? Also yes.   Would eat it again, but would certainly not line up for it. Maybe I'll visit again next year.  2.5* but an extra * for their cute uniforms :)"}
{"text":"I tried the mini cheese tarts when I was in Japan and I thought they were delicious so I expected the cheese tarts here to be the same. Unfortunately, I thought the taste of the cheese tart was really different from what I had in Japan so I was quite disappointed. The cheese tart here had a pretty tasty crust, but the cheese itself didn't taste that great. Luckily I picked it up in the morning and there was no lineup outside, but the cashier worked very slowly."}
{"text":"When the Pablo first came to Toronto, I was surprised by the long line-up in front of the store every time I passed the place. Naturally, I had been curious to try their cheese tart, but I wasn't willing to line up for it.   One night, I saw that the place didn't have any line up, so decided to finally give it a try. Funny enough, as soon as I came into the place, the line up started forming right behind me, which made me feel very lucky.   I ordered the original cheese tart as well as the original smoothie. The smoothie was really good - it definitely had a strong flavor of cheese, and it wasn't too sugary to ruin the taste of cheese. On the other hand, the famous tart was not so impressive, which was quite surprising to me as I usually enjoy most of Japanese pastry. Everything about the tart was very bland including texture, flavor and taste.   I would like to come back (when there's no line up again) to have smoothie again, but I don't think I will every buy the tart again."}
{"text":"I bought this cheese tart because I saw a long line up at the shop before. However I would like to say this cheese tart is just worth one star. Very disappointed because it barely taste the cheese at all, basically is tasteless. There's a thin layer of jello on top which make the tart even taste worst. It's cost $14.99 for the whole tart? I don't think so. I won't go back again."}
{"text":"it was only ok after the all hype while tasty was a little too runny for my taste, crust was rather bland could use some butter/sugar? maybe ill try their premium next time!"}
{"text":"Loved the cheese soft serve . Awesome tarts as well . Just one suggestion I feel the mini tarts are lil over priced ."}
{"text":"Great cheese tarts and coffee. Good atmosphere. Very chill and warm. Could spend the rest of the day hanging out there. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"What is there to say about Pablo's that hasn't been said already?  Their cheesetarts are absolutely divine - not too sweet (I'm more of a savoury tooth myself), with a beautifully baked crust, filled with the most decadent of cheese. The staff here are proud of their product and so, so sweet!  At the end of the evening, they gave us an extra slice of cake because they could tell one of my friends was curious about the matcha cheesecake. The atmosphere is also lovely - like a cozy library with pretty decent seating in the midst of downtown. Highly recommend!  P.S: Ignore the comparisons \"Oh, this is better/worse\" to Tetsu.  They're totally different types of desserts! It's like comparing apples and oranges. Both rock my socks though."}
{"text":"So I counted more than 50 cheesecakes available to go sitting behind the cashier and yet there are more than 30 people lining up outside, clearly supply is not the problem, the store is purposely creating the line up.  You got 3 people working at the drink station, then 4 people working in the baking area and another person greeting people.  Why only open one line up when you have two cashier machines and you clearly see the huge line up?  At least at Uncle Tetsu the cashier is way more efficient, 1 person packs it and have it ready to be handed over to customer.  I understand if it's hard to meet demand but when you have 50 ready to go cheesecakes and customers still have to line up for over an hour, clearly management has some issues.  Now to the cheesecake or cheese tart,  totally not up to the hype.  Whole family thought it was really average, not just me.  It's like those Chinese tarts, remove the sweetness and add some cheese.  It's so \"watery\" that you can barely cut and hold properly!  Just walk 30 seconds and get an Uncle Tetsu cheesecake, it's much better!  I'm pretty sure majority of people lining for it just want to take a picture of the tart and post on social media."}
{"text":"The place was pretty big. They have good size seats and tables even though they are in the middle of downtown area. They have ice cream, frappe, cold drinks and hot drinks. They have items more than uncle Tetsu. Their main things are cheese tarts. They are very good. They are cheese tarts not cheese cakes. They are different from Uncle Tetsu. These cheese tarts are more gourmet type. I got just a whole baked cheese tart for $14. It was reasonable. I am looking forward to trying premium cheese tarts someday."}
{"text":"I didn't like it, it's bland and watery...I like the one from Uncle Tetsu or Bake Code better...not worth the long line up and high price imo. But maybe people who like that kind of texture and taste will like it"}
{"text":"Sweet, creamy and crunchy cheesetarts! Love their original and matcha flavours as well as their coffees! Usually order takeout as it is more worth it but their cafe is really cute as well-makes for a perfect catch up session with friends!"}
{"text":"Crazy queue but nice comfortable space.  I had the chocolate tart and ate it warm. So gooey and delicious.  It was a good level of sweet but you're gunna have to share or save a good chunk otherwise you'll be super sick.  Pastry is firm and flakey and a perfect foundation for the heavy cheese.    I love that they give out pots of honey and gel but wish they weren't plastic -like the cutlery-a bit of a faux pas.  I would think most places would be moving away from the sheer amount of plastic and packaging but not this place."}
{"text":"Describe as the best cheese tart in Japan, Pablo just opened in Toronto last week! Ive been follow their instagram closely waiting to get my hands on delicious cheese tart.  And well. It might be the best cheese in japan, but not in Canada. The smooth cheese filling lack flavours and the crust is crumbly and blend. This is an very average cheese tart. I would, if uncle tetsu line is too long then make my way to Pablo as a plan B tart.  Thats pablo. Plan B Tart"}
{"text":"The best Cheesetart ever!!!!! I have tried this in Osaka before and I was amazed! Now I can have the same taste in Toronto! Even though the matcha one was sold out, the original one also tastes good! Love that!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Came here by chance and tried the cheese tarts and icecream. It was definitely something I come back for from time to time. I would highly recommend this place to just about anyone as it is something worth trying! My only pet peeve is that the matcha icecream is usually sold out (apparently the machine is out of service), but the cheese icecream is soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cozy space to grab coffee and of course one of their delicious cheesetarts. I recently tried their mini cheesetarts and they don't disappoint! They're very rich in flavor, specially the chocolate one!  I find it a bit pricey but they're so delicious I didn't care lol def recommend it"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place! At first I was skeptical, thinking that this was just another Uncle Tetsu, but I was wrong! Pablo's cheese tart is freshly baked out of the oven as when you stand in line, you see the staff carefully and attentively making the warm, sweet, flavourful tart from step 1 to finish. They must really be passionate in making their tarts as they gently stamp the Pablo signature on top of the tart.  The bakers were also properly dressed in their Pablo uniform which makes it look like we were in Tokyo. There were also sitting areas if you which to have your tart while it is warm. The freshly baked tart is $14.99 but if you want a bite size, you can have it for $3.99. The cheese tart taste like a warm cheesecake that is very satisfying and makes you wish you got the $14.99 instead of the $3.99 as you want more!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"To be honest, the taste highly dependent on if it was lava hot from the oven, vs 1 hour later.  For prior, it worth 4 stars.  When it's fresh, it was flaky and molten hot and taste so good. For latter, it is probably 2 stars max.  The crust won't be good.  The apricot gel congealed and too thick to match the cheese crepe brûlée center.    I also bought the mini Mont Blanc. It was decent, but won't drive me to think of it and miss it like other stores in Japan.  It's still a good experience to try it out, especially now the line is short.  Also I noted that did not remind the customer of the amount of time it can leave out in room temperature beyond the sticker on the box, not very traditional Japanese cake shop style from customer service perspective."}
{"text":"I did not like the soft serve ice cream that I got. The Icecream was matcha flavor and tasted artificial. This is an establishment that is supposedly giving tetsu a tough competition but I don't see the same quality in the product."}
{"text":"Went here on a double date with friends from out of town. The cheesecake itself has a more custardy, silken and creamy consistency compared to your traditional soft silken German cheesecake. The crust is flakey so you'll want to have it on a plate. It's totally not that sweet; even as someone who's averse to saccharine icing type sweetness I found the tart to be too bland and milky. I think it fits with an Asian palate though, and the three others I went with really liked it."}
{"text":"I've been to the original Osaka shop and the new one here. I far prefer this than Uncle Tetsu, which is really just unremarkable sponge cake with cheese. I prefer my cheesecake dense and NY style so Uncle Tetsu will never be something I find appealing. Besides, it's actually quite mediocre beyond just my personal preference. My partner being Japanese from Tokyo said Uncle Tetsu is nothing special. Pablo's matcha Cheesetart with azuki red beans and shiratama (mochi balls) is my new favourite. And it's even better after being in the fridge overnight. The strawberry mochi Cheesetart is also beautiful and lovely, with a nice mellow flavour and textures."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Just as I remembered from Japan. Half an hour lineup. My sister got the matcha flavored one and we loved it. Cheese flavor is faint but the crust is to die for."}
{"text":"I was looking for coffee and tasty treat.. it looked and smelled so good.. besides I love cheesecake... so  I tried their tart and coffee .. it was really good. The only problem their paper cups are not very good... I also took home their small cheesecake.. I think it had peach jam on top.. it was very different from the small tart.. it was very smooth and silky.. with a bit of peach flavour.. so good."}
{"text":"I really like these cheese tarts. I understand that not everyone's going to love them or think they're worth the line, but I personally do. My favourite is the original cheese tart. It's super smooth and creamy, and the apricot glaze adds the perfect hint of tartness to cut through the richness. The matcha tart is great because of the shiratama and red bean paste inside, but the glaze on this one is quite sweet, so keep that in mind if you prefer subtle flavours.  The premium cheese cake is the only one I wouldn't line up for. It tastes like the traditional cheese cakes we have here only with a caramelized outer crust, and you get a far smaller slice than you would at other places for the price.   I also enjoy their matcha smoothie with shiratama and azuki cream. Those three things just make a perfect combo, no matter if they come in tart or drink form."}
{"text":"Truly amazing! This is the best cheesecake place I've ever asked for! original cheese tart and classic cheese cake is the must try item! sugar level is just perfect! Definitely my favourite dessert place in town!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pablo twice since its opening and am sad to say that I will not be returning. I wanted to love this so much but it's just too sweet. I've tried the original and the green tea tarts (green tea is sweeter than the original) but only found them to be average and not worth the price. I've also tried the milk pudding and was also disappointed with how artificial it tasted.   Given that people say that the Pablos in Japan are better, I would give them one more try when I visit Japan however, within Toronto I would prefer Uncle Tetsu's cheese cakes over Pablo's tarts."}
{"text":"Their matcha tart is amazing, I've tasted nothing like it in Toronto. Probably one of my favorite desserts period."}
{"text":"My friend heard that Pablo's Cheesetart rivals Uncle Tetsu's cakes. And I had to see if that was true. I'm not an avid fan of Uncle Tetsu, but they have this slightly addicting taste.   They have a selection of five drinks (smoothies) to choose from, ranging from mango to chocolate and we went with the matcha and azuki cream. Originally I thought it would be very heavy, but it turned out to be pleasantly light and refreshing. The drink had matcha jelly, chocolate whipped cream and I believe some type of chewy pearl (? Lol idk).   The cheese tart had the fluffiness of an egg tart and the creaminess of a cheese cake. Really really delicious! I actually wanted to take a full size chocolate cheese tart home, but at 7pm they were already sold out. Next time I guess.   Will surely be back to try their other drink flavours and the matcha and chocolate cheese tart!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good but I think it was overhyped. We took it to go and the crust was soggy and not crispy. The top jam part came off the tart and spilled in the box a bit. The taste of the actual cheesecake part was really good and the topping was great too but the crust being soggy really put a damper on it. Overall I liked the flavour and experience but the crust was lacking."}
{"text":"This is one of the most anticipated store openings in Toronto of 2017. The store was supposed to be opened in March 2017, but it wasn't until August when the doors finally opened to the public with great fanfare which included a brief speech from the founder of Pablo. Is this worth the hype?  I wish I could give it a 2.5 instead of three. I was one of those who lined up for the grand opening (yes call me stupid but hey that is how foodies roll) so the expectation and hype was great. But that's all it was.  The cheese tart was bland and had a very weak flavour, which lacked any cheese or cream flavour. The crust was rather flaky and wasn't too dry. The texture inside was delicate like tofu or custard pudding.   If you are someone who prefers a stronger cheese taste, then I would give this a pass or at least buy a small slice to say you have tried it. If you prefer more of a subtle taste and let the texture of the tart take over, this actually might be good and contender."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this a 2 star instead of 3 is to prevent more people from waiting a really long time for something kind of mediocre. It isn't bad, but it's not great either. Filing was somewhat bland and not chees-y tasting, and pretty hefty at $15. May want to try it when the line dies down."}
{"text":"30 minute wait. Limited flavour, it really dependent on your luck of the day.  Got the regular flavour for the cheese tart to share with the fam.  Everyone liked it. It was lighter flavour (not too cheesy). Being a Hong Kong family - all members agree - it taste oddly similar as a giant egg tart (dan tart) except firmer.   The crust does not stay well over time. It absorb moisture from the filling over time, making if soggy. Consume fast!  Would we eat it again? Yes, only when there isn't a line up anymore."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was adamant of trying Pablo Cheesetart at first because of the long lines and how overrated it was. I got to admit it was pretty tasty. Tasty to the point where I prefer it over Uncle Tetsu! The cake was light and the shell was so light. It was an absolute delight to eat; however, the price of the tart was a little bit too much for what it offered. I would definitely come again to bring friends or buy a tart for a special occasion but it was good one time dessert to try!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for cheesecake or cheese tarts, especially if you have uncle tetsus on your mind. It won't compare. HOWEVER do come here for their ice cream! They have matcha and cheese soft serve & offer a swirl option. Many people (including myself) are offended by the idea of cheese flavoured ice cream, but this was delicious. They sell out of the twist option so go earlier during the day. Their matcha is made perfectly & not too bitter or artificial tasting. Their cheese ice cream is delicious! Literally taste like cheesecake flavoured ice cream with a hint of vanilla. Must try! The ambience is also cute & intimate. Place is clean and service is good too."}
{"text":"I think the cheesetarts tastes better than Uncle Tetsu, however, for $15 it's a tough choice.   For flavour I would take this place but for price you may want to consider Uncle Tetsu.  As for the taste, I thought it was pretty good with just enough sweetness and cheese taste. The texture might put off some people but I didn't mind it at all. The crust was really well done.  The low rating is because of price. It's pretty ridiculous to charge $15 for these cheesetarts. Also, it seems the hype died down pretty quickly so I think people have a similar idea.   Try once and forget it. Don't wait in line for it either. You're going to kick yourself wasting 20-30 mins.  1.5 stars rounding up. I think it tastes better than Uncle Tetsu but for $15??? LOLOL get out of here"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Waited for 1hour and Ordered the cheese tart. Too much egg and sugar, no cheese"}
{"text":"Meh just an average cheestart. I waited for the hype to be over so I wouldn't have to wait in the line. I couldn't really understand what the hype was app about. It tasted just like what I had exepected, a tart  with cream cheese filling. The store gave nice atmosphere and was a good sitting spot to chat with friends for couple minutes. I personally wouldn't try again tbh."}
{"text":"We went to Pablo's in the afternoon (around 2:30ish) and there was no line up. We ordered the original cheesetart and it was quite delicious. It was light, creamy and the sweet apricot glaze on top adds a nice fruity taste to it. The crust was crispy and flaky just the way I like it. The cheese tart was big enough for my husband and I to enjoy. We also bought a special chocolate smoothie and while it was yummy, it was pretty small for $5+. Pablo's is a little overpriced but worth the trip to get their cheesetart when we go into the city from time to time (we live in Brampton)."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and it does not disappoint... except for the fact that they are ALWAYS out of the thing you want. This time it was the original cheese tart.  I still very much enjoy the matcha cheese ice cream on a cone. It blends some good flavors and textures together. The premium cheese tart we had was very creamy with a touch of lemon meringue and the crust was almost like an egg tart crust but baked slightly longer. Matcha & Azuki cream is basically a Matcha shake with red bean whipped cream and two sweet chewy rice balls. Which wasn't too bad but it is nowhere near as good as the matcha ice cream.  The seating area itself is pretty small... seats around 20 people. The service is usually pretty quick and people are out around 15-30 minutes."}
{"text":"I had their original cheese tart. I like how light it is and that it's not too sweet. I knocked 1 star off because it's slightly expensive. $15 for the tart. If it was less expensive at $12, I may buy it again."}
{"text":"Got the Pablo tart ($3.99) to share. You can read my review with a grain of salt because my friend and I both do not like cheesecake but we thought maybe this would change our minds. People have told me it's like a Chinese egg tart...not at all. I won't comment on the filling, but the crust was terrible. It was soggy and tasteless like cardboard, like what you'd get a grocery store."}
{"text":"Was alright. Not the most amazing cheese cake. It wasn't as decadent or rich tasting. It was more like a faint creamy cheese filling. The crust however was pretty good. Maybe not enough to make up for the rest of the cheese cake though. I haven't tried their cheese tarts and might one day but for now the cheese cake was just okay."}
{"text":"The pies are ok. Saw a video clip of this food critic who flew from nyc to japan to try out Pablo pies. She should see it's available in Toronto.  Wasn't impressed with the desserts.. the service may be not great. The girl at the counter refused to give smaller pieces of pies to go. Insisted to order the whole pie."}
{"text":"Location/Service Along Dundas, close to Eaton centre. Parking might be a little difficult since it's downtown core.  Place is not hard to miss since it has a bright outdoor decor. Inside similar, bright with a few seating available.  Staff overall nice and helpful with what items are available for sale.   Food I tried two of their cheese tarts - original and matcha.  Presentation wise it's very good. For $15, it is a pretty big cheese tart.  But a little messy to eat - it has a very thick and hard crust with a very liquidity and jelly centre. It's a bit difficult to share and slice. And once you cut it, the presentation is gone cause it becomes a blob almost.  Taste wise. It's on a sweeter end, especially with the layer of sugar syrup at the top. I felt it overpowers the actual content of the tart. Original was a lot better compared to matcha. Original was smooth and eggy. Matcha was bitter and combining it with the syrup made it a bit weird to my tasting. I think the way to incorporate the matcha could be done a lot better.   Overall this place is okay. It's great they start off strong with a few variety of items to choose from, but I wonder if that might throw it off in terms of consistency and quality. I haven't tried their drinks, but would be curious to try to see how it differs. I look forward to their mini tarts as I think more people would generally like the size and portion of it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, after dinner, about 30 mins prior to closing and they ran out of the original cheese tart so we got 2 mini cheese tarts. It was $3.5 each which is kind of expensive but I know cheese can be expensive so I guess it's average. The tart was very delicious. Tasted like silky cream cheese so it has a very defining cheese flavour but was not too overwhelming. Even though the tart was very small, it was a great dessert and very filling for a small dessert.  There is also a small seating area at the back of the restaurant. A high communal table, a few along the wall and 2 couches. Seems like people grab a snack and just chill and talk so it can be hard to get a seat."}
{"text":"Didn't think that I would like it because a lot of people compared it to Cheese Garden and I didn't like theirs at all but oh my goodness theirs is the perfect combination of sweet and cheesy! The line may seem long but it goes pretty quick!"}
{"text":"This is another addition to the Japanese dessert craze (not all bad). Thankfully the line ups seemed to have died down so my wait time was next to nothing.  I was visiting friends nearby so decided to buy the original tart.  The presentation is nice with neat packaging that's synonymous with Japanese design.  On to the main attraction the shell isn't a tart shell and is made from puff pastry hmm not necessarily a bad thing but for a dessert that's this tall not a good mode for transport. On to the taste hmm this was more like custard and the cheese flavor was hard to identify. The apricot flavored glaze didn't wow either. I did appreciate that it wasn't overly sweet which is good.  I didn't enjoy this tart though they have a lot of other options so might try those maybe but for now 2 stars"}
{"text":"I had the original cheese tart. It's exactly what it sounds like. A giant cheese tart. About six inches diameter.   The crust is flaky and similar to an egg tart crust. The inside is a cheese custard filling with a tangy lemon (?) glaze.   I don't think a cheese tart of this size works. The ratio of custard to crust is bad. There's too much custard to crust. The lemon glaze is adds sour notes that creeps in unexpectedly.  I look forward to trying the smaller tarts."}
{"text":"Had the big tart when it opened and wasn't impressed but came back and had the mini tarts and they were amazing. This was comparable to the tokyo location I've been to."}
{"text":"After I got off school, some of my classmates wanted to try out this newly opened cheesetart place.  I was expecting a long line up, but there were that many people in front of the line, maybe around 7-8 people.  However, we waited for almost 35 minutes until we can make a purchase.  I ordered the original flavour for $14.99 and one of my classmate order the matcha flavour for $16.99.  In addition, you can only buy one item from the menu only not including beverages.  The cashier told us that we need to wait for 14 minutes for the matcha flavour.  The cheesetart was really jiggly, but really hard to cut since we were only given a plastic knife.  I broke the tart while cutting a quarter of it to try.  Thr puff pastry shell was hard and not really great flavour and was not really crispy.  The cheese egg curd filling was just way too rich.  The balance of flavour is not really there.  I think the apricot glaze was not a good match to the tard which kind of distract from the flavour of the filling.  I would prefer this to be serve cold rather than warm.    After I tried my slice, I waited anxiously for the matcha.  We waited for a hour before we got the cheesetart when the cashier said around 14 minutes.  I was really disappointed with that since service industry usually under promise and over deliver, but they did the exact opposite.  The matcha flavour one with some red bean paste on the bottom has good flavour profile, but it was just too sweet for my taste.  Totally disappointed since I spent almost 2 hours here without satisfying my expectation and I won't come back again."}
{"text":"Warm,  soft,  and melt-in-your-mouth cheese tarts!    I went to Pablo on a Sunday afternoon and the line-up was about 20 minutes. The original cheese tart was amazing!  The crust was very crispy and the baked cheese was soft and warm.  The texture was somewhat like custard bread pudding without the bread chunks.  The cheese tart didn't feel as heavy as I thought.  It was layered with apricot jam,  which made the cheese tart even more appetizing.   The reason I haven't rated it a 5-star is because it is quite pricey. One cheese tart is $15 plus tax. Otherwise,  I highly recommend it if you're a cheese lover like me."}
{"text":"Rating - 1.0/5.0  Sorry but this ain't good. Definitely overhyped and am hoping the one in Japan is not like this. I decided to check this place out a couple weeks ago as there wasn't really a lineup. The wait was around 15 minutes at around 8-9 pm.  We tried the original cheesecake tart. For something that has received so much praise and anticipation, it was truly a disappointing experience.  The texture was runny and lacked any depth in cheese flavour. The crust was also bland.   We tried eating it fresh as well as after leaving it in the fridge the next day - which was even worse. It was like eating a soggy cardboard with some eggy pudding.  +1 star for the polite and attentive service  I have walked by the place a few times recently and the line seemed to have died down quite a bit. The hype is over folks. You can sit back and relax for now until another Japanese franchise decides to open shop again."}
{"text":"The cashier who helped us was so rude, I think they should train them properly how to serve people."}
{"text":"Came to try their mini tarts but noticed their Limited Time Only Christmas Special, a \"White Raspberry Mini\" ($4.99), and decided to try that instead. It was served chilled and it wasn't too sweet with the raspberry filling. Definitely a nice and cute treat for the holidays."}
{"text":"The mini tarts are better than the large tarts because they taste cheesier and creamier. The small tarts use an actual tart crust. The large tarts have this weird thin crust, and have this nasty apricot jelly on top of them that you have to scrape away. Both the mini tarts and the large tarts are way too expensive at $4 and $15, but with the crazy rent prices in the downtown core, it's probably what they'll need to charge to stay afloat once the hype has died down.  Uncle Tetsu's around the corner has a cheesecake which I feel is much better than these cheese tarts."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, I came here because I had Pablo cheesecake in Japan and it was delicious. I got the green tea cheesecake, it had mochi and red bean in it. I refrigerated it which is a no no no. It softened the crust, and it is not recommended you reheat the cheesecake. It tasted great, but I didn't think it worth $17."}
{"text":"Very disappointed .. this place won't coming back again . No good. Taste totally different like the Pablo cheesecake in Japan . Not recommended for anyone . !!! Waste my money and time ..!!"}
{"text":"If you like Japanese style cheesecake, then you should definitely here! $12.99 it a little pricey, but once in a while, I guess it's affordable"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening at around 7:00pm and the lineup took a total of approximately 20 minutes to get through. Only the original cheese tart was available as everything else was sold out.  As we were lining up, we noticed there was a nice seating area  in the back. Sadly, the cheese tart was a complete disappointment. It was so light to the point where there was barely any cheesiness. It was more of an egg tart, with a terrible crust that lacked flakiness and butter. We don't  plan on returning, especially at a price point of $14.99. There are plenty of much better options out there. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"They have the smaller size tarts but if u ask for it to go they gave it to you on a napkin no box no bag.. when if i could get a box or a bag they said they are not allowed to give boxes or bag for the small tarts.. did not end up buying it.. no idea how it tastes but the stupid rule gets a 1 star. Looks like the soup nazi from Seinfeld has some competition"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for their cheese tarts, and really was pleasantly surprised !   We ordered the full size of the original and the green tea matcha.  The original is my personal favourite. The flakey crust and yummy light filling is to die for! Especially enjoy the sugar jelly layer on the top.   This is not as cheesey as expected however I love the texture and how it isn't too sweet.   The green tea matcha tart is not everyone's cup of tea I would say. It is over powering in flavour compared to their classic tart. The inside has pockets of red bean paste and Mocchi balls. The green tea is strong but when you eat the whole thing with the filling in 1 bite it balances out to be pretty tasty.   They often do good promotions too so you can try their other items.   Service is knowledgable and friendly as well.   Well kept and clean establishment. I would highly reccomend this as a regular dessert place to be!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed at the Pablo. I used to have this in Japan and I love it. However Pablo in Toronto are too sweet and portion is smaller while much more expensive then the Japanese one.  Matcha cheesetart is even sweeter than the original one. It tastes like artificial matcha favor.  I would definitely not waste my time and money at this place anymore."}
{"text":"I had Pablo years ago in Japan and Taiwan, and again in Japan on a recent trip. The cheese tarts there were heavenly, and I couldn't be more excited when I learned my favourite cheesecake was coming to Toronto. Unfortunately, Pablo in Toronto is nowhere close to the original. The Toronto version is not as cheesy and runny. The crust also isn't as flakey. I tried making this kind of cheesecake at home after trying the one in Japan and I can honestly say that the one I made was superior to the Pablo in Toronto. It was quite honesty a huge disappointment. I told so many of my friends how amazing Pablo cheese tarts were and it's a shame they won't get to experience that here in Toronto :("}
{"text":"I had this cheese tart in Japan, and it taste really good and they have different flavour in Naha, Japan.  Not sure why is the one in Canada don't have the same taste as the one in Japan.  The one in Canada is a little different cause I find is a little too soft on the crust and the texture inside of the cheese is too watery.  The cashier is very slow not sure they do it purposely so people's can line up. Lol  Is still not bad but cannot compare to the store in Japan. Can get Pablo in lots of location.  Basically is ok but not worth of a long line up."}
{"text":"I liked the vibe of this cafe. Props for photos, comfy couches, good lighting. The original cheese tarts were the best. I ordered the mini tarts in chocolate. Do not get those. The chocolate tastes really cheap, like it's made from powder. I took home the large size original cheese tart. The crust was bit soggy. The later of gelatine or jelly had slid off. It looked quite gross, at first I didn't know what it was. The cheese filling itself was quite yummy. I would suggest eating it fresh in the cafe."}
{"text":"I had these cheese tarts in Japan and they were quite good. The ones here don't really compare. The tart itself is quite good - buttery and flakey.   The cheese part? Not quite that great. I can't really describe it. It taste like a watered down egg tart tasting dessert with some cheese taste.  For $15 dollars a cake, I probably won't be returning.  If you want to try it, I recommend going at night. The wait was around 10 minutes and they take cash or debit only.   They also offer cheese soft serve, milkshakes and shaved ice - they run anywhere from $3.99 to $7.99.  There is also a small seating area in the back if you want to sit and enjoy your cake!"}
{"text":"Decided to visit Pablo after the lines died down. Compared to the hour-long lines from the first week, there wasn't much of a line at this point which makes it much more accessible for the impatient.  The restaurant has a nice seating area in the back, with plates and cutlery available upon request if you'd like to enjoy your cheese tarts while they're hot...If they're hot.  There are a couple flavours to choose from such as the original, matcha, or chocolate among other things. You can also choose to buy a small tart, a big tart, or a slice of tart. If you go for the large one, you're looking at about $15 each. It's not too big, but not too small either and good to share between 4 people.  The tart itself might not be hot when you get it. Maybe they are turning over less frequently so you end up with tarts that aren't just out the oven.  The filling is alright. I tried the original and the matcha red bean, and think the original tastes better. The crust however is delicious. If they offered it on the menu as an option, I'd just buy a bag of the crust because it was definitely the star.  When it comes to cheese tarts, I'd prefer the ones up at Cheese Garden."}
{"text":"Saw tons of postings about Pablo so I wanted to try it for the longest time. It happened that me and my husband were in downtown so we decided to give it a try. We were there during a weekday at around 3ish, the store was packed but the line was moving really quick. I did not even have enough time to finished looking at the menu and it's already my turn to order. So, I give 5 stars to the service.  We ordered some mini cheese tart, Rich Berry Cheese Frute and Pablo Signature Coffee. The mini cheese tart has the cheese taste but I was expecting even more cheesy to it. I found that the filling to be too loose (or too watery). I was looking for more solid custard like filling. For the crust, I am not too sure if it's suppose to be butter crust or pastry crust. The Rich Berry Cheese Frute was actually not very rich in berries, but the taste is good, not those adding water to syrup type of drinks. And my husband was satisfied with his cold coffee.  With the price scale, I would have a higher expectation to the cheese-tart but ending up that the drinks are much better than the main focus on their menu."}
{"text":"I had to make my way to Pablo to really understand  the hype. I loved it! It of course is more expensive compared to Uncle Tetsu but so worth. The cheese, flavor as well as aroma is much richer.  I tried their original cheesetart. Simple and vey flavorful. To my surprise its texture was like pudding. It was not overly sweet but it had hints of sweetness and tangy taste from im guessing the lemon thinly layered flavor on top. My mom is not into cakes because they tend to be very sweet but she truly enjiyed the cheesetart and even had seconds!   I also ordered their cheesecake drink which was so good. Fatty heavy and cheesey! To my surprise there were litrle cheese chunks in there as well as two pieces of rice balls. A drink where you must chew more than drink!  Overall pretty good spot:)"}
{"text":"Probably the best Cheesetart I have ever tasted in my life!   I had the mini Cheesetart because I did not know what I was going into!  Behold the glory!  It was so delicious and the crust was perfect.  Words cannot describe the flavors that I tasted!  You must simply go to Pablo and enjoy the tart! Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Pablo mini cheese tarts are the perfect treat when you're just craving for something that's sweet and with a crunch.  I ordered all the flavours they had available at the time which was Roasted Marshmallow chocolate, The original cheese tart, Strawberry Daifuku and Chocolate.  All four mini tarts came up to just under $20 after taxes.  The cheese tarts were aesthetically pleasing to look.  The fillings tasted fresh and creamy and complemented the crispy shell tart.  I personally prefer the mini tarts as you get to try a variety of flavours. The cheese filling in the mini tarts is also slightly denser and the shell is a lot more crispier and more like a cookie as oppose to the full size cheese tart which has a flaky pastry shell.   Pablo usually offers seasonal items, so keep an eye out to see what special flavours are in store."}
{"text":"Just a heavily branded, average tasting cheese tart. In my opinion, for the price you pay, you can get a better tasting tart from a Chinese bakery.  The flavour isn't terrible, but I don't find it unique compared to other options.  It will be interesting to see how well this place does after the hype dies down."}
{"text":"I guess this is a new cheese pastry place in Canada. Again, hailing from Japan, it is the current rage. The line up there was crazy. I don't understand what it is with Japanese cheese pastries now a days, but it seems to be the boom.   Can't say much about the service or the experience as I got my cousin to wait in line and buy it for me. I hate waiting in line and if I can get a sucker family member to line up for me, all the better..   Overall, the cheese is very creamy, and the pastry is amazing....for the first few bites. As soon as we start eating more, you begin to get sick of it. We ordered two tarts/cakes for a family of six, and couldn't finish it because it was too much. The kids said that it was great at the beginning, but began to dislike it after the first slice. It just wasn't for us."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while walking around the area, but I remembered i had seen videos of these Cheesetarts on my Facebook feed. Going in, I thought these were tarts with soft cheese inside (like a warm brie), which is way off the mark. Although, if someone knows where to get that kind of tart, I'm all ears. These cheesetarts remind me of Uncle Tetsu's, sort of like a cheesecake within a tart cup. Except the filing is more dense, and rich. P.S. There was no lineup on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Honestly, Pablo's is just all hype. The combination of the long lines and price just isn't worth it. I would much rather walk a couple of steps further and head to the Uncle Tetsu cheese tart location. The line was not very long today around 12:30pm. My mom had waited around 30 minutes, which in comparison to the 1-2 hour wait others have been saying it takes is almost nothing.   They have a total of 3 flavours: original, matcha, and chocolate. At $14.99 for the original cheese tart, it very much tasted like an egg tart with some cheese flavour and jelly on top. Their matcha cheese tart is priced slightly higher at $17. They also have a 'premium' tart, which is almost like a creme brûlée for $24.99.   They do have lattes and drinks, but you do have to line up in the ridiculous line prior to getting in the store and ordering it!  With the lines, prices and disappointment, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"From reading the previous reviews, I had pretty low expectations for the cheesecake and it looked like the reviews were correct. The cheesecake was quite pricey ($15) and personally, I didn't find the taste to be as good as Uncle Tetsu. The cake was quite bland and had a easily broken down, jello-like texture that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"A bit overraed but a nice experience. It won't create an addiction but worth to try once"}
{"text":"Pablo is finally in Toronto and is located just a few steps away from the Eaton Centre!   Although both are from Japan, all the tarts I tried were very different from the fluffy Uncle Tetsu cheesecakes that were introduced to Toronto not too long ago. I tried their original tart, matcha tart and premium cheesecake and I would recommend the matcha one out of the three. I was super surprised to discover red bean paste and even a bunch of MOCHI inside of the cheesy matcha. The premium cheesecake was also good! It had a crunchy crème brulee top and was close to an New York style cheesecake but not quite as heavy.  I also tried their matcha cheese smoothie which I thought tasted sort of like a thick version of a green tea latte with a slight hint of cheese. Despite tasting great, l found it very hard to finish because of how heavy it was. I'd recommend sharing this drink if you plan on trying it out!    Also, this location has quite a few tables and offers other delicious treats like shaved ice and mini tarts! I'd say this is a great place to gather with friends for some dessert."}
{"text":"The cheese cake is so good!!! While one may be tempted to compare Pablo with uncle tetsu's cheesecake, I see the two desserts as very different types of desserts and I can't see how one could begin to compare the two."}
{"text":"I am jumping off the hype train before it crashes. Pablo has been shared on everyone's networks countless times, and the long three hour line ups were exemplary of this.  It was presumed to go head to head with big name Uncle Tetsu and establish itself as the new trendsetter in town. Well, this new kid on the block just couldn't make it into the cool kids' club.  It's more like that new transfer kid who tried to be cool but ended up looking funny and out of place.  In other words, compared to other nouveau Japanese dessert chains, Pablo falls short in flavour, texture, and price.   *Flavour: My group purchased the Original and Chocolate Cheese Tarts as well as a chocolate shake. The shake unfortunately had an artificial aftertaste that was off putting. Additionally, the cheese tarts tasted rather bland and the citrus marmalade on the Original didn't complement the rest of the flavours as well as a caramel sauce would have.  I was surprised at how light the flavour was as I was hoping that the flavour would have been as deep as an egg tart's. 3/5  *Texture: The shake was powdery to the tongue, so forget about it being thirst quenching.  Also, the cheese tarts are more like puddings encased in flaky pie crust, so they are rather difficult to slice up when they are warm. This makes them a bit messy to share unless you chill them for a few hours.  If you don't mind the mess, you're better off spooning the filling out.  Despite the mess though, I do enjoy this type of creaminess. 4/5  *Price: Depending on the flavour you purchase, your tart will cost you a whopping 15-17 dollars before tax.  The tart is about 10 inches in diameter and has a medium height, so compared to Uncle Tetsu and Love Me Sweet's original cake, the tart seems a little larger - and of course pricier.  Normally, when a dessert is this large and priced as such, I wouldn't bat an eye.  However, with the tart's dull flavour looming over me with every bite, I just couldn't shake off the unbalanced price to quality ratio.  At my core, I can't even force myself to think that these tarts are worth more than 5 dollars with the low quality flavour they present. 1/5  I am past the Pablo hype and have little inclination to try their other desserts, even their limited time Mont Blanc fare. This new kid on the block can try to come up with as many new items as it can, but at the end of the day, the tarts leave a regrettable impression that just sticks."}
{"text":"Pablo in Toronto  ordered cheese tart and matcha cheese tart soft serve. Cuz I've tried Japanese version before, so not surprisingly cheese tart was not as tasty as Japan's but still yummy. Never tried soft serve in Japan and no comparison. So kinda surprised by this special flavour. The have few tables for customers dinning in. Clean and bright enough (good for take photos). The service was good and efficient. They bring food really quick."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of cheesecake or anything cheese related but man their cheese ice cream is good! It's a bit pricy but its the best cheese ice cream I've had. I only had the original, never tried the matcha."}
{"text":"Before I begin, for anyone currently looking at this review, this location accepts DEBIT and CASH as a form of payment.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  It was a lovely afternoon, my friend and I decided to head here (around 4 pm) because we had seen Pablos trademark lurking around social media feeds and it got us curious. When we arrived, there was a line past the door but it wasn't too long of a wait. While waiting, you also get the opportunity to view the process of the cheese tarts getting glazed and branded. In addition, the closer you get to the cashier, you'll see: displays of the smoothies they offer, coffee beans, mugs, and stainless steel water bottles for sale.   Upon arriving at the cashier there will be two menus, one for take out and the other for dine-in (they also have a seasonal menu but I only discovered this on the actual tables while dining-in). We decided to order the: Pablo cheese tart ($3.99), Pablo Smoothie ($5.99) (flavour: classic cheese tart), and lastly the cheese soft serve (3.99).  You may be wondering, what's the difference between PABLO CHEESE TART ($3.99) VS. PREMIUM CHEESE TART ($5.99). The pablo cheese tart has a much softer texture and has an apricot glaze on top. The premium one is more layered, therefore having a T H I C C (er) density. The top of the premium tart is apparently caramelized (just like the top part of crème brûlée).  PABLO CHEESE TART: Yummy! I loved the apricot glaze, it was tangy but it complimented the cheese very well. In addition, there was a lot of textures going on, the crust of the tart flaked beautifully within my mouth while the cheese had a custardy/pudding like consistency. If you're looking for a subtle flavour item on the menu, the tart is the way to go.  PABLO SMOOTHIE [CLASSIC CHEESE TART]: First sip, I literally cringed a bit because I took a giant gulp of the apricot compote. There was a decent amount of flavour in the smoothie but it just tasted so wrong yet it was so unique. On top of the smoothie, there are also giant chunks of graham crumble but it literally will not go through your straw. Probably won't be getting this ever again.   CHEESE SOFT SERVE: For some odd reason, I was expecting the flavour to be very light but it was the complete opposite. It was very dense, heavy and the flavour was very strong. Surprisingly it was the boldest of the three (and my personal favourite).   Aesthetics wise, I really enjoyed that there was a dine-in area, it made the location feel like a café as well. Also there are mini signs you can hold up and take pictures of! I would definitely come back for their soft serve and possibly try an item from their seasonal menu."}
{"text":"Pablo is a Japanese Cheese tart place that is very famous in Japan. The cheese tart has a rare texture inside that melts, yet the crust is crispy. The cheese tarts comes in a variety of flavours: matcha, original and chocolate. We ordered the matcha cheese tart ($16).  The matcha cheese tart was delicious. However, we found it to be slightly overpriced for what it was. I prefer the Uncle Tetsu cheese cake.  I would recommend that you go early as there's often a line up."}
{"text":"Pretty good! It wasn't as creamy as I thought it would be but it was very light and crust was flaky - almost like a Chinese egg tart with some apricot glaze on top.  We waited in line for about 20 min, which is not so bad considering that they opened 2 days ago. They also have other items that were sadly sold out or not available yet, I will definitely be back to give them another try.  The service was very friendly and prompt considering the amount of people waiting. Interior was warm and spacious."}
{"text":"Came back Oct 16th to try the mini pablo cheese tarts! Highly recommend these little ones. \"It's go fluffy and nice\" It has a graham cracker tasting crust. Excellent consistency, and no overwhelming apricot jam flavour. Fluffy and delicious. Made my day after ending day one of work from a 3 weeks vacation. It was $3.99 for one, and $19.95 for 6. Glad I came back to try this out! (4 stars for this mini tart!)"}
{"text":"The biggest thing going against this place is their dine-in facilities. It's small, and on a first come first serve. There is no table service - you're on your own. The  cake is alight, while the smoothie I has was a disappointment.  I was expecting a Cultures-like cold smoothie. What I got was a warm smoothie. May be it's a Japanese thing, but I wasn't feeling it."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday afternoon and waited approximately 20min for a cheese tart. I agree with other reviewers that there were a lot of already baked cheese tarts available yet there was a lineup of people. Although the staff is friendly, service is inefficient and slow.  I ordered the regular cheese tart that was already boxed and ready to go. When I tried it about 2 hours later, the crust was soggy and part of the glaze had shifted off the tart and onto the bottom of the box. I think this happened because the cheese tart was boxed when it was too hot and created steam in the box.  I have also tried Pablo in Tokyo and the quality and taste of the cheese tarts tastes much better there."}
{"text":"Yum! We dropped by for coffee and dessert after lunch. The cheesecake was creamy and not too sweet. The tart was good but a bit too light for me. I think something between the cheesecake and the tart filling would be heaven. There are tables and couches in the back!"}
{"text":"Long wait time. Initially was informed a wait time of 20min. After waiting for 30 minutes, they informed me there was a miscommunication in the kitchen, the tarts were not even in the oven. Additional 30+ minutes waiting time were added."}
{"text":"I had to wait in the long line but it was worth it. I dont understand why people keeps saying this is cheese cakes and complained why it taste so weird..Welll because it is cheese pudding"}
{"text":"My son is in love with Uncle Tetsu but after hearing this Japanese competitor opened up around the corner, I had to do a taste comparison.  My son still loves Uncle Tetsu. No competition there. Lol  Pablo's is more like a custard to me. I find Uncle Tetsu's eggy when warm and I can taste the eggs/milk/cheese custardiness of it. But when cooled, the egginess mellows.  Pablo's surrounds theirs in a flakey crust. Very hard to eat without a knife cutting it. Presentation wise it looks gorgeous. But I personally found the topping took away from the delicate middle. I read it was an apricot glaze. I preferred moving the top aside and just eating the custardy filling which is cheesy in a light way, with the crust. It was $15 including taxes.   I won't be able to convince my kid to get it again, but it's pretty good. Not too sweet which is why I might opt for this over a French custard pastry.  It's worth a try. I'm not sure if I'm up for their super special cheesecake $25! I thought $15 was good enough for a taste comparison.   Ok an hour later I try it again and Pablo's cheesecake reminds me of what an airy Portuguese tart that isn't too sweet should taste like. So I do like it a lot. But I wouldn't say it's a cheesecake"}
{"text":"Not at all worth the hype, definetly not worth waiting 45 mins in line.   Their cheese tart only tastes ok, no strong cheese flavour.   Will not return."}
{"text":"I came here during the afternoon and there was barely a line up. The decor of the place is definitely very intriguing. I bought the original cheese tart and the smoothie and both were SO GOOD. The cheese tart reminds me of a giant Portuguese tart which is not super sweet which is perfect. They only allow one original cheese tart per person and it's cash or debit only. If there's not a long line up I would definitely recommend to try!"}
{"text":"If you're going to try a tart here, try them when they're fresh out of the oven!  My first impression eating the original tart was okay. But I think it's because I had it to-go, and it got exposed to cool air. By the time I tasted it (45 min. post-purchase), the texture was a bit off. It was definitely creamy although it looked slightly crumbly, and the apricot jelly-glaze had already slid off. Based on other people's reviews of this product, it seems like a hit or miss. So the next time I try it, I hope my experience will be much better if I just sit down in their café and hope for a fresh slice... Other than that, re-heating in the oven helps."}
{"text":"Definitely a disappointment especially since they are so popular in Japan.  My friend loves Pablo in Japan, so we decided to give it a go even though the reviews werent the best. Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations at all.   Going for the original cheesetart, what was disappointing was that the tart did not have that gooey centre. Instead, the middle was very gelatinous, sort of like jello rather than cheesecake. The outer tart was good but nothing spectacular. Perhaps we just got one that was poorly made, but I dont think I will be coming back for more. I'll probably just wait until I go to Japan to try the original one."}
{"text":"I saw that the line wasn't too bad on Sunday at 4pm (during the opening weekend). Overall I waited 35-40mins (20mins was outside and the rest was waiting inside). Most of the flavours were sold out but by there time I reached the cash, matcha and chocolate was available.  It's my first time trying Pablo's so I only purchased the original. I didn't eat it immediately and walked around Chinatown and harbourfront with it for a couple hours and it was a little bit roughed up but still okay.   I liked the cheese tart because of its flaky crust, mild cheese flavour, soft texture and the stronger vanilla flavour. The jelly glaze on top was a little weird and I would've preferred the cheese tart without it. I also agree with other reviewers that it tastes similar to an egg tart with more of a custard taste than cheese tart.   Aside from the cheese tarts, there is soft serve ice cream, a variety of desert drinks, and espresso based drinks available. There is also a dine in area where customers can enjoy their purchases.   I would like to come back and dine in but I don't think it's worth the wait so I probably won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"The wait wasn't terrible. We had lined up around 2pm on Sunday (two days after opening) and waited around 20 minutes? I had this originally in Japan and was curious to see if the Toronto location would live up.   Like, I'm not mad at it. However, in my mind, I keep thinking that the one in Japan was a lot tastier and more firmer, with the crust being flaky and crispy.   Not the case here. To be honest, I couldn't really get a cheesy taste and the tart resembled more of a Chinese egg tart, but more runny. I was kind of expecting an umami flavour - but it fell short. Crust was a bit gummy, but maybe because we didn't eat it right away. For $15 CAD, it's pretty expensive compared to 800 yen in Osaka.   To be honest, I'd rather get a smaller Uncle Tetsu cheese tart around the corner for $3.50."}
{"text":"Totally a preference thing, but it wasn't that good to me. Perhaps it was too hyped up, I was super excited to try it, especially since I am a cheese lover...went Friday night, only waited ~15 mins.  I agree with most of the reviews here - I ate it right when I got home, the filling is not very firm and tastes more egg-y than cheese-y. It does kind of taste like a watered down egg tart. Also I didn't like the jelly-ish topping (marmalade?).  That being said, the crust was really good - loved the crust - very buttery & flaky. I tried the uncle tetsu tarts and i personally liked those better - cheesier.  However, I will be returning as I am curious to try their other flavors. Just not returning for the original tart.   Some things to note: - only 1 tart per person - I wish they put a sign somewhere, because I wanted to buy 2 until the cashier asked if I had another person lining up with me - they sell individual slices for around $3 i think - but the slices are tiny...not worth it - available flavors as of now: original, matcha, chocolate - the other flavors are all sold out, we asked the cashier she said they are usually sold out in the morning - the other flavors are more expensive - i believe $16.99 per tart (and i thought the original tart at $14 was expensive)  - new flavors coming as per their sign outside (but not helpful - only has a picture, no names) - they have soft serve ice cream, drinks, merchandise - they have a cute seating area at the back - some comfy looking booths"}
{"text":"3.5 tastes like a combination of chinese egg tart, creme brulee and light toasted croissant.  texture of the tart was moist light somewhat gelatin-like.  overall differebt from tetsu.  hard to compare the two.  they both have thrir own unique taste.  tetsu has a bit more sponge like texture sort of dry/minimal moistness.  lol the pricepoint is high thats for sure.  it was good but didnt taks my breathe away therefore i would not stand in line....and pay that price....in the future."}
{"text":"My friend was in the area and helped me buy it for me (I personally would not line up for it)   I didn't really like it either. Did not enjoy the super runny interior, the mediocre crust... the jelly on top was ok... I wouldn't have it again."}
{"text":"I really don't get what the hype is all about. Maybe these tarts are better in Japan? Maybe it's just not my thing? I had a slice of the original cheese tart and it felt like I was eating pudding... I'll take uncle Tetsu's cheese tarts over this ANY DAY. I'd like to try the chocolate one but with such a high price point and the risk of disappointment, I might save my money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came in because of my curiosity. What impressed me was the big bowl sized cheese tarts which looked really yummy. I have to say thank to my friend who told me not to order the whole classic tart which was $14.99, but a $4.19 piece. It did not taste as good as it looked. Instead of cheese, egg was the most thing I could find in the filling. I think people went here because of curiosity like me"}
{"text":"The hype is not real. I don't know understand why they only open one register when there are two. They make customers wait for 30 mins for cheesecakes when they can open one more register to speed up tj progress. As for the cheesecake, it is not good. It's very sour and tastes just like a regular cheesecake. Don't waste your time at this place."}
{"text":"Went back to try the matcha latte $5. Utterly regretted the decision. It tastes freaky bad :((( Should've just gotten matcha latte from tsujiri cross the street.  I'm so disappointed ......"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but personally, this was not worth the hype that I saw everywhere from the Instagram posts, to the blogTO videos of millions of people waiting in ridiculously long lineups for this.   I came a lot after the hype of the Pablo madness, on a weekday afternoon so I don't have to complain about their ridiculously long lineups. I got my Pablo cheesetart in five minutes! I loved the cute little displays here of fake foods to demonstrate what types of foods you'll be expecting here. Pablo also had a really cute seating location at the back!  I got a Pablo Cheesetart to go to share with my family. There are two cashiers where they only take Debit and Cash. Cash is on the further counter on the left and you can pay by debit on the right, making this line go by a lot slower than needed when I went. The Pablo Cheesetart is $15 each, I was expecting quite a bit from it, hoping that it will taste smooth, yet not too sweet.  Trying this cheesetart for the first time, the shell wasn't as flaky as I hoped it was. In fact, in some areas, it was rather hard. This was the number one disappointment. Taking a bite into the cheesetart, I wasn't a big fan of it either. Comparing it to the cheesetart from LoveMeSweet bakery, I thought the cheesetart from Pablo was very mediocre compared to the cheesetarts from LoveMeSweet bakery.   I'm not sure if this tastes a lot better in Japan, but the quality of the cheesetart definitely didn't impress me too much when I tried it from the location in Toronto!"}
{"text":"L O C A T I O N  Between Dundas St W and Bay St. Driving here it a bit of a pain and street parking can be stressful. I would avoid driving here at all cost because it's in downtown.  F O O D  //Cheesecake Tart// (14.99)This was recommended to me by by my co-worker and cousin and I was really excited to try this famous cheesecake. Sadly, I was underwhelmed by the taste. It wasn't as cheesy as I hoped and it tasted too light. This particular cheese tart had a thin jelly upper layer that gave the cheese tart an interesting texture (not quite a fan of it).  //Golden Brulee Cheese Pudding// (3.99) Packaged in its own to-go box with the sugar and caramel sauce. The pudding itself was airy and firm and it was yummy. The caramel sauce was too concentrated and gave a liquor-y taste. I would've prefer the pudding by itself.  S E R V I C E  The staff here were pleasant and focused on their work. They packaged everything in a timely manner. There was one person ahead of us so we got lucky that the service was quick.  O V E R A L L This is a cool place to come to if you can't afford to go to the original in Japan. This place is beautifully decorated to suit the modernness of the store and it has a cute overhead light that resembles a gooey cheesecake. There's a variety of seating in this cozy establishment. They have a wall you can buy merchandise from. I love how you can see the freshly baked Cheesecake Tart getting the signature emblem near the entrance of the store.  Though the Cheesecake Tart's texture and flavor was underwhelming I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other items."}
{"text":"General: We came around 7pm and had to wait for 30min. The service was quite slow. However the staffs were friendly. The place doesnt have many seats. Decor is nice and cute.  Food: I tried Paulo cheese tart in Japan and loved it. It was the best cheese tart that I have ever had. However, the cheese tart at this location was a disappointment. Also the matcha flavour is always sold out (considering this is my third time visit). I might revisit to try it."}
{"text":"We found Pablo completely by accident. I knew there was a Pablo in Toronto, but didn't really put too much thought into it as we were going to Uncle Tetsu's. We popped in to grab two cheese tarts - they just pulled out a fresh batch of original tarts from the oven, which was very lucky.   Preface: I had Pablo back in Tokyo and Osaka and had set the bar very high.   Review: Honestly, these were just OK. If I had not had the comparison, I would've rated them much higher as they are pretty good. I liked the original much, much more than the chocolate, which I thought tasted like uncooked brownie dough. But since I had the high expectation of how delicious Pablo was in Tokyo and Osaka, these fell short. The cheese part was drier and not as smooth. The crust was nice and flakey though.   I can't say too much about the larger cheese tarts as we had the mini ones only - but they looked a lot more like the ones we had in Japan than the mini ones did. Perhaps stick with those?"}
{"text":"I can't believe how many negative reviews this place has! We were celebrating something and I've always seen the crazy lineups at this place and Uncle Tetsu's (I've had neither) and I was walking past and was like- well, lets just do it and see what happens. The line was long and the process is slow, but watching them make them with such care is really something to see. Every menu item looks amazing. I don't even have much of a sweet tooth, but when I hear \"cheese\" my interest is automatically piqued. The lineup didn't extend beyond the door (which was surprising) but it still took about 20 minutes before I got to place an order. Once paid for, my cake was ready to go and she told me that I had 6 hours without refrigerating it or it would be good for two days if refrigerated. Silly- she thought it wasn't going to get eaten all in one sitting!  Took it home and insisted on having a bite before I even had dinner and wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Holy sh*t. It was delicious. It was the perfect balance of sweet and salty and the crust was still crispy. We had to hold ourselves back from eating it all because dinner was made (and was getting cold), but as soon as we finished our dinner we slaughtered it and it was in our respective bellies in less than 10 minutes. We couldn't move for two hours, but I'd say it was worth it. Four stars for the taste alone. I'm deducting a star because you're not allowed to buy a slice and get it to go (you have to eat it in the store-- I'm assuming because they don't have smaller boxes to accommodate single slices and it would be wasteful to use their regular boxes) and the price is pretty high. $15 for a regular and $25 for the premium? They're delicious, but that's steep even for what you get and the location of the store.  I'm seeing the lines dying down quickly and the reviews aren't too fantastic-- I bet if they had more competitive pricing to Mr. Tetsu's, they'd have much better luck keeping the momentum going longterm."}
{"text":"Had very high hopes for the place but am utterly disappointed. First of all, despite being a new store they got a conditional pass from the food inspector recently. Secondly, service was not the best. While my friend and I were at different cashiers, hers accepted credit cards while mine rejected credit cards. Thirdly, way overpriced considering the quality of the food. The matcha cheese soft serve looked and tasted like vanilla soft serve from McDonald's at $6 dollars and came in a cup half the size of a sundae. The cheese tarts tasted like egg tarts and the crust wasn't particularly flakey or buttery."}
{"text":"We saw the long lineup and decided not to wait.    But after shopping and as the store closed we lucked out as they allowed a few people in for the opportunity to buy the $15 cheese tart.  YUMMY!  This is different than a cheese cake since it's a tart with a crispy shell.   And it's not overly sweet.  Tasty dessert.  Go for the original one.  The mocha is good but a touch sweet.  Is it good?  Yeap!   Is it worth the long lineup to get it?   Nope."}
{"text":"A-OK is right. This is a cute place for intimate settings. Even the communal tables are pretty tight but the dim lighting implies it's intimate and cozy (see: cushions at the back). This is a very long store so if you have winter coats, it's going to be a tight fit.   I got the original slice of cheese tart and Dude got a thing with a crust. I liked the fully soft one more.   Nothing really stood out too much in terms of flavour, but the texture and consistency were positive attributes. IMO, Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake trumps this cheesetart thing because they're extra fluffy and cheesy, but this place doesn't have anything that stood out. I mean, it was good, but for that price point? I had expected better.  Good thing I didn't get the whole cheese tart.   It's a cute first date kind of deal but they rely more on their appearances than content."}
{"text":"Tried them in Kyoto first time and fell in love. Was anticipating a Toronto opening. Went there the second day after their launch. The tarts are awesome ! Tried the regular cheese and matcha tart. The chocolate one is the one I will try next time.  The interior is nice and there is plenty of space to chill and eat with your friends and family. That's once you get in. See note below.    Beware: line up can be long. Took me about an hour to get it."}
{"text":"Got pablo this morning when it just open. The line up wasn't too long, so I decided to give it a try. The tarts are very light compare to the ones in Asia which is a little disappointing. For the price of the tarts, it is not very worth to line up and buy it."}
{"text":"To be honest, this tastes like a waste of time and disappointment.  To anyone who lined up for this, I am so sorry you wasted your time.  I think this only got as popular as it did as it's the most popular cheese tart in Japan (yo, japan I'm so sorry your cheese sucks then) and because a thousand instagram FAMOOOUS foodies posted pics all over hyping it up (well I'd hype something up too if I got it for free and had no morals. -not meant to target anyone but hey, if the shoe fits...)  Like somebody else said, too much cheese to crust. It's like biting into a mushy filling and just tastes BLAND. The cheese is not even cheese. It tastes like warm custard gone wrong. Expired jelly textured custard that should not be consumed. Why is there a layer of clear jelly at the top? You know how food looks when it molds? Yeaaaaah. Exactly.  Matcha one has the slightest taste of matcha, not really worth. To be honest, they're all kind of gross.  Honestly nothing here is really worth- don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Was waiting for this to open since forever and so excited when Mr. Couch Potato bought it for me 2 months ago but TBH I was so disappointed.  Texture wise it wasn't my cup of tea, it was more like hard pudding rather than a soft molten style cheese tart I saw at Pablo Japan. The taste was lacking as well, not cheesy at all and the top layer of gelatine(?) was quite thick & sweet & I did not think it compliments the cheese tarts.  The most disappointing part was the crust..it was not flakey and rather hard, totally not what I expected. Heard that the ones in Japan is much much better so I will give it another try when I am in Japan next time. But until then, I will continue to try my luck at Cheese Garden  ?  Original Cheese Tart"}
{"text":"Finally came here to try the giant cheesetart. Pablo is a popular cheesetart dessert originated from Japan. It opened in Toronto a little over a month and a half ago drawing huge crowds and lines as they also gave out their mini-cheesetarts to the public. Ever since it opened, there has been a lot of hype surrounding this dessert place. I came by on a weekday afternoon to finally try the cheesetart here. When you walk right in, you can see the bakers prepare and make the cheesetarts in front of your eyes. They have a dine-in section where you can enjoy the smaller cheesetarts in the restaurant I ordered the original Pablo cheesetart and it take long to get it. Nice box, packaging and bag. The texture was quite interesting. It's firm on the outside and runny and smooth on the inside. The texture is very similar to a traditional Chinese egg tart. Overall, I found it was just A-Ok. Nothing special or unique in my opinion. It looks great but the taste is average. I also don't think the cost justifies getting the cheesetart either. Probably won't be coming back to try their other flavours anytime soon."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a visit after the hype died down. The cafe itself gave me Starbucks vibes. The cheesecake that I had was good - it wasn't mind blowingly good but it was good nonetheless (perhaps it was too small?) I'm down for coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Wil I be able to buy one tart today?? Yes! I did buy one. Barely any taste of cheese... tart shel is golden crispy and nice but... I do not get it.. so blend. Would I go back for it again? Sorry but don't think so..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I bought a matcha cheese tart only to find out when we got home that it wasn't fully cooked... the center was still very runny and because it had cooled down, also became goopy and slimy. The green colour of matcha also didn't help...   Overall it looked like someone splattered green gloop on a crust and to be quite honest it was one of the most unappetizing things I've ever seen.  Needless to say that after we cut slices, we didn't decided against eating it and just threw it away."}
{"text":"If i knew that this ice-cream was so subpar, I would've walked across the street to Tsujiri to get matcha chiffon cake sundaes instead. The ice-cream was grainy and there wasn't much matcha flavor. What made it more disappointing was that there wasn't much cheese flavor even though it's supposed to be a cheese flavored ice-cream.   I came here with my friend who I went to Japan with and we both had Pablo for the first time in Osaka. He tried to order the matcha cheese tart but they were all sold out. This experience pales in comparison to what we had in Osaka. Pablo in Japan really impressed us both so I guess the next time we have Pablo again is when we're back in Japan."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but it was more hype than actual deliciousness. Despite how truly creamy the cheesecakes were, the cheesy flavour was really lacking for me. The part I enjoyed most about three tart was actually its shell."}
{"text":"Pablo, one of the biggest cheesecake/cheesetarts franchises in Japan finally made its way to Toronto 2 years after Uncle Tetsu made a statement in Toronto.  Timing is very key and unfortunately Pablo came to Toronto towards the end of the Cheesecake/tarts hype and I was surprised there was zero lineup when I came here during lunch on a workday only 2 weeks after their grand opening.  Tried their original size cheese tarts and mini cheese tarts and I have to say, although the original size cheese tarts was decent, the mini cheese tarts are not good compared to Uncle Tetsu's.  So let's just focus on the original size cheese tarts.  This thing is pretty big, I believe it's at least 5 to 6 inches, crusted with a more puffy style similar to the HK egg tarts.  Cheesecake content was rich but was rather liquidy for some reason which I didn't like and I had to put it in the fridge for a day to solidify it to give it a better texture.  The top layer jello type thing wasn't my thing either.  For $15, I was hoping the quality would be better.  Overall, still worth a try if you never had Pablo before but for the mini cheese tarts, for sure go next door and have Uncle Tetsu's.  They are releasing new items soon and I will still go back to try them out."}
{"text":"Great Sucess for the Grand Opening of Pablo!  Been waiting for this since I came back from Osaka 4 years ago. Let's see where we should start here.. Ahh. The lineups outside is what most people would be wondering about and how long it would be if you're craving this gooey cheese tart? I would say the lineup is definitely much more organized than the other hyped up Japanese places around, since Pablo has everything packed and ready-to-go,and the line wasn't too bad(except for the grand opening day). I'm not a lining-up-person and for sure;not under the sweaty hot weather, but Pablo is like this everywhere, not only in Toronto, even in Japan people will line up and stays in line for Pablo because their cheese tart crust is just tooooo good! I personally liked the Original cheese tart the most, I've heard great things about the Matcha ones,which they sell out quickly!! It would be amazing if the Toronto location will lauch their Pablo's Limited Edition mini tarts (like the purple okinawa sweet potato, pumpkin,lime, pineapple muscat grapes!!) That will be soooo worth the lineup!"}
{"text":"A little expensive but the taste was good. Girlfriend really likes the cheese tarts here but i prefer the uncle tetsu ones. These are more fluffy and light."}
{"text":"Finally, I got to try the famous original cheese tart by Pablo Cheesetart Canada last Monday on Eclipse Day. I expected hot liquidy cheese flowing through as I bit into the big tart but instead what I got was a big custard egg tart with an apricot/lemony? glaze. Perhaps I am not used to this type of cheesetart but I much prefer the cheesier tart from the local shop in North York (if you know your cheese tarts ).Don't get me wrong. I still like it but it isn't what I expected. I did try chilled and unchilled rite within the 6 hours of staying in room temperature.    At $14.99, this Pablo cheese tart is quite expensive. I ended up buying a few ones that day relining up a few times (30 mins wait each time) and oh boy does it add up $$$! SInce I tried it now, not sure if I would be willing to line up again to get the original, ESPECIALLY if there is a line. The buttery flakey crust though is good. I brought a Pablo tart to share at work and all my colleagues loved it.  Line up wasn't too bad at 30 mins average wait but the line could move faster if there was two cash registers open as opposed to just one. I had to line up 30 mins each time as there was a limit of 1 tart per person!  I was also bummed out they ran out of the matcha, chocolate cheese tarts. They don't seemed to be available in the evening and get sell out quickly. Wish they could make more.  If you do not want the whole tart, Pablo does sell it by the slice at $3.99 for the original only but it has to be dine in only. Slice of the Premium Tart can also be ordered at $5.99 but it has to be dine in again along with the long line up.  I heard the tarts taste very different in Japan as opposed to here in Toronto.  I still have yet to try the Pablo chocolate and matcha cheese tart as well as the mini tarts but I am looking forward to taste them as well as try their drinks and soft serve ice cream. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------"}
{"text":"???????PABLO cheese cake??????????????????????????????????????2????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Disappointed at the quality of the cheesetart here. Unfortunately, it does not taste like the Pablo cheesetarts in Japan. The tart is too dense and not creamy enough. It is quite pricey for what you get. However, the mont blanc was delicious! I enjoyed the chestnut dessert a lot more than the actual cheese tart, ironic eh? It's fine if you have never tried japanese cheesetarts in Asia, but if you have, you will be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Quite a good cheese tart and rather light. You can eat about a third of this in a sitting and not feel too stuffed. I will say though, it's definitely more egg-y and it has the consistency and texture of a tart and not a cheesecake. I think many people mistake this be like a traditional cheesecake, but as the name suggests, it's a tart. They pour a layer on top of the original flavored tart and it becomes a semi-jello layer that is tart/sour, which is a nice balance of flavours from the rest of the filling. Lines are extremely long (especially at night and on weekends), so I'd recommend maybe waiting until the lines calm down a bit or come during the day when the lines are a little less crazy.  Staff there don't seem to be too fluent in English, so you'll need to be clear with your instructions and any questions about the menu. When I went, you could pick up an original flavored tart immediately, but the green tea and chocolate ones required a 15-20 minute wait. Drinks / other sweets also took a much longer wait time. Overall, a pretty yummy tart, not worth that long of a wait though."}
{"text":"Japan's famous Pablo has finally landed in Canada. From my trips to Osaka, there would be insane lineups at the Dotonbori location.  Most of the store is the bakery and display counter. There is a small seating area in the back - about 4 tables for 2, a large table for 6 and a sofa seating for 6.  Comfortable and can also be intimate.  Ordered the following: Cheesecake - so light with a custard texture. Probably lighter than Uncle Tetsu's.   Overall, very nice.  Mini Cheesetart - more dense with so much more cheesy\"umph\". Two bites and it is all gone.  Guess there is a reason why the Cheesetarts are there signature offering.  Glad to see the Toronto Asian food scene maturing.  Overall this is a must try."}
{"text":"Too bad, cheese tarts are tiny in size. The one that I got was too mushy and it fell apart in the bag that was in. The taste is average, you could get better one's from nearby."}
{"text":"Didn't like it. Not worth the line up. Bought the original cheese tart and the Golden Brulee Cheese Pudding. The cheese tart is very runny inside and the custard doesn't really have a taste. The golden brulee pudding was much better. It's like a South American flan. Save your money and go to Uncle Tetsu's instead."}
{"text":"From Muji, Uniqlo, Uncle Tetsu and the newly opened Pablo Cheese Tart, Japanese culture is slowly creeping into Toronto land.  Nine days after Pablo's opening day, I managed to see what the hype is all about. I was at the store exactly at 10 am (Sunday opening time) and there were already 20 people ahead of me.  30 minutes later and $30 less on my pocket I was surely not impressed!  I decided to order the Chocolate Cheese Tart, a slice of Premium Cheese Tart and their Matcha & Azuki Cream Smoothie.  The Chocolate Cheese Tart resembles more of a Custard Tart than a cheesecake. There's no hint of cheese flavour nor the texture of a cheesecake. Slicing into it is such a hassle since it's so soft and then tasting it afterwards is another story. Imagine eating a goey chocolate pudding topped with a gelatinous like substance. You get the picture, nothing special about it!  On the other hand, their Premium Cheese Tart tasted like a real cheesecake with a rich creme brulee flavour.  And this I think is what makes them better than  Uncle Tetsu (hence additional star)  The Matcha smoothie is just okay albeit a little bit sweet.  Would i go back again to Pablo, maybe not, and if I do decide to go, I will just buy the Premium Cheese Tart."}
{"text":"I came here last weekend and was pretty disappointed. After waiting in line for 15 minutes I was greeted by a polite, but very confused cashier. I told him several times that I wanted an ICED matcha latte and he kept asking if I wanted it hot. Then when he asked for my name (it's Greg btw) he had no idea what I was saying. I spelled it out for him and he wrote \"GrAg\" and then scribbled it out and eventually realized I was saying \"E\" and not \"A\". This interaction was frustrating, but I understand that it can be hard for people who are still learning English to be working a busy job like this.  Now let's talk about the \"drink\" I received.... iced matcha latte? More like iced milky bitter powder!!! This drink was DISGUSTING. It tasted like they dumped 20lbs of matcha powder into a cup, added 1 spoon of milk and drenched it in ice. It was too saturated with powder and the matcha flavour was very overpowering and bitter. I would NOT recommend this drink. Disgusting."}
{"text":"It was my second visit and I still didnt get the chance to taste the green tea cheesecake. Again, I was so disappointed I live in Mississauga its not really a far drive but it really sucks when you cant get the cake you wanted.   The first time I came it was newly open. And I lined up to get in by the time I got to order she said green tea cheesecake was sold out and it was around 10:30am. This time I came around 6:30pm again the guy said green tea cheesecake was sold out???!! They open till 10pm, four hours before the closing some items were already sold out? Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"I had high hopes that the cheese tart was going to be really tasty. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. Luckily for me I didn't have to wait in line for too long and I got myself the original cheese tart for $15. When I got it, it wiggled and when I cut into it, it didn't ooze out cheese. The crust was amazing but the main event just didn't do it for me. It was light and fluffy but the cheese flavour just wasn't there for me. I personally don't think it is worth the wait or money. Glad I tried it, but definitely wouldn't repurchase it."}
{"text":"Reading the bad reviews here honestly puzzles me to no ends.  You can't compare Pablo to Uncle Tetsu or thick, hard consistency of NY style cheese cakes because they are fundamentally different things. Some of the reviews are like eating grapes and giving it a bad rating because it doesn't taste like apples...  If you're expecting Japanese cheese cakes or New York style cheese cakes, you're setting yourself up for disappointment because Pablo serves cheese TARTS.   I got the original flavor. The filling is a unique texture similar to a jello/meringue with eggy flavor. The cheese flavor isn't overwhelming, but certainly there. The top glaze is an apricot jello that is sour and matches the custardy-eggy filling very well. It adds a refreshing aroma in your mouth.  The filling is subtly sweet - if you're used to the sweetness of NY style cakes, you might not even think it's sweet. However, the good part of Japanese sweets is that they are very sparing on sugar so you can enjoy the flavors of the ingredients themselves: eggs, custard, cream cheese...  The pie area is thin, slighty crunchy goodness. It adds flavor and texture without weighing the whole dessert down.   At this point I'm not even going to comment on the price. Fancy desserts are expensive. This goes for all the artisan sweet shops in Toronto. If you want cheap desserts, then go get a cake from Costco.   Overall the tart was very nice, but I don't see myself craving it repeatedly, given the lineups. I have to agree that there is not a WOW factor (but not many things WOW me), but overall it is definitely enjoyable.   I'd give Pablo a 3.5/5 if I could, but too bad Yelp doesn't allow that :("}
{"text":"I love Pablo ! I was so excited when I found out it was coming to Toronto. I had this in Japan and I loved it. I love cheese and I love custard. This is a blend of both.   I didn't come during the first week of opening because I knew there would be a long queue. I was right , I passed by during the first week and there was a long line outside. I visited a few weeks after opening on a weeknight and the line wasn't very long. The line went to the door and that was about 20minute wait.   I got the original cheese tart which i had in Japan. I saw that they have the premium cheese tart coming soon and I'm excited to try that. I love Pablo cheese tart and I will be a regular at this bakery."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is exactly how I would describe this cheese tart. I don't see or taste the hype about this. (As a preface, I had Cheese Garden's (Yonge & Sheppard) cheese tart a couple months back and it made me craving for more.) Pablo was underwhelming as the cheese tart had no cheese flavour to it and the texture was too light like mousse. The decor, uniforms and layout of the cafe was really cute. I like the idea of an open kitchen where you see   them make the tarts and i understand they want to maintain the same standards across locations, but it seemed too much like a science when everything was measured out using a scale - from the tart shell dough, water to apricot jelly ratio, amount of cheese batter per tart, to the amount of apricot jelly on top of each tart. As a baker, I feel like some of that process could be done \"to the eye\" making it seem more fun and less like a science or factory/mass produced."}
{"text":"I know, \"not another over-hyped Japanese thing\", and guess what, you always have the choice of not going. I've had the original cheese tart back in Tokyo and wasn't really a big fan. The one in Toronto tasted exactly the same and hence, I was not a big fan of it either.  I pass by this place on a fairly regular basis and I've yet to see any significant line forming for the place. I've heard a number of people say that the cheese tart from Uncle Tetsu is better, so maybe that's been undercutting some of their profits. I haven't tried the Tetsu version myself so I can't really comment on that. Pablo does offer other cafe menu items though, and they do have places to sit, though the space is a bit small and cramped.  I personally am not a fan of the big tarts. I find that there is too much filling compared to the crust, and it feels like I'm eating too much sweet mush than a proper tart. I also find their filling to be too soft, which doesn't quite compliment the thickness of the crust. It kinda feels like I'm eating dipped butter cookies into a cheese pudding, maybe that's what they're aiming for. It is also a little bit odd that their default size is so large given that they only last about 2 days in the fridge. Unless it's bulking season for you, it would be hard  for one person to eat the entire thing in such a short time.  However, I did quite enjoy their ice cream though - but for some reason, they seem to give you a lot less ice cream if you ask for it in a cup over a cone. The subtle hint of cheese flavour works quite well in a soft serve and I would skip the tart and gladly come back for that."}
{"text":"Offensively bad. Not disgusting, but really not worth the money and one of the more disappointing desserts I've bought. I bought an original cheese tart about 15 minutes ago after being told it was \"cheesy\" and \"creamy\". What is in my box is neither cheesy (it is extremely bland) nor creamy (it is custardy but lighter than any tart I've ever had, a bit closer to a flan, but with a slight scrambled-eggy texture), and the most salient flavour and texture in it is the apricot jam glaze (I don't like jam, but was not expecting it to be so pronounced). The middle of my tart does NOT ooze out like in the photographs--perhaps it was overcooked? Or perhaps it was old, overheated on the counter, since it apparently expires tomorrow. I'm starving and it's quite edible, since it tastes like air, so will continue eating it (thankfully, I did not get the bite-size version or I'd be hangry), but I am disappointed and will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm sad to review something came from my home country with 1 star but I can't help it. I've never tried their cheese tart in Japan, so I can't compare the one in Japan and Toronto but I can say that their cheese tart here in Toronto is not good. I disagree with calling it as \"cheese tart\". It doesn't have much cheese flavour. To me, it was yellowy-milky liquid that was thickened with corn starch. The crust is not that impressive either, kind of dry and not much flavour. My husband and I ate half of a whole tart on the day, not very satisfied. When we ate it the next day, after refrigerated, it was slightly better but it's no worth $15 for this. It was such a disappointment. If I want a real cheese tart, I'd get the uncle tetsu cheese tart from just around the corner. Their cheese tart is way better."}
{"text":"Finally got to trying the Mini tart and was disappointed. If you want an amazing tart go to Uncle Tetsu next door."}
{"text":"Their signature cheesecake/tart didn't live up to the hype. While I loved their interior design and high quality cafe feel, I can't just rate them for the beautiful packaging.  The food is a solid 2. The tart was something I could've made myself, except with a weird fruity glaze on top. It wasn't bad, but definitely not something I expected to find in such a nice store. I asked my friend and she said the taste is different compared to Japan. I had no desire to try any of their other stuff. They offer things like a drinkable version of the tart, which seems like a heart-attack and not a delicious one at that.  Come if you like trying popular, trendy foods. Skip if you're expecting good quality Japanese style cheese tarts."}
{"text":"I was on my way home from Eatons and saw what appeared to be a short line here (plus it also happened to be my boyfriend's mom's birthday that night), so I quickly got in line.  I had seen lots of social media around these tarts and figured given the occasion, why not. As I was in line, I started reading reviews of the cheese tarts, and I have to say I was contemplating whether or not I made a good choice of standing in line.  Despite so many negative reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed It! I got the original to try for the first time. I think the flavour profile, texture, and taste change when you eat it right away vs if you give it some time to sit for a bit. I read reviews about it being too wet or runny, which my bf's mom commented on when I brought it to her and she immediately had some (before dinner). That said, we all dug in after dinner and she said the \"after\" was even better than the \"before\"!   I loved everything about this tart, and keep in mind that that's what that is. I forgot and kept on thinking it was going to be like uncle tetsu and so glad that is isn't because I'm not a fan. It's got a crunchy crust and the center is more like a caramel-y custard.  I did deduct a star only because of how long it took the line up. Line looked short but ended up being about 50 minutes (plus an additional few more minutes because the original ones were just coming out of the oven - they had chocolate and matcha ones that you could get right away). The line outside is misleading because it continues quite deep into the cafe - you'll spend about half the time outside as you will inside."}
{"text":"Toronto has become the Foodie Scene, and I love it! I work close by and always pass by Pablo. I remember when they first opened up, there was lines out the door and down the street.   After months of being opened, the hype had died down and I was ready to pick up a cheese tart. I walked in and decided to go for the original cheese tart. I took it to go so I could share it with the rest of my office.   It was very fresh and the cost was okay (I think about $15), not bad. I arrived back at the office, and opened it up. The packaging is very cute.   I'm not sure what this is supposed to taste like but it wasn't for me. It wasn't sweet which I liked but I wasn't a fan of the gelatin on top. The crust was really good but again the cheese part wasn't very exciting.   Hope you like it!   Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"No more lines at Pablo - whether that is for good or for bad! Note that their cheese tart does not resemble cake and are best enjoyed warm. The cheese tart is topped with a layer of lemon sauce!  Personally, I prefer Uncle Tetsu's mini cheese tart as they have more cheese! Unlike Uncle Tetsu, Pablo boasts a small dining area in the back to enjoy your Japanese desserts!"}
{"text":"The mini original tart are good and more firm than the bigger tart. However, the original cheese tart has a texture of chunky vomit after a night out of drinking and the apricot jam with the cheese does not go well, kinda taste like acidic puke. We couldn't even cut it into pieces as the crust was so hard. We had to scoop the filling to eat it. We had one bite and were disappointed, gave the whole cake away.   Would not recommend the original, but would the mini versions which taste much different and better."}
{"text":"We had the mango cheese tart. The cashier was not very friendly when we asked her questions and whether they had anything  other than cheese tarts... well, I guess it says cheese tart in the name so that's probably why that's all that they serve. Pretty good cheese tart though :)"}
{"text":"Overall:4.125 Food: 4 Service: 4.5 Price: 4 Atmosphere: 4  Pablo is a great take on cheese tarts. I have been here once before and this time I introduced my friend to this dessert spot. The lines are alot more reasonable than when they first opened, so their service has improved. Our wait time was around 10 mins, which isn't too bad for what we got. We ordered the original cheese tart and it came out to be around 10 CAD.   The original cheese tart has a fluffy cheese and sweet filling. Its crust has quite soft yet firm. It is not hard compared to most crust. It can be pretty heavy or sweet, so I recommend grabbing a coffee to balance the flavors or sharing it with friends. Overall, I would come here again."}
{"text":"I tried the original and thought it was really good! It was definitely a big serving and can absolutely feed more than one mouth. There was a bit of a wait and a line out the door but the place itself is very small and doesn't leave much for standing inside. I actually would have liked mine to be a bit warmer and the filling to be a little more gooey, but I was still satisfied. I would recommend giving this a try."}
{"text":"Really really wanted to give Pablo more stars but I think they should have worked more on quality control before opening. I had their amazing tarts in Japan before and the inconsistency in the Canadian Pablo tarts disappointed me. I bought two matcha cheese tarts. Both tarts had huge cracks along at least half of the perimeter of the cheese part of the tart. The mochi in one of the tarts were really undercooked and hard. The store still has several items that they are not producing yet (eg mini tarts). I think this is a wise idea because if they can't nail the classic tarts every time, then I wouldn't have confidence in getting decent item every time. I only waited around 20 minutes in line as I arrived around 10:15 (they opened at 10am). If they have huge lines, I wouldn't bother getting a tart that may end up being subpar. I would wait a while until they have consistency in their items before going back"}
{"text":"Ranting alert. Generally I don't have problem with restaurants or the way they managing their business. But today I was quite disappointed with Pablo .   As many people might already read about their first day giveaway of 150 cheese tarts. Me and my boyfriend saw the promotion online and decided to stood in line at 4:30 pm. The giveaway starts at 4 pm, and when we finally got into the store- 7:46pm, The cashier told us the free cheese tarts tickets were all distributed before we even stood in the line. That means we were in the line for ALMOST 4 HOURS for nothing.  During that 4 hours, many employees walked around and counting people/ handing out water, nobody said a thing! The ridiculous part is, I asked a employee about which tarts they were giving out for free ( while I was still in the line), she said \" we are giving out the original one today, but for the other flavors you have to but them\".   With that being said, we were speechless when we found out about no free cheese tarts at the last second. And because for that many hours of standing in line, we felt like it would only be worth it if we buy a tart instead of walking away empty handed.   I'm very disappointed. And what's even more disappointing is the fact Pablo letting people line up thinking there's going to be a reward in the end but there isn't. There were at least another 80 people in the line behind me, I don't know how many people is going to feel played as I did when the talk to the cashier.  p.s: I'm giving it a 1 star because my boyfriend did like the chocolate tart."}
{"text":"When I went during the weekend, the line up wasn't too bad. I only waited about 5-10min for my cheese tart.  I asked for recommendation, and the lady told me if it's my first time, I should start with the original. And that's what I got. The cheese tart is different from other places such as Uncle Tetsu's. The center filling is super light and not overly sweet. The texture is like jello, with a sweeter jelly topping. The pastry is flaky and light. I quite liked it. But the price was rather high for what it is. :( I'll go back next time to give the green tea flavor a try!"}
{"text":"This is over hyped. This is a cheese tart and I really can't taste any cheese flavour in it. Not sweet and it is very bland. I waited 30 mins for this and I can't finish even a slice of it. Dont let them scam our money easily. We can definitely get better food with this price."}
{"text":"Decided to finally give into the hype and try Pablo's. We came here on a weekday morning so the place was empty. I was pleasantly surprised by the large seating area, which made for a nice space to study and enjoy our cheese tart.  I liked the cheese tart overall, but would've preferred a less flakey crust. The apricot is a nice touch. Can't decide if I prefer Uncle Tetsu's or Pablo's. Both are great options in my opinion :)"}
{"text":"Waited for the hype to die down and have walked past this place on many occasions, finally gave it a go. Bought only a slice of the fresh baked cheese tart and a mini cheese tart. For some reason, I wasn't really a huge fan of the freshly baked cheese tart, it was too soft and almost runny for me plus I didn't really think the jelly coating they put on top suit the tart itself. Actually I think I only tasted the jelly coating to be honest. The mini cheese tart was actually a lot better. I love how dense and cheesey it was. Yes you read right. I could taste the cheese in the cheese tart. I guess you can come try it for curiosity."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such long lines...  Got a slice of their cheese tart and was pretty disappointed. The filling was too soft and didn't taste cheesy enough. The tart tastes ok though.  Presentation is pretty though. The sitting area at the back has some comfy couches if you want to hang out with some friends...   I probably won't come back though"}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins for it (Sunday 1pm).  I ordered two original flavour cheesetart.  I had one when it's hot when the custard was still running, and the other one I put it it fridge for ours and had it when it's cold.  For video effect, hot one is better. But for taste, I like cold one more.  In terms of tastes, as other Yelper said, it is pretty bland. If you are used to North American/French/Italian dessert, this is not for you. They didn't put a lot of sugar or cheese in it. Instead, it is tastes pretty eggy. Desserts/pastries from Japan and China are usually not too sweet.  I probably would not come back. For its price $14+tax, it is pretty pricey and not worth it. I would rather get 2 uncle tetsu cheesecake lol."}
{"text":"Not sure why just west of Yonge & Dundas is becoming Toronto's 'hypebeast Asia-town'.  In the area, there are line-ups for ramen, bubble tea, matcha, and Japanese cheese cake/tarts as a lot of global Asian brands are opening locations here -- and Asian kids just love lining up for trendy Asian food.  These businesses are completely sustained by IG-'foodies'.  Anyways, I don't know too much about Pablo - other than it being a Japanese chain that specializes in cheesetarts.  I didn't really have interest, but the lady wanted to try it out and there were no lineups.  We got a full size cheese tart for around $15 and it was about 8\".  The texture of the filling is similar to flan or pudding - taste was very light (not eggy or cheesy at all).  Most of the flavour comes from the apricot topping.  The crust was pretty flaky.  Neither of us will try it again - just not a great value proposition (their 'premium' cheese tart is the same size but $25 with a creme brulee topping).  Although not the same, Uncle Tetsu is probably their nearest competitor (geographically and figuratively).  I'm not a huge fan of sweets, so I do prefer the more subtle taste and better texture of Tetsu's 'cheesecake' (which I probably won't have again anytime soon either).  However, with Tetsu, it's hard to find a good substitute -- with Pablo, I rather have a good Chinese egg tart or a Portuguese egg tart... and I won't have to pay $15 - $25 for either."}
{"text":"I've purchased the fresh baked cheesecake and a mini cheese tart to try on separate occasions. As it's been months since Pablo first opened, the hype has mostly died down and I was spared the long lines.   The mini cheese tart is dense and very cheesy. The buttery crust reminds me of Chinese egg tarts. I enjoyed this one very much. At $3.99 for barely a mouthful, it's expensive but a nice treat.   The fresh baked cheese tart I brought home to share with my family. We tried it both at room temp and reheated. The custardy, almost mousse-like cheesecake is too soft for our liking and very bland. You can barely taste any cheese. Almost just feels like you're eating egg pudding. The crust is flaky but a little tough at room temperature. I did like the apricot jam on top as it was the only flavor I could taste.   Overall, 4 stars for the mini tart, 2 stars for the original fresh baked cheese tart. Would return to try the other mini tarts and maybe the iced drinks."}
{"text":"I picked up a full-sized tart after work on a weekday and there was no line. A simple in, pick a tart, pay and out in 5 minutes flat. The service was helpful and efficient, no complaints.  The tart itself has a light creamy filling and the crust is more of a dense pastry vs a butter flaky tart. I had the traditional cheese flavored one but the cheese taste is so light that I noticed the smoothness of the filling more than anything. If you are looking for a light dessert with simple flavors, this would be a good choice."}
{"text":"Decided to try out the original Pablo cheese tart to compare it to uncle tetsu's and the Pablo I've eaten in Osaka Japan. The tart is a lot more wet and creamy like an egg tart compared to the spongy cheesecake from uncle tetsu's. The cake is also a lot more expensive ($15) compared to uncle tetsu's down the street which is $10ish. The cheese cake isn't overly sweet or cheesy which I enjoyed but a tip for you would be to eat it while it's fresh, you don't want to leave it for too long. All in all, the famous cheesecake is worth a try but you should expect it to be more of a mega tart than a cake."}
{"text":"Tried the mini cheese tart again and was totally underwhelmed. It just didn't taste as amazing as I remembered. It feels incredibly expensive at $4.50."}
{"text":"Price wise I was unprepared especially to not have use of credit cards my favorite. The issue is not the crust of the tart which has its layered buttery flake down; the concern I have is the jello like consistency. Wait there is a jewel it is hidden towards the end of your journey into a high minded cheesecake almost one and a half to two times the height of the average joe. The jewel is a Mochi ball lodged towards the crust. On the inside you will find what appears to be red bean. This not unusually to see this pair of flavours. Early arrival and this place is clean not to mention empty which makes me wonder if the clients are take outers? I like the shine on this cheesecake because it is ever so uncommon in contrast to the competitor around the corner whose cake is a soufflé type cheesecake. If I would suggest this is a different type of cheese, it doesn't have the mouthfeel you would expect of a cheesecake. It is heavier and denser than the average which borders on pudding."}
{"text":"The line up isnt that bad now. About 20 minutes in total. Dont let the short line outside fool you. You have to line up inside too. The $15 cheese tart is WORTH IT if you love egg custard types of desserts. This is not Uncle Tetsu or cheesecake. I would say its more eggy than cheesey. I love egg tarts so this is exactly what I prefer. I give it 5 stars for taste AFTER you put it in the FRIDGE. I strongly recommend you dont eat it right away. It wont taste as good. Trust me on this. 1 star off for the line up though. I would come again when its not busy to try out the matcha one. ****"}
{"text":"Our friend bought us two tarts when she came over to our house! Sadly though because of hte commute, the tarte had shrunken a bit and wasn't as beautiful as it looks in the pictures most ppl put up!   Because it's been cooled off, I ended up eating it as cold - the texture is nice, firmer, but the taste is quite like a japanese cheesecake. I think i woudl've enjoyed it a lot more if it was eaten warm and preferably right out of the box!!! Next time I think i'm going to have to try it - the taste is definitely there, but the texture wasn't as good mostly becuase I was eating it 2 hours after it's made and its no longer warm."}
{"text":"Went there at around 8:30pm on a Saturday night. The wait wasn't too bad. Probably around 10 to 15 minute. I told the cashier that I want an original cheese tart and she seem like she has trouble understanding.. so I have to point the picture from the menu in front of me. Other than that service was ok. For the tart, it was very hard to share since cutting it was really difficult. And the center was very runny so after you start eating the tart looks like a mess. Taste wise, I think it's better than uncle tetsu. However I don't like the texture. Maybe a bit firmer will be better. Might go back again and try their soft serve tho."}
{"text":"Was fortunate I didn't have to queue to get it, but will be straight up honest; it was not that good especially for $15! And if I were made to wait, I would probably flip a table or two (maybe even some people).   Not a big fan of having a fruit gelatin layer on top, because it tasted like something that shouldn't be there. Why do you put jelly on cheese? It is gross (Kind of tastes like sweat & sadness). Also want to mention that it tasted like custard; can't taste the cheese at all. Should be renamed to \"custard tarts.\"   See, what they didn't do correctly was introduce the the option of the mini baked cheese tarts--those are heavenly!  Final thoughts? Forget about the big \"cheese tart\" and wait for the small mini bake ones (if they ever release it in Canada). The original tart is not that great."}
{"text":"For what it is worth, Pablo Cheesetart is all hype. Like the other reviews, I only had to wait about 25 minutes during lunch time however you can only takeout the cheese tarts if you buy the whole tart. If it is single pieces, you have to go sit down or they'll give you a napkin to take it out with you. For 10 dollars more, you can get their creme brûlée version but that's like 25 bucks already.   The tart itself (I got the original) is runny which I don't like with a cheesecake taste to it. I only bought it cause my sister in law really wanted it.   Overall probably wouldn't go again as I don't find the value in it and like said, other places can sell better quality for what you pay for."}
{"text":"I ordered the original cheese tart.  I would describe this as a combination of the Japanese cheesecake and the new york style cheesecake in terms of texture: Very smooth and rich yet not too thick.  The overall flavour is actually quite mild.  The hint of sweetness mostly comes from their signature apricot glaze.    Price is a bit on the pricey end however the tarts in Japan were roughly the same price after conversion."}
{"text":"I've only ever taken out, but the tart, the packaging and the atmosphere was really nice. You can always tell a place has great customer service from the moment you walk in, and the demeanour of the employees. The girls were super awesome and the tart was the die for!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to see what all this hype is about. Stood in line for about 20mins. I ordered the reg  cheese tart and a slice of the premium cheesecake. The cheesecake tasted like a regular ordinary cheesecake. The burnted  cream Brulé on top was a bit too bitter for my liking. The chese tart was just ok nothing special about any of them. They are a bit pricy and not worth waiting in line for them. Imo I like uncle tetsu cheesecake better."}
{"text":"Pablo's cheesetart wasn't for me.  It was extremely hard to cut, share, and eat.  The apricot glaze is a yummy touch but really doesn't elevate the tart to make it work a wait more than 5 minutes. Overall, the taste wasn't all that great and I think one time was enough.  Also, the matcha cheese freeze drink or w.e lacked flavour. Not impressed."}
{"text":"OMG!! Their cheese softserve ice cream is HEAVEN!!! It reminds me of baby milk formula which I LOVE!! I wish they sold them in tubs that you can take home. So unique and delicious with just the right amount of sweetness. I give this a 5 star.  Their cheesetart barely has any cheese flavor to it. It tastes and feels like a custard, just fyi. They don't sell slices as take out so I had to cough up $15 for the whole tart which I am not fond of. I much prefer Uncle Tetsu's for a rich cheese flavor. YMMV. I give this one a 2 star.  Average rating is 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"If you see a line, don't bother, it is not worth the 20 mins, the 30 mins, the 45 or 60 mins and def not over an hour's wait.  Way too sweet and the crust gets soggy fast!  The sign says SOLD OUT outside but when you ask, they have it.  Completely overpriced for what it's worth.  Just turn around if you see a line. Come when there's no line if you really want to try. You'll be disappointed with what you get after a long wait."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Both times were on the weekend, and there wasn't much of a line either time. I think even when there isn't a long line, we still had to put up with the people who stood at the front and took a handful of  minutes to decide what they wanted. I'm not sure why businesses don't ask people who don't know what they want to step aside, let people behind them order  and then take their orders when they're ready. That's my only complaint about the service here. Overall though, I think it was about ten minutes total that we spent in line getting what we wanted to go.  As far as the tarts go: we got the original the first time we came here. The pastry was flaky and crumbly. The filling was light, soft, and not overly sweet. Overall, it was delicious. I think a lot of people said in their reviews that their tarts cracked and fell apart. Note, it is very *soft* . If you want a picture of the tart, take it before you commute so that you can see it is in one beautiful piece. Obviously, as soft as it is, if it bounces around, etc., it could split. Having said that, we had no trouble walking our tart home in one piece the first time. The second time, it did crack a little. But even when it does crack, we're K with it because it would be cut and devoured in a matter of minutes anyway. It's not an overly large tart. The routine is, we would cut it into four so that we could each have a slice, and then save the rest to eat later/share with others. Later was like...only a few hours later =) To be honest, I could probably eat an entire one on my own given the opportunity hahaha.  One subsequent visits, we opted to go for some of the mini tarts. We're split on how we feel about it. One loved it more than the larger tart, the other felt it wasn't as good (that person would be me). But ultimately, I think it's a good way to go because then we won't have as much to eat and then be all like, was it a good idea to eat the whole thing in a day?  We haven't tried the matcha cheesecake...will be trying it next though!!"}
{"text":"I finally visited the hyped up Pablo's and it was indeed hyped up.  We tried a slice of cake $3.99, which was not cheap considering the size and bought two mini tarts.  Unfortunately, it was actually hyped up - first the cake was partially frozen.  By the time we finished our cake, I could taste frozen bits.  And second, the actual cake itself really wasn't that good.  I also don't like the tart jelly glaze over the cheesecake.  And finally, the crust itself was quite sad.  I mean, what gives?  I would not come back again - totally overhyped."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it , but couldn't. It was so bad that I ended up throwing it out . Waste of time and money"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening after class. Originally I was making my way to Uncle Tetsu's maid cafe but I passed by this store and the scent of cheesey goodness was flowing in the air! Instantly drew my attention and I lined up to see what's on the menu. I ended up ordering the original cheesetart, matcha cheesetart (had to wait an extra 5 minutes for them to finish this order) and a mango smoothie ( didn't like it, tasted like watered down banana). Price wise the cheesetarts were good, so worth the quality!   However I didn't like the smoothie. It took long for them to make it and it was not worth $5.99 in my opinion. The cashier also charged me an extra 0.50 cents when I was using credit card. I didn't notice until after.   The wait wasn't long and the cheesetarts were definitely worth my visit! Will definitely come back with friends !"}
{"text":"Pablo's cheesetarts are very unique, and because of this it might not be everyone's cup of tea. My first try at Pablo's was a pretty average experience, but I went back a couple more times because a) there is no more lineup! yay! and b) I wanted to see which flavor tasted the best.   The store itself is adorable, and I love the neatly stacked cakes in the Picasso-style containers they give you for takeout. I normally just take the cakes to-go as the seating in the back looks nice, but I'd rather shove cake in my mouth at home. The texture of the cheese tarts is very runny and smooth, and I prefer to eat it on the same day I buy it.  My favorite flavor is the matcha one! It contains mochi and red bean inside, and the matcha taste is very strong but still sweet. My second favorite would be the chocolate, but the chocolate pieces get hard inside if you put it in the fridge for too long. The premium cheese tart with the torched surface is more like a traditional cheese cake, but I wasn't a huge fan. My least favorite would be the original cheese tart as they have some kind of weird orange-jello layer on top, giving it a fruity taste. So if you're ever to try out the cakes please get the matcha one!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! But unfortunately, I was not a huge fan of their famous cheesetarts :( The filling of their original cheesetart was not really what I expected, it had a jelly-gelatin consistency (kind of expected it to be more custard-like instead).   BUT!!!!! Their cheese soft serve is AMAZING. It tastes exactly like the asian white rabbit candy. Definitely going to come back and have their icecream."}
{"text":"My be and I had the default cheesetart in the store and thankfully didn't have to deal with broken cheese tart."}
{"text":"I fall in love with Pablo after trying their cheese tart in Osaka not long ago. I heard mixed opinions from many of my friends who tried the Toronto location.  I actually waited a few weeks hoping they have enough time to master the technique making the cheese tarts...  Very disappointed. Compared to the Pablo in Japan as this location failed not only in one but several aspects in making the cheese tart.  The texture of the cheese tart is not right, it is way too firm. It is supposed to be exactly like their picture, which is almost semi runny like almost still lava. Flavor is off. Compared to Japan, I was expecting a mild cheese taste but with stronger milky and creamy note. The consistency is off too as the cheese tart should be creamy smooth centre and not like bouncy jello with huge bubbles inside.  My friends had the same cheese cake with me said that it is not bad at all but they never tried the one in Japan. However, to me it is a total failure. Pablo please master your technique, maybe one day I will come back again."}
{"text":"Freshly Baked Cheesecake ($3.99+tax)   I wanted a piece to take to the hotel to enjoy, but if you buy one slice, you can only Dine-in. You have to order a full size to go. I hope they can change that for tourist. I didn't have anyone to share the whole cheesecake because I was there for work. I also didn't want to dine-in either, but I was forced to since I really wanted to see what the hype was all about.   I ordered the original cheesecake which was light, creamy, and not too sweet.  The cheesecake wasn't as \"cheesey\" as I expected; however, it was still pretty good. I personally like my cheesecake a little bit more \"cheesey\" tho.   If I have to choose between Pablo and Uncle Tetsu, I prefer the Uncle tetsu cheesecake a lot more!"}
{"text":"I would say Pablo has the most decent cheese tart I have tried in Toronto so far. But that being said, if any of you have had Bake cheese tarts in Asia, this would not compare (in my opinion). Nonetheless, I would say this was better than I expected. The outer layer texture is great, just the right amount of crisp/ fluffiness, which makes a good 'tart'. The cheese filling inside was light and not too sweet. Only thing is it gets a little messy when you are trying to cut it up for sharing. I had the Pablo mini cheese tart in Japan, but didn't find it a lot more 'wow' than the one in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love the wiggliness and gooiness of the cheese tart which is further enhanced with the flaky crust.  Possibly it is the rush of crowds but the cake didn't set fully.  Got the chocolate cheesecake.  The chocolate paste at the bottom was a tad bit too sweet for me so for anyone else sensitive to sugar, i would recommend the original  Lineup as of 1 week after open is about 1 hr 10 mins starting at nail salon place with a wrap around line right in front of the store."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Pablo's yesterday afternoon and saw that the line had about 12 people outside the door, which was great considering how long I've heard this line can be. The line quickly grew by 20 people behind us a few minutes after though. We ended up waiting about 25 minutes by the time we reached the cash register. Not a big deal since we were chatting and looking at the different menu items anyway.  Staff were very busy at work in the open kitchen and the staff member at the door who was greeting customers was cheerful. The one at the cash register was a bit slow which seemed to have caused the wait though.   There are some tables and couches available for those who want to eat their tarts or have their drinks right away. There's enough seating for around 20 people and maybe a bit more if people squish in.  Since it was our first time, we got the original cheese tart for $14.99 plus tax. The flaky but somewhat crispy crust went well with the custard like cheese of the tart. It was savoury but with a hint of vanilla sweetness to it. We enjoyed it and we were really full by the end of it - even feeling a little sick from having eaten too much of it in a short amount of time. We would have taken the other half home but aparently it is best consumed warm and within 3 hours of getting it, which didn't work with our evening plans.  They also have the tart in matcha as well as chocolate - both of which I've heard mixed reviews about. Creme brulee and other treats like soft serve ice cream are available too, along with a variety of drinks.  Overall, we liked the cheese tart here and it was interesting to try it. I would say it's probably overhyped since I wouldn't consider it the most amazing thing I've eaten but definitely worth trying at least once! We'll eventually try the other flavours in the future when the lines die down a bit more."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out these cheesetarts I've been seeing around on social media! We got the original cheese Tart, original cheese soft serve, and the premium cheesecake (just one slice). At first bite of the cheese tarts it wasn't that pleasant tasting which was likely due to it being still warm. I think you're supposed to eat these tarts cold(er) so if you decide to get this please refrigerate! It tasted delicious and light when the filling was solidified - a nice creamy custard light cheese taste. The soft serve tasted quite pleasant as well! The premium cheesecake was quite underwhelming - tasted like a regular cheesecake nothing too special. The wait for us was around 20 mins and we began lining up at 11AM. Would recommend checking this place out! I'll be back to try to matcha softserve and tart! :)"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. First time got a premium and regular dine in slice. Horrible.... Texture and flavour were not great and quite overpriced. Second time got a fresh out of the oven mini tart. DELICIOUS! More expensive than uncle tetsu though and I like the uncle tetsu crust more as well which is more cookie like while this is flakey like a pie. Third time I got the huge fresh tart in matcha. I spilt it with a large group of friends and we all LOVED IT. The staff even gave us plates to cut it and I love the wet wipes. Overall I would go again but onky with a group of friends willing to share the large tart! The texture between the cold and warm is very different."}
{"text":"I went to Pablo Cheesetart for the first time last night and was pretty surprised when the lady who served me took my money in her hand, took out change and gave it to me (was wearing rubber gloves) and then went directly to the shelf, picked up the 3 Cheesetarts I ordered and put them in my bag with the same gloves. Very unclean and unprofessional thing to do so I give it a 1/5."}
{"text":"Oh no! Another Japanese business opened in Toronto. You know what will happen next.  I wonder if the person who brought this business to Canada is the same Canadian business partner that persuaded Uncle Tetsu to come here. The similarities are uncanny. But first, this Japanese chain of Cheese tarts, pastry, ice cream, smoothies and coffee has arrived and I am glad. Japanese products are usually of a high quality.  Yet, we all know what happens next. They are Japanese. So all the Chinese-Canadian population will rush it and create the ever so desirable line-up and voila. There were twenty or so people in line today and my advice is if you are a guy and want to pick up a Chinese girl or if you are a gal and want to pick up a Chinese boy Pablo's queue is now as hot a ticket as Uncle Tetsu (all respect to homosexuals as well, this line-up could be for you too of course).  Back to the similarities I mentioned. The Japanese business (although Pablo is an actual chain and business in Japan whereas uncle Tetsu is not having long gone broke and shut down its stores) serves cheese tarts (which is why Uncle Tetsu started the same a couple of months ago), there is a line-up of Asian Canadians outside (and yes Pablo has placed a rope outside), one cheese tart per person is allowed, no credit card is accepted and they stamp/brand their items on top.  There are a couple of differences however. Pablo is a café with seating. The interior, as such, is much nicer than the drab Uncle Tetsu and they sell coffee, smoothies, slices of tart (only for dine-in customers) and they have branded their oven. The store also sells branded items like coffee mugs. The prices are outrageous. $15 for a regular cheese tart. $25 for a premium cheese tart, which is blowtorched (brulee) on top. There are several items 'coming soon' and not yet available. By the way, here is another way Pablo and Uncle Tetsu are similar (again: same businessman running both shows??): they are master marketers and create a line-up on purpose. Uncle Tetsu does it by not adding an oven and making people wait. Pablo does it by moving customers as slowly as possible. When I got to the cash there were approximately 30 cakes ready for purchase behind the cashiers. Would they sell them and move the line? No, move as slowly as possible. Speak to one another, get the cake from the fridge, ask you to wait, go bring it, hand it to you slowly, etc. Slowly now slowly, we need the line-up to be there. LOL honest! The cashier was polite and eager to explain expiration and storage, which is nice, but I am sorry I am not going to be prompted by the cash machine to tip. Are you kidding me? It is a take-out, I was standing in line, in a hot store and the tart is $25. Should I tip at Harvey's too? How about at the post office? Will they suggest a 15% tip at Sobeys too next? Ridiculous.  But I told you. These guys have done their homework on Canada (there is no tipping in Japan or East Asia).  Now and finally, how was the cheese tart? Well, it was OK. It is too dense for me and actually reminded me of (a better) New York Cheesecake. Of course Americans cheesecake is gross and heavy so this was not as bad as that, but it is definitely denser and heavier than Japanese cheesecake or Uncle Tetsu's tarts. I actually prefer Uncle Testu's spongy cheesecake. I was not a fan of Uncle Tetsu's cheese tart either. I am not sure what to think of the blowtorched top of the premium either. To save myself the thought and money I would probably get the 'Classic' if I ever go back, but I would not be in a rush to be at Pablo again. All in all, happy that Uncle Tetsu, Tsujiri, Pablo, Uniqlo (hey, pay your employees! stop mistreating employees) and Muji are in a cluster here, but obviously not as happy as Chinese-Canadian friends of mine."}
{"text":"Best cheesecake of its kind I've ever had and it was amazing. Ordered 2 original and there wasn't particularly a long wait. Definately will be back next time I visit Toronto!   Apricot spread on top is a neat touch but does roll off if not careful."}
{"text":"The filling tasted like pudding rather than cheese and the crust was like pastry. Not my favorite combination and not worth waiting in line."}
{"text":"No line up today so I decided to try it out and see what the fuss was about. Definitely not worth the hype - or the price!  I bought the original cheese tart, which costed $14.99 plus tax. It's basically a pastry crust with a gelatinous custard filling. Taste is ok, but the texture threw me off (it was like eating a very soft jello).   I was also offered 50% off the pudding box as I purchased an entire cheese tart. The pudding box includes 6 puddings and was $19.99(???) originally but I picked them up for $10. I would NOT recommend these puddings. They're prepackaged and very, very small. The taste was awful, and the caramel sauce that came with it tasted so artificial I had to throw 80% of the pudding away.   It's not worth the price. The tart is ok-ish but the pudding is so off-putting I'm not sure what to do with the remaining 5. The only good thing about this experience was the friendly staff I encountered at the shop."}
{"text":"We went to Pablo Cheesetart restaurant for cheesetart and coffee. Pablo Cheesetart is nicely decorated restaurant that is small and doesn't have many seats. The service was slow and we have to wait 10 minutes to get our cheesetarts and drinks.  We ordered two cheesetart and a coffee and another drink. It came to around 20 dollars. The cheesetarts were okay, nothing special.  Would we go back? I doubt it since the service was slow and the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Yum! We got to try this minus the wait after my brother brought a cheese tart home. The line was reportedly only around 15mins on a late Tuesday night.   I actually really enjoyed it despite reading  mixed reviews. Smooth custardy filling and crispy pie shell with great packaging. I could see how with the larger $30 size, the ratio of crust to filling might be skewed, but the proportions for the regular size are a-okay. In comparison with Uncle Tetsu's, I'd take a cheese tart over a cheesecake - the different textures make for a tastier dessert experience."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of very decadent desserts, Pablo's cheese tarts are great. But personally, I did not enjoy their cheese tart.  I ordered a matcha cheese tart, which had some adzuki bean filling and some pieces of mochi in it. The crust is flaky, similar to the texture of a crunchy croissant. The matcha filling is reminiscent of a custard, and is extremely sweet.  In comparison to Uncle Testsu's, Pablo's cheese tarts are much sweeter, and more liquidy. The tart is also much more fragile than  an average cheesecake, so beware if you plan to carry the tart around.   I waited around 20 minutes to order. The staff are friendly, and there's a decent amount of seating in the shop.   I won't be back anytime soon, but it was interesting to see what the hype was about."}
{"text":"very disappointed  - matcha soft serve: light green colour with intense milk flavour, charged for 4.99$, should have went to tsujiri next door to get matcha ice cream - matcha cheese tart: has a clear sugary layer on the top, very disgusting, had to get rid of the sugary part. The red bean filling is too sweet compared to uncle testu. The tart part is hard to cut apart.  As a fan of matcha desserts, I'm very sad about these 2 matcha products"}
{"text":"tl;dr: Such a disappointment. Nothing like their Japan branches so lower your expectations! If you're looking for real cheese tarts then check out Uncle Tetsu next door for their hot and fresh ones. If you must try anything then I suggest getting the mini ones (sized like an egg tart for one) and not the original (large one that's $10+).   Original (large size): I got the large one which is enough to serve at least 4 people. Even though they market this as freshly baked it was lukewarm and had clearly been sitting on the counter for quite some time. The cheese filling was a texture that felt more gelatin like than creamy cheesecake (not sure if this was intentional but I didn't like it). It's covered in this goopy apricot jelly and honestly deterred from the flavor of the cheese tart than add to it. One thing that was a semi redeeming factor was its phyllo shell which was crispy and delicious.   Mini (small size): These are sized for one person and actually were quite good! They were warmer than their originally large and the main differences were: didn't have the funky apricot jelly on top and a crispy pie cookie shell. Honestly these resembled the Uncle Tetsu ones more and had a creamier cheese texture which I loved."}
{"text":"Went to Pablos a month after it opened, and line up's were out the door. Don't be fooled, it was a line up created by the staff with slow service - they gave a 5min speech with every order. The cheesecake was ok, would not spend an hour in line for it. Fast-forward to Dec, and there are no line ups. But don't think I will go back, their cheesecakes are way too soft and runny."}
{"text":"Tried Pablo first in Naha, Japan and was blown away. Was totally excited to hear its coming to Toronto. I think I had the mini tarts in Japan, so when I tried the cheese tart here I was admittedly let down a bit compared to what i remembered of my experience in Japan. But nonetheless, a great Japanese cheese tart dessert, not overly sweet, subtle flavors. It shouldn't be compared to Uncle Tetsu's because its not supposed to be the same style. Two different things, both enjoyable in its own right. Let's just be glad there's another great option in town!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today after seeing huge lineups in front of the shop for the last few weeks. There wasn't a big line when I got there but I can see why it's worth the wait!  We got slices of the original cheese tart and the premium cheese tart, and also got a whole original cheese tart to go. The original cheese tart that Pablo is famous for was creamy and was balanced out with a nice tartness from the apricot spread on top. Not super sweet, this isn't as light as Tetsu's cheese cake, but definitely has more cheesy flavour. In contrast, the premium cheese tart is more dense and is slightly reminiscent of a less sweet version NY-style cheese cake, fused with a creme brûlée topping. It costs a bit more but definitely worth trying!  I would recommend eating the tarts either in-house or as soon as possible while it's freshly baked as they do start to get soggy after a few hours, especially because the full tarts are pre-packed in the boxes already before you order."}
{"text":"By now, the hype has died down and there is usually no line ups anymore for these cheesecakes. I have tried the matcha and the original. The original is good but the matcha one is way too sweet, especially because there's mochi and red bean inside.  They also have individual ones like the Mont Blanc tart but it's pretty small for a $5 tart."}
{"text":"Don't bother. We went on a weekday at around dinner time, the store was not terribly busy, but the cashier lady had to take 5 minutes per customer, so we waited for 20 minutes. What first shocked me was the price, its 14.99 before tax for a tiny cheesecake, way overpriced. But since I had high expectation for Pablo, I decided to give it a try.   I didn't even want to swallow my first bite, it tasted like uncooked, raw filling and custard with no texture or firmness like a cheesecake should have. The crusts were soggy and not crispy. The worst thing is that the cake is COLD. I can buy a better cake even from Loblaws or anywhere else. Honestly, I would dump it in the garbage even if I got this for free.  Please, save yourself a trip and go to Uncle Tetsu (it's just around the corner) instead, way better quality and my go-to spot for cheese tarts, which is what I should have probably done in the first place, what a waste of money and time."}
{"text":"I've tried almost every cheesecake they offer here and my favorite is the cremebruele cheesecake! The tasted like creme brûlée and the top was torched nicely. The only thing is it was kind of hard. Not as soft as the other cheesecake which is not what I was expecting as I put my fork into it. I would come back just for that and recommend it to other if you don't mind the $24 price tag. Also I'm not sure how this place compares to uncle tetsu because these are cheese tarts and uncle tetsu sells cheesecake..."}
{"text":"This is too hyped up, Cheesetart was not good at all but their crust is superior compared to others as it was crisp and flakey. The texture was literally just like some tofu and had minimal taste"}
{"text":"The famous Pablo Japanese Cheesetarts have finally arrived in North America, and they chose Toronto to be the first city to open a store!  I got a chance to do a sneak preview of the store before it opened. The interior is very nice and had a modern Japanese bakery look. There is a seating area at the back which is very cosy.  I tried all four flavours of their tarts: the Original, Premium, Matcha and Chocolate. Of the four, I enjoyed the Original ($14.99) the most - it has a creamy texure with a flaky crust, and the taste is light and elegant.  The Premium ($24.99) is not really a cheesetart, rather more like a cheesecake. It is dense, has very intense cheese flavour and the top is a thin creme brulee crust. Some people commented that they liked this more.  I also had a taste of the Matcha ($16.99) and Chocolate ($16.99) - both are decent tasting, but personally I like the cleaner taste of the Original the best.  They also sell smoothies here, most notable being the cream cheese smoothie, which tastes good but is too heavy for most people. The matcha smoothie though is excellent, and it comes with matcha jelly at the bottom, red bean paste, and is topped with a mochi ball.  There is shaved ice here as well, and the matcha shaved ice was excellent.  Overall, big fan of this place! Expect very long line ups for the foreseeable future, but it is worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check out what all the hype was about at Pablo. Surprised to see there wasn't a line so I walked in. The mini cheese tarts were excellent and the perfect portion size, and the larger tarts came in two flavors (regular and NY style). Both were delicious! Only downside is that it's all pretty expensive, but you gotta treat yourself every so often."}
{"text":"Tried the match cheese tart.   It's way too sweet for me.  Not a fan about it.  I'll try the chocolate one in the future. Somehow I start missing uncle tetsu 's cheesecake"}
{"text":"*Warning - if you want a slice of Pablo cheesecake, you are not able to get it to go! They will not sell you a slice if you do not sit down and use their cafe.   Overall, I found consistency an issue at Pablo. The first time I got it when it came out of the oven, it was quite good. The best way to describe Pablo is a premium version of Uncle Tetsu cheesecake. It tastes the same but thicker and creamier. However, the second time I got it, the cake was a bit sour and tasted like it went bad.   Pablo is a decent place to grab dessert, but won't be an experience that will be memorable!"}
{"text":"The line is very long & slow! I was very curious due the mixed reviews... but I had to wait 30 mins in the rain and got to try the cheese tart. It melted in my mouth!! I would wait again for it!"}
{"text":"I love cheese. I love cheesecake. I don't really like tarts though so maybe that's why I don't understand the hype.  I thought the original cheese tart was quite disgusting...the texture was weird. It was jelly and mushy.  The mini cheese tarts were cute and delicious though (because it tasted more like a regular ny style cheesecake texture but sweeter)"}
{"text":"I'm very excited to try this place since I'm a fan of Japanese desserts. Yesterday, there was a short line around 6ppl in front of me, so I decided to step in. It took me 15mins to reach cash reigster and 4 mins to get classic cheese tart smoothie. I bought 2 mini and 1 orginal. First of all, smoothie is not yummy as I expected it. It tasted like milk and creamy cheese with iced blended-nothing special. If they increase creamy cheese and sugar, the smoothie would be great. Mini cheese tarts are good because the flavor is balanced.  Original cheese tart is very disappointed with creamy filling and unbalanced texture. It tasted more whipping cream than cream cheese. The pastry is the best part-crispy.  Overall, I won't come back here again."}
{"text":"not worth the hype! i lined up for ~10mins for this place. there's a limit of 1 per person. while waiting in line you get to see how the tarts are made and i was surprised because there was no aroma. i got the original tart which cost $15 after tax. i was told it's good sitting on the counter 6h after purchasing and then it has to be refrigerated and consumed within 24h. to be honest, it did not taste very good. it was very bland and it wasn't cheesy. the tart looked nice but failed on the flavour. uncle tetsu's is 100% times better"}
{"text":"Many people have complained about getting a cracked cheese tart so I was really worried about ordering it coming in.  I also had concerns about the line up.   I purchased the cheesetart on a Sunday evening with no lineups or cracked tart! I was super eager to try the Japanese famous cheesetart and so I hurried to find a seat in the store. (Love the sofas btw!)  After carefully unboxing the tart, I was met with a golden cake glistening with the sweet apricot glaze. Upon my first bite, I immediately fell in love with the creamy filling. The crust itself was really buttery as well, making for a flavorful combination."}
{"text":"I like it! Imagine having a tart with a filling that's light yet creamy, jiggly like a pudding but texture like a mousse.  Lineups aren't bad now, expect to wait 5 minutes or so to order. I got the fresh cheese tart slice ($4). You can only order slices to eat at the cafe. It was pretty unique and yummy, it is kind of the opposite of an American cheesecake. Since it's so light, it feels like the perfect dessert after a meal! The crust is flaky yet thin, the filling is slightly sweet with that fruit glaze.  Glad to have had a slice, and not a whole tart because I don't think I could bring it with me as I trek back uptown! Maybe if their packaging gets an upgrade I would take a risk. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I personally like their cheese tarts more than Tetsu's. Tetsu's is basically an air cake and it's boring.. so I always Pablo's cheese tart or their cheese soft serve. Their stuff is just more exciting than Tetsu's."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying out Pablo because I heard so much about it online and from friends. The line up wasn't too long maybe around 15mins. We ordered the original cheese tart and ate it fresh there and also tried it again the next day refrigerated. Definitely tastes better fresh. The tart has a very light cheese taste and I was expecting a lot more flavour. I didn't like the jelly that they coated the tart with, I think it gives it a weird texture. I would say it's worth a try but for $15 it is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"I was here last night around 9pm, and it wasn't that busy. I didn't have to wait a long time only about 10 mins to order. We got the original cheese tart, the cheese tart smoothie, and the mango smoothie.   It came up to about $30 bucks, and boy was I disappointed.   First off the tarts in the making was mouth watering as I watched it but when I got my first bite it was the total opposite. The yellow glaze on top was not in my favor it was gross and was like some jelly that ruined the tart. It was sour and lemony.  The drinks however did not satisfy my taste buds either. They took over 15 minutes to make because they decided to make the people's drinks behind me first... why? We had to return the mango one because she left it sitting for 15 minutes and you can see the liquids on the bottom + it wasn't even cold! It was nasty!   The original tart smoothie wasn't great either. It tasted like a stomach ache. Nothing here was wow to me. It was just a waste of my time. The only thing I can say positively was the environment, and the atmosphere. It was cozy and nice, but they played the same song 20 times so... annoying   I really had high high highhh hopes for Pablo, but i understand why the lines aren't even long anymore. It's because it sucks! I don't recommend, and I won't be back   toodaloo"}
{"text":"Finally got around trying this place after the hype died down and no more line ups.  Originally I was thinking of maybe getting their mini tart for $3.99 but I figured I should go with their signature original cheese tart, what they are known for. I wanted to just order a slice for $3.99, but apparently slices were only available for dine-in. If you get take-out you have to get a full cake...So I just decided to get the whole original cheese tart ($14.99). What a disappointment. Just was not what I expected it to taste like. Wasn't runny like a lava, it just tasted like a normal mousse cheesecake. The top orange layer tasted like mango flavored jelly which really threw off the cheesecake flavor. Definitely had better cheese tarts elsewhere at a cheaper price. If their signature cake was already such a disappointment, I don't know what to expect for their other cakes.  A few of my friends tried it and told me it tastes nothing like the one in Japan and it was over-hyped so I already had low expectations..but it was just a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"a very good creamy change to the traditional cheesecake we have been eating over the past couple of years when tetsu had the full monopoly of Japanese cakes in that area. i liked it, especially the chocolate one. i must admit that all tarts tasted like an eggy pudding or a fancier more subtle egg tart, but i like that in general.... thus a bigger egg tart was a great thing to have!   however... for the high price (17 cad for a chocolate one), they should really go faster! the line is incredibly slow to move, whereas there are plenty of tarts ready to be bought... as if a long line outside has become mandatory now to attract customers..."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is expensive and not worth the price but I agree with a previous reviewer that the cheese ice cream in a cone was good (especially on a hot day)."}
{"text":"I ate their cheese tart for lunch one day, and it was delicious. Only issue I have is its kinda runny, but otherwise I enjoy the jam on top, the flakey crust and the flavour of custard-like filling. I think it's worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"Grand opening was very unorganized. Had people line up for hours in advance and at 4pm instead of opening the doors to let the people in they decided to start their ceremonial speeches and ribbon cutting. Everyone was under the assumption that doors would open at 4, but actual customers were not allowed in until 4:45. When i asked what the delay was, no one could give me a firm answer, just told me to wait 5 more minutes. I got the original and the matcha and both were very underwhelming. The matcha was too sweet and the sugar over powered any natural flavour the adzuki beans had. Will not line up again.   - debit only no credit card allowed"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by since there was not much of a line (Tuesday lunch time). Waited 10 minutes and picked up an original cheese tart for $15.   It's unlike anything I have tasted. The texture is like crème brûlée, yet the taste resembles a light cheesecake. This is combined with a Hong Kong egg tart crust and a faint scent of Kraft singles cheese. Overall, not bad but not great.  Although unique, I personally would not line up for it."}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open for awhile because I love tarts. Waited in line for a bit less than 3 hours. They make the cheese tarts fresh in house so that's really cool. When we finally get to order, all they had was the regular cheese tart left.   As for the cheese tart, not myself and my significant other thought it was a 6.5/10.   It was essentially a giant egg tart. So think of creme Brule with a thin layer of apricot sauce on top. The best part of the tart was the cheese crust. It was really delicious with the perfect amount of fluffiness and flavour."}
{"text":"So, 9pm on a Wednesday this place was littered with people/students hanging out.  I came in for the first time ordering something for myself and opted for:  - Pablo's Original Cheesetart ($15) - Pablo's Strawberry Mini Daifuku ($5) - Caramel Yuzu Tea ($5)  The service was good, nothing spectacular.  Ambiance, reminded me of a bubble tea environment with nicer seating (compared to Chatime).  The original Cheesetart was good, delicious.  Would I eat it again, sure.  Would I order it myself--not likely.  I love cheese but I would prefer a traditional North American Cheesecake.  The Strawberry Daifuku I really enjoyed and love the size of it--perfect for one person and the flavour was delicious.  It was like a molten strawberry mochi on a cheese cake   The caramel yuzu was delicious but at that price point--you're better off paying for a jar at T&T as it wasn't crafted or \"homemade\" in any way.  Otherwise there are various other cakes and mini cakes and a nice place to hang out.  They also have a full service espresso machine so you can get your coffee and cake which is lovely.  Only 3 stars because it was good but I was not blown away."}
{"text":"After subway and bus ride home from dt, the big tart looked miserable. Filling floated out of the crust from one side. There was no sudden toss n turns during the way, i am carrying a cake after all. But i guess it's still too much for the soft tart centre. Anyway, other than the bad look, it tastes fine, but definately NOT worth the lineup and the money. Probably will not go again."}
{"text":"Had this twice and not been impressed either time. Maybe I'm not the right person to judge since I'm not very familiar with cheese tarts like this but I didn't enjoy the texture or flavour. The crust was tasty, but I really did not like the gelatin topping. It made the whole thing feel slimy. It does not last very long in the fridge either without becoming mushy.  I also got to try to the mochi strawberry tart and it was more my style. It had a very distinctive sugary and artificial strawberry jam sort of taste but I like that sorta thing so I enjoyed it.  I'll stick with egg tarts from local HK-style bakeries instead."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Pablo's cheesetarts, but I'm just not a fan. I love that they're made fresh, but I really did not like the warm gooey center. I even tried to refrigerate it to let it set but it didn't quite do it for me. The tart crust is great though and super flakey.   Service is great and they're pretty efficient in pumping out customers while maintaining a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I have had Pablo cheese tarts in Osaka Japan and am happy they finally came to Toronto! I prefer the matcha cheese tart which has red bean and mochi inside to the original cheese tart. The flaky buttery crust is baked to perfection and the creamy matcha and cheese are in good balance. I think the red bean takes away from the cheese flavour but adds a nice sweetness to the tart. There is also a chocolate cheese tart which I have never tried, but I imagine it must be very sweet. For those that are used to Uncle Tetsu cheesecake, don't expect something similar as you will find Pablo cheese tarts a lot sweeter and heavier. For cheesecake lovers I would recommend going for the original cheese tart as that has the strongest cheese taste. I am just a sucker for anything matcha.   With the grand opening today and the free cheese tart giveaway to the first 150 customers, obviously there were crazy line-ups. It will probably stay that way for awhile as with any Japanese chain that comes over to Toronto. I really like Pablo but I wouldn't say it's worth lining up hours for. Hopefully once the craze dies down a little bit we can get one within a reasonable wait time!"}
{"text":"Not very good. The custard was spongy and gelatinous rather than smooth and creamy. I didn't get a lot of cheese flavour from the tart, unlike the Uncle Tetsu version. The glaze looked nice but didn't add much in terms of flavour. The only part I liked was the pastry crust.  It may be that I just don't \"get\" Japanese cheese tarts. I'm not in love with Uncle Tetsu either but it was better than this one.   No plans to go back."}
{"text":"Well, it's not that good.  Tried the original that was fresh out of the oven. The only good thing about it was the crust. The warm filling was like pudding but it wasn't sweet. I felt like I was eating mush and the jelly topping didn't help either. Maybe it would taste better if it firmed up once cooled. People comparing it to an egg tart are pretty wrong though, egg tarts are way better. I wish it was like an egg tart. Who wouldn't want a pie sized egg tart?!   Hopefully when I get to Japan, their Pablo's would be way better. I will eventually try the other flavours from here though, my friend said the matcha is delicious."}
{"text":"Personally, the Pablo cheese tart just wasn't my thing. First things first though: keep in mind that this is a cheese tart, and is different from a Japanese cheesecake. Therefore, don't expect it to be similar at all to Uncle Tetsu's, because the two products are completely different.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the texture of the cheese tart is really... interesting. It's not like liquid cheese oozing out, but it's also not completely solid. Rather, it's somewhere in between, and personally I found it a bit off-putting. I had one slice when I got home, which was still slightly warm. I did like the flavour of the tart, which was lightly cheesy. I did have another slice (cold) the next morning though, and found the taste of the cheese had significantly diminished.  I have had mini cheese tarts before in Hong Kong and really enjoyed them, so I think part of the problem is with the large size of the tarts here, as it creates an uneven ratio of tart-to-filling and also affects the texture of the tarts. Pablo is coming out with mini tarts soon, so I am looking forward to trying those. I wouldn't get the large tarts again though, and wouldn't recommend waiting more than 20-30 mins for one, although they are cool to try once. It's nice that they have a small seating area inside so you could ideally eat your tart (or they sell single slices too) right away."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon the line for pablo during their second week of opening. Heard all the hype and thought I'd give it a try since the line up wasnt too bad. After about 20min of waiting i was in the store, and apparently they and sold out of everything except the original. So I settled for what they had, and thb, it was not as amazing as the hype had described it to be.   The crust of the tart/pie was flaky and crispy, it was very pleasant to dip it in the cheese filling. The centre of the tart was very rich and creamy, which was nice the first bite in. But after 1 slice of it, you really dont want to eat anymore due to the heaviness of the cream. (So make sure you buy it to share with lots of ppl!)"}
{"text":"I like the cheese tart, it is very rich in cheese. I like the original better than the mocha flavour, just feel like class is best.   It is a bit pricy comparing to other cheesecake."}
{"text":"Worst cheese tart I've ever ate. I have been to Cheese Garden at north york several times?and heard someone recommend Pablo. So my boyfriend and I driver to dt to try it. Taste strange and not even like a CHEESE tart?"}
{"text":"Tried the original cheese tart again earlier this weekend, and the consistency was off from the ones in Osaka, JP. The cheese flavour was severely lacking. I still liked its buttery crust though. It was also only 800 yen over there compared to $15 here, so definitely a big price difference."}
{"text":"To be honest this place is overpriced cheesecake.  I can't believe people lined up for it!  Nothing too special about it.  Maybe it was overhyped and had high expectations for it.  If the line is long, go another day.  Save your time for something better!"}
{"text":"Had the cheesecake smoothie - absolutely phenomenal. Well-balanced flavour between sweet and savoury, fragrant cheese and the chunks of the Pablo crust made it an interesting beverage."}
{"text":"big lineups still month after opening, for me its worth it although portion-price ratio is really high, the cake I tried was so good. milkshakes, so-so. staff is really nice but I can't stand the music theme that is repeating over and over every 15 seconds lol I wonder how they don't go crazy working there. Hope to try more cakes and for smaller lineups once it gets colder. veru convenient location in little Tokyo near Eaton centre."}
{"text":"I finally got to try the matcha cheesecake! Really hard to find a day when they have it available because they either sell out very quickly or they didn't have it available the day I go!   Their matcha cheesecake is different than their regular cheesecake because not only is it a matcha flavor, but there's red bean inside! On top of red bean, there's a rare occasion of one or two white mochi balls (rice glutinous balls) inside too! What a surprise and a great addition to the matcha cheese cake.   Their cheesecakes are definitely not the type of Japanese cheesecakes you're familiar with at Uncle Tetsus where it's nice and fluffy, Pablo's cheesecake is more on the gooey side and when you cut into it, it's more fragile and tend to fall apart. So I assume there's more eggs in their tarts but the taste is great. I know it won't be everyone's type of cheesecake because of its texture but there's different ways to make a cheesecake right?? I especially like the crust though because by the time I took the cheesecake home, the crust was still crunchy! The apricot jelly on top is a nice finish to the cheesecake.   Go early if you want an order of this cheesecake! You definitely have a better chance at getting a regular cheesecake than a green tea one, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying Pablo but it wasn't down to wait in line when the store just opened. We dropped by Pablo around 830pm on a Saturday and there was no line but very limited selection of tarts left - I got the last matcha! We wanted to get one to go and bring back to share with our family. By the time we got back, it was too late to eat it so we left it in the fridge with the plan to eat it the day after. I don't really know what it looks like fresh because it was already packaged and put in a bag, but I can tell you that after leaving it in the fridge overnight the top matcha area was cracking a bit. You can see in my pictures attached.  Apparently we weren't supposed to leave it in the fridge because it makes the pastry part harder to eat. Was just a little hard to eat but manageable. The cheese tart itself was really creamy and not too sweet. Because its matcha, there was red bean inside which made it taste more sweeter. There was also a semi large white ball (didn't get it in my slice but apparently it's a mochi).  Price is pretty steep for the matcha tart and it tastes pretty generic.. something we've had before but it was still good! probably get the smaller tarts next time when they're available."}
{"text":"I didn't understand the long lines I'd almost always see for this place. I finally decided to try it because there was no line and I'm not really impressed with the tart itself. Inside of the cafe is quite cozy and cute. I could see myself possibly enjoying some coffee and studying here, but definitely not for the cheesetart.   It was so hyped up but I felt that there was no flavor in the original one. It's quite expensive for one entire tart, which is a good thing I only got a slice for dine-in.  If you like the taste of cheese, skip this place. My friend and I were quite dissapointed to say the least with the lack of flavor. It was just as though we were eating flavorless pudding. The tart shell was crisp and I felt that had more flavor than the cheese part.   I'm not a huge fan of cheese, but even I think Tetsu's next door is much better."}
{"text":"We got the regular and premium cheese tarts and they were awesome! The classic tart was fluffy and not too sweet while the premium tart was more of a creme bule that is a little bit more dense. The atmosphere of the place is also chic and chill - I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Finally got to try it out after being driven away by the long line-ups.  I walked past the storefront at ~7pm on a Friday night and miraculously there was a short line. We waited ~10 min and was able to watch the process of the cheese tarts coming out of the oven, being hot stamped, and poured over with some sort of caramel-coloured glaze.  ORIGINAL CHEESE TART $14.99 - Overall it's fun to cut into it and jiggle. It's light and the cheese filling had a custard-like texture. The glaze on top tasted & felt like a sweet jello layer. The tart crust was crisp and held the cheese filling greatly. The price is quite expensive though..  //TIPS// The cheese tart can stay in room temperature up to 6 hours then it must be refrigerated and eaten by the next day.  //FINAL THOUGHTS// I'm glad I tried it but I didn't particularly like the combination of the cream cheesy taste with the wetter texture, crispy tart crust, nor the sweet jello glaze."}
{"text":"This review is based entirely on the Premium Cheese Tart ($24.99) that I took out to eat at home.   Despite its \"tart\" title, this dessert is in fact a NY style cheesecake which is made with two types of cream cheese and topped with a brûlée of maple sugar. The cheesecake was decadently rich with a smooth and creamy texture. It did lack the slightly acidic taste of sour cream/cream cheese which is associated with traditional NY cheesecakes - this could be a positive or negative depending on your personal tastes but I thought it was quite nice. However, what I was most impressed by was the crust. It was extremely thin, light and crispy and the flavour was not overly sweet with deep earthy notes of browned sugar. I thought it was the brulee that really made this dessert pop as the flavour and texture of the top shell perfectly complemented the creaminess of the cheesecake."}
{"text":"4.5 was a bit skeptical - especially when there is that tedious line up and hype. Similar to Uncle Tetsu's.... But wow, delicious! creamy almost saucy and smooth and not overly sweet, and that crust so flakey and chewy.  I will get another... Only thing is I hear it is pricey (was given a tart when I first tried it) and the line ups are annoying (-0.5)."}
{"text":"A colleague of mine brought in the premium tart to work and I feel in love and have been back several times. It's a great choice for those that love cheesecake (and it's lighter) as well as creme brûlée. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Heard it's definitely different from the Pablo cheesecakes in Japan as the cheese and milk in Canada is different. From what I've tasted in Toronto, it's not worth waiting in line for...and not worth the hype. They are also overpriced imo. I would try them again in Japan tho"}
{"text":"Pricy for the amount you get. Wasn't anything special but it didn't taste bad either. Almost tastes like Chinese egg tarts with how gooey and creamy it is on the inside. Overall not bad but wouldn't come often. Service was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"This place is way overhyped! I ordered an original cheese tart for $15 and the filling was so runny and bland. I will stick with Uncle Tetsu"}
{"text":"Located near Dundas/Bay, I was able to finally try a Pablo cheese tart after all the lines and hype had died down. Went there on a Tuesday afternoon and I ordered a freshly baked original cheese tart to go which cost $15. The store is small but they also serve a variety of drinks, soft serve, and baked goods. The service can be a bit slow as there was only one cashier, one person making drinks, and 2 people making cheese tarts. I had to wait almost 10 min with 2 people in front of me.   Overall, I had no expectations of what the cheese tart would taste like and was pleasantly surprised. The lightness of the cheese tart was a nice surprise (almost like eating air!) and the apricot jam glaze worked well together with the ingredients. The crust also had a nice flaky texture which was not heavy. Would return to purchase the cheese tart once in a while for a nice treat!"}
{"text":"There's been so much hype about these cheese tarts. I was in the area and stopped by to get one. I was quite excited since everyone seems to love them. I was told that it wasn't exactly small and it would take at least a few people to finish it.   Perhaps it's the texture that turns me off. I thought it'd be more like an egg tart. After a small slice I was done and didn't want anymore. In my opinion, the crust was the best part."}
{"text":"Fortunately, there was no line up so I decided to give this place a try. I've seen the long line ups whenever I'm downtown but luckily today there were none. This was not what I expected. There were a lot of hype and many mentioning how creamy and rich that tarts were. I decided to give the matcha ice cream and the cheese tart a try. I was disappointed by both.The glaze on top of the tart did nothing to appease my taste buds nor did anything for tart. The filling was a mix of pudding and mousse like texture which I did not like. I personally don't like mousse texture so I am bias here.  I did like the crust of the tart tho. Personally, I find the cheese taste really mild for the tart and the ice cream.  I'm not a picky eater but I would definitely not come back here again."}
{"text":"Original flavor is light with full flavor of cheese that melts in your mouth. Best eaten warm combined with crispy texture of the outer layers. Definitely worth a try. A true indulgence!"}
{"text":"I had the fortunate opportunity to come to Pablo when the lineup was not streaming out the door. We ordered an Original Cheesetart that cost $15, as a few of the other tart items were already sold out for the night.  The Cheesetart could be described as a fusion between an Asian egg tart and a cheesecake. The first bite gives you the tartness of the shiny apricot glaze atop of the pastry. This is followed by the sweet and creamy egg custard filling. And finally, the cheese flavour kicks in at the end as a surprising aftertaste. The tart crust is flakey and reminiscent of many Asian styled egg tarts.   My friends and I enjoyed the fact that the tart was very light and easy to eat. Overall, the  taste and texture of the product was closer to that of an egg tart than of traditional or japanese styled cheesecakes. Worth trying though, in my opinion, as long as you don't have to wait in line for hours ;p  The establishment itself was pretty fancy looking, and has many branded products for sale (cups, thermos, etc-reminded me of Starbucks). They seem to be planning new pastries for the future as well, so I look forward to coming back next time for their other delicacies =)"}
{"text":"Maybe I had too much expectation  the space is pretty cozy but the time we went (Friday afternoon), there weren't a lot of seating. One of us had to stand at the tall table. Service was ok, got the signature cheesecake slices, I feel it's over priced."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I waited about 20 minutes in line and another 5-10 minutes for my order. I ordered the regular cheesecake and was quite satisfied with the taste. Since I took the cheesecake to-go, I didn't get a chance to eat it fresh - I highly recommend you eat this fresh as the taste would be much better. I ended up eating mine a little lukewarm and it wasn't as satisfying. Also, make sure not to tip the to-go container/box if you are carrying this as the caramel glaze on the top of the cake will leak off.  It smells so good inside here and you can see how the cheesecakes are being made on the assembly line. I love watching them burn the logo on the tops. They also serve soft serve ice cream, smoothies, shaved ice, and beverages. There is surprisingly a decent amount of seating space inside. I'll def be back to try their other food items!"}
