{"text":"On Erin Mills Parkway just south of the 403, nestled into the \"Michaelangelos\" Plaza, stands  Ido Cafe. An all day brekkie joint that offers decent foods at reasonable prices. The Sandwich selection is quite impressive too. Please note that Ido Cafe now offers Selections of Pho and Vietnamese Grilled Pork dishes. Wow.  
It was about two in the afternoon and \"The Feeding\" was, once again, overwhelming my ability to rationalize. I claw my way into Ido and order the following:  The two egg, sausage, fruit, home fries and toast special. I also added an egg for a buck. Easy with brown I say. To wash that all down with, I also ordered Ido's BLT on Brown. Verdict.  Breakfast was good. Not oily at all.  Home fries were crisp. BLT was yummy too. Nice bacon count. It is so nice when the last bite bite of sandwich still has a crazy amount of bacon in it. So go my fellow Yelpers.  Support your local small businesses.  Peace!"}
{"text":"I'm always in search of hole-in-the-wall type breakfast places and this one hit the jackpot. So cheap (2 eggs, generous helping of fruit, meat, homefries, toast and 2 pancakes for $10), tasty with great service. It was perfect and I will be back for sure.  It feels so great supporting local businesses while enjoying delicious meals!"}
{"text":"Great place to come get all day breakfast or even brunch on the weekend.  

The prices are not too bad, I mean 6.99 for breakfast; eggs, bacon, home potatoes, toast, fruits and pancakes. They also have cheaper deals. You also have the option to pay before or after of course. They have a good spread of sandwiches, If you're looking for that. The staff here are nice. The location is great I think, there's not too many cafés like this around this area. If you can't find it, it's in the same plaza as the Michael Angelo's. If your looking for a refill on coffee you pay for it but the third refill is free. The cafe is small but cute, try it!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this café in maybe 10 years. We ate here once or twice before when I believe it was called Irene's Café.

The menu is standard breakfast/lunch fare. There was also a big sign that said to try their new Vietnamese items, such as pho (with beef or beef balls), rice with fried egg and chicken or pork and vermicelli with grilled pork.

We had to stand at the counter to order, but then were told to sit down and they'd bring our dishes to us. We also didn't have to pay until after we ate.

Our food was delivered within a few minutes and was piping hot.

My son and I had the same dish, 2 fried eggs, bacon, homefries and fruit. We asked them to hold the toast. The eggs were a perfect sunny side up and the bacon was crisp. The homefries were okay, nothing special. The fruit was 2 orange wedges, 2 cubes of canteloupe and 2 cubes of honedew. All in all, it was pretty good. 

My husband had the vermicelli with grilled pork. It came with the usual nuoc cham dipping sauce, but we had to ask for Sriracha to spice it up. He said the grilled pork was good and he liked that there was lots of lettuce and cucumber. There wasn't any pickled daikon or carrot and no bean sprouts either. He said the whole dish was pretty tasty.

The prices were good ($30 for all three, including tax).

I think we'll probably return here for breakfast in the future."}
