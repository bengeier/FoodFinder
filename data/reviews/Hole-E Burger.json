{"text":"Yesterday I took my two sons (teenagers) to try this place. None of us finished our burgers!  All we could taste was salt! $60 for four burgers and sodas and we went to eat something straight from there. Will NEVER be back there again! Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Like some people have already stated, the food is a little pricey and a little greasy but I would say this is in my top 5 burgers in Toronto.  I had the skirt burger, quality meat and toppings. Large portions of fries and their gravy is really, really tasty.  Much like a South Street Burger or other gourmet burger places, you do have to wait a bit as everything is made to order, so don't think you can run in and out in 2 or 3 minutes.  All in all, have recommended it to all my friends and would definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"I had the Cesar Salad with chicken and it was a very, very good salad. It was thoroughly coated with vinaigrette, had crunchy croutons and bacon bits, and the chicken was breaded and delicious. My friend had the Canadian burger and it tasted great with mushrooms and BBQ sauce. Would definitely go again.  The AC inside was a bit too cold for us so we sat outside."}
{"text":"Overpriced, and fairly tasteless. I ordered the \"kitchen sink\" but found it to lack on taste. It was bland. It also cost me almost 13 bucks and while they prepared it, I was subjected to some punk rock headbanging music playing on the overhead speakers. Not an overall great experience or meal."}
{"text":"Dropped in here for lunch today and was very pleased with the quality, taste and ambience of this burger joint. You definitely come out full and satisfied. The burger that I had had pulled pork and coleslaw on it. Not the type of burger that you would add traditional toppings too. It tasted great.  They also carry a nice selection of very traditional soda pop in glass bottles. Haven't seen that in years. Friendly staff and would definitely recommend if you are hungry and looking for something that is satisfying."}
{"text":"Went here with a buddy who lives in the area when we were looking for some supper. Both of us got the Nacho Burger he got regular fries and I got Nona's Fries. We were expecting some spice in the burgers because of the chilli and deep fried jalapeños but were both disappointed.   After a couple of bites I looked at burger and noticed how dry it was and after the first few bites it became harder to eat the burger. I finished it and it was simply not sitting well in my stomach.   The fries I should mention were quite good. Not stupendous but still well above average.   Would I recommend this place to a friend? Nope. Go one subway stop in either direction and you have way better options."}
{"text":"Overall rating :3.75 Good place for a burger in the area. imho better than burger priest. Repeat: likely"}
{"text":"Saw a new burger joint on my walk today and decided to pop in! I'm so happy I did. I was greeted by very friendly staff who informed me that the location was brand new and won't be opening for another week, however they are testing out menu items and would like feedback! I sat down with a few friends. We were brought tons of delicious free items to try! My favourites were the Nona fries, and the Nacho burger (best burger I've ever had)!   I can't wait for the location to open so I can explore the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Really dense patty. Nice tasting burger.   Everything looks just like the advertising. Thick egg bun  etc: I had the skirt burger, which seemed over-the-top (it's their most basic menu burger). Next time I would just build my burger with cheese and bacon. It's pricey as mentioned by other reviewers, but it's a substantial burger and the fries portions are generous.  Nice and friendly staff."}
{"text":"So glad to have this place in the hood.  The other location didn't have great reviews so I was skeptical, but thought it was worth a try.  The verdict?  Fantastic.  No longer do I have a reason to hike up to The Burger's Priest up at Lawrence.  These burgers are huge, greasy and exploding with flavour.  I'm not much of a food critic so I'll not try to break down the few burgers I've had but if big greasy burgers are your thing you owe it to yourself to try this place.  It's just a shame places like this aren't licensed, although I guess you'd have people hanging around too long.  I get mine to go and have them with a beer at home."}
{"text":"I have been to Coxwell location which is reason I stopped here but as learned Hole E is chain burger spot well it has only 3 location but the owner here are different have something different but i didnt feel that  I was still a great burger so that wasnt an issue and I dont know if was the fact I have breakfast a few hours before but it was filling burger."}
{"text":"Felt sorry for your team at Yonge because of the inside temperature, but I can't help it so it shouldn't have effect on how you interact with customers.  There are many other places to get good food and drinks where I feel welcome no matter how the temperature is..."}
{"text":"Sadly, disappointed. I tried the burger with pulled pork the standard toppings. The burger was flavourless and felt a little over cooked. The pulled pork was barley pulled and had zero bbq sauce on it. The bbq sauce is just topped in the burger, as ketchup would be. The coleslaw atop the burger was very typical but was actually the best part about the whole burger. Sweet potato fries were good, very over priced, almost 7$. A takeout lunch of burger, fries & a drink totalled up to just over $20. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Quick review: STAFF was friendly and helped me make my selection as it was my first time here. DECOR was fine.  Like most 'gourmet' burger places. Though they should do something about their condiment/napkin/drink set-up.  Definitely needs work.  Nice little patio area. FOOD was good, not great.  I had the Hole-E Smoke Burger.  Very big, but the pulled pork on top could've been a bit better.  Tons of fries.     PRICE... too high in my opinion, but I guess this is what the gourmet burger places do now (4.99 to turn it into a combo?!).  $15ish in total for the combo.  Kinda ouch, but not unexpected.   3.25 out of 5 (It was good enough to get me to try this place again at a future date.)"}
{"text":"Not a bad burger but it was super greasy. I had the skirt burger which was a mess to eat. It was just dripping in oil and fat. $10 just for the burger. Very filling but man did I feel guilty eating it. Can't say it was anything super special. The cheese skirt was very interesting, crunchy and crispy! I liked that alot. My friend got some of their fries which was really bland. Needed to be seasoned alot!   Great thing is they have a small patio so you can sit outside and have everyone watch you stuff your face and make a fool out if yourself. Thumbs up to that!"}
{"text":"I got Hole-E Nacho Burger. I ate half of it before throwing it out. Yikes, some parts of the beef patty were pink. I didn't really like the cheese skirt. I couldn't taste any chili or fried jalapeño rings either. Overall, the burger was super greasy. For $10 a burger, even if it were a $5 burger, I wouldn't go back there again."}
{"text":"The Hol-E smoke burger was very good - I particularly liked the coleslaw, but the Nona Fries were literally dripping in butter/grease. I'm not normally one to shy away from excess fat, but I couldn't even finish them because of a) the guilt and b) they were pretty soggy and meh."}
