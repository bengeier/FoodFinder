{"text":"Simple, cool and great coffee/food... Can't ask for much more. Excellent service! I had the English Egg Sammy with with Avocado and tomato ... I skipped the cheese - It was super tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Good coffee and great breakfast sandwich. The English muffin that made the sandwich was about twice the size of a normal English muffin. However, I tried a pretzel and the pretzel sticks and they were not good. They look beautiful and smell like proper pretzels, but they are tough and mealy."}
{"text":"The chorizo scramble in a wrap was delicious.  Staff was really friendly and accommodating.  The cookies looked really good but I didn't try one because they were just sitting out on the counter by the register.  Not sure why they don't have one of those clear plastic pastry covers on them. (Think subway sneeze guard) Overall 5 stars and I will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"this place...so good! The guys working are incredibly friendly. We're new to Arizona and they were quick to welcome our business. Their food---all flavor. loved it. The onion roll on the breakfast sandwich is amazing. Nice touch! And the coffee is great. The cold brew has a nice chocolate flavor to it :) yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Okay. Seriously. This place is so good. Haven't had a day off in over 2 months with my husband and this morning he took me to Be. I wasn't too hungry and was only going to coffee. 
 
Let me start off by saying this place is a little different. Half museum, half kitchen, half coffee eatery. We told the lady at the counter we were new and she helped us out with the coffee. Having done some research my hubs ordered the egg sandwich and a lemonade. I got a mocha...and at the last second a warm pretzel. 

Sat down after checking out the art on the walls. Coffee came out first. Simple and delicious. Then our food. The pretzel was a great last minute call, nice and crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. It seemed to have a light honey touch with nice big salt on the outside. Perfect sweet and salty. With a whole grain mustard. SO GOOD!!! And the egg sandwich....all the right flavors. Sometimes when you make it yourself, you think, how could I eff it up...and then it's not as good as you imagined...stop and go to Be. The egg sandwich is one of the best I've ever had. MUNSTER cheese...SOLD! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Great coffee.  Nice physical location.  The food menu is a little bit thin... but then you remember that they are a coffee shop... so expecting anything more than the scrambled eggs they offer is because your expectations are out of whack.... 

great services as well..."}
{"text":"I'm picky and this is the greatest breakfast sandwich I've had in my life. Perfectly cooked eggs, the ideal onion roll - I dream about these sandwiches and go way out of my way to get them as frequently as possible."}
{"text":"There are lots of great places for coffee in Phx, but I always end up here. Guess it's my favorite"}
{"text":"We had the Be Sammy add ham and grilled cheese add ham and both were delicious. The Be Sammy didn't come with a side, but grilled cheese came with chips. 

It is in a great atmosphere and next to an art gallery and cactus shop. Both great to wonder around in.

The coffee and baked goods were also delicious. This was a great find!"}
{"text":"Great place for the riders. Nice people and food. Not crowd. Outside table is awesome."}
{"text":"I lIve next door to this place. I've walked over to get coffee on THREE separate occasions, and ALL THREE TIMES they had me waiting over 10 minutes for an americano. This past trip I was the ONLY COFFEE ORDER. A bunch of lazy, millennial, worthless kids workin there, usually 3 at a time, all on their phones. AVOID. GO TO JOBOT."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've had anywhere especially for a ham and egg and cheese muffin. It's a meal all by itself recommend it to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Awesome food, the grilled cheese can't be beat! The atmosphere was great. The parking very easy!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The cold brew coffee is will change your world. The skinny vanilla latte is probably the best I've ever had. These baristas know their way around some beans. Also, if TJ is there, you will be happy. His smile is legit infectious. Food is on point, too. Definitely you must check it out"}
{"text":"Wow, yum!  The English egg may be the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had.  The English muffin (house made?) combined with the muenster cheese, giant pile of scrambled eggs and healthy dab of mayo was simply astounding!  Next time we find ourselves in Phoenix, this is a definite stop.  And I just loved that it was right next to an adorable little shop, I think it was called The Bosque. All around a great experience."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today.  I really enjoyed the salad with pistachios and a delicious vinaigrette dressing and topped with grated cheese.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, the best coffee (and I'm from Seattle), great service, and TJ is super welcoming. We had the be Sammy and the Avocado and Tomato -- both were very tasty. They hit the spot. Had to get a cookie for the road -- also delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of town and needed somewhere for breakfast. Came in here and it was amazing!!! My coffee was a tad cold and the made me a whole new one, fantastic service ten out ten would come here again. Egg sandwich to die for."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and quick service. Chorizo and eggs scrambled was great. My wife loved her latte. Reasonable prices, cheap compared to San Diego prices. Thanks Phoenix."}
{"text":"Every. Single. Time. 

Absolutely any time I am in Phoenix I get to this art/food/nursery/COFFEE little piece of Heaven ASAP!

The servers are always super friendly, and full of suggestions, and the Vibes are some serious icing on the cake. 

What an unbelievably cool coffee shop full of some great baristas in an incredibly cool building!"}
{"text":"SMH, you let me down yelp. This is not really a breakfast place, it's more an art studio with 4 food item choices and poor quality of food. Had the chorizo scramble which was more like scrambled eggs and cut up hotdog. If you are looking for a restaurant, keep looking is my advice."}
{"text":"Still My favorite coffee!!! My family and I come once a month! Love this place and their cool atmosphere. It's a far drive from my house but so worth the drive."}
{"text":"This nice little cafe sits at the entrance of a co op building called monarchid. Cool open space and energetic 90s esque hip hop accompanied by breakfast of the English egg Sammy (ham and egg on English muffin) and a caramel iced latte. 

There sandwich is decently filling and tastes fresh without being overly salty. I got the latte on the barrister's recommendation for a sweet drink and that was good too. It seems that they do traditional coffees as well if you are into that.

Friendly service and good food makes this a place worth trying out."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We had the chorizo egg scramble and the avocado, tomato, muenster and egg sandwich. Both were truly great. 

Great space in a cool building with an art gallery and plant store. 

The staff was incredibly friendly. 

Enjoy it and say hello to TJ and Troy!"}
{"text":"I inhaled my breakfast sandwich, which goes to tell you how bomb dot comb it was! I ordered the ham + Muenster sammy and it was overall DEVINE. My favorite part of it all was purely the bread, the English muffin; it was just so good I want the recipe to try to recreate at home, hahaha. Visited Phoenix, Arizona for a business trip and we had to grab food before heading back to California so it was a great decision to eat here and experience such an amazing atmosphere. If ever back in Phoenix, definitely a go to spot for breakfast!!! :-)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is AWESOME! If you like art scenes, mellow vibes, awesome music then this is your place for good eats! It is clean, the staff are great and look like they love their job! (And that's hard to find these days) I had an iced latte with almond milk with the Avo Breakfast Sammy on the English muffin while my friend had a caramel cappuccino with the chorizo scramble. They were absolutely AMAZING! The best part was knowing things were local and stayed to the roots of being a homegrown place! Definitely coming back to this place and looking forward to getting some homemade Nutella added to my coffee or the blackberry ginger green tea! Super excited about visiting Roosevelt Row more often!"}
{"text":"The food was at the perfect temperature and was served quickly. It was very delicious. The servers and all staff are very friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"Best latte I have ever tasted.  Food was legit as well.  Super chill atmosphere, friendly staff, good music.  If you are in PHX you must stop through."}
{"text":"The English Egg Sammy is amazing. I've had it several times and it never fails. There's something about the English muffin that just ties everything together. Also, the iced chai is fantastic and is my new favorite chai in town. I have yet to try their toasts, they look delicious as well."}
{"text":"Such a fun, quirky place to grab some coffee or brekky. Super friendly, personable staff. Very reasonably priced - a big delish brekky sammy was only $6 :) Really chill, relaxed ambience. Come grab a bite and stay a while :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town for a friend's wedding and decided to spend a day seeing what's in Arizona. The breakfast sandwiches here were one of our favorite parts of the trip. Service is excellent! Very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Breakfast sandwich English Egg Sammy with avo and ham is simply DELISH! A must try! New favorite breakfast place, awesome place!"}
{"text":"Don't get the eggs and chorizo. Anyone could make it better. Spicy cold brew also is pretty darn bad. Way to sweet for my taste. Cool vibes though."}
{"text":"This is a nice unassuming place to relax, unwind and eat or drink. I can't order a \"6th grader\" because that's not right but if I order the turkey sandwich they'll know what I mean! They have a variety of seating options, club chairs, sofa, tables..
Very comfortable! My son had the Chorizo Scramble and loved it, the eggs were cooked to perfection and it was served piping hot. He lives across the street so I'll be here frequently and can't wait to try some of the breakfast sandwiches. 
Each time I've been here I've been impressed with the friendliness of the staff and cleanliness of the entire restaurant. I have it on pretty good authority the cookies are the best! I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I come here every week with my family for some good coffee and just tried their English Egg Sammy . It was amazing!!!  I highly decoy his place for their chill atmosphere, wonderful staff, and amazing products"}
{"text":"This used to be songbird coffee house (which relocated). And these guys somehow have made this place even better than songbird. 

Excellent coffee. 
Extremely friendly staff. 
Absolutely delicious sandwiches. Must try the egg and cheese sandwich. 

A great addition to the neighborhood. This is our go to spot for breakfast and coffee on the weekends."}
{"text":"What a cool place!!!

The staff was amazing, their spicy cold brew was unreal (maybe the best I have had), and the food was great. They introduce themselves and call you by name. Truly a special spot. 

From the moment you walk in you feel at home. They have a shop to buy airplants and succulents and an art gallery in the back. All very well kept up.

5 star!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a breakfast sandwich prior to heading out for a hike. The indoor space here is so cool. Lots of different areas to sit in, plenty of space for large groups. It wasn't busy when we got there but it was pretty early in the morning. My husband and I both got a breakfast sandwich which were huge! Definitely could have shared one but I'm not a huge portion person for breakfast. One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had in a while! Their cold brew was good, my husband got a chamomile tea I believe which was also good. You can get things to go too if you need to be quick. There isn't outdoor seating that I saw. Parking is on the street but also around the back. We had no trouble getting a spot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wandered in after hitting up the Phoenix Public Market last week. He got a macchiato and I had an iced chai, both with almond milk (thank you for offering it!). We were hungry, so he had the breakfast sandwich and I had the chorizo scramble.

Everything was so, so good. You can tell the food and drink are made with high-quality ingredients. Whoever does the food KNOWS how to cook scrambled eggs, and how to subtly use seasoning. The staff were friendly and gave us plenty of space. I love that the little succulent store is inside the building, for you to browse the plants after you're done eating. Bonus points for the adorable boxer hanging out inside!

Reasonable pricing for what you get. Initially we thought the portions were a little small, but we could barely finish our food-- which is what happens when you eat a quality, nutrient-dense meal!

I could definitely see myself returning to study or get some work done. The environment is quiet and relaxing, more so than most Starbucks locations nowadays."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! The tall brown boy with the arm tattoo (cross) is the best at making coffee. & great breakfast sandwiches. 10/10!"}
{"text":"I was so surprised by all the coffee options in downtown Phoenix! A friend and I landed on this place and we were not disappointed! We parked in the side lot, took pictures by the wings and bird mural, saw the cute directional sign, and then went inside! The coffee was great as was the toast. The whole wheat bread was worth the $4 alone! But I got banana, Nutella, and sea salt. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I asked for a caramel macchiato and got a caramel latte. It was too milky for me to taste the espresso but I did appreciate the caramel was flavorful and not too sweet or syrupy. I think it was housemade. We ordered chorizo scramble and a breakfast egg sammy. It took 20 minutes to make (we had the only food orders) and they forgot to put it in to go containers as requested. Both were okay. The sammy is definitely sizeable but not a lot of flavor. I got the one with avocado and there was minimal avocado in it. The scramble chorizo is not heavy as expected - in a good way. I like the vibes here and what they are trying to offer but alas, they never hit the nail on the head."}
{"text":"I love this place and am so glad it's within walking distance of ASU's downtown campus. Their breakfast sandwiches sound so simple but are just so good!!! The coffee is fantastic too, I like the spicy cold brew and Nutella latte. 
Be is housed in a cool unique space that features a shop and a gallery. It's also a nice (relatively) quiet place to work or study. Definitely my favorite place to kill time in between classes. 
Staff is always very friendly and helpful too! Parking kinda sucks but that is to be expected downtown."}
{"text":"Really amazingly good breve latte!  And the avocado and tomato egg sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, laid back atmosphere.  Wait staff is attentive and accommodating...our go-to place...thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I came to AZ for surgery, heading back to CALI hopped on yelp and found this place.  5 stars good reviews so I had to check for myself.  Delicious food,great smiles and good music.  Definitely a good establishment and I highly recommend the Avo Tomato on sourdough.  Vanilla iced coffee was delicious and the gave me a ticket for a free coffee in the future.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"This place had a very cool vibe and the employees are very nice! Wasnt a huge fan of the coffee i ordered but i would come back one day"}
{"text":"We were just passing through Phoenix on a road trip and decided to stop in because of all  the rave reviews. We stepped in expecting it to be decent but the egg Sammy's blew us away! I never new a breakfast sandwich could be such a thing of beauty. I also ordered a Caramel macchiato to go along with my breakfast which turned out to be the perfect cherry on top. Next time I'm in town again, I'll def be making it a point to swing by."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick breakfast when my sister was visiting, and we were amazed by the food and prices. We got a breakfast sandwich and toast with mascarpone and jam, which was the perfect amount to share. Everything was super tasty and very reasonably priced, and the employees were all very friendly. The place it's in had a fun vibe, if we had more time we would've explored the gallery and plant/gift shop in the building. Seating is limited, so if you don't like sharing big tables with strangers, maybe take your food to go and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"yummy!   they were very accommodating of my food restrictions and made one of their menu items even better, adding avocado. Very nice people, comfortable atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Great little diamond in the rough. We needed a place to go early this morning while trying to keep my daughter awake for an EEG nearby. The other yelp reviews led us here. 

We had a chorizo scramble, BE Hammy and toast with Nutella, banana and sea salt. We really enjoyed all except the toast. My 8 year old thought it was a bit too salty for her. My husband tried it and agreed it was too salty. 

Our cappuccinos were among the best we've had and we've had them in Italy!  

Decor was very simple contemporary. The art work nearby of the naked woman drew some questions from our daughter but we didn't make a big deal so neither did she. Just a warning tho. 

Thanks!  Enjoyed ourselves a lot."}
{"text":"Thought I would stop in and check this place out. The space inside is really cool... Coffee counter/Art gallery meets airplane hanger meets industrial loft meets hipster hang-out. The inside shows really well, open roof space, showing off old-school bowstring trusses. Lots of professionally presented art. Cool meeting space, cool picnic style tables.
I stepped up to the counter at 10:00 am on a Monday to order a bite to go, wanted the signature eggsammy on English muffin. I was told they were all out of ham (somebody better do that grocery run because lunch starts in an hour).They have maybe 6 or 7 breakfast options, that are really variations of 3 things, sandwich, toast, and oatmeal. Similar thing on the lunch menu).... Anyway they offered turkey, I wasn't down so I selected cup of coffe with ricotta cheese, cherry jam, and MJ toast, (fancy bread from a spclty bakery) order took over 10 min. I felt ripped off, see photo...
One un-toasted pc of Texas toast, with a table spoon of jam and ricotta chese($3.75), and they were out of made coffee...more waiting... 
No ham, no Splenda, solo egg whites are not an option, and no fresh coffee....I hope they figure it all out, because the space wants to be hung out in....."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich on an onion but is delish! I love that bread! We coffee was good too! There's a small art gallery attached that we enjoyed walking around after our meal. Staff was super friendly and overall had a great experience."}
{"text":"Located on 5th and Roosevelt- The employees care about you and make sure you enjoy your meal. They know majority of their customers by name which is pretty cool. The vibe of this place is just awesome; yet alone their breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love trying new coffee shops when I'm visiting Phoenix, so checked out Yelp's latest and greatest. I honestly chose \"Be\" because (no pun intended) for the cute decor and furnishings. 

When I got in the green logo on the cups looked familiar . I didn't know where I had seen it until I sat down and overheard who I think was one of the owners being interviewed by a lady and he explained that they had something to do with Royal at the Market and then it clicked . I think they had those cups there ! 

The cashier / Barista was super friendly and shook my hand when meeting him. My only complaint was that he completely forgot to make our drinks so it took about 10 mins without anyone else ahead of us. He did redeem himself however by giving us free coffee cards for next time for the long wait .

I LOVE the space ! It is shared with Bison leather goods, Monorchid, and a cute succulent place with the calmest Boxer I have ever met . JB Snyder's work is on the wall and ties in the furnishings . So cute . The food also looked fantastic, but I didn't try it ."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop on Roosevelt Row. The atmosphere, coffee, eats and staff are second to none. Located in the same space as Monorchid Gallery and the Bosque, Be Coffee feels like my home away from home, my office, and my favorite meet/hang/chill spot all wrapped up into one."}
{"text":"This is the place for a top-notch breakfast in downtown Phoenix! My wife and I were here for the first time, but not the last. 

The staff are all outstanding, the space is interesting, and it's a happy place to meet nice folks from the neighborhood. 

We loved their top two breakfast sandwiches, one with an English muffin & the other with sourdough.

All superb!!"}
{"text":"By far this place exceeded the expectations noted on reviews. Not only was the food excellent, the service was eceptional.  The manager came out and introduced himself and obviously was very compassionate about food quality and customer experience. I ordered the tomatoe avocado breakfast sandwich and have never had a tastier breakfast sandwhich. You can tell the dish was prepared with only the highest  quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Awesome location, great service, friendly staff, an affordable menu, and my new-favorite cold brew coffee. Be Coffee + Food + Stuff is brand new to the downtown Phoenix and Roosevelt Row scene and has certainly hit the ground running on all cylinders.

I've yet to try any of the food, but it's definitely on my list. I've heard nothing but good things from a number of people that I trust. I'm also familiar with the owners and have experienced their knack for delicious food first-hand.

I mentioned the cold brew: if you're a coffee nerd like I am, you can rest assured knowing that Be Coffee + Food + Stuff uses premium locally-roasted beans and brews the cold brew for a solid 24 hours before serving. And you can tell! It's my new go-to.

The location is small, but it has been laid out really well, providing a surprising amount of space given its size. It's also set within one of the coolest buildings in Phoenix and opens right up into a couple of tiny retail stores and a well-known gallery (open to the public), which makes for a fun visit.

Parking appears somewhat of an issue at first blush, but I was happy to find that there was plenty of free street parking all around the building. E Portland Street, directly behind the building, is your best bet if you can't manage to snag a spot in the lot.

Do yourself a favor and check these guys out if you haven't already had the opportunity to visit. I know I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Great selection of breakfast and lunch sandwiches, as well as fresh pastries.  The coffee menu is good as well, offering blended drinks as well as single origin pour-over.  Neat ambience as you walk in, and ample parking, which is hard to come by on Roosevelt.  Very roomy and open atmosphere.  I had a pour-over and a ham, egg, and cheese breakfast English muffin.  The service was excellent.  My only complaint was that there were onions cooked into the eggs.  Had that been on the menu, I would have ordered my sandwich without it.  It was a bit of a surprise and I couldn't finish my sandwich.  Other than that, not bad."}
{"text":"Great coffee! I had the spicy cold brew with half and half. So yummy! Super friendly baristas!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and decided to take a stroll to Be Coffee + Food + Stuff based on the yummy looking menu and good recommendations. Very cute, industrial style spot serving healthy portions of cold brew. I also ordered the English Avocado + Tomato breakfast sandwich and it was super good. The bread tasted freshly baked and had a hint of sourdough flavor. Everything just hit the spot. 

The service was friendly, and I was happy to have someone come and collect my \"trash\" after I was done (being a first-time visitor I was having mild anxiety over where to put it!). 

My only gripe would be the somewhat limited seating, but it's a small place.

*I was also happy to discover a little plant store, The Bosque Phoenix, that is essentially an extension of the coffee shop. Having a new apt that is very much lacking greenery, it was a fun find. 

Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"The salami sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Goodness gracious. So good."}
{"text":"Hubby & I each had breakfast sandwiches on MJ English muffins-Yummy! Taking 1/2 of my sandwich home.
Fast service..
Love the decor..
Very nice & personable owner.

Definitely will be returning. : )"}
{"text":"Coffee: 4.5 stars
Snacks n such: 4.5 stars
Atmosphere: 5.0 stars

Coffee: 4.5 stars
I returned--and honestly, I've decided this is in my top 5 coffee shops in all of Phoenix. Espresso is delicious, cold brew is refreshing, and their lattes are inventive--what more could you ask for? 

Snacks n such: 4.5 stars
Big fan of their toasts--simple ingredients, but very well chosen. They're connected to a nearby bakery, whose name escapes me, but it's good stuff. Plus their cookies are huge and tasty (a wonderful combination). 

Atmosphere: 5.0 stars
Love the area. Shop is inside a cool space: random art gallery behind it, plant store on one side, craft beer bar adjacent, comfortable couch...me gusta."}
{"text":"This place is the coolest. The employees are all incredibly friendly and know many of the neighborhood regulars by name. From what I understand, all of the syrups and even the nutella is made in house. Also, the English Egg Sammy has got to be one of the best, if not the best, breakfast sandwiches in Phoenix. I can't stay away."}
{"text":"Came by for an afternoon java jolt after lunch at Short Leash up the street. Midday, the atmosphere was quiet with a few people sitting around working on laptops with good background music. The pour over I got was okay, the giant cookies in the pastry case were okay, the service was somewhat disinterested but okay, and the lack of coffee cup sleeves was not ideal, but okay. Perhaps this place is best visited when you can grab a bite to eat, but I found it to be just A-OK."}
{"text":"Relaxing café with great food, amazing coffee, and the BEST COOKIE you will ever eat - ever!! 

I worked with the attached gallery space on a private event, so my team and I got to sample almost everything on the menu. It's all delicious!

The staff is friendly and welcoming - the owners are accommodating and kind. It's just a great place to grab a cup of coffee and a treat!

Seriously though... the cookies!!"}
{"text":"When you want some food that has been made with love, check this place out!  I had the be Sammy sandwich added Ham and Avocado along with a cold Brew and it made my day! The scrambled eggs are like nothing you have tried!"}
{"text":"You could miss this gem if you were not looking for it. It a neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot. While you wait for your food, tour the art displays and the vibes of the environment. Great food!"}
{"text":"stopped by before leaving phoenix and glad we did.

coffee: definitely one of the better tasting chai lattes that i've ever had, and i'm also a sucker for pretty drinks ;)

food: this was probably the best breakfast sandwich i've ever had. i ate the english muffin sammy with eggs, tomato, avocado, and muenster cheese- i could eat this over and over again"}
{"text":"Good vibe. Tasty coffee and delicious food. Our breakfast orders got served to the wrong people. We waited not too long before the staff told us the mistake. They compensated us with free drinks and a cookie and were very apologetic! What a kind gesture! Fantastic customer service. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Cute place. Good coffee. Don't go upstairs. They have artwork in the back but it seems like they only want you in the front area not browsing around. Update: I guess it's a communal space and we dealt with non \"Be Good\" staff. I wanted a cold brew and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Friendly baristas and a great chai latte! I haven't had the food yet, but I'm sure it's great, and will be trying it soon. The only downside is that the parking is mainly street. I suggest checking out The Bosque plant shop that is also located in the space."}
{"text":"I love this little hipster place! They have amazing cold brew and breakfast sandwiches and I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu. The atmosphere is great and even the parking lot in the back is cute and covered in really neat street art. I had the avocado tomato breakfast sandwich last time and it was so tasty and filling and not too pricey either!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and comfy. Came here to spend time with my niece and have a nice conversation about her schooling. Great coffee hangout spot with yummy food."}
{"text":"This really is a perfect taste of the arts district. Everyone was very friendly and the egg Sammy is very good."}
{"text":"Had the Chorizo Scramble and it was on point. It was perfectly season and very tasty. The staff was also very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"A weird location when you walk into the coffee shop; in the back in a large art gallery (that when we were there looked like it was in transition) and a floral/ plant shop to the left. It was pretty busy when my wife and I went there with only a couple large table for sitting and a little amount of bar space; for doing work I would not recommend it because there is little space to spread out and its pretty busy. The coffee (capaccino and ice coffee) were good and reasonably priced. We did not order food though they serve a decent variety that looked tasty."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place since I had been here for First Friday and had loved the space as it was used as an art gallery. I told myself one day I will try their coffee, and I finally did.

Unfortunately, the coffee was not as exciting as the space. I ordered a hot Nutella Latte and the roast was burnt and it didn't even taste like it had Nutella, maybe they didn't put enough? My friend ordered an iced Chai Tea Latte and she didn't like hers that much either. 

On the other hand they did have a great peanut butter cookie with M&M's which was delicious and they had excellent customer service! But since they are marketed as a coffee house and that's their specialty they should improve upon that aspect. So great staff, and cookies, but sub-par coffee."}
{"text":"Great people! Cashier named Troy, introduced himself, offered recommendations, and was just genuinely happy! I walked 10 blocks to get breakfast based on other yelp reviews and it was worth the walk!"}
{"text":"Great shop with VERY nice people working the bar. I was hesitant to go at first, as the reviews, though great, failed to mention the quality of the coffee.

As someone who has an extensive background in coffee, I have traveled to and visited many coffee shops around the world, and the coffee I was served today was superb.

They use different roasters from around the country, and whoever is choosing the beans, has great discretion. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Americano I have had today, so much, I have ordered three of them while I have been here!

The roast of the coffee I am enjoying is a medium roast with great notes.

I have not tried the food, though the smells wafting through the air have tempted me, but everyone seems to enjoy what they are eating and the food looks great.

If you are looking for great coffee, this is the place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I happened to be coming into town for a conference and stopped here for breakfast...best choice of my trip. I asked for their egg/avocado/tomato sammy (even dairy free!) and nearly died and went to heaven eating it, it was so freaking good. That, coupled with a strong iced latte made me forget that I'd been up since 3:30am -- the coffee was smooth and delicious. Enjoyed my little breakfast outside in the sun and had a great start to my day. If you head here, I'm sure you'll feel the same!"}
{"text":"Just had coffee & a brownie, but they were good! Great location- walking distance from museums, etc. Great place to just stop in for a coffee and chill out for a bit."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop downtown, with access to an art gallery, and little plant shop. There is seating inside and outside. You do have to order at the front. The only part is that when you walk in, the Be Coffee is straight ahead and there is a restaurant to your right. Which is a little disorienting. Staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Massive tasty breakfast sandwiches and friendly service! Add the ham to the tomato avocado, delicious!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this adorable little coffee shop! I popped in to get some work done while in the area and had a delicious cold brew with almond milk! To my surprise, the center that the shop is in has so many fun things to explore! There was a free art exhibit basically attached to it and an adorable plant store called The Bosque {I wanted everything in there!}. The service was SO friendly, decor hip, and plenty of seating! I will definitely be back to try out some of their delicious looking breakfast. I've heard the breakfast sandwiches are the bomb.com. 

Thank you for allowing me to work in your cute little coffee + more shop! I'll absolutely be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! My bff and I ordered the same exact thing: drip coffee and the Ham + Muenster breakfast sandwich. They had Cholula hot sauce, which is my fave, so that's always a plus! The coffee was super yummy with all the right fixings at the coffee bar. The sandwich is DAMN good! And the price was right! Less than $10 for the two items and it was well worth it. It's also located in a cool spot adjacent to a plant shop and art gallery. They played dope music too. Chill vibes."}
{"text":"Service is great. Staff super friendly. And awesome artistic vibe here. I love the comfortable couch as well."}
{"text":"Best cup of coffee in Phoenix! Such a beautiful environment, and the nicest workers. So frothy, and flavorful"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this adorable downtown coffee shop!! I had toast with strawberry rhubarb jelly. Holy moly!! Incredible. Never tried it but everyone says the 6th grader sandwich is amazing and if believe it. Very cool environment and inviting. Street parking which stinks but it's downtown, what do you expect! You can walk around a little gallery which is rad! Great place to hang out of just pop by for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing in both customer service and food. I went in today while visiting from out of town. When I walked in, a friendly guy named, Q introduced himself. I appreciate the amount of time he took in explaining the menu to me. 
The spicy cold brew is the most unique coffee I've ever tried-and I mean that in the best way possible. I ordered the Sammy for a breakfast sandwich, and it was an explosion for my taste buds. I definitely disagree with the review who said portion sizes were small, I thought everything was the perfect amount. Also, the apple fritter is probably the best apple fritter I've ever tried. Love the emphasis on keeping things in house and local. There was also fascinating art work on display in the gallery. If you're traveling and looking for all local spot, look no further."}
{"text":"Great independent coffee shop with funky vibe. The lattes were terrific and the food tasty and fresh. We both thoroughly enjoyed our chorizo  scrambles. The modem art added to the atmosphere as did the friendly and helpful staff. The one downside: an overly-base laden club soundtrack that didn't mesh with Saturday morning feel."}
{"text":"Be Coffee is worth the trip. I've been twice with different people and we have enjoyed the breakfast items as well as the coffee.  It's in an eclectic building containing the coffee shop, a restaurant, a nursery (green plants), yoga studio, and an art exhibit. I've had two different coffee drinks, the second was a coffee and root beer drink that was interesting, but I think I would like to have it colder. The staff had been helpful each time. They have fresh baked cookies the size of your head."}
{"text":"Great coffee spot along Roosevelt Way. The coffee shop combines coffee, art and  co-opt office spaces. The owner Wayne sat down and chatted with us as it was our first time visiting and looking around. Very nice man who enlightened us with the Downtown Phoenix history."}
{"text":"Phenomenal cappuccino, and a nearly unbelievably savory ham & muenster breakfast sandwich really set this visit off strong! Really friendly vibe started off with an enthusiastic menu description and welcome handshake.  A must stop!"}
{"text":"One of those rare occasions where you'll find me at a coffee spot.  Not for the coffee (still don't drink coffee), but for the food.  The restaurant space in the MonOrchid (formerly occupied by Songbird) is now run by the staff at Be.  The super positive early reviews and a Saturday morning hankering for a hearty breakfast got me in the door.  Arriving at 7am, I was the first customer of the day.

Just as when Songbird occupied this space, its beautiful.  Comfy couch seating for some, cafeteria style for others, and additional overflow seating upstairs and around the corner in the MonOrchid space.  If you've never been to the MonOrchid I recommend coming by and checking it out at least once.  There's a reason so many weddings and other big groups events are held here.  And the artwork is pretty impressive as well.  But let's get back to Be's business.

Like I said, not a coffee drinker, but I was curious about their breakfast repertoire.  The English Egg Sammy with Ham and Muenster cheese sounded like a good starting point.  To pair it, I went with their Nutella toast (made with MJ Bread from Tammie Coe) with banana and sea salt.  First off, the Sammy is huge (like twice the size of your usual store brand english muffin) and had at least two eggs in there (probably three).  The muenster cheese was a great contrast for the ham as well.  The homemade nutella they make in house for the toast is awesome.  Kinda wish the bread slices were a little bigger, but no complaints about the nutella whatsoever.

Total price for the Sammy, the Nutella Toast, water and tax came to about $14.  Perhaps a little steep, though I can't complain about the quality of the ingredients or the super friendly staff.  Like a lot of coffee houses, this is the sort of place you could just relax and spend hours here mingling, studying, or even just taking in the aesthetics of the building itself.  And hey if the early reviews are any indication, the coffee must be good too.  I'm just glad to find a coffee spot with more than just great coffee."}
{"text":"So amazing! Went in because I was looking for all day breakfast and I was treated by the nicest barista ever named TJ. He took my order and as I waited I looked around and saw that they had an art gallery and a little plant shop. It was so fun to look around and see all they had. Once I got my food and left the same barista waved me goodbye. They have a good student discount so not only was it reasonable but delicious as well. I can't wait to go back and have it be my new spot to hang out and do my homework."}
{"text":"Lovely early morning spot in the Roosevelt Arts District. Yogis are coming in as you sip on your Metropolis coffee beverage. There's even a young man meditating before he picks up his iced coffee and Sammy. I checked into the office email in between bites of my English Egg Sammy with avocado, muenster, scrambled egg and garlic mayo. The staff are delightful. You should be here this Monday morn too, starting the week off right."}
{"text":"One of THE best (if not my absolute favorite now) coffee shops in town!!! I hate that I rarely ever get to downtown to check out the amazing places, but on the rare occasion I do, I always Yelp my way around... Which is how I found Be. 

I'm always sold when reviewers say the coffee is amazing, so I just had to try it for myself. Found Be (altho I almost drove past it), parked and went inside, and was happily greeted by the baristas -- as if I was a long-time friend they hadn't seen in a while. After a quick pit-stop to the little girls room (which was a reason to wander around the venue, and let me just say AWESOME venue! They were actually setting up for a wedding; so cool!), TJ was so kind as to go over their menu, and explain the intoxicating, mouth-watering smell that was enveloping me and getting my tummy grumbling -- it was their breakfast sammies. With the way it smelled, I could not pass one up! I ordered for the English Egg Sammy with avocado, tomato, Muenster, and turkey. And of course, a latte -- I never pass on liquid gold! TJ explained that they make their own sauces in-house! What?! How awesome is that?! I, of course, opted for some caramel in my latte. (Great choice, btw, if you're wondering.)

As I was about to pay, the cookies hanging out by the register were taunting me... So I showed them better than to taunt me; I'll eat you if you taunt me, cookie! Yes, I got a cookie too -- a peanut butter M&M one. (These are all made in-house too. And made with love... Per the gentlemen working. Thanks guys!) 

While waiting for my Sammy and coffee, I plopped myself down on the couch to relax for a bit. Most comfy couch EVERRR!!! And got to chat with a couple of girls sitting on the couch as well... Super nice ppl at Be! 

Then the Sammy and coffee were ready and I sat at the table to eat. Oh Em Gee! The Sammy was incredibly tasty! And the coffee... Wow! Where do I even begin?! So bold and flavorful that with the first sip your tastebuds get lost in the rich creamy-ness of the deliciously perfectly roasted and brewed coffee. If you're reading this, go get some coffee at Be... You'll taste what I'm talking about! 

As I was finishing my Sammy, I realized I hadn't gotten my cookie. I asked TJ where my cookie was and he apologized for not giving me one... And to make it up to me (not that he needed to), he let me pick out my cookie from the tray of freshly baked cookies. (Great customer service! Thanks, TJ!!!) I picked one that was thicker so it would be half-baked to perfection... And indeed it was cookie perfection!

As I left, I thanked TJ and the other guys working (sorry, I didn't get your names but you were all awesome!!!) for the awesome food, coffee, and exceptional service... and told them I'd be back soon, even though it means me driving 45mins one-way. Yes, it's THAT good!!!"}
{"text":"Great cold brew! Tried this spot for my first time today. Friendly owners and great tasting coffee. They have soft serve ice cream which was vanilla bean flavor. I look forward to sampling other items on the menu. I would of given 5-stars but parking is not convenient. 3 meters to park at across the street or good luck finding a spot!"}
{"text":"great local downtown business they were super friendly and had mad skills with the food they served it was a lovely experience, this is why i use yelp to find amazing places like this..."}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning on our way to the opposite side of town. This is a great place for an amazing cup of coffee! We got the \"Spicy White Chick\". It is a spicy cold brew with white chocolate. It was amazing! We also purchased a regular cold brew with coconut milk and caramel. It was delicious as well. The apple fritters were huge and delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Employees do not know how to listen and show no empathy when they incorrectly make a order."}
{"text":"Super cool brunch place! I met a friend down here because of the good reviews on Yelp. I ordered the Be Sammy with turkey which was pretty yummy with their mayo sauce and avocado. Seriously, anything with avocado makes me drool. They have a good selection of coffees, i.e. Drip, pour over, latte, etc. It was cute and small, sat at the long table with other random people which was just fine cuz everyone was really friendly. You can even walk a few steps around the corner and check out the art gallery. I think it's part of first Fridays as well. 

It's pretty hipster and you'll find a lot of different types of people here. Good food/sandwich and coffee was on point. I also loved that we didn't have to wait an hour in line to get seated like a lot of brunch spots on a Saturday morning. I only gave it a 4star cuz it didn't have the biggest selection but I could definitely see myself coming back to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Be Coffee during my three day stay in Phoenix. It was within walking distance from my airBnB, so I was jazzed that I was going to have some place to snag some good coffee. Be is so much more than good coffee, they offer an awesome hang space, as well as some delicious food. 
I walked in and was greeted by a very kind woman with an awesome hair cut. We chatted and I told her I was from out of town. She was very welcoming and her service was outstanding. Their spicy iced coffee was fantastic. It was slightly sweetened, but not enough to put off the taste. If I ever find my way back to Phoenix, I will definitely be paying another visit."}
{"text":"Really tasty breakfast sandwich on onion roll. Excellent coffee. Nice chair and a small art show to walk through after. Very nice."}
{"text":"This shit was the bomb! My family and I each had the avocado, tomato, egg sandwich! 
Yes lawd! You know I'm going back! Tomorrow"}
{"text":"Stopped into this coffee shop for coffee and breakfast before heading to the airport.  I heard it was a cool space with fun art, but the day I was there they were changing over the art work, but the food was good enough to earn 5 stars in my book.  The staff were really friendly and the food/drinks came out hot and fast.

Upon walking in, I saw someone eating something that I HAD to have.  I found out it was the Avo Tomato.  I added Turkey because thats what the guy was eating when I came in, and I was very happy to.  This sandwich was MASSIVE and awesome.  The english muffin it came on I think was an MJ English Muffin, and I found out MJ was a lady who made them.  They were a million times better than Thomas' and I wish I lived in Arizona so I could eat this for breakfast more than once.  

Got an Americano and it was on point.  I later walked down the block and got another Americano, and this one was way better."}
{"text":"First timer and the employees helped me pick out something id like and it turned out to be the best coffee ive ever tasted. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Wow - this place is truly amazing!  We stopped in this morning to grab a cup of tea and ended up staying for breakfast and a sweet treat!  First off, the staff is so super friendly - thanks to TJ and team for making us feel so welcome!  We both ordered the English Egg Sammy and it was like no other breakfast sandwich I have have eaten - super fresh english muffin (the best), eggs with herbs and onions, a thin slice of ham and muenster cheese...absolute perfection!  I enjoyed a nicely brewed lemon chamomile tea with my amazing sandwich and took a little extra to go with me.  We were also tempted by the amazing chocolate chip cookies that were begging us to buy one when we ordered.  Boy, am I glad we did - it was seriously one of the best cookies I have ever eaten.  I knew it would be good when the staff wouldn't let us leave until we each took a bite as they wanted to see our expression!  They were freshly baked that morning and it was so evident in their fresh, amazing taste.

I can't recommend this place enough...truly worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best latte's I've ever had in my life...which is saying a lot because I'm a huge coffee drinker. The service here is wonderful and gave great recommendations. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love the staff recommendations for trying a new breakfast sammie! Service was superb! Loved the iced coffee and ambience of this open concept spot!"}
{"text":"Found this spot while walking Downtown Phoenix looking for breakfast. Ordered the English Egg Sammy and the house made Nutella toast. Best breakfast I've ever had. Must stop to eat at this spot!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and came across the place for breakfast. Very, very good! Had some of the Apple Fritter, and the kids also had the Nutella Toast. Homemade Nutella! I had the Be Sammy which is an absolute must and the Pour Over and Cold Brew were great! Had a sip of the Chai Tea Latte which I normally don't like but this one tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"A nice little place with good ambiance and music. Ordered the Avocado + Tomatoe Sandwich. They have fair prices. Sandwich and large cold brew was $10. 

Parking lot is directly behind them. Downsides are: not a lot of free parking and they have 2 gluten free options. 

Overall, I'd come back! Worth the trip, especially since they serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"I had the Be Sammy, which is in the top 2 best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had. My wife had the grilled cheese. (Well, she ate one half and I ate the other.) It was so flavorful!! The fact that everything is made fresh, but doesn't take forever to prepare is a plus. Definitely a place to stop, when you are in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Stopped here for one of my lunch adventures. I was not disappointed with this cute coffee shop. I asked for a caramel macchiato and received a delicious hot cup of greatness. The service was great, the cashier introduced himself which made the atmosphere so welcoming. I will be back, especially since it's a 2 minute walk from my office!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with some friends or just studying. It's a very hipster'y place with great toast! I got their cherry mascarpone toast and it's worth dying for. Their whole grain bread that they use is wholesome and will definitely goes perfectly with the drink you order here. I got their OJ, but I bet their coffee is great as well. Great customer service. Would recommend for anyone looking for a good place to study or meet up with some friends!"}
{"text":"Very limited seating, but worth it. The avo English sandwich was delicious. The apple fritter was tasty. Reasonably priced and ambiance is fun. The music is rather loud, which is fun but not great for conversation."}
{"text":"Just found out about Be Coffee and that they took over the coffee shop space in MonOrchid.  Stopped in to try it out today.  Excellent coffee.  The menu looks great too with breakfast and lunch sandwiches. I will try those next time though.  The space maintains the modern industrial look which I love and the music flows smoothly with energy.  Great to have another coffee shop to spend time in downtown."}
{"text":"I've come here twice, and on both occasions, I was treated with a lot of respect. The workers are very friendly and calm despite the sometimes long lines. The coffee isn't the best, but it is by no means bad. The lemonade is fantastic! Overall, I would recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yuuuuuuum! This place was recommended to me by a friend and it was love at first bite. Don't be put off that they don't have a huge selections for breakfast. Their breakfast sandwiches are just perfect! Simple egg muffin sandwich with cheese, meat, and avocado. But this sandwich is huge, it's like an egg mcmuffin on steroids. Their lattes are also really good! Cute spot with some artwork next door and everyone is always friendly."}
{"text":"Came here after an early flight. The food: avocado, cheese and egg sandwich was well made and a good price! However, the food did take a while to get to me (a little over 20 minutes) when they were not busy at all. 
The coffee was also well brewed. Would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I really loved the ambient and the staff, I was there with some friends and we all loved the place. Food was good, not the greatest selection but I was able to eat a nice gluten free portion of scrambled egg with chorizo. I would go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now, and have told myself to write a review probably each time, but forget. Today, though, I took my boyfriend for the first time. About half way through he looked up at me and said \"my love, this sandwich is soooo good, it makes me want to cry,\" and his eyes began to water!! Haha we both had the \"be Sammy\" with turkey, it scores every time. My one and almost a half year old loved it too. The place is super chill, really friendly, good tunes, and always good vibes. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went for a morning bike ride and we decided we wanted coffee. Did a quick search on Yelp and this place was close by and looked fun. The English Egg Sammy, the apple fritter and iced Carmel lattes were all AMAZING! Selena was very nice and cool, too. Also, Check out the art!"}
{"text":"Coffee was good and made to order. Recommendations from TJ were spot on. I had the chorizo scramble and was delicious. Wife had the ham and munster sammy, very good flavor profile was very nicely balanced. I Could've used more heat on the scramble but you can always ad with some cholula which was accessible..  The guys were super friendly and accommodating and everything was clean!"}
{"text":"I really don't want to over post, but my recent experience was absolutely fabulous. As always I am welcomed in, greeted really politely and nicely, and not only was I greeted by name but they went out of their way to make sure it was spelled right without being asked. What I was looking forward to was another iced American splash of soy morning, and I got that and more. I'm dying.

Also really cute girl with overalls and a cool haircut, you're aesthetic is legendary"}
{"text":"Dropped by at 6am and was delighted by the friendly service and charming decor.  This place rocks! Get the cold brew and a breakfast sandwich. Both were simple, high quality, and delicious. They out a lot of love into their food and coffee here."}
{"text":"Must stop in downtown Phoenix. They have delicious food items, out of this world lattes and an art studio to browse while waiting and a plant store. This is a great place to stop to get fueled up and enjoy some culture. The employs genuinely pay attention to you and help you get the perfect order. Love this place. It will be one of my first stops when I visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"This place I discovered on Maps just trying to find some local coffee. And I'm so glad me and my sister dropped in! We got classic macchiatos which we've never had before, it was a shock because we were expecting an ice coffee like Starbucks but oh my, they were delicious! We also got a yummy breakfast Sammy! Thanks to all that helped us on our first time here, Qyu and Connor! Thank you for helping us :) we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Be is so rad! So many coffee shops have a \"we're better than you\" vibe, but this place does not AT ALL, and everything on the menu is delicious. My two favorites are the apple fritter and the Be Sammy. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm rarely compelled to write a review, but to say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. I decided to grab the avo, tomato, avocado and turkey breakfast sammy on English muffin as a last resort, expecting a medicore as best sandwich (as one would from a low key coffee shop) but I was blown away. The sandwich was ENORMOUS (two of us shared it and we're plenty full) and every bite bursted with flavor. Do yourself a favor and stop in to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by here for a breakfast bite. We ordered the English Egg Sammy and the Chorizo Scramble, both of which were pretty amazing. The sandwich is actually one of the best I've had and quite possibly the heaviest. The scramble was good but I think the portion was a bit insufficient. My boyfriend was still hungry after finishing it. Therefore we ordered an apple cinnamon fritter (?) and the spicy cold brew. The gentleman at the cashier who is a friend of the owner (who was AWESOME, super witty and hilarious) recommended the cinnamon fritter and quite honestly I wasn't terribly impressed. Overall, the coffee is great, the atmosphere chill and hipster-y, and it's attached to a restaurant and an art gallery which just means you get to enjoy the beautiful artwork while you wait for your food. For free! Absolutely recommend anyone and everyone to stop by."}
{"text":"Make sure you get the spicy cold brew! I'm obsessed with it! The staff is always very friendly and they make great recommendations. It's my favorite stop on my walk to work"}
{"text":"Best egg sandwich I've ever had. Lots of fresh avocado and empty munster cheese..delicious"}
{"text":"OK their name is really silly.  However the MJ sammy, add tomato and avocado, is the best breakfast sandwich in the Valley BAR NONE."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick coffee, I would go back again if it came up but I thought the service was on the slow side and there was an off odor in the air. Granted, I am from California and I noticed that most stuff in Phoenix is slow for some reason. Not fantastic, but not horrible either. Worth it to try out as the ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"The best egg sandwiches in downtown Phoenix hands down. Perfectly cooked egg, you'll want to come back again for another one! The menu is small but quality and the homemade lemonade is delicious. The staff is really friendly and there's a shaded little patio that's perfect to sit out on in the morning hours."}
{"text":"The Avocado and Tomato English Egg Sammy is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had!!!! 5 stars on that alone! I drive all the way from scottsdale just to get it for breakfast! They also have the absolute best service, coffee and pastries and remember everyone's name when you come in. It's the place to \"BE.\"

Ps. There's the loveliest boxer that roams around and loves doggie pats."}
{"text":"Uber Eats turned me on to this place, and I'm so glad they did! The breakfast sandwiches are awesome! I love the avocado Sammie, but I always add chorizo or ham to beef it up a bit. The English muffins are perfectly crisp on the outside and soft inside, and the ingredients are juicy and flavorful. The only thing I really was not crazy about was the chorizo scramble. It was a little on the small side, and felt like scrambled eggs with chunks of hot dog or sausage. Ever since, I've stuck to the sandwiches and have always been happy."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted by everyone who works there. Very friendly and professional staff! Asked what they would recommend and was given the suggestion of the \"be Sammy\". It was absolutely delicious, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool place to check out. It is not for the kids for sure. The menu is adult driven and this place is really hipster. The artwork inside is really retro and fun. The food is consistent and good. The staff are super nice and very accommodating. 

The bakery items are fresh made and tantalizing. The breads come daily made by a local bakery. Additionally, they support our local businesses for their ingredients; Schreiner's Fine  Sausage and many others. The inside of the business is super cool and showcases a rustic industrial feel infused with art.

When I walked in, the vibe of this place grabbed me right away. It is one of those spots that appeal to my inner nature and like of industrial areas. Biff and Erma do-gooder's from Scottsdale need not venture here. Most of them are not too hip. You might kill the vibe as well. PS- Stay in Scottsdale and wear your polo shirt, Sperry top-siders and shorts with the matching belt. That is good place for you. 

Anyway, this is a great place to chill out, read the paper and take in some cool aspects of downtown Phoenix. We love to just walk around hand in hand and soak up the local businesses and fare. Come try out this awesome joint...

{"text":"The Be Sammy with ham is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had! Fast & friendly joint. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, step right in and your Ora immediately changes. The art work there is great! Place is plastered with art, and they have a little plant room where you can purchase them. Food was good. Syrups are house made which gives them an extra edge on the other coffee shops. Cold Brew had a nice bitter taste to it, just the way I like it. The breakfast was perfect, light and still filling."}
{"text":"Our experience at Be Happy was okay. While they do serve breakfast and lunch all day, their menu is very limited.

Hubby had basically scrambled eggs (Chorizo on the menu). There was some pepper and sausage thrown in. Just eggs, no toast. There was toast with assorted toppings available for $4.50.

I enjoyed a grilled cheese. Unfortunately the sandwich was accompanied by potato chips that were too salty to eat.

The latte and chai were decent but cold.

All together our bill was $24 including tip."}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee shop with nice service and hot tasty coffee. Go with the pour over! Their food looked good too and not too many choices which a plus for me. Any cafe with Nutella on the menu gets bonus stars from me. This cafe is on the same floor as the Mon Orchid gallery and co-working space (as it is also a member). Don't forget to get your Oxygen supply as you take a look at the Bosque plant shop next door there and make friends with the shop's guard :)"}
{"text":"Be Coffee + Food + Stuff is a quaint and hyper trendy coffee shop that absolutely needs to be on your Phoenix bucket list. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

The service and atmosphere at Be Coffee are both excellent. From those behind the counter taking your order while introducing themselves to the owner who often serves up guests himself, everyone is excellent, and the atmosphere and decor is one of the most unique I've encountered. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

The menu at Be Coffee is small, but nothing on it is above $10.00. My scramble was small, but for $9.00 I was perfectly content with the fresh ingredients. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

My chorizo breakfast scramble was simple, but excellently so. The chorizo was fresh, the eggs flavorful, and the cheese and mustard brought it all together nicely. As I touched on earlier, the portion was small, but the dish was good. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Absolutely. Be Coffee is a must-visit. Star Granted."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop in a fun location.   Good ambiance and shares location with an art gallery and plant shop.  Food was quite good and they are eager to please.  We'd recommend it."}
{"text":"I can't believe how much I love this place!!!! The staff at the coffee/tea bar was INCREDIBLE! The nicest staff I've seen in SO LONG. All so patient and sweet. They're knowledgeable about all their products. I got some tea that was incredible, a perfect pick-me-up. The flower tea? I can't remember, but so so good. My girlfriend got a chai tea latte thet she said was the best chai tea she's ever had. We went next door, inside, that had all these plants and everything was SO beautiful. The young blonde girl working was SO SO SO nice and really made our day. She was so personable and sweet, we really enjoyed talking to her. This entire place is not only such a cute great spot, but the people really do make this place one of a kind. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great experience here! TJ and the crew make the shit out of my coffee every time I go there. One of the few places in Phoenix to get a solid pour over with coffee with the brew being from outside of the Americas.
Great atmosphere with cool folk. This is the kinda place you go when you're in your mid to late thirties to work through your midlife crisis and invite a thin sinewy barista to your depressing party. There's probably a regular or two there with 300 dollars in tips a month. Definitely a hip vibe there, you'll feel cool for a second before you have to go back to Starbucks to consume their diarrhea in a cup.

5 out of 5 would crisis again."}
{"text":"If you love great coffee, friendly people, excellent breakfast & lunch sandwiches with insanely fresh ingredients that are made to order for you, AND a cool open space with which to enjoy your bounty, then Be Coffee + Food + Stuff is your place. I stopped by and was greeted by a friendly guy named Troy, who walked me through their menu, patiently shared with me his favorites and made a unique breakfast sandwich just for me! And, in supporting this local business you are also supporting a local coffee company (how awesome?!?!) Go to Be Coffee -- you'll leave happier than you arrived for sure!!! ps. Plus the building is really cool with an art gallery and a little fresh plant store to check out while you are there! pps. I was told you can also rent out the space for parties! What the what?!?! Go already!!!"}
{"text":"Hipster/Trendy cafe/art studio. We both ordered the chorizo plate. My daughter is a fanatic chorizo seeker. If they serve it she will come. I enjoyed it but we both didnt like the chorizo served sliced instead of scrambled in with the eggs. Dont get me wrong, it was still delicious. But I'd rather go further West into Avondale to Colados Coffee & Crepes."}
{"text":"Really positive experience. Cool ambience, nice workers, and great food/coffee. I got the avocado + tomato egg sandwich on the homemade English muffin and it was absolutely delicious. The coffee was good too, and all reasonably priced. Would definitely come back here if I pass through Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Awesome place. I had the avocado breakfast sandwich with a cold brew and it was amazing. The staff was extremely friendly and ambiance was great."}
{"text":"Delicious Sammy's! We got the avocado + Munster+tomato and it was delicious. Just the right crunch from the toasted bun and delicious insides!! Great find!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Discovered it because there was an hour wait at Matt's Big Breakfast. The coffee shop is in a funky little spot and shares space with a cool plant shop--where I discovered air plants--and another restaurant that adjoins it (don't recall the name), plus a large space with a \"cyclorama\" wall. At first glance I thought it was some sort of skateboarding wall, but no--there's a helpful sign stating that it's used in photography and videography as an \"infinity\" background with no discernible beginning or end. But on to the food and coffee...

Loved the coffee with unlimited free refills--rich, with no bitterness. We got the chorizo egg scramble (delicious), toast with the most creamy ricotta ever and strawberry rhubarb jam (outstanding) and sourdough toast with house-made nutella, sliced bananas, and salt--absolute heaven!!"}
{"text":"5 stars! First time here and I loved it.  

The food - omg! It was so amazing. I got the avocado, tomato, munster, egg sandwich. Delicious! Flavorful, fresh and so juicy. 
I also got a salted chocolate chip cookie...yum!

I'm usually a pancake/waffle kind of girl for breakfast so I was a little out of my element but I'm so glad I tried this! I will definitely be back. 

The place had a cool vibe. It shares a building with an art studio and unique plant shop. And in the cafe there are cool pieces of art, a couch, just overall inviting and chill."}
{"text":"Fantastic cookies, lots of flavor. Snickerdoodle is delightful without being too sweet. Great staff! Wife needed a cookie, this place was perfect."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this place was awesome so I had too! I had a few hours to kill in between meetings downtown so I checked Yelp for a place to grab a coffee and something to eat. This place had all five stars and I now get why! The food and coffee was fantastic but the staff really made it a five. TJ took my order and introduced himself and the place. They gave me free coffee for being a newbie and everyone new everyone in the place by name. It almost took me off guard how kind everyone was as you just don't see friendliness like this in most establishments! Place had an art gallery and plant store attached too!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, good location, fun atmosphere and the food was super yummy! I'd definitely come back if I were in the area!"}
{"text":"Just came in for the first time. Super friendly staff and we both loved the BE Sammy. Everything tastes really fresh. Good coffee and casual, friendly atmosphere. As close as this is to our apartment, we will be back often!"}
{"text":"They have a great cold brew. The kind with a strong flavorful essence. The  English egg Sammy was also enjoyable. Different and better from your typical dry rough English muffin sandwiches. I had the one with avocado, tomato and muenster. I gotta say- I absolutely devoured it! Had the pleasure of meeting the owner \"Q\", great guy! Definitely give it a try if you are looking for some new and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place lives up to the good reviews. We got the egg Sammie and the chorizo scramble and an impulse buy on the apple fritter. All three were amazing. The apple fritter by the way came from Karl's bakery. I ate way too much but couldn't stop because it was all so tasty. I also got the cold brew coffee which had a great balanced flavor. Outstanding place and setting is very cool."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate at on my trip to Phoenix. It is a really cute space and the breakfast was good. I had the chorizo scrambler and it was the perfect amount of food-not a huge meal. The service was good, limited seating but I met a really nice couple who told me all the Phoenix places to check out!"}
{"text":"I was kind of disappointed with the customer service of this place after the superb service we got  next store at the dressing room a week ago. I had received a free coffee voucher to use here and decided to check it out. I ordered a coffee and the Nutella, banana, and sea salt bread and showed the guy at the counter my voucher... He said \"okay\" and proceeded to charge me! He wasn't very friendly and seemed like he didn't want to be there. Disappointing! I'd like to try this location again because the food and coffee were great, I just wish I could say the same about the staff!"}
{"text":"3 holy words- English. Egg. Sammy. English muffins ain't my thang but damn that Sammy turned out, flipped and reversed meh. I'll be returning for that heavenly delight. The ambiance is very simple, cool and modern. 
Service was nice, casual and I personally prefer that. Small venue but they have an outdoor patio with seating which is a sweet view too.

PSA: they have co-ed bathrooms. I wouldn't handle that business here ladies."}
{"text":"Cool venue.  Cold brew.  Sandwiches to hit the spot.   Look at the size of the cookies while you check out the art space behind."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem thanks to fellow Yelpers. Visited on a Friday around 9am. Plenty of people but still open seats available. We had the best service. The kitchen, under the culinary magic of Pablo, whipped up a special avocado toast for me that was outstanding. I enjoyed a large cold brew spiced with cloves, cinnamon, and a hint of chile. 

Someone else commented in their review that Be Coffee had the best breakfast sandwich in town, and my husband will vouch for that claim. He ordered the avocado egg sammy and savored every bite. What a cool space with tons of art, free Wi-Fi, great patio, and high-quality coffee."}
{"text":"Good food, great sevice. Word of advice, if you text your order ahead of time, make sure you get a confirmation message or call to ensure the order was received."}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes to get my breakfast sandwich to go but otherwise it was amazing !!!!! The plant shop adjoining Be is beautiful, so if you get a chance to come here I would recommend checking it out as well while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"Best coffee in PHX, best English muffin sandwich in PHX, best cookies in PHX. Visiting from TX and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I had my breakfast and coffee here this morning and at first, I was confused because I went to this location before....but we found out that this is a new coffee spot that resides here! At first, I was a little disappointed because their large is a 16 oz - my husband is a coffee addict, but he was cool with it. My hot almond milk vanilla latte was fabulous! 

We also ordered the chorizo scramble and the Be Sammy sandwich. Like the coffee sizes, the portions were slim. However, both entrees filled us up! I enjoyed the Be Sammy sandwich - the bread was crunchy and packed with flavor! The music they were playing was my type of music too. 

It was a chilly morning and I did not prepare well - I had a thin long sleeve shirt on so while eating, I just felt cold drafts in the building and it made me want to eat my food as quick as I could and leave.

Overall, we'd come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocoa (with homemade marshmallow) for the kids and delicious coffee. This is a great shop with a relaxed atmosphere. Definitely worth a stop when in the downtown area."}
{"text":"If you are going in a group be aware there is pretty limited seating. The location of this coffee shop is great though you have so many things to do after you finish your drinks and food. The coffee was great but I was so bummed out that they had ran out of the english muffins for their breakfast sandwiches. I ended up settling with the onion roll and it ruined the experience for me. The service was really nice and friendly and I would totally go back with the hope that they have everything in supply."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to work yesterday and had the BeSammy.  Best breakfast sandwich anywhere.  The onion roll really makes it!  The coffee is also delish, very flavorful and bright.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Friendly service and absolutely delicious sammies! My husband and I look forward to our Friday morning date here all week. It's a really beautifully decorated space, as well, with local art hung and you can peek into Monorchid on your way to the ladies room. Great place to do a couple of hours of work- nice atmosphere and music selection is great and not too loud. Check it out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"LA girl flies to Phoenix with onion-hating boyfriend before making drive to Sedona

LA girl Yelps breakfast in Phoenix and is lead to the magic of BE COFFEE.

Iced coffee + almond milk: tasty level= standard 

The magic of this place lies in 1) giant cookies staring at you while you order and more importantly 2)  giant breakfast sammy! 

First bite was spectacular! Incredibly well seasoned eggs, ooey gooey melted muenster cheese, ripe avocado, tomatoes and thick slice of turkey. Onion-hating boyfriend LOVED the sandwich and only halfway through realized eggs are cooked with diced onions (A-hem*: this should be noted on menu though, guys, should said onion haters of the world have an actual allergy) 

Anywho, I was sad to finish this Sammy -- very full but sad! I was so satisfied and satiated after tackling this sammy that I HAD to stop here again before my return flight to LA. Tried ordering it with ham...flavor profile wasn't the same. Either the eggs were under seasoned this second time around or the sliced turkey is the magic touch. Still great just not breathtaking! 

Whichever herbs or s&p that were skillfully balanced on Sammy day 1 were not as present on Sammy day 2. :( 

Whomever was working the line on Thursday 4/14 @ about 11am: YOU ROCK! 

Overall cool space, good vibes and great brekkie options. If I ever find myself back in PHX, I'll surely stop here."}
{"text":"My GO-TO spot for my morning capp. Even though there are other coffeeshops in the area that I very much enjoy, this is where I start my day, almost every day. The staff is just TOO good. I walk in feeling like family. I am greeted with the same enthusiasm every.single.time. Each barista is genuine, compassionate + full of contagious joy. I cannot justify going anywhere else any more - I am, without fail, always impressed with Be. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Five star! Walked 1 mile from hotel to have breakfast. Great food, tasty coffee and interesting stuff! Friendly staff, cozy place to hang out. Love it!"}
{"text":"It was hard to find this place but definitely worth the trouble. Great space and amazing food. I am not a fan of English muffin but this place changed my mind about it, I have never had a breakfast sandwich that good ( avocado and tomato with cheese).  I find Phoenix not so friendly but server here was great and knowledgeable, Jamie was engaging and super friendly."}
{"text":"The avocado breakfast sandwich + turkey was so good! It was a huge sandwich and I couldn't even finish the last few bites. The egg was cooked so perfectly. The spiced cold brew was really good as well. I usually don't drink coffee but this cold brew was almost like a cross between a coffee and chai tea. What a creative delicious creation!"}
{"text":"So stoked I found this place. Best shot pull in all of downtown Phoenix. Breakfast egg and avo sandwich is huge and tastes awesome. Really enjoyed ducking away from the job site to hide here and chill for a while. Good staff too."}
{"text":"Great cold brew and a great place to work or hang out.  Nestled inside a gallery so really cool scenery if you want to take a look around.  Friendly staff with tons of seating/tables and free wifi."}
{"text":"So good! Super trendy. Stopped here on my way out of Phoenix and was delicious. Had an iced coffee with a breakfast sandwich and I couldn't have asked for anything better at that time. The staff was super cool and friendly as well. I even had the owner come up and greet me. Also, there is a small art museum inside which was cool to check out! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dropped in here for breakfast on the way from the airport to Sedona. Really great breakfast Sammy - I had the avocado tomato and hubby had the ham. Iced coffee really great and hot coffee delicious, too. 

Totally recommend."}
{"text":"The coffee here is great! I absolutely love their cold brew and it has become what I get almost every time. I've only been here a handful of times, but I enjoy the building and the atmosphere. I'm looking forwards to trying some more of the foods here. 
It's in a great location with a lot to do."}
{"text":"The best place for a high quality coffee and scrumptious breakfast. Everything we had was on point sooo we went 3 days in a row while in town from Oakland. Yum! Everyone there and the space have a solid cool vibe."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, fabulous coffee and breakfast sandwich, neat vibe and proximity to the plant shop/art gallery combo that exists in the same space. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix. 

Bonus for the unisex bathroom."}
{"text":"New spot I found and spent half my Saturday there. It was so chill and quaint. Jacob and the other owner was so awesome to my friend and I. The waitress and waiter were so friendly and quick. For breakfast I had a snickerdoodle cookie and chai tea with soy and it was delish! Then for the lunch there's a next door spot for easy transition. Love, love this place and will be hanging out more here. The owners are doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very interesting, welcoming place! Exceptional customer service! Excellent coffee! Great atmosphere to grab breakfast, have coffee with a friend, or study!!"}
{"text":"Great service! The moment we walked in a dog greted us!  I love dogs and that made me happy and also the service was great food was up top Great. I'm not a morning person or eat breakfast but my family and I were down here for my brothers college. But Great everything overall."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the most underrated hidden gems in all of Phoenix. As a long-time Lux fan, I never thought I'd find a coffee shop that I enjoyed as much. I fell in love with Be at the first mocha. I like their coffee (and atmosphere) even better - who wouldn't want to drink coffee while walking around an art gallery?  My office space is on Roosevelt Row, so I'm always there during the week. Now, I'm finding myself driving up there on the weekends as well. If you are anywhere near Downtown, you need to try this place out (allow a few extra minutes for parking)."}
{"text":"My family (of 3) and I enjoyed everything about this place-- the space, the coffee, and the HUGE breakfast sandwiches we got on big ole' muffins. We opted for the egg, tomato, and avocado sans the mayo, and they were sooooo delicious. The the pour over coffee was super smooth, and my daughters chocolate chip cookie with sea salt was divine. If we were locals we'd definitely become regulars. :-)"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Stumbled upon it since I live in the area. I had the Be Sammy sandwich with ham and no mayo, and the spicy cold brew. So good!! I'll totally be back. The atmosphere is adorable too."}
{"text":"I love the name of this place. I love their latte (best I had in Phoenix). I love the decor. I love the space. They also make an effort to get to know you! So friendly. 

Toast with mascarpone and jam... so gooooood.

There's some artwork right outside too!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and nice people. Came here this morning and the staff was so welcoming and warm. Large coffee was actually large and had a very smooth taste. Also had the breakfast Sammy with ham and that bad boy was a monster! Will definitely be full most of the day. Thank you Monday morning crew! You're awesome:)"}
{"text":"Another gem on Roosevelt. We went simple with drip coffee and toasts which were exceptional. The friendly, welcoming staff made our first visit a great experience and we cant wait to go back. Great place, check it out!"}
{"text":"We came here during a First Friday and needed a little break from wandering around. My sister-in-law and I both ordered the Blackberry Ginger Green Tea. It was very refreshing and tasty! It came unsweetened and tasted so good neither of us added any sugar. We didn't eat any of the pastries but they looked really good. 

The inside is very cute and quaint with enough seating for the place. It's open and airy with a lot of plants around. The vibe is pretty mellow and welcoming. The employee who took our order was very nice and offered recommendations. 

Overall, it's a great place to grab a drink/bite to eat and relax at. If I'm ever in the area, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I drank and ate at Be three days in a row on a business trip. Espresso was on point every day. Service was strong and consistent. Music choice and volume was good for being social or doing a little work. Avo egg english muffin sammy was exceptional, I ate one every day and would make this a regular breakfast on my own dime if I lived nearby. Nice work, Be!"}
{"text":"Chill spot w friendly laid back crew. Got the be sammy w turkey on the onion roll n lemonade .. No complaints. Everythg was fresh, the place is clean n just overall gd vibe."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee shop. These guys really know their pour over coffees and make a killer lattes. Their breakfast English Sandwiches and bomber. Came here three days in a row."}
{"text":"I found my favorite new homework spot! The staff is SO friendly and pleasant. It was my first time here & Caolan helped me navigate the menu. I ordered the avo+tomato breakfast sandwich i recommend adding turkey, i got a spicy cold brew as well. Warning: it's the biggest breakfast sammich ever!"}
{"text":"I read some good reviews about this place when I was in NY. So, the next day after I moved to the Phoenix area, I decided to drive here for breakfast and coffee. The 20-mile drive was well worth it. There is an art gallery inside. TJ helped me. He was great! GREAT food, DOPE coffee, GREATER service and the music is EXCELLENT . Try it! I've come back twice already."}
{"text":"The food quality was pretty good, I liked my Chorizo Scramble. The chorizo sausage wasn't overly salty like some other chorizo and egg dishes, and it was actual slices of sausage (not the ground crumbled kind). My wife had the Be Sammy sandwich, which was a large onion roll with a lot of egg and cheese. It was good, but we saw some other people getting english muffin sandwiches with turkey and avocado and other greens, which I think is the same price ($6?). So those might be healthier.  I kind of missed having a side of hash browns or potatoes, but I guess this was a healthier meal so that's good. The nutella ice coffee was good too, as was the iced jasmine tea. The tea was unsweetened and had a very strong herbal taste which I liked but some might not."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite coffee shops in DTPHX. The owners, Troy and Kyu, are very friendly and get to know their customers on a personal level. I recommend the 6th Grader sandwich, Boylan Root Beer, strawberry rhubarb toast, cold brew coffee, ice cream, and cookies! They're all great!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this coffee shop! From the moment you walk in the employees all say hello, always with a smile, and ready to help. The coffee is amazing. Their caramel latte is my favorite! Breakfast is always yummy. While waiting you can check out some cool art or later in the day check out the bosque succulent store inside the same building. Out of all the coffee shops down town this is by far in my top three! Give them a visit. They won't disappoint ! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food and drink offerings were awesome, especially because you can customize many of them. The staff there were very warm and friendly. I got the Be Sammy and added turkey to it. I also got an ice chai with coconut milk. Both were seasoned well and delicious. 

It's a very cool spot with an art gallery within and Bosque, a plant studio and boutique. I fell in love with the vibe in bosque and the lady who helped me (I neglected to ask her name) was knowledgeable and could answer my random plant questions. 

10/10 would definitely return again and give them my money."}
{"text":"Was near the downtown area in the morning and decided to check out yelp to find a place to stop for breakfast. I saw this place had a 5 star review so I knew I had to check it out.  I was not disappointed. 
I ordered the English turkey and munster egg Sammy and the Be Sammy and added the ham. Both were so amazing and is a lot of food. The English muffin is twice the size of a normal one with a slice of ham, munster cheese and I'd say 2 eggs (seasoned). The seasoning used on the eggs was good I think it was garlic, salt and pepper. The Be Sammy comes on an onion roll again huge. Only thing is 2 bucks for a thin slice of ham sends super steep, but like I said it was delicious. 
I also got their large latte wroth skim milk and had then add caramel flavor which they make themselves in house, best latte I have had. 
On another note they have some pastries on the counter for sale. I did not buy but the bear claw was about 3 times bigger than I have ever seen before and it looked good. 
I will definitely recommend this place to others and if downtown again in the morning will hit it up again. I actually have already told 3 grieve about this place as a must try."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere, deliiiiicious breakfast sandwiches and amazing coffee/tea! There is a cute plant house and a gallery all in the building. It's a favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwiches and nice service/atmosphere! Due to the convenience of the location, will definitely be returning again!"}
{"text":"Not a whole lot on the menu, but everything is absolutely awesome. Can't go wrong and the chill environment is great for a lunch date or just having a coffee and getting out some emails. This place has become a regular of mine when I'm in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I've had really good service & really bad service here. I've waited half an hour for my food & drink (basically forgotten about until I mentioned it). I've also gotten an avocado & tomato sandwich, that had avocado that was very clearly not good, in the hopes I wouldn't open the sandwich. But the coffee is delicious. They foam the milk for my latte until it's deliciously smooth, my favorite part. The coffee itself also just tastes good (I am a reformed Starbucks addict). So, it's spotty but overall good."}
{"text":"Super cute n trendy inside. The casual ambience and simplicity of how the food is presented makes this place very easy to eat at and actually feel comfortable.  For the taste... I ordered the BE SAMMY, it was perfect,  lots  of  flavor, and soft bread. The cappuccino was good. And I know this how?... if I don't  have to add sugar to a cappuccino or if doesn't  taste like a cup of milk THEN trust me it's a good  cappuccino!  Overall,  I love this spot, recommending it to others, and coming back when I'm in AZ"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Not only is the food delish the coffee is too! I get a vanilla mocha late with almond milk and it seriously lifts my soul to the sky for the day. It can make the crappiest Monday look like a Friday(if it could actually make it Friday that would be even better ;P) but seriously check this place out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Be has my all-time favorite cold brew! It definitely doesn't need cream or flavor but I love getting one of their house made syrups just because even the syrups are delicious!"}
{"text":"Cant say enough about this marvelous jewel of a place. The staff is friendly and very accommodating and the coffee and food were delicious. We had our pup with us and were greeted with fresh water for our pup as we sat outside, and when our food came the server told us dogs were allowed inside in a certain area and there was a spot open, he helped us move ourselves and our food inside. Thank you for a delightful experience, we will be back and will definitely be telling our friends and family about this place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic everytime I come. Not pretentious, great food, great coffee (real coffee not that overly sweet shit) and there is a lovely plant shop the next room over and an art gallery. The plant shop owner is the nicest and you can easily spend hours talking to- has a wealth of knowledge about Phoenix."}
{"text":"What a lovely little spot for coffee and brunch! Set inside the MonOrchid building, Be Coffee is a cozy little area that shares space with a plant store and an art gallery towards the back. The menu offers breakfast, lunch, and a delightful selection of coffee drinks and tea. After having a small sample of the spicy cold brew I knew I needed this for my meal! It had just the right kick of spiciness from the inclusion of habaneros and Fresno chiles, and was lightly sweet. The coffee itself was so smooth I didn't even need any cream or milk to go with it. 

As for the \"+ Food\", I had the avocado-tomato English muffin breakfast sandwich. It was a very generous portion, and oh so good. The English muffin was lightly toasted, with fluffy soft eggs, fresh avocado and tomato. The acidity from the tomato and the light saltiness from the muenster cheese was an excellent counterpoint to balance out the creamy flavors of the avocado and eggs. My total for the coffee plus the sandwich was around $12. 

Service was so friendly and sweet. Another plus of this restaurant is that there is a private parking lot in the back. 

\"B(e)\" Coffee definitely gets an \"A+\" in my book!"}
{"text":"Spicy cold brew is amazing. English breakfast Sammy was incredible. Price was affordable. Highly recommend checking this place out. Free WiFi and a nice spot to get some work done."}
{"text":"Out-of-towners BEWARE! Unisex restrooms.  I didn't know until after the female came out of the toilet stall. Very awkward

Very cool place. They share a space with some art studios. The sandwiches were 5 star.   The coffee was HORRIBLE. Literally tasted sour . Both our coffees were sour and we're tossed out. I'd go back though just for the sandwiches.  Very good."}
{"text":"I have never been to this place before but I have always wanted to stop in. Every first Friday I always stop in to see the art in monorchid and the energy is always rad. Kaylin was working register and was supper warm and friendly and he recommended the avo and tomato English egg Sammy. The sandwich which was out of this world and the food came out quick. The music  and vibes were great except for some of the harder rap songs that made appearances. 

Check this place out if you want a tasty breakfast and some good company."}
{"text":"I grab their English Muffin Egg Sammy with ham and muenster cheese on a regular basis. Love their food!"}
{"text":"I had the English Sammy and it was terrific. My grandson had the chorizo scrambled.  Both were terrific. Service was amazing."}
{"text":"I came here straight from the airport based on good reviews.  The place is cute, good coffee, and the first two bites of the breakfast sandwich were great.  I ordered the sammy with avocado, tomato, and cheese.  Unfortunately, they didn't list the fourth ingredient, which is mayonnaise.  I am allergic to mayo (raw eggs).  The cashier and cook offered to make me another one, but  I just left.  

Please list all of your ingredients.  There is no reason not to."}
{"text":"5 stars for the vibe. 5 stars for the staff. 5 stars for the food and drinks. 3 stars for the seating area. 

This place is inside a building called the monorchid which is filled with local businesses each claiming their own niche inside. This coffee shop and the plant store next door are the only businesses selling a product vs a service. The reason for 3 stars is partly due to this close business thing they have going on. Any time I've gone in, the same people are here working on a laptop, taking up the entire table, and conversing with each other. This is a coffee shop, should be normal right? Well I found these people are workers from the surrounding businesses. Since their office space is so small, sometimes with no door, they come hang at the coffee place all day. As I sit in the corner I see many customers come in looking for a spot to settle in, but end up having to do take out or walk out all together. 


 The sandwiches are so delicious and every time I've been there I've received some type of coffee art. There are a couple cool historic books on the table to check out while sipping on your drinks.q"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is really nice. It's a little different it does have other businesses inside. I ordered a vanilla latte and a breakfast sandwich. Both were very good. Customer service is amazing. Everyone was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich I have had in a long time. Place is in a cool location and friendly staff."}
{"text":"English Egg Sammy a 10/10. Got the avocado option. Phenomenal and at a really fair price ($6.50). Potions were plentiful particularly with the nicely herbed eggs.  Super nice people. Hip place. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Be + Coffee and Stuff, is the most beloved little coffee shop l've been to so far in Phoenix. An artsy little spot, counter serve cafe, providing local roasts, free wi-fi also serving breakfast all day and lunch sandwiches. 
Once you walk in Be is located on the right extending some seats to part of the mOnOrchid Gallery. The building is also shared to wonderful work spaces up stairs also, to a cute little botanical shop for all your plant needs. I like how things are very minimal from the menu board to the counter even the baristas and clerks are a breath of fresH air, and definitely friendly and customer service orientated. Definitely one of my favorite spot, on Roosevelt row coffee and can' beat a delicious breakfast sandwich. Iced americano, all black cause if you are a coffee taster then you wouldn't need any dairy or sugar! Breakfast sandwich was superb! Avocado, Tomato and Munster cheese on a crisp fresh baked English muffin was awesome. Be you, be Awesome, and be hungry Phoenix, be at be technically!"}
{"text":"I had the \"be sammy\" and the scrambled eggs are the best I've ever had. They were super light, fluffy and melted in your mouth! Also had a spiced cold brew, very unique taste not overwhelming or too spicy. It was a nice blend. Both highly recommended"}
{"text":"Friendly and sincere service and in an incredibly cool shop paired with delicious food make this place incomparably great."}
{"text":"Looking for a coffee spot? Well here it is! Their coffee is clearly made with expertise. My go to: Vanilla Soy Latte  my palette was met with the classic aromas of \"wake-me-up\" coffee beans combined with the vanilla notes in one of  their home made syrups. It is an open space that is housed in the old songbird spot in the Roosevelt downtown area."}
{"text":"This place deserves all my praises. Great cold brew,amazing (and filling) breakfast sandwiches, and affordable prices. I had the avo, egg, and havarti and it was huge and delicious. Braeden, who I believe is the owner, was incredibly friendly and passionate about his coffee. It's a great place to chill out and work on your laptop (free wifi).Definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"Nicest people. Delicious food including lots of vegan and vegetarian dishes, egg dishes. Not your typical lunch place. Appeals to a young crowd, which we're NOT, but it was delightful."}
{"text":"Just as the four star reads, I am a fan. The rennovated and newly designed old songbird space has reopened itself as Be Coffee and I loved it. An intimate space with friendly baristas, lots of natural lighting and personalized study areas. The latte I had wasn't my favorite but I loved being there and from the amount of people walking through, I don't deny phoenicians like being there as well! I can't wait to go back and try the foods off their menu~"}
{"text":"Landed in PHX and found this gem on Yelp. Cool ambiance and delicious food. The AVO+TOMATO+MUENSTER was so damn flavorful. Hands down the most delicious breakfast sandwich I can remember having."}
{"text":"Came here for a late breakfast, ordered a Nutella latte (which was great.) and a be Sammy (which is a sweet deal for $6.50). 

After my wife and I finished our drinks and our meal, a very friendly person working there came by our table and asked if we would like anything else, we asked for two coffees. He informed us the coffees were on the house along with a Big Ass Snickerdoodle Cookie. 

This place is a fun spot, with awesome food/coffee and even better staff. If you plan on coming here, be prepared to be treated right."}
{"text":"I don't get it...  oh wait I guess I do.  In Phx you don't need quality you just need a vibe or atmosphere.  I will give this place the nice atmosphere check off...  but the quality of the two coffees that we ordered were disappointing to say the least.  

We ordered a cold brew and an Americano.  Didn't finish either and in fact the Americano (served in what seemed like the largest cup available..  making it not an Americano) probably burned it's way through the trash can.

Nice plant shop though"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review in the delirium of what has to be the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. This place is seriously amazing. The cold brew coffee is great. The wait was long but that's expected for a Saturday morning. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe of this place. The guys working were super knowledge and really friendly. Delicious food and excellent coffee."}
{"text":"Located in the Monorchid gallery. Great service from TJ. The breakfast sandwich was one of the best I've ever had and coffee was great too. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Checked out this shop when they first opened. Very friendly and helpful staff! The breakfast sammy was just what I needed that morning too."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very urban/hipster-y. The multi-use center is really neat, I loved walking around the succulent shop and the art gallery in the back. The Egg Muffin was bomb! I ordered the Spicy White Girl latte, which had a hint of spice and was very tasty."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to being a friend from out of town to eat breakfast. It was perfect! We were greeted by a nice gentleman, we both ordered the English egg Sammy and a latte and sat down 
They were brought out to us. They were both PEREFECT. They made sure we were satisfied with our food. 
The sand which is big and filling. My coffee was great. Definitely coming back here. Great food and customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Love the many different aspects to this place. Had the veg bfast sandwich - it was probably hands down the best bfast sandwich i've ever had. will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so neat. The breakfast sandwich with avocado was amazing! I love the atmosphere, adjacent gallery, chill space, when I was here there was a doggie greeting the customers. So cute. Perfect welcome for my first time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We were in the area and attempted to eat at Matts breakfast, but the line was aweful. So we saw this place was right down the street and thought \"what the heck it has 5stars let's give it a try?!\" So we walked in an immediately are met with a warm smiles. We ordered 3 breakfast plates,2 lattes and a huge breakfast pastry that only cost roughly 30$. While we waited for our food and coffee we browsed the art gallery, which was unique and entertaining. When The food arrived, it was hot, fresh, massive portions and Delicious!! I definitely will be back! It's a new coffee shop but it definitely earned my loyalty."}
{"text":"So thank you UberEats for allowing me to try Be Coffee + Food + Stuff, because I would never venture to Roosevelt for a breakfast sandwich and a latte on my own.

I ordered a large White Chocolate latte, yum by the way, and the Be Sammy with ham. That has got to be one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever eaten. It was huge, delicious, and satisfying. The ham was tender, yummy and not dried out. The roll was amazing. I wish I could buy a dozen of them and make sandwiches out of them every day. The bottom bun was like an everything bagel, so when you bit into your sandwich you got all that seasoning mixed in with your egg and cheese. Even after driving from their location to 16th st and Northern, my sandwich was still this amazing, can only imagine if I ate it there.

I will be hitting them up again, for sure."}
{"text":"Be Coffee is a unique coffee adventure. Great location and the building itself is pretty interesting with the plant store and neighboring restaurant. I told the barista it was my first time and he informed me that they are known for their spicy cold brew and followed the statement with a sample. Now I get why it's a fan favorite. You can taste a kick of spice and experience a flavor transformation with every sip, I was shook. You should stop by if you like rad environments and some good cold brew!"}
{"text":"The absolute best breakfast in Phoenix. Everyone who works there is chill and super fun to talk to. But besides that the food is bomb and its fast. I would recommend this spot to people who just want to chill and eat a low key good breakfast sandwich. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been thinking about what I ordered from this lovely coffee shop since the day I first set foot in it about 2 weeks ago. I was planning on an afternoon at the movies but thought this seemed like a cool place to hang and get a quick bite before the movie. I met my friend here and we ordered: Hot chocolate & English muffin with egg, cheese, tomato and avocado. I know it doesn't sound like anything crazy amazing but it was a cool day and we wanted something warm while we caught up. First off, the hot chocolate took a little bit but when I got it I immediately understood why. It was incredibly creamy and incredibly chocolatey, basically the best hot chocolate I've ever tried, or at least definite top 3! My breakfast sandwich was A) a really nice big size and B) absofreakinglutely (yes, it's a word) Dee-lish!! Wow! The english muffin tasted as if it had just been baked, it was utterly soft and fresh in every way, the egg, the avo, everything about this sandwich was crazy good. I will be back to have both these items in the future again and again. The cookies looked amazing but I was trying not to eat sweets that day but being a crazy cookie person, I will surely have some next time. What a cool space overall. You can sit outside in the sun and people watch or sit inside on their super comfy couch and walk around the gallery area. Very cool find. Just go people reading this, go now."}
{"text":"Be Sammy.... I substituted provolone for American in my Be Sammy and added the ham, and I normally am not a fan of onion rolls, but day-yam, that was one great sandwich! Coffee's steaming hot, and we were offered refills. Good coffee at non-Starbucks prices. Hubby said he was surprised that the chorizo was Spanish and not Mexican, but he liked it in his chorizo scramble, which he got without the spinach. Seriously friendly staff here, too! Pleasant visit, unless you're someone who doesn't like hip-hop or world music during breakfast. But, I can't chew and listen at the same time, so I was happy. LOL"}
{"text":"Coffee spot checklist: 

-Delicious coffee and tea (Spicy cold brew is mind-blowing)
-Free Wifi
-English Egg Sammy Avo Tomato is huge, delicious, and fresh. That bread though 
- Power strip and outlets to keep you all charged up for work or study
- Super sweet staff who check up on you periodically just in case (esp dude in the green beanie!) 
- Extra Mile: they ran out of OJ after I already paid, and gave me a new drink and coupon for next time."}
{"text":"This place was a little strange but really good. We are visiting from Colorado and we love to try new places. So the good reviews on Yelp and thought we would try. The breakfast sandwich was amazing. Holy cow. I had a chai tea and it was delicious and beautiful. Also we got my son some chocolate milk. That was the fanciest chocolate milk it will ever have. It was homemade and awesome."}
{"text":"I got out of the habit of going here for coffee when the old coffee joint here moved. I was told to check it out last night by a buddy of mine. He told me they have the best cookies in Phoenix ...and ya know what? ... he was right. These cookies are bomb, service was great and the coffee is really good too. Would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"The best americano I've ever had. I got a large with an extra shot, it was so SMOOTH, it was actually silky. Located downtown, with a really friendly cool staff and a drip coffee honor system ($2 per cup). There's an art gallery attached and it's a chill place to sit on your laptop and work if that's your thing. I went here twice in the 3 days I was in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The staff was wonderfully friendly. I just got a latte the first time and wandered into the plant shop. So charming! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The pastries and food are alright. However, the customer service here is awful. Today the female attendant blatantly ignored a customer, even after she looked and acknowledged the him. I saw the whole ordeal: the customer walked in, walked to the counter, and the attendant walked away. It came off as pretty racist given the customer was a young black male and literally nothing he did was deserving of that treatment. It's honestly embarrassing that a local coffee shop in a generally liberal area employs indiscreetly racist and ridiculously rude employees."}
{"text":"Decided to try after seeing the great reviews on Yelp.

Nice interior, simple menu. Really enjoyed the ambience.

Tried the \"English Ham + Muenster\" on an onion roll and loved it. Coffee was fresh and tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop, made a great Sunday morning study spot. I only had a cup of coffee so I can't attest to the quality of the food, by everything looked and smelled delicious. There is even a convenient parking lot behind the place for those of us who are inclined toward getting parking tickets."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Delicious food, fun atmosphere, really nice people! We were visiting from the Midwest and needed some breakfast and most importantly coffee. This place was spot on for both! They made my favorite drink better than my place at home and even with homemade syrups. Breakfast was exactly what I needed to keeping going till lunch. This is a must if you want to eat, drink, or chill."}
{"text":"I was checking out of one hotel, and needed a place to hang out and work before I hit the road in the afternoon. What a great spot I lucked into. 

I started out with the Chorizo Scramble and a drip coffee. The scramble is amazzzingggg. Just get it. Coffee was strong, just how I like it. 

The vibe is cool, gallery, meets hipster, meets desert modern loft, sometimes that's off putting frankly cause it isn't always friendly. The baristas here though, they are. So are your fellow hanger outers, working from whereverers etc. 

I worked from here for a few hours and the staff checked on me a few times, I purchased a coffee refill or two, had some water etc."}
{"text":"The Be Sammy is amazing! I've never thought of root beer and coffee but definitely recommend the bad boy.  The service at be is awesome  they do a great job every time I'm here and make me want to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Was a cool little place. probably family owned so i always support small businesess' .
Avail w/ Uber Eats
enjoyed a nice vanilla latte , solid bean they use and the cold brew was pretty rightous....

Need to try an espresso or two or ten next time I go back."}
{"text":"PROS
-Very cute, collaborative space. Small communal tables, comfy couch. Mixed space for a gallery behind there as well
-Breakfast sammies, my guy ordered the ham and cheese one, great english muffin, great crunch and loved the corn meal bottom.
-Good energy, tons of folks out for Sunday breakfast / coffee with family and friends
-my hot cocoa was very delicious and wasn't hiding behind a lot of whipped cream. It was in a mug with frothy design, no paper cups here! 

CONS
-Would like to see + patio seating if possible. 
-Chorizo scramble was just \"eh,\" I could have made same thing at home. Do yourself a favor and order the sammies instead."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. I was traveling across country and this was probably the best service I had during my entire trip. I can't remember the staff person's name at the front but he absolutely rocks. The food was simple and light but very favorable. The only thing I was less than impressed with was my latte. It wasn't the best but to their defense in a pretty picky coffee drinker. I would def go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Nice people food tasted good only complaint coffee to bitter was suppose to be a nutella latte didnt taste that way...."}
{"text":"This is a cool hang out spot to relax with good music, good vibe, and friendly staff. Was greeted by introducing ourselves and they guy even remembered our names when he brought us our food.. 
The customers were friendly as well.. And to top it off the coffee and breakfast sandwich was VERY SATISFYING AND TASTY! 

Thank you Yelp for introducing me to another great spot!"}
{"text":"dang that was a good sandwich

i really really don't like english muffins and i forgot to ask, in the rush to my conference, to ask if alt bread was available for their breakfast sandos. i couldnt even take a bite when the guy handed it to me through their little window. but by god it smelled amazing all through my walk to the conference center and i am fairly certain i made like fifty other students in the conference hall extremely jealous with the Pure Aromatics from this avocado tomato muenster cheese monstrosity

this sandwich powered me thru from 8am to 2pm. it's hefty, well-seasoned, and pretty pretty for a breakfast sando. that scrambled egg was wonderfully fluffy and the english muffin did well in sopping up that flavor.

and also, shout out to the guy- he was so kind enough to throw in a hot sauce packet into the to go container. cholula is now my jam

all in all, a wonderful breakfast/lunch, and probably wouldve been more glorious on a slow sweet sunday morning. thanks!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, macchiato was on point! This little place has a very simple menu but the attention to detail makes it awesome! I love the fact that they use MJ Bread! Very nice touch! I got a breakfast sandwich on the onion bread with scrambled eggs  (it had a very generous amount of pepper, which I loved:) munster cheese, sliced tomatoes & avocado. Yummy & so filling! Hubby got the chorizo scramble which he also loved! He said that next time he will get it on the onion bun."}
{"text":"Their Sammy sandwich is the best!!!  Their lemonade is delicious as well! Definitely  a MUST GO!"}
{"text":"This was my first breakfast in Phoenix and it was the perfect spot to pick. The food was AMAZING. I had he \"Be-Sammy Sandwich\" with a cold brew coffee. The sandwich comes with eggs (scrambled and herbed to perfection) an onion bun that has real onion on the bottom of the bun and a delicious cut of ham to top the sandwich. The coffee was very good also. The staff was polite and helpful and the food could not have been better. I tried my friend's chorizo scramble and it also was seasoned to perfection. The chorizo was spanish syle (hard sausage form) and had a ton of great flavor. I will definitely be returning to Be Coffee on my next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Been twice in a week and can't wait to go back.  Cold brew is really good and the bread they use for their breakfast sandwiches is amazing.  I like the onion roll and the wheat.  Nice people too."}
{"text":"Came here after going to three other spots disappointed with the wait time, smell of the location etc. Immediately after coming in the intense aroma of the food hits you. So yummy! The staff was utterly polite, friendly, and courteous. The food was so damn good. We had the Egg Sammy with tomato avocado and muenster cheese and I had the Chorizo scramble.  The Americano coffee was fresh and delicious. Definitely worth a visit!!!"}
{"text":"Stop by BE to get a cup of coffee and some breakfast.  I can say the service was top notch.  The coffee is good, the Tomato Avocado Egg Scrambled Sandwich was off the charts!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop! They have a cafe and art studio right next to it in a nice spot on Roosevelt Row. The cold brew is good, the atmosphere is even better. Service is a little slow but very friendly. Prices are a little expensive for my taste but still a good place to go with a close friend for a nice chat in a cool spot. Very chill."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Great location. Amazing food. My husband is a picky eater and he loved it here. It was definitely a win win."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm a something like a coffee snob and had been looking for a good shop while on a business trip. I finally struck gold with this place. The Ethiopian pour over was life giving with a cool flavor profile. The all day burrito was also amazing! I could literally eat it all day, but the way my metabolism set up... The vibe is cool as well!"}
{"text":"On my first visit to Be, I just ordered an iced black and white... but I had a few questions (did they have white mocha?  How many espresso shots in a large beverage?).  The answers are \"yes\" and \"2\".

The service is outstanding for a coffee shop!  The girl at the register was super informative and helpful in answering my questions and making recommendations.  The barista made a fantastic-tasting espresso drink.  And another gentleman even approached us and asked if we would like a food menu or to be seated for dinner.  

And Be also happens to have an art gallery as well!  We chose a seat on a couch with a view of many of the art pieces.

Wow... this is the kind of place that I will probably end up spending countless hours getting my caffeine on and being while being productive with work!

I cannot wait to actually try some food items off of their menu.  I mean, have you seen the pictures and other reviews?!?  The sandwiches look and sound amazing!

I'm in love with Be.

*****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"I came by Be a couple weeks ago while (sort of) doing the meet me downtown walk. I was surprised at how different Be is from Songbird in décor... they really made the space their own. I had their cold brew and it was fabulous! I really enjoyed it. The husband tried the latte and it was not so fabulous.... it was alright. Anyway, the service here was great and the food looks good, we'll have to come back to try it sometime!"}
{"text":"I really liked the friendliness of the baristas here, but the toast was very disappointing, hence the three rather than four stars. For a house made Nutella, this piece of toast only had some Nutella drizzle on top of the banana and nothing to hold the banana in place atop of the toast! Structural integrity of the toast aside, the cold brew (I tried the regular and the spicy version) is decent, but a bit acidic. Given the other options around here, this place did not make my favorites, though I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in hear quickly for breakfast before we flew home to the east coast. The service was amazing and the food was delicious! The ambiance of the place is cool and artistic! Great place! Definitely a must to try. We got two sammys, a salad, Nutella toast and a cookie! Nothing was a disappoint! Make sure you try it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while visiting Phoenix.  Thanks Yelp for sending us to get best breakfast sandwich ever!  Customer service was awesome!!  Eggs were perfectly seasoned with avocado and tomato (turkey and ham available) on the best English toasted muffin.  Also had a mocha - Simply delish.  I had coconut milk but many milk choices available and handmade syrup (not the corn syrup stuff).  Will definitely stop in again when in Phoenix.  For you locals, you have to treat yourself to an A++ breakfast!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe. Small coffee shop that is attached to a large art studio and yoga studio in the back where they were doing Ariel yoga. 

Husband and I both had the avocado egg sandwich. He switched his bread to a onion roll. Both sandwiches had a fair amount of mayo which made the sandwiches slippery. 

Seating is limited and not very conducive for small kids, even thought they had high chairs. 

We got the iced coffee, one regular and one spicy. The regular was rather bitter. Spicy grew on me, made with two kinds of peppers. Kudos for creativity. We ended up mixing the two and enjoyed the combined coffees."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent customer service, and a very comfortable atmosphere. I loved that you can order everything any way you want. A+!"}
{"text":"Cool looking inside. Nice staff. It's a an early weekend morning, there's just a few people here so not super busy. The \"cooks\" make one item at a time before they move to the next. Super inefficient to not start multiple orders like a normal food services cafe. Waiting more that 18 minutes so far for a chorizo sandwich to go...gave them two stars but they got three since they gave me a free chai refill for my wait."}
{"text":"Love the spot and all the people that work here. I eat the B Sammy like 3 times a week at this point. Best breakfast sandwich downtown IMO. The pour overs are great and the house made cookies are huge and delicious. It took me 3 days to finish it. Haha. It's become my go to coffee shop in the hood."}
{"text":"Traveled to Phoenix with my boyfriend and our hotel did not have complimentary breakfast, so we found this little gem on Yelp! It's a small space, but offers the rustic, unfinished, hipster vibe we all crave when looking for a great coffee spot. 

We both ordered a 12 oz hot latte and the tomato, avocado and egg breakfast sandwich. The latte had a great, smooth espresso flavor and the sandwiches were HUGE and so tasty!! 

If you get a chance to try this place, definitely do it. Also, their customer service was fantastic. Troy immediately greeted us and took the time to get to know us when he brought out our orders...very nice guy! 

Will be back next time we travel to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"i loved both the food and coffee here. got the be sammy + avocado + meat and enjoyed the fuhhhh outta it (except the mayo part -- i didn't know there was gonna be mayo). seating is OK, but there's not a lot when the place gets a lil busier. the only thing missing here is the fact that they don't have bacon :("}
{"text":"Came here because it was close to our AirBnB. So glad we did!! The barista was very helpful and accommodating when my husband asked to swap cheeses on his egg sandwich. And very patient and understanding when a patron asked to confirm that his drink had almond milk instead of regular milk. The cold brew was delicious both black and with a splash of cream. I ordered the whole grain toast with ricotta and strawberry-rhubarb jam. It was so good! You could tell the bread was toasted on the flat top because it had a fantastic crunch to it that you don't get with a toaster. I imagine their grilled cheese is excellent based on how tasty the toast was. We were able to get our food to-go, so I got to slather the ricotta and jam on myself. I could just eat that jam out of the little cup it came in. Very good and highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am in shock, by how good a breakfast sandwich could be. The creamy sauce filling every spare corner of the savory, crunchy, doughy goodness of their slightly seasoned English Muffin. The perfectly fluffed egg punctuated by the ripe and tangy tomato and decadent avocado.

The Nutella toast? It's Nutella (hello) with ripened bananas on a sweet soft bread with salt, adding a lovely savoriness and flavor dimension.

Forget about it, go, and just enjoy. You will not be disappointed in any food choice, that is for certain.

Stay for rhetoric wonderful ambiance and art.

Two Thumbs, and all Appendages up."}
{"text":"What are you doing?  Just go.  You will sell yourself short if you go anywhere but here.  Wonderful food and the staff are super nice."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches are fairly priced for what you're buying. Buuut I won't come back due to the poor service. I understand everyone has off days but you never want to put that onto your customers who are most likely having a good day off enjoying breakfast. To wait forever for your food and then when it finally arrives to be greeted with \"sorry I'm having an off day because it's just one of those days - I know I dropped the ball on you guys\" - a better response would have been \"hey guys! Thanks for being so patient, I hope you enjoy - is there anything else I can get for you?\" 

It's sad that poor customer service can ruin a place you once enjoyed."}
{"text":"I adore this place. It's the coffee shop I alternate with Lux Central so neither shop's baristas think I'm weird. The baristas always remember my name (even though I've only been a few times) and the food/iced mochas are delish. There's a little plant shop inside, and for some reason that I haven't quite figured out, there's this adorable dog (maybe a boxer mix?) wandering around the shop all the time. I love that guests just let their dogs walk around without a leash -- it makes the place feel even cozier and friendlier than it already is. 

Do yourself a favor and try the mocha, which is supposedly made with homemade chocolate ganache, and the Be Sammy. AMAZING."}
{"text":"Great place to Be! (Lololol)

Nah for real, Be is an awesome place to catch up with a friend or catch up on work!

I love the roasters that they have brought in for the most part! Their cookies are a highlight for me personally!

{"text":"Amazing experience! Hipsters eat your hearts out, but the common man can enjoy himself too. If you're looking for an adventure, try a crew's choice. Got the \"Bad Boy\" and I will certainly be trying to replicate it back home. More spots like this will make the world a better place. Quality espresso and food. Also outlets and wifi."}
{"text":"Talk about BEing awesome! This place has got it going on! Love the drip coffee service they have going on. And they are always coming up with new stuff all the time!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, even on Labor Day. The English Egg Sammy was hands down the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had! Add to that a fantastical cold brew coffee, and did I mention the super friendly staff... 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast sandwich! Super fluffy scrambled eggs, crisp delicious ham, and melty muenster cheese! Highly recommend! Staff was super friendly and welcoming. The space is pretty cool too. Shared with an art gallery and little shop."}
{"text":"Great cold brew and breakfast sandwiches, and the plant advice from the little shop inside was awesome!"}
{"text":"Get the \"Be Sammy\" with meunster cheese. Best breakfast sandwich in Phoenix. I go here at least once a week. Super awesome staff too 10/10"}
