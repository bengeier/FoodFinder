{"text":"Really good take-out. Good quality meat and pieces of vegetables. I get the beef hakka noodles. I think they are getting better over time!

I haven't tried every Asian takeout place in the area, but this is at the top of my list for Meadowvale/Churchill Meadows. Keep up the good work. Will be back often!"}
{"text":"Though the food is good but they have The most pathetic service ever!!!! They have no idea how to handle service in rush hours"}
{"text":"I go here for the lunch specials. Chili chicken with hakka noodles doesn't fail.  Service is speedy and the staff are efficient."}
{"text":"Had their chili chicken, bombay chicken, and manchurian chicken. Best dish was probably the manchurian. Right amount of spice, and tastes delicious. If you go for lunch, you can get it for $6+tax, and it comes with a spring roll and pop. Really good deal since its available 7 days a week."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat when i'm in the area. 
Good service, food taste great and cost is reasonable."}
{"text":"I been going here for few years now. And love the food and the service. Spicy deep fried fish is my fav :)"}
{"text":"I went with 3 friends and ordered 6 different dishes.  We ate our fill and had enough food for another meal!  Love the variety of offerings at this restaurant!  

The service was fast and efficient and the staff were very friendly.  

I recommend this location!"}
{"text":"The food is good, with large portions and at a great value.

The problem is the service. I prefer the other Tangerine locations.  At this one, they tend to cater to their Indian clientele.  I was seated with 2 Asian friends, and the two tables (Indian descent)  that came after us had their orders taken and their food served first.  

At least the food was good."}
{"text":"This place does Hakka food--that is a fusion of Chinese & Indian, for those not aware.  In reality, they also do pure Chinese, Thai and other various random dishes.

Definitely not a superb dining place... decor is pretty blah, service is barely acceptable, but the hey.. there is always the ultimate upside--food is cheap!  Dirt cheap.  

Lunch only:  $5.95 -$6.95, for \"something-on-rice\"... 

What is that something?  Chicken & mixed vegetables, mango chicken, general whoever chicken, etc.. All in all, they had a choice of about 30 lunch dishes.

I recommend crispy ginger chicken.  It was breaded chicken pieces, deep fried, in a spice/sweet/sour sauce.  It had a lot of orange zest, which was a nice touch.  The bombay chicken was quite good too (sampled my friends'), which was quite spicy/garlicky/coriandory. 

Oh, and they also throw in a pretty bad spring roll and a can of soda (or in my case, a Nestle bottled water).

For you lazy asses who never pack lunch and eat out all the time, here is a good alternative. Cheaper than your $6.99 Wendy's salad and you still get a drink :)"}
{"text":"Bombay chicken was really good. Also, enjoyed the noodles."}
{"text":"Can't believe they still have a halal sign posted outside.. Don't eat here if you're vegetarian or have Islamic dietary needs! It is not halal"}
{"text":"Probably the best deal in Toronto. Very good food...good prices...huge portions Third time here. Better each time."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Tangerine for lunch.
We ordered Beef with black bean sauce and Chicken Cantonese Chow mein. We asked them if they can make both dishes spicy. They turned around and said it's an additional .50 cents per dish to have them make it spicy.

We advised them that FREDERICKS does not charge this to make dishes spicy. What resteraunt charges .50 cents more to make a dish spicy. My wife and I have gone to many resteraunts around the world and within the GTA and no one charges extra to have your dish made spicy. This is our first and LAST time ever go there. Please spend your money elsewhere if you are looking to have a good meal. 

Thanks."}
{"text":"this review is just for the lunch special.

there is a different menu at lunch for the lunch special. i think its 6.99 or 7.99 depending on what you get (the menu is split in half depending on price).

it is a combo (kinda like a prix fixe)

spring roll, entree, plus pop or soup

the entrees include many popular hakka dishes. my favorites at this location from lunch items is chili chicken,garlic chicken, mango chicken - but there are many more items to choose from - they have vegetarian items if you are attending with a non-meat eater

you can substitute fried rice or noodles for an optional 1.00 charge.

the portion sizes are large. If you are attending with multiple people there is more than enough to share if you order multiple combos - and this is the way to go if you are attending for lunch - you can still order off regular menu at lunch if you with though.

the service is fast and friendly. This place can get very busy at lunch - but they have lots of tables and on their busiest days I have waited maybe 5 minutes or so for a table.

I don't think I have ever left this place disappointed. I have eaten at this location at least 20 times (i'm a creature of habit :)

there are many hakka places in the area - but this is the one I keep coming back to. DO NOT confuse it with 'tangerine express' across the street -despite their claims that its the same owner/franchise etc - its not - what happened there is that soem o the staff left the original and set up their own restaurant - hows that for an 'east side- west side' conflict?"}
{"text":"Hmmm.. I had pretty high expectations of this restaurant because my friends rave about it. The food is very good and all the standard hakka dishes quite excellent. I knock these guys down because of the bad customer service. Honestly, I felt like we were not welcomed at this restaurant. The owner, older gentleman seemed nice, but the other staff just gave our group dirty looks and were very rude to us as soon as we walked in and throughout the evening. Do we have a neon sign that said \"shit bags - kick me\"? 

This is one of those places where I would just order takeout for their food, but would never again eat here in person. Dining in a restaurant, I don't expect to have ass-kissing, but man, would really love it if decent respect is given to customers. Just be a human being and be nice! Why bother working in the service industry if you are there to be rude, give dirty looks, and treat customers like shit! This was my first visit here, they perhaps confused me with a lookalike who gave them a hard time. Hope management reads this as your staff needs some training on human decency."}
{"text":"There are no major signs from the road to find the place.The time right now is 21:40, they close at 22:00 and they didn't allow us to dine in."}
{"text":"Very unprofessional and disgusting customer service. Host and manager was very aggressive in nature when I found a stone in my fried rice. Manager yelled at me, attempting to indicate that it was my fault. Food is okay but based on this experience, I never intend on going back."}
{"text":"What?! Must order: Sweet n Sour Chicken Balls and Crispy Ginger Chicken or Beef


SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good

Yah like another reviewer said 'do not order the pad thai!!' 
it was bland."}
{"text":"This is the best Hakka restaurant in the east city... If u live anywhere in Durham or Scarborough.. It's definitely worth taking a trip down here"}
{"text":"Restaurant layout is good.  Service was okay.  But food at this location is mediocre at best.  Portions are small for the price they charge and the taste is pretty bland.  Of particular note is the Cantonese Chow Mein we ordered.  Sauce was seriously watery.  It tasted like they used borvil beef stock syrup, water and a thickening agent (Corn starch) then threw in the meat/veggie/shrimp and dumped it on the noodles.  The shrimp they used were so small....

I won't go back there or any Tangerine Asian Cuisine based on my experience at this location."}
{"text":"My office gets take-out from Tangerine regularly and we always enjoy the food. We decided to eat in for lunch at tangerine, and it was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. We had 3 coupons that we planned on using for 6 people in our office, and the manager rudely told us that we would only be allowed to use 1 coupon. This policy is not stated on the coupons and these coupons were paid for in the Entertainment Coupon Savings book. The manager was extremely rude to my group, and we left without ordering. I would never return to this restaurant because of the poor experience and treatment from the manager. I've also reported them to the Entertainment Coupon Savings book because this is extremely poor business practice to not accept the face value of coupons. I would not recommend Tangerine to anyone."}
{"text":"this is 3.5 stars.

I've been coming here for years. the quality has dipped a bit but I keep coming back because its still a great lunch value. (for 6 or 7 bucks you get a main, rice, and a soup or soft drink) I've had chili chicken, szechuan chicken, garlic sauce chicken. all of them are things i would recommend. the amount of oil they use is a bit much though...

good food great value. i would give it another star but their quality has dipped a bit from awesome to merely 'very good'"}
{"text":"Just went there and ordered the house special fried rice[chicken n shrimp] chicken Hakka noodle and the Bombay chicken and all I can say is amazing. Right about of spice and great flavour. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came on looking for recent reviews to see if this place has improved since my first visit before deciding to return for a second. Reviews have not changed. And so I will add what my first pickup visit (about 6 months ago) was like. Crap. Bland. portion size  for cost, was definitely not in line. Food was Bland. Bland. Bland."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5! Not as good as Federick's. Recommend the mango chicken and spicy garlic fish."}
{"text":"LOVE the food...Great vegetarian/halal options, good portion sizes and not too bad prices. Definitely recommend to people."}
{"text":"Easily the best Hakka food in the city. I tried all other 'top' Hakka spots and none were even close.

The portions are large and the price is good. Food is ready in under 10 minutes usually.

The place is always very clean. Staff is friendly.

Try the crispy ginger chicken, Bombay chicken, chilli chicken, mango chicken, chicken pakora."}
{"text":"Tasty! Cool!! They was lunch specials for $5.99, better than the nearby burger joint ;-)"}
{"text":"Never had a problem with service or food . Keep it up & to all u out there.  Don't be negative about they business  . I have tried at a lot of Hakka restaurant  so far they have been consistent with they food so stop bashing  and enjoy they food ."}
{"text":"I was excited to notice this location after hearing great things about their east end location. I have no plans to go back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, a big fan of this place, their chicken pakora (fried chicken in a batter) is really good, even better is their Tangergine's Bombay chicken. Their house special Hakka noodle is good as well. Most of their food is spicy.

If only this place was closer to where I live, I'll come here almost everyweek. They are always busy so make reservations if you can."}
{"text":"I have absolutely no clue how anyone has been able to give this place more than a couple of stars. My husband and I just managed to choke down parts of their Cantonese dinner for two and an order of Cantonese chow mein.

The noodles were drowning in a flavourless sauce, and more than half the noodles were still in a raw state. 

The beef with almonds and vegetables was bland, and devoid of seasoning or flavour. The sweet and sour chicken was coated in far too much batter, and the meat inside had a ton of fat and gristle. 

The chicken fried rice was the dim highlight of the meal. No serious complaints there.

Overall, the experience has left us extremely disappointed. Although we were given a credit for the uncooked chow mein noodles, we will not be using it. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is authentic and fresh, large portions and (usually) quick service. Our favourite are the chicken pakora and Mongolian Beef."}
{"text":"We went in to pick up a takeout order. They send you to the back and treat you like a second-class customer if you're not dining in. Then, after ordering more than $60 worth of food, we find out when we get home that they didn't put in two of the main dishes. When we called, they told us they'd credit that amount to us. The restaurant is far from our house, so I asked if we could come in another day to get reimbursed. They said that was fine, but then when we did just two days later, they wouldn't refund the money, the manger accused me of trying to cheat him, and they totally ignored my brother and I afterward. Turned off of their food for good.. And I think Lee's Wok on Kennedy is way better anyway."}
{"text":"I normally do not write negative reviews but anyone going to this location please refuse to be served by an old disgruntled Asian waiter. This old man made my young son wait for 45 minutes before he gave him our order of 2 items. This was at 4:15 pm when there were less than 10 people in the restaurant. The nasty man made us pay in advance because his intention was to harass us. We counted at least 5 people who walked into the place after us, placed their order and still got their large orders served before ours. I have taken food out of this restaurant many times earlier but have never had such a horrid experience. The man was definitely racist or a sadistic. Neither are virtues I would want from someone touching my food. Bad karma."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have received in my life. Our chicken manchurian and chili chicken tasted the same. We order spicy deep fried fish and received pieces of soggy fish on which the fried batter was falling off. The chow Mein was extremely spicy, almost inedible. When told the server about the food, he argued to make his point. We waiting 25 mins to get ice which is kind of ready made. I went on a recommendation and was deeply disappointed. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place. We ordered chicken pakora, chicken corn soup, their special fried rice, fish in hot garlic sauce and chili chicken. I must say they were all delicious! 
Highly recommend the chicken pakora and the fish is hot garlic sauce! Reasonably  priced and good portions. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a long overdue lunch date with a group of friends. The service was excellent. There was water on our tables within seconds of being seated. Really it was almost as if the water magically appeared. I totally didn't even notice the waiter bring the water! Shortly afterwards they came to take our order. No fuss when we needed more time. The waitress was very patient with us as we changed the order she had just taken :|
We ordered two lunch specials and one dish from the main menu between two people thinking the lunch portions would be small. However just one lunch portion was more than enough food for two people to share. The portions are HUGE! Can't go wrong for $5-7 when it includes a soup/spring roll or pop! 
The food itself was delicious. We ordered Hakka noddles with Manchurian veg balls. The Manchurian veg balls were so great! they were small and a little crispy on the outside. Just perfect with the right amount of spice. We also ordered the Cantonese noodles, but those were just OK. I probably wouldn't order again. Not enough veggies and the sauce wasn't as sweet as other places.

Needless to say, I could hardly breathe when I was done. I couldn't let all the deliciousness go to waste! All in all, this place is great. So great in fact, I went and got take-out two days later! :|
Highly recommeded!"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable!  
A combination that is hard to find. 
Ginger beef was the best I've ever had but all the other dishes I have tried have been really good as well."}
{"text":"There isn't that much asian food this north of Richmond Hill, so I was happy to see Tangerine open up. The food is great for the price. My only complaint would be that they pack too much rice in their dishes, and not enough of the main.

I've gotten take out from them many times and they're always pretty prompt, even when they're extremely busy. Would definitely continue going back. 

I wish they accept debit / credit under $10, as their lunch specials are usually under $10 a person. It's annoying to have to go to the bank to withdraw cash before picking up my food."}
{"text":"I agree with Dennis Q that they're just ok. Been to better places like this. But with decent prices its a good deal, but I find the food too oily."}
{"text":"I had heard about Tangerine from a friend of mine, and then realized it is in the plaza beside my  periodontist. So, being stuck in Scarborough, hungry after a tremendously long appointment we decided to grab a bite before fighting rush hour traffic back DT.  

the SO and I entered, sat down and were offered Chinese Tea ($2). The place is newish, very clean, so that's fine. We ordered based on the servers recommendations, all items marked 2 chili. (presumably spicy)

We had a beef dish, the chili and garlic eggplant dry, and Szechuan fish wet. The fish sauce was VERY gloopy. The unfortunate thing was that NONE of the dishes were spicy what-so-ever. We were liberally dousing our meals with the table-top chili sauce. You would only assume that two chillis on the menu, and asking for the \"spiciest\" would get you a small amount of heat? 

It was fine, run of the mill, cheap Chinese food. Which was a shame as I wanted Hakka, or SPICE in the least. Service was ok, I would not rush here by any means but we might return of in the same situation again. I will be very clear with my want for HEAT next time. Disappointing. 

to the 1 star review... you really expected good PAD THAI from a CHINESE/INDIAN restaurant? Are you dreaming? 

I'm with Min Min. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant and used to think the food was amazing. I FOUND A BUG IN MY SOUP. IT WAS GROSS. Health department should check with them."}
{"text":"Main protein is always plentiful and lots of it. Delicious. Many times the fried rice is slightly burned and you can taste it. There is no pork at all on the menu. Staff is prompt and efficient as the place is always busy. We eat there at least once a week and are always impressed, usually lunch time, and we always leave with leftovers. Very inexpensive for the quality and quantity you receive."}
{"text":"I really like their chicken pakoras! Chili fish dry is also very tasty so is the Hakka chow mein. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go.
Great prices, and great menu. They have Lunch specials that are 7$ which includes a filling portion, a pop, and a spring roll. Dinner menu is also great!

Personally I recommend the Thai green curry with beef or chicken, the Chili Chicken is also good, and if you're looking for an appetizer I always go with chicken pakora. The Ellesmere/Dolly Varden location has excellent customer service, always ready with water & a smile!"}
{"text":"definitely has good food and the portion sizes are very large so if highly recommend sharing"}
{"text":"What an incredibly horrible experience. This establishment truly doesn't understand the integrity of customer service nor do they comprehend how to retain loyal customers. Their food is lack luster and the (what I believe) was the management staff isn't the brightest.
Their 'Bombay fried rice' is a poor imitation of Lucky's Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice (which, btw you've failed miserably at) and the majority of their dishes are doused in salt, with leaves your mouth in sores.
Having requested an order avialable for 7:30pm (calling in advance at 5:15om) we were left to wait for an additional 20 minutes before collecting our items, further to that when I called to ask for an approximate time I was told 'You don't understand.. YOu need to understand, there are 131 people in the queue ahead of you' 'if I am talking to you on the phone how can I expedite the order' leading me to believe the person who was talking to me was truly the only one working in the establishment and my asking for an ETA was that major of request leads me to believe the staff lacks time management and proper customer experience etiquette.
Further to that, apparently there were other patrons waiting for an extended period of time, with one customer having to go to the front asking if her order was ready, when in fact, it was, all bagged up and ready to go, but she wasn't notified until she asked!!!!!!!

Lucky's has and will continue to be the market leader in the GTA for authentic, GOOD tasting, great customer service Hakka Chinese Food.

Please think twice before visiting or placing a take out order at Tangerine."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to place when we want to go out to eat. Since we discovered this restaurant, we find ourselves there at least once a month.  The food is great and the service is always hospitable. They are really great at modifying their dishes to your liking. The Chef's Special Steamed Fish is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Why do I see 4 & 5 stars??? seriously the most lousy General Tao , Pad Thai and Steamed dumplings I have had so far. I am so upset for driving all the way to pick up such tasteless food . Dumplings were so hard , and the rest were just plain sweet.  Horrible!!"}
{"text":"Service is somewhat decent, waiter always has some stupid comments or jokes(not very funny) food quality was very bad! Ordered Chicken corn soup (was ok) and ordered the chicken with broccoli (more like broccoli with chicken) not that great at all. Ate there a handful of time only because there is not much other options in this area, the last time I ate there the chicken was spoiled and got a bad stomach ache."}
{"text":"Spicy potato spring rolls are good!  The prawn dishes are good too.  I've had quite a few different prawn dishes and I only wish I got more prawns but you can never get enough.  The green curry beef is good.  Take out is hot and fresh.  Dine in is nice and a clean place.  Much better then the old Pizza Hut that was there prior.  The noodles are good, mango chicken, manchurian chicken and hot and sour soup. 

Every time I pick up my take out for dinner there is a few people dinning in.  Not packed and I think this place deserves to be filled up at dinner time.  They do good lunch time business as we were in good company.  They gave a discount for paying cash!  We got a re-useable take out bag with one of our orders.  

So far my experiences are all positive so far and I hope people in the community support this place and allow them to continue to server fresh food with good service."}
{"text":"This is the worst,trashiest restaurant I have ever been to. Their service was trash, they served food but then the remaining oil caused so much smoke that I suffocated and I had to run outside. Never go to tangerine."}
{"text":"Came by here for some food and we ended up ordering a few items.  They had 1 really memorable dish and that was the tiger prawns in spicy garlic sauce.

Ok
- Chili chicken, dry
- Bombay chicken
- Hakka noodles (on the border of like and not like)
- Chicken pakora's
- Shrimp pakora's

Did not like
- Manchurian fish
- Pan fried dumplings

I probably won't come back here with some of the better Toronto styled Hakka places close to here.  I would come back for a meal if nothing else was open though and I had a craving."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great food, large portions. I went with 5 of my girlfriends and we were all very pleased. No wait time, fast service and very affordable! Very Happy."}
{"text":"So nice to have a Hakka style restaurant so close to home...no need to drive out to Markham Rd. anymore.

Manchurian Chicken (dry)!!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place. Manchurian anything is good here! Fair pricing."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on Saturday, April 20th to pick up a phone order. The lady who took the order (who happened to speak in a very thick accent) had trouble listening to me and I had to repeat myself several times to finally place the order. Unfortunately, when I arrived there, I discovered that they took the order wrong for one of the items (instead of Mongolian Chicken, they prepared Manchurian Chicken). I advised the cashier about the mix up, and she said there is no way they would have taken the wrong order. They also have multiple people stand behind the counter. One of the males who was standing behind the counter stepped in and repeated what the other cashier said. I found this person to be extremely condescending. He went onto spell out the term \"Mongolian\" to me, and insisted that the mistake was on my part when I placed the order. I politely asked him what could be done to fix things, to which he responded, \"what would I do with the wrong dish then\". I could not believe both his audacity and rudeness. In the end, he hesitantly agreed to give me the right dish I ordered. While I waited there for the right dish to be prepared, that person spoke with another gentleman in their own language and he didn't seem too happy. I was able to only make out the terms \"Mongolian\" and \"Manchurian\" from their conversation. Overall, it was a terrible customer experience. 

If you do happen to place an order ahead of time, please ask the person taking the order to repeat it back to you even if they are busy and try to rush you (sometimes they are busy, especially on the weekends."}

{"text":"Terrible customer service, servers brought my friend the wrong dish and when she asked for it to be sent back the owner threw a fit and threatened to call the cops"}
{"text":"My first night ever in Toronto. After rejecting the crap/flop Hotel my hosts sent me to (relocating at my own expense to the Holiday Inn Express nearby) it was time for my \"first night dinner\". \"FND\" is a tradition I have where I get to my port of call a day early with fuck-all to do 'cept check in to the Hotel and find somewhere good to eat. Preferably a Local star, and something I might not get in Chicago. 
Consulting YELP, of course, I spied all the nearby joints were Oriental in one way or another. A closer read showed me something I ain't never seen before-a cuisine called \"Hakka\" which is a meld of Indian/Chinese. WHOA! Now you're talkin'! There were three places in the area that serves this cuisine, with Tangerine the closest to my Hotel and highest rated.
The little strip mall where Tangerine was located wasn't the most picturesque place I've been to, and Tangerine itself was a basic storefront. Crowded for a Tuesday night, too.The service was a bit terse, then again I was prolly the only Occidental in there. The menu was long and involved, but I was able to suss out the \"Hakka\" dishes.
I ordered some Chili Samosas and \"Himalayan Soup\", for starters with a Spicy Shrimp Curry for Entree. The Samosas were hot as hell in flavor-just the way I like it. And a BIG order as well. Tasty! \"Himalayan Soup\" was unlike anything I've ever had, and was very very tasty-not spicy though. The Spicy Shrimp curry packed a mighty chilli punch and took me to the Capiscum-endorphin temple I seldom come across in restaurants. I ordered some Green Tea Ice cream for afters.
The whole meal was very very satisfying and prices were commensurate with the quality and how much you got (I took plenty back to my Hotel room)
A great great feed, with indifferent service, but not bad enough to keep me away from here next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm no Hakka expert but I've liked what I've ordered at this location. My family normally orders the Tiger prawns in lobster sauce and the ginger beef. Not an expensive place but it sucks that they don't do fountain pop.  READ: no refills!  Not a biggie for most people but it is for me!"}
{"text":"Their food is food and tasty. I love their Bombay chicken.its really spicy; so if you love spice this the best dish to order. For something sweet I get the crust ginger beef. I also love their ho fun noodles. Their spicy soup is also very spicy nut good if you are sick. The staff are also friendly."}
{"text":"Go for the lunch special. And make sure you get the bombay chicken. You will noy regret it."}
{"text":"Worst customer experience of my life. They wouldn't switch a dish that was not labelled or described correctly in their menu and tasted like a bowl of salt and water. Do not go here, they just want your money. So rude."}
{"text":"Excellent Asian fusion. Every time we come here for take it there's as big a lineup for pickup as there are people waiting to dine in. It's about time we started to see more and more cultural food choices up here in suburbia! Tangerine does a fantastic job blending sweets and spices from Asian and Indian dishes, so that we can enjoy not doing the dishes! Seriously, they are an excellent Asian dining experience. We will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place. Typically all the food on there menu were great. The portions are average size since I have a huge appetite. I would recommend the beef fried rice mixed in hot and sour soup. It was the first time I've tried something so delicious. It was like a new flavour altogether.
The dine-in service is typically good. The place is very clean which I do not see in many asian cuisines. It also has a great atmosphere with comfortable seating.
Overall, I regularly have my meals here."}
{"text":"Bombay chicken or fish depending on your mood both are excellent. Szechwan or chilli eggplant are favs. Mango lassi is reasonably priced. Kulfi generous helping at the end. It is a pistachio flavor and very tasty. It reminds me of creamy kulfi from india.  The service is prompt but i still dont get whether each dish comes with steamed rice as sometimes they serve it and sometimes not."}
{"text":"Went recently and quality was not so good. Shrimp was not fresh and egg plant tough. I hope it was a one time thing but i dont want to go back."}
{"text":"Great place with tons of choice for Indian chinese food. Quantity is great and prices are very reasonable. Friendly staff. Good expe5each time I have visited here."}
{"text":"Awesome place.. have been there with a large group and so have had chance to try a lot of dishes.. and every dish was tasty. the only chinese place i enjoy in toronto"}
{"text":"Best Chinese place ever.  If you are from Mumbai then try Bombay chicken, taste is similar. For just $9, you get pretty good quantity. Order egg fried rice and not plain rice, its better."}
{"text":"I have lots of family who live out in east Markham and whenever we have family get togethers or functions, they often cater from Tangerine. Consistently, I have been let down by this restaurant. 

I'm not so much disappointed by the food so much as I am disappointed by the people who praise this restaurant so much. The food is average and many of their dishes taste the same, especially the chicken based ones. 

The hakka food here does not hold a candle to Szechuan Gourmet, Frederick's, Lin Garden or Bombay Chopstix so why all the praise? What amazing hakka restaurant has a thai dish section on their menu? It is my firm belief that if you're good at something stick to it, if hakka is your forté then serve hakka dishes. Very rarely can restaurants branch off and successfully master more than one type of cuisine and Tangerine is not one of them. 

Best thing about this restaurant is that they serve liquor. 

And let me close with \"to each their own\". If people didn't have differing opinions and subjective experiences, Yelp would not successfully exist."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Hakka style Indian chinese food."}
{"text":"People in Markham/Scarborough sure love their Hakka food. It's this spicy asian cuisine which seems to be sort of addictive. Deep fried, stir fried whatever you have it. 
I have been going here since it first opened back when I was in elementary school. It's so good!  Service can be good. 

Tangerine was a staple from back in the day at this location in Markham. I've tried way too many dishes to count, but they've been a variety of the seafood, chicken , rice and noodle dishes. All adjustable according to your spice levels. It's a nice casual atmosphere with decent decor. Enough to have a small party or dinner with a group of family/friends.

Good soups too for when you're feeling sick!

Decent prices for dinner and good lunch deals!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best hakka restaurant in Markham. Like everything else at Markham and 14th, the parking and traffic is terrible down there.

The pakoras are great, as are most of the other dishes, like chili chicken in particular. We've had a few duds though, such as some of the seafood dishes. Overall, a great restaurant though!"}
{"text":"Edit: forgot to mention that the waiter told me they can't make it dry when the menu said you can request it to be made dry. 

So disappointed...I used to come here during lunch time from work to get the dry chili chicken with noodles...they Apparebtly don't make it for dinner because it's not the lunch *special*. The staff gave me dirty looks for the *request* too. Guess they don't know how to treat recurring customers. 

Guess I'm not coming back again..."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for 8:15. Called around 8:10 to let them know we were still coming but we were just running a little late. The girl told me that the food had been sitting there since 8:00. I asked her if it would be cold by the time we got there as they made it 15 minutes early and she had told me : \"maybe. But that's not my problem\". She handed the phone to a guy who kept asking what I wanted to order (zero communication between co workers). I explained that the food I ordered was made early and that it might be cold by the time I got there and he yelled at me and said : \" I have had other customers who come an hour late and their food is still hot \" and hung up. Apparently they defy the concept of food going cold. I came in at 8:20 and the food was room temperature. As I stood there, waiting to pay, I watched as a young man was taking orders on the phone. He was rolling his eyes the entire time, and obnoxiously chewing gum ! When paying, they spoke in a different language which made me uncomfortable as they were probably speaking about me since they mentioned the food I ordered . Safe to say I didn't tip. If you're looking for terrible customer service and want to leave feeling disrespected, this is the place for you. I'd stay away."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, when looking for something quick, tasty and, I'll admit, a bit greasy. This place is slightly 'better' than your regular Chinese take-out places, but with the inclusion of Hakka items. I wouldn't say anything really stands out about the food and some items are more consistently made than others. This place does a 10% discount for cash orders (surprise, I wonder why!) but since HST is 13%, there's not much of a 'shared benefit', if you get what I'm saying *wink wink*. I'm sure I'll go again. It's tasty enough."}
{"text":"I think this is the best tasting Chinese food I have had. Have been many times, and am always pleased."}
{"text":"Upgrading to 5 stars because of the \"Chilli Fish dry\"!  Lunch special is only $5.95 and comes with a either a soup or spring roll or pop.  This is my new favourite Hakka dish along with the crispy ginger beef.  So crispy and tasty with the onions, garlic and pepper.  You have to try it dry because I think too much sauce would just make for a soggy texture and would become boring after a few spoons."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the service was insanely slow both times. The food was great; very hot and fresh, but it's not worth the wait. I could go to many other restaurants in the area and get the same quality of food in half the time. It took at least 20min for someone to take our order and another 20min to get it. I was about to leave when they finally took our order. We had to go to the counter to get the bill and take out containers. Our glasses were never refilled nor did anyone come by to check on us. It wasn't a busy night, not half full.

I recommend getting take out."}
{"text":"Decent fusion food. It served as a great place to pick up quick to-go meal upon arriving in TO after a long plane flight from the states. 

Service is quick, and our order was accurate.. I hope to sample more of their menu the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment a few months ago, it is very close to my house but I've still never gone again here is why.

      It was grey, gloomy, cool summer day. Perfect for warm comforting, spicy Chinese food, with an Indian twist. Being Pakistani I've eaten Hakka lots of times, and love it. However all Hakka is not cooked equal. I ordered the kung pow chiken. Greasy, dry, chewy, and bland meat. Undercooked, salty, bad rice. And a plethora of stale peanuts, and mushy celery, that created a disgusting texture. Please keep your food away from me."}
{"text":"Sad to see that this location closed before I got my review in.

Not going to waste time going in depth here, but the food was good. Pretty much on par with other Hakka places in the area, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I will forever be grateful to Tangerine for bringing an amazing hakka option to Richmond Hill! This has been our go-to place for the last year or so as we are huge fans of hakka fare but the trek to Scarborough/Markham is always an encumbrance. 

We were here on Tuesday night (six people) and ordered:
+Chicken Pakora (10 pieces): These were a great start to the meal - tender and nicely spiced. I prefer the pakora at Federick but these were still great, especially with the green chili sauce.

+Mango Chicken: We order this every time! It's similar to a general tso chicken but we like it better as we don't see it offered elsewhere whereas general tso is generally a hakka staple. If you don't like having some mango pieces on your plate though this might not be for you. 

+Manchurian Beef: Thinly sliced chewy beef sunken into a bowl of delicious sauce. A personal favourite of mine and my mom. Really saucy!
 
+Dried Ginger Tiger Prawns(?): Recommended to us by the owner. I'm not a huge shrimp fan but everyone at the table thought this was great, albeit a little on the spicy side!

+House Fried Rice w/ Chicken & Shrimp: This fried rice is a chef's favourite option for a reason. The rice is almost crispy, and it's delicious. Highly recommend (you can also order without the chicken/shrimp I believe).

I thought the meal was just excellent and the service was beyond wonderful - even though our group arrived at 9pm (closing time 9:30pm), the owner was gracious in guiding us through the menu, and even amused us with his ability to speak to us in bengali! He was a highlight of the night, apart from the food of course :D

Tip: If you pay in cash for any takeout order valued above $20 (possibly $25), you can get a 10% discount :)"}
{"text":"Food was enjoyable but sauces were very sweet and springs rolls salty.
Lots of oil and cornstarch in the dishes.
Also did not like that when I asked for fortune cookies I was told they are not free.  What did I miss? An Asian restaurant always gives this as part of the meal so why are they saying its extra? Sign of the times I guess or perhaps I should just take my business elsewhere.  Whats next a charge for extra hot sauce or extra bags....no cool."}
{"text":"Outside the restaurant, above the 2 doors, there are two very different Tangerine signs, and two open signs, but only one door. 
It made me so confused. 

I have been twice. The first time it was dinner and very full of families and I wasn't paying so I was perhaps in a better mood. Not Tangerine's fault, I admit. 
However, aside from having to pay half the bill, the restaurant was also quite empty except for one very large party who also happened to be very noisy. 
Despite there being multiple free tables we were forced to sit at one of the 4 surrounding the large noisy group. 
I tried every excuse I could think of, and worked my charm on the manager and 2 different waiters. I even threatened to give a bad Yelp review...Nothin'. We were stuck next to the noisy peoples. 

The food was quite good, although last time it was better as I ate meat and this time could only eat one of the three dishes (tiger prawns) so obviously I didn't enjoy it as much the 2nd time around, but the chicken certainly looked delicious. The food came super-dooper quickly the second visit, as well (maybe because it was the table of a million loud people and us, only). 
The 3 stars are because I am keeping in mind my first, better, experience at this place and not just my not so great experience. 

It's good. It's not great. Even if we had been given the entire restaurant to ourselves, I would likely only give it one more star for being impressed with the service, which I was not. It's nothing to write home about, but worth going to if you are in the Markham area."}
{"text":"We ordered hot and sour soup, chicken corn soup, egg fried rice and Bombay chicken. We were a bit hesitant to order Bombay chicken but I am glad we did. It was just delicious. Very crunchy a bit spicy had sliced onions and green chills. It was just tasty. When you get sick and tired of the traditional Chinese like Manchurian and other gravies. This is a good dry and crunchy entree."}
{"text":"Had a entertainment.com 2 for 1 coupon that they refused to take. Employee ended up calling the POLICE because we asked for them to honor something THEY offer! Police showed up and of course they eventually had to honor their offer. We spent an hour trying to explain this is an online coupon, it took 3 police officers to get him to honor our coupon."}
{"text":"Food poisoning on two different occasions, first time just me, not my Daughter and Wife so I thought maybe it wasn't. This time just them. Terrible service, really terrible actually and the food is ok, minus the projectile vomit from my Daughter at 2am. The owner should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I think this is a go-to hakka place for many people in the area and lesser for out-of-the-area but I could be wrong. It's been a fantastic experience almost every time. The staff is friendly, and efficient... they know what they're doing. They have fantastic hours and have managed to maintain an appropriate level of seating for their customer table turnover. 

There's some dishes on this menu that have amazing value, if you get those, there's really no going wrong. In my (vegetarian + experienced... if I do say so myself) opinion, these include the veggie Manchurian balls, veggie fried rice, and hakka noodles. 

You may have to remember to ask for your fortune cookie or hot sauces once in a while but overall I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Usually a good experience but last night at the Richmondhill d Hill location the service was very poor."}
{"text":"I enjoy Tangerine very much. Chicken pakora, chili fish dry, ginger chicken, mixed veggies, hakka noodles, egg rolls, and even their FRIED BANANA ICE CREAM! These are all delicious from my own experience. It's very convenient for everyone! I love the food here! It is very delicious and the service is great too!


MUST EAT!"}
{"text":"My uncle and aunt always go to this place since my uncle likes Chinese food lot too! 

Anyways the food here is good !

We got corn soup, noodle soup, and some spicy soup !
If you like eating spicy stuff this is a good place to try :]

I think we got the chili chicken, Some noodle the waiter recommended which tasted amazing they were thin and crispy just how I like 'em!  Also got vegetable fried rice, Spicy garlic eggplant, Bok Choy and Asian broccoli!

I would come back again! Also got dessert the fried banana with honey and ice cream which was yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Thai Red Curry Chicken with rice from the lunch menu.  I really enjoyed this red curry chicken since the red curry was extremely creamy and the coconut cream was very evident.  The pieces of chicken in the dish were also tender and moist.  There were also chunks of eggplant and green peas within it.  It was a great choice!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place gets such good ratings except maybe that everyone's measure of Hakka cuisine differs.

Came here to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch.  The pros are quick service and large portion sizes for a low price - but that's pretty much where it ends.

Had the Hot and Sour Soup to start and it was quite good.  Not overly gooey, nor broth-y.  Just the right level of spice to it although I wish it had a hint more tamarind flavour to it (just like my mom makes!)

I tried the Chili Fish and Chicken Pad Thai.  Yes, I should've known better than to order Pad Thai from a Hakka restaurant - but even the Chili Fish was a disappointment and Chili Fish/Chicken/Beef are usually a must-try dish!

The Chili Fish was too much soy sauce and not enough chili.  It was so salty that it was inedible.  For $1 extra you can switch from plain white rice to egg fried rice, which I'm glad I did as this was the only saving grace for the dish.  The spring rolls that come with on the side have a nice crisp exterior, but the filling is bland and boring.

The Pad Thai was not very flavourful but the noodles were cooked al dente.  It tasted like someone squirted ketchup out of a bottle and mixed it in with noodles.

At the end of the day we were pretty stuffed, but the meal was anything but gratifying. Lunch specials are around $7."}
{"text":"I love this place and I use to drive all the way from downtown just to get it! I am so happy they opened another location. 
I recommend the dry garlic paneer and the spicy manchurian paneer.

I like to get take out and I have only eaten at the restaurant once and the service was friendly and fast. 

I dont know many Hakka Asian places but I love this one!"}
{"text":"Great food and great value. 
Their chicken pakora is the best.
The only bad thing about this location is that the service isnt that great."}
{"text":"It's very affordable delicious food!!! Been here about 5 times. Especially on a budget it's great."}
{"text":"Amazing place to get chili chicken. Now I don't have to drive to Markham to get Hakka food.
The staff are super friendly. The place is clean."}
{"text":"Poor quality food. 
We took four different dishes to get a wide variety of tastes...
Unfortunately everything was either dry and had no taste or greasy...
We were clearly disappointed...
Will never go back. So many other great restaurants in Markham!"}
{"text":"My in-laws had come here over the holidays and loved it, naturally we came back for my father-in-law's birthday last night.  The waiter was very attentive and suggested dishes for our table of 7.  There was one dish too many, but we packed it up to bring home.  The Manchurian fried rice was excessively spicy, and wasn't able to enjoy it. The Bombay chicken was dry and not very tasty. I did enjoy the crispy ginger beef. that was different and full of flavor. 

Normally, when you go to a restaurant and announce it is someone's birthday, one expects a little more, but nothing special, not a piece of cake, nor any freebies.  That was disappointing. We left by 9:30pm and the staff had already started sweeping and mopping and they were making it evident they wanted us to leave. (restaurant normally closes at 10pm). As we were getting up from the table and put on our jackets, they turned off the main lights!  

So.. ya.. I have had better.. better food, better manners, better reception.  I won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for a lot of years, and it is still pretty good. If you are a fan of hakka Chinese/indian food, then you will love this place. but of course if you are not a fan of that type of cuisine, most likely you won't find much for yourself to enjoy. I really enjoy their general tao chicken, as it is a good combination of sweet and spicy and the sauce goes really well with rice. I think the one thing though is that if you want a great deal. you should go to this place during weekday lunches. their weekday lunch specials are very good. its the dinner that prices wise is so so. the services is typically very fast and efficient no frills style. Definitely the one of the better Hakka Chinese joints around. and in that plaza the best one. i woudl recommend those who love this type of cuisine to go to this place if their in the area. its worth a drop in."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Items ordered:

Chili Chicken
Manchurian Seafood fried rice
Manchurian Chicken

This place is pretty good. Their items are pretty spicy but full of flavour.

I really liked the Manchurian seafood fried rice, lots of flavor, spicy, and very well presented. I would recommend this item (take a look at the picutre I took). 

The other two dishes we ordered was okay, looked like the same sauce base on both and one was just spicier than the other. It was just battered chicken and drenched with sauce.

It was pretty packed even around 8:30pm in the night. Definitely need to come earlier or during non-peak hours if you don't want to wait. Saw many customers just simply left because they didn't want to wait. It's worth a try, they have many locations within the GTA."}
{"text":"Seen this location for some time while driving by so one late afternoon decided to  check it out. It's decent sit-in restaurant that also offers quick take out. Decor inside is pleasant and tasteful. Staff seem polite.

Tried the Chicken Thai Green Curry. The base was a bit thicker than expected. The portion for the curry was pretty big though. Taste was a solid OK.

Overall the menu variety was very good and this is a decent place if you are craving what they offer. You won't be blown away but it is a good reliable option for the area."}
{"text":"A colleague recommended Tangerine Asian Cuisine for a work luncheon that I was organizing. Not being familiar with Hakka Cuisine, the staff were very helpful with answering all my questions because I wanted to make sure that I ordered food for a variety of tastes. After the luncheon, a lot of my staff came up to me to mention that they really enjoyed their meal. #success 

Fast forward three weeks, I decided to drive out to Markham to try Tangerine myself on a Saturday afternoon. At the luncheon, I just mingled with everyone and didn't actually get a chance to try the food (it smelled pretty good though) so I wanted to see what all the hype was about. They have daily specials for under $10. Being n00bs to TAS, we ordered: beef w/ beans, honey garlic chicken, and pad thai. The portions are really big as the special comes with a spring roll, rice (a lot of it), and soup or a drink. Between the three of us, we shared all three dishes and ended up with a lot of leftovers to take home with no room left in our stomachs for dessert (or even dinner). Service was quite good; attentive and our server came often to ask how we were enjoying the food. The place is clean and has a number of tables that would be perfect for groups.

I would like to return and try other dishes. I live quite a ways from Tangerine so I'm not sure when I'll be back. However, if you're in the area and you're jonesing for a cheap eat with a group of people, consider this place.

Good for: Hakka Cuisine, groups, lunch"}
{"text":"Lunch time special for weekends: \"A large plate of food for $5.95 or $6.95 with a spring roll and a an of pop.\" I believe weekdys is a dollar cheaper. There was a large plate of food served and it tasted fairly well. I had the chicken pad Thai which was a huge plate for $5.95. There wasn't a lot of chicken, but it was a huge plate - enough for me to bring home as leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the summer and I must say, I've grown to love this restaurant. The chili shrimp is amazing, same with the Cantonese veggie noodles. I bumped up the rating to a 5 star just based on those 2 items above. The service is friendly and dine in looks clean(haven't dined in yet)
The honey garlic chicken is also very tasty. 


The food is good but I've had better chili chicken. I ordered a lunch special today which consist of about 75% rice. I don't think ill be visiting here much. This food tastes like Chinese food trying to be hakka. Doesn't taste at all like authentic hakka. Even willys down the street is better than this place. 
The mango chicken isn't at all authentic Thai.
I've also come to the conclusion after eating here many time that this isn't authentic hakka. I've had authentic hakka from airport road and over to Hwy 48 and tangerine isn't even similar and I don't mean that in a god way."}
{"text":"Tangerine is one of several Hakka restaurants in the Markham/14th area. 

Taste is alright, but the takeout portion size for Bombay chicken was a let down - especially after reading the reviews for here and obviously having gone to some of the other restaurants in that area.

The upside is that the taste was definitely comparable, although I think Hakka Legend is a bit better with the Bombay.

They do have some dish combos where you can get two or more items for a lower price, and that's nice. They are also generally a bit faster in service - but that might also be because there wasn't a line up when we went in!

Basically, Tangerine doesn't quite have the BEST quality or quantity, but it's still fairly tasty, and fast."}
{"text":"The food is decent. The poutine was very flavorful, chili chicken was too dry but had a decent flavor, the Bok Choy was very flavorful, and the fried rice was average. The service was slow at their peak hour around 7:30PM. I asked for water 4 times before they finally gave us some. 
The decor is nice and clean, pretty modern, nothing special though... The flowers in the middle are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Food quality going down,  nickel and dime everything from hot sauce to credit card payments. Take out takes forever,  they take your money first then say okay wait so you can't cancel after you go in lol.  40mins for 1 dish,  customers told me if they don't get tipped for takeout they intentionally delay orders too. Losing business to Frederick's."}
{"text":"Yet another restaurant serving hakka cuisine, however not comparable to most other well known hakka restaurants (esp Frederick's). Having said that, this place isn't terrible and I'd consider it half decent.

I agree with Devan's review about sticking to what you do best, which is why I keep my order at Tangerine fairly simple and hakka related. Chicken corn soup, crispy beef, chilli chicken - and steamed rice (not a big fan of the fried rice here). I usually order sweet and sour chicken balls at every hakka restaurant I go to however let's just say that Tangerine dropped the ball with their balls. 

One time I asked for some honey garlic chicken which wasn't on the menu (but the honey garlic chicken wings were) and they made it for me after I convinced them to just make the chicken in the honey garlic sauce lol that worked a few times and then one day they refused since it wasn't on the menu. I haven't really dined in since that day. Coincidence, I think not.

I'm always big on service so I will say that the service is okay for smaller parties, however once we had a party of about 15 and the service sucked balls - great big, extra battered, sweet and sour chicken balls."}
{"text":"A while ago, a friend mentioned this place is good to try if i love hakka food. We finally got the chance a few days ago while in the neighbourhood. ( way too far from where i live)

fish pakora is a must and it was heavenly. the bombay chicken was very dry and not spiced enough. the decor was quite cute. maybe i'll find a closer tangerine to try if there's one closer to me."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. I am Hakka Chinese and tangerine does Indian Hakka food well. It's not for everyone though, but I like it! If you're looking for a good amount of decent food at great prices then go here. I won't comment on which hakka restaurant is better, they are all pretty similar and it comes down to personal preference (I.e. Fredericks vs Tangerine). We came here with a massive group of 30 people for lunch and I thought the food and value was great. Lunch specials are worth it.

We ordered the chicken pakora, Bombay chicken, crispy ginger beef, beef chow fun, chicken fried rice, Hakka noodles, Manchurian fish, Manchurian shrimp, gai lan with beef and more.

I strongly recommend the pakora - it is crispy and has a good ratio of batter and meat. The chicken was moist and juicy. Squeeze lemon and drizzle the lime/cilantro sauce on top! I also recommend the crispy ginger beef, it is sweet, crispy, and delicious! Bombay chicken is also a classic and you can't go wrong with that. Even though we didn't order it, try their chili chicken.

You can't go wrong with fried rice or the noodles - they're standard but white rice should be fine as well as you might be overloading your taste buds with salt. The food might be too greasy or salty for some.

As with all establishments, service is quick and efficient and you get your fortune cookie at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile, but since I joined YELP I might as well state that I cannot wait to go back.  The service is fine but the food is phenomenal!  If you choose any fried rice or fried noodle dish...That 'flaming wok' taste is sooooo there!  How the Chinese would say \"gow wok hei\".  As stated...I cannot wait to experience the food there again soon!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem within Richmond Hill absolutely great chilli chicken fusion cuisine beyond reproach. I've got to share many times love it every single time, I tell all my friends at this is the spicy place for Monja cake. Don't miss out on this place be sure to go and try at everything on the menu is absolutely fantastic"}
{"text":"I have never been here, but this Haka joint catered my cousins birthday party at her Moms apartment and I happily indulged in all sorts of Indo-chinese creations. Haka noodles, chili paneer, fried rice, all the usual suspects were delicious. I didn't add anything to it or wish to take anything away from it. Some of it was slightly greasy but isn't that the fun of it? I ate their food one time and haven't been back because there has been no chance but my family there really seems to enjoy it. The next time I am in Scarborough, I will check it out to see if the restaurant is as good as what we enjoyed at home."}
{"text":"Crispy Ginger Chick, nuff said!

I have been to this place a couple of times and I have nothing but good things to say about it.
The food is pretty good and it always feels fresh. I have developed a craving for Ginger chicken since I have had it there.

The service is pretty good too, the servers are compasionate. I remember, one time we went 20 minutes before the closing time, not only did they serve us food, all the staff just remained in the restaurant for us when nobody was there, the guy would refill our water while he is wearing his winter jacket (it was 20 minutes after the closing time). The owner came and asked how the food was and stuff, nice little gestures which made us feel special.

The price is Very reasonable! This is my go to spot whenever I am in the mood of good food in reasonable price in my area, I end up there and I am yet to be disappointed.

A word to the owner/staff: Thanks for looking after us, keep doing what you are doing :)"}
{"text":"It's misleading to say Tangerine is Chinese food. It's Hakka food and here's a quote from their website.

\"Hakka cuisine is the cooking style of the Hakka, and originally came from southeastern China (Guangdong and Fujian). Hakka people are migratory tribes of ethnic Han people originated from central China. Their ancestors exiled themselves from foreign rulers such as the Mongols during the Yuan Dynasty. Due to their late migration to the southern areas of China, they found that all of the best land had been settled long before. The Hakka people were forced to settle in the sparsely settled hill country. As a result, fresh produce was at a premium, forcing the Hakkas to heavily utilize dried and preserved ingredients, such as various kinds of fermented tofu, preserved lime and much use of onion.

Hakka means \"Guest\". The Hakka people in Toronto are first and second generation of Hakka settler from India. The Hakka food is infused with many common ingredients of Indian spices such as red chillies, green chillies, red chilli powder, tandoori masala, cumin and coriander. Together with the Indian and Chinese ingredients, many of the Hakka food is more flavourful than other Chinese cuisine one has experienced. \"

If asked, I say it's Chinese Indian food. And it's damn good.  

Tangerine is busy. It's busy for a reason. They serve amazing Hakka food for a reasonable price and with warm, friendly and knowledgeable service. Make sure you try their OMG-worthy dishes - Mango Chicken, Fish with Hot Garlic Sauce, Crispy Ginger Beef , House Special Hakka Noodle, House Special Fried Rice, Fried Curry Chicken Spring Roll and Deep Fried Banana with Honey and Ice Cream. 

Great... now I'm drooling... If you're a lover of Hakka food, make sure you try Tangerine. If you've never had Hakka food, Tangerine is a great ambassador for this cuisine.  One last thing, make reservations..."}
{"text":"Based on my experience with both lunch (4 stars) and dinner (2 stars), Tangerine continues to be a lunch time favourite of mine. Considering the food is about the same at dinner, save the portion sizes which are somehow doubled, I save my hakka fetish for lunch. 

Echoing others, the Owner provides is warm and hospitable while the rest of staff is to the point and almost curt in their fast-food like approach. 

I suggest calling your order in ahead if you're in a hurry, the website is surprisingly comprehensive for lunch. My favourites include:

Chili Chicken, spicy (it's deep-fried)
Eggplant in Garlic Sauce
Manchurian Vegetable Balls (With sauce)"}
{"text":"Delicious Hakka restaurant, better than Federicks in my opinion. Love their ginger beef and Manchurian noodles. Their lunch specials are awesome and the portions are very generous!
I usually get take out but will try dining in next time. I'm sure everything on their menu is great."}
{"text":"Food was decent but BAD customer service. Waitor got the wrong order and kept telling me I pointed at hakka fried rice when I had asked about noodle dishes and had ordered hakka noodles. She said i was wrong three times and i gave up. Not cool for a customer service business."}
{"text":"Absolute amazing food. I am impressed every time I go. Service is meh at best. 
Kinda grossed out last time since a cook was sitting at a table separating green beans  with no gloves and putting the separated beans on the table with no napkin or bowl to put them in. Ew."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

This place is always busy - especially on a weekend!  It's a nice enough place to dine in and the food is pretty decent.  Nothing I ate here made me want to scream Hallelujah   but nothing made me not want to return.  It's a happy medium! 

There are 2 other locations - Markham and I believe Mississauga.  It's cheap, cheerful and quick.  They have take out and delivery and lunch specials so for a quick pick me up on a night you don't want to cook, it's perfect!"}

{"text":"I was introduced to the Markham location by a co worker and immediately fell in love with the place. I was ecstatic when I found out they opened a location closer to home.

Having just opened, the interior is pristine. The bench seats are a little hard, but I think they'll soften over time. I can't really comment on the service as I've only gotten take out. If it's anything like the Markham location then it's great. I've actually seen one of the waiters from the Markham location there, hopefully it was some kind of promotion. 

The food is great. It's always fresh and served fast, even when there getting slammed with orders.

They only cons about the place is the incredibly small parking lot and the minimum $10 purchase to use debit or credit."}
{"text":"Never experienced such a bad customer Service...
People if you want to go to Tangerine please come to whitby but only if you want horrible service, bunch of liars. I placed an ordered over the phone and when I reached the restaurant in bad weather with low visibility i noticed that one of my main dish was missing. They did not inform me that they ran out of dish and on top of it blamed me for it and later changed the sentence to I did not listen and in the end completing the conversation by saying \"Take your business some where else\". I had been so regular at tangerine but from now on no more stepping in. So, if you do not want to get yourself insulted with bad attitude and bad service DO NOT GO TO TANGERINE WHITBY. During the festive time one needs a smile not rudeness."}
{"text":"Tried the pad thai. Really really bland and flavourless. From this experience alone I will never go back there. It was the worst pad thai I've ever had - easily."}
{"text":"Really nice place to eat with very reasonable price.  The green mango salad and green curry chicken was really delicious.  The only negative thing I can think of is the portion of plain steam rice that comes with curry dishes.  The staff also needs to improve on serving with a smile."}
{"text":"Food has improved over the months. No MSG is fantastic. Food quality had gone up. Crispy ginger beef fantastic."}
{"text":"We were in the area and thought we would drop in for a quick meal. Ordered the usual house fried rice and chilli chicken. The food took a bit longer then expected approx 20 mins or so. It did show up hot and ready to eat eventually. My partner said the chicken tasted 'off' so he didn't eat more then one piece and only ate the fried rice. I really enjoyed the sauce so i covered my fried rice with the sauce. It was delicious at the time - but it was a huge mistake. Finished the meal around 7pm. Got home, stomach was rumbling a bit, thought it was just because the fried rice was pretty spicy, but no big deal. At 4:30 AM I woke up feeling nauseous and was throwing until 11:00 AM. At 6:30 AM it came out the OTHER end and that didn't stop until 12:45pm. I felt like I was going to die. It was the worst feeling in the whole world and would not wish this on anyone. My body was cold, sweaty and aching all over. =( 
FOOD POISONING

I use to love this place but since it took me out of commission for an entire day it's been axed off my list.  
I hate leaving a review that says 'don't eat here' but DON'T EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"There food is sooo good. Better to come in during lunch time, sesame chicken and honey garlic with vegetable fried rice is delicious if your into sweet stuff. I want to try the tofu and the egg fried rice ! I've tried other Hakka places but my personal favourite for chicken pakora is fredricks. But I honestly love this place better due to their variety."}
{"text":"Fredericks was my regular go to Hakka joint but since I was introduced to this place by my amazing fiancée, this is my primary Hakka home. 

I've had a lot of dishes here and here's what I have to say. 

The service is good. Prompt, efficient and spot on. Not too many smiles, thank you's, etc. but I don't go here to have my horn tooted. 

Portions are very large. Food is tasty and arrives quickly. 

All in all, you really can't lose here."}
{"text":"Have been going there at least twice a month for the past 5 years. Good food, good portions and nice and clean environment. Service is mostly good. I've had an 'ok' experience once, but then again, one bad experience in 5 yrs is not that bad. 
Kids love the honey-garlic chicken. I love the chicken pakoras, chilli, szcheuan, & manchurain chicken. Not a fan of the crispy ginger beef."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Markham and Scarborough location for over 4 yrs. Was glad to know they opened one closer to home. 
Service, food and quality is great. And its spacious. I have tried many items on the menu, all great. The food here never lets you down."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice.  First time was with a group of 9 and it was ok and food was fine.  The second time,  my husband and I went for lunch and we were told we would have to wait a while until a table was free.  We pointed out at least 3 booths that were empty but we were told those were for groups of 6 and we would have to wait.  There was nobody behind us at the time! Luckily a smaller booth opened up within 5 minutes.

We sat down and waited for our water and menus.  The waiter was literally running around the restaurant and even when he was with us, he was looking over to the other tables.  We ordered fairly quickly but then realized everyone around us was getting served and we weren't....even those that came in after us!  We asked the waiter and he said he would check.  He said it was coming shortly and then he disappeared again.  After waiting some more, my husband told the man at the bar that the service was awful and we had been waiting for our food for over 25minutes.  He went to the kitchen and said it would be ready in 5 minutes!! We got fed up and left as it was obvious the waiter had never even put in our order.

We left, drove to Eddie's wok n' roll, ordered, were served, finished eating and paid all within 20 minutes.  A restaurant that has such quick turnover at lunch needs to ensure they have the staff and service available to meet the needs of their customers.  Tangerine.....take some lessons from Eddie's"}
{"text":"Your basic hakka place. Food is as expected and atmosphere is ok. 
Depending on which server you get some are nice and some are rude. But who cares, you're there for halal hakka. Shut up, eat up, pay your bill and leave. It's that kind of a place."}
{"text":"100% agree with previous reviews. This is so not authentic! Chinese food with a hint of Hakka twist. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I like this place. Customer service is great. Place is clean including bathrooms, and it's nuts during lunch hour peeks from their daily lunch specials that are worth every penny. At dinner it's usually family based people eating or groups of friends.

Every time I go I get the chili chicken, but you have to specify if you want it spicy or else it will come to your table mild. 

i also get the spicy fried shrimp. Big juicy succulent shrimp in a paper thin batter tossed with sweet bell peppers, onions and garlic. So delectable.

I can't bring myself to order anything else but once I went on a whim and orders the Bombay fish. I couldn't eat it. It wasn't good at all. Or maybe those flavors just didn't mesh right with fish? I don't know. I just never ordered it again.

All in all, this is a great Hakka style resto."}
{"text":"Wednesday evening with my old co-worker and craving some Hakka food.

I have been to this location only one time in the past and I cannot remember if it was good or not.  Trust me, it's wonderful!

As a Hakka advocate (my wife is Hakka Chinese), the food here is not too pricey, huge portions and tastes great.  The service was good too.  A lot of waiters took care of our table which was nice that they always came by to fill our waters.

I ended up getting the Chicken Pakora, Veggie Hakka Noodles and Chilli Chicken (Dry).

The Chicken Pakoras were fabulous.  They were huge, red, spicy and had excellent flavour.  Crispy, oily goodness.  The taste reminded me of a cross breed between Hakka Magic and Wan Lee Xin's pakoras which are our absolute favourites.  

The Hakka noodles were tasty.  Not slimy but oily and enjoyable.  Good complement to the chicken.

Unfortunately, the chilli chicken (dry) was terrible.  Even though it was try, it tasted over-cooked, chewy and missing flavour.  It had a ginger taste which I was not really fond of.  I did not enjoy this dish at all.  I would not get it again.  Maybe if it had a little bit of sauce it might have been better.

This place would have gotten 5 stars if it was not for the chew chilli chicken.  I will most definitely return here in the future and include my Hakka in-laws as well."}
{"text":"I tried their sesame chicken lunch special and there was atleast 10% meat content of the sesame chicken given and 90% of the rest was the coating. Very disappointed. Although a generous amount of rice has been given but for what ? I usually come here for their lunch deals but the quality of their food had drastically gone down. 
I probably dont plan on going back. Very disappointed indeed."}
{"text":"I had another chance to eat at this place yesterday. We ordered Veg Chopsuey which was just sweet and didn't taste like a chopsuey. Made a  bad decision to order it.

The veg manchurian was good. Aptly spicy and with the perfect hakka style taste. 

Veg noodles were good but had a little too much oil. Though the taste was fine. 

The fried wish that my husband ordered was super fabulous and super spicy. Everyone loved the fish (except me cus I am a vegetarian).

This place does not have the same taste every time we go there or order from. The taste of food varies every time. Thats not what one expects from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Hubby ordered takeout.  

How do I compare you to food court grub... let me count the ways:
- The generic taste where although we ordered 4 different dishes they all tasted and looked identical (granted, hubby does not have experience in the ordering dept)
- The giving of soya sauce although we did not order anything to warrant it
- The stale crushed fortune cookies 
- The after taste

To give them some credit - we did not get sick.  I did see some small buk choy in the vegetable dish.  

Will I order from here again?
NEVER."}
{"text":"First off I tried so many times to call the waiter that I had to go in front of the cash register to call the damn waiter to take our order. The food is delicious regardless but a restaurant that doesn't even notice the customer coming in I raised my hand for a long time and they still didn't notice. The food is good not as good as federicks forced to come here today because federicks was closed. Anyway this place is good if good restaurants close early then yu can come here"}
{"text":"I am appalled at the experience I had today. Came into this establishment at 9:20 on, they close at 10. I was told we could not dine in but takeout was available.

We ordered three entrees to go! We sat there for 45 minutes. Until finally the lady who took out order realized she gave our order to some random woman.

This server did not apologize, did not offer any incentives.

After being frustrated with the whole situation I told her that I'd like my money back for my order (10$) and my two friends still want theirs.

I simply asked for it to be removed and that I didn't like my experience at this restaurant and I'd like to leave.

She became rude and said its already made like 10 times. I told her I'm entitled to my opinion and I didn't feel the service was good and didn't like that nobody even offers an apology. 

She started saying how we should feel bad for her because that she will have to pay my portion of the meal since it's already made off her paycheck.

She was rude and I couldn't believe she was refusing to pay me back for my 10$ meal. That I waited 45 minutes for.

The whole kitchen staff came out, surrounded me and my two friends and was just staring at us.

The most uncomfortable unnerving experience I had."}
{"text":"Lunch special is mostly rice.  Overpriced for what you get. Many better options in the area. Taste ok, but nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"First time to visit this branch and the food is good. If you like Hakka food, this is a good place to visit. Not very pricey at all. Service is quick, staff are friendly and attentive. Our server came several times to check on us and brought water refill without us requesting it.

Chicken pakora taste good, I love to squeeze a little lemon to enjoy it. I love the bombay chicken(dry) and i found a new favorite. Everything we had taste good,  crisy ginger beef(dry) , chili fish(dry), stir fry brocolli, chili chicken(dry), sesame chicken. Each order comes with 1 bowl of rice. The only downside is the noodle, oily and need more flavor.

There are lots of variety of food with different sauce or flavor. Definely will come back and try other items."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of Hakka Chinese dishes fresh made to order. This is our regular place. Lots of vegetarian options. Consistently good. Good reduced price lunch menu. My family of five have enough selection on the menu. Manchuria style dishes are excellent. Best Thai mango salad! Hakka noodles are super
Yummy. Family style eating."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now and it's great service and decent food when you are in need of the hakka fix. 

Was impressed to see the hot and sour soup had some authentic chinese ingredients in it 

massive portions for very cheap, all in all you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This is our usual go to spot for take out when we cant figure out what to eat. The previous reviewer was spot on about the pad thai - it's terrible here. I spent time in Bangkok for work, so I was spoiled with fresh authentic thai food, and although no Thai dishes in Toronto that I've tried have come even remotely close to the food there, Tangerine has the worse Pad Thai I've ever tasted...it's so flavorless. Maybe it was a bad day because everything else we tried we liked. We tend to stick with the fried shrimp wonton as appetizers and either fish curry, crispy ginger beef, mango chicken, or dry garlic shrimp as our main course. I've been coming here for years and those are a faves."}
{"text":"Recently mentioned as #3 on Blog TO's list of 'Best Hakka Restaurants in Toronto', Tangerine opened its third location in east-end Scarborough, just 5-minutes from Highway 401. 

We came to try it out one Friday night when I spotted a buy-1-get-1-free coupon on the website. One of the few open shops in a newly-built stripmall, eerily surrounded by bare stalls. The sleek interior is a bit cold and the tiny booth seats might not bode well for those who are heftier than the average Asian person.

The menu here is split according to appetizers, noodles and the kind of meat you want. There is still a large section of pure vegetable dishes, strangely, not listed on the online menu. Boggled by the choices, we were recommended the vegetarian Hakka noodles, which were excessively salty but otherwise quite good. I probably ate two-thirds of the entire plate.

Our second dish were vegetables and tofu in black bean sauce; the sauce was excessively starchy and relied too heavily on the soy sauces. Although the portions of vegetables were decent, the taste was akin to something you'd get in a Chinese restaurant in Middle-of-Nowhere, U.S.A. We picked out the tofu but wasn't tasty enough to pack up for leftovers.

The only dish that truly convince me that I might visit again were the dry* garlic and chili eggplant. The dish itself was large and the eggplant quite fresh and not overcooked. It was so tasty I had myself licking my lips! The bowls rice that accompanied our orders were quite generous, although my 90-year-old grandmother complained that the grains could have been made softer. To finish off our meal, I ordered dessert: two giant fried bananas with a enormous scope of ice cream, easily split between 2-3 people! At $4, it was pretty good deal.

Overall, the service here is quite fast and we got our dishes surprisingly quick. In regards to Vanessa's reviews about bad service, one must realize that Asian waiters are prided for being fast and efficient, not jovial. However, they are quite willing to give suggestions if you ask and can speak a few Chinese dialects. And once you are served, don't expect the waiters to come back ... unless you ask them too. The servers are often too busy handling the take-out orders in the evenings. By the time we left at 7:30 pm, there were four families sitting on the side waiting for their take-out orders. 

A decent meal for a good price and fast service. I'm still not too sold on Hakka and don't see what the fuss is about. My grandmother claims that traditional Hakka is nothing like the basterdized version we find in Canada. As well, there are other forms of Asian cuisine that I find far more appealing since what you often get doesn't seem quite as divergent from a lot of Chinese dishes. 

2.5/5 STARS

{"text":"This is based off their takeout.
- chicken pakora soggy, didn't see the lemon wedges until halfway through as they were hiding in the bottom. Also size inconsistency. I believe there are supposed to be 10. One was way smaller than the rest!!!
- Bombay fried rice was spicy, tasted like regular fried rice but with some more seasoning, although mild. I think they must add red colouring to make it look more intense or different from plain Chinese fried rice. The box was nice and filled to the max. 
- Bombay shrimp: the serving looked disappointing especially for the price. The box wasnt even half filled. I think it came with plain rice though as our bag came with plain rice which we did not order. 
- overall, the food was okay. Would rather try a new place than go here again. 
- when I asked for hot sauce, we got the basic cheap Chinese packet hot sauce when I expected their house made chili"}
{"text":"So glad to see this location as its 5 mins from me! Always had to drive to Markham, so worth it though. Hakka style cuisine is so good and tangerine does it just right, the prices are great too. They give you 10% off too if you pay with cash! Definitely worth a try!  I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Worst service.. Have been there so many times just for the food but guess I'll stop going now.. It's humiliating when the servers talk to you so rudely (it's not a one time thing, they are rude all the time). It is like paying them to treat you badly. The owner is so busy counting $$ he is making that even if you want to complain he does not have time to talk to you. Never recommend this place to anyone going forward.. 

Note:- Please stop going to this restaurant unless you want to be treated really bad. Wish I could give -ve stars to this place."}
{"text":"This place is great food value and quite tasty. Service is usually quite fast, occasionally not when they get overwhelmed. Fish and eggplant are both great."}
{"text":"I Came here for dinner and was pleasantly enveloped by the cozy and just-at-home feel. The busy restaurant meant that the waiters were scant and occupied. However when available, they were prompt. The food was very good in texture and freshness; Crunchy and hence fresh. Some dishes I had ordered; Eggplant in Garlic sauce and a generic mixed vegetable melee which was alright but sans spice. Blasphemy in a Hakka Chinese restaurant. My advice to you: The chilli signs on the menu mean NOTHING, so feel free to add more Spice! Also, in light of heightened nut allergy surveillance, the \"Chicken with Cashew nut\" dish was barren of nut. Although it hurt my \"nuts about nuts\" appetite, kudos on the GREAT social initiative. Wouldn't mind coming here again but I would have to search for more flavorful dishes a little more sauce and not just vegetables individually dunked in sauce. My advice to you is: BYON; N for nuts and order the Manchurian dishes."}
{"text":"Good place for cheap and quick Hakka food in Markham (Markham/14th in the Future Shop plaza).

Favourites include: Chicken Pakora's, Chilli Tofu (my wife is Vegan and swears by this dish) and of course Chilli Chicken.

Likes:
- Quick service (however, they get very busy on weekends!)
- Cheap food with well priced lunch specials

Disklikes:
- Most of the dishes taste the same
- I've gotten sick a few times after eating here.  Not sure if it was from the food being too spicy or just not properly cooked. 
- After being in here for over 10 minutes your clothes will begin to smell like the restaurant
- Credit/Debit machine always seems to be down

Update (Oct 2014):  I've since stopped coming here as it always makes me feel sick afterwards.  Instead, we go to Fredericks across the street which is much better.  Ever since they extended the restaurant I think the quality of the food has gone downhill."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants.  Glad they finally opened a location nearby, as I use to drive to the Markham Rd location all the time.

They just opened on Dec 5th in time for my birthday. 

So excited!

---------
Update:  Dec 2016

After many meals over the past year, I've unfortunately decided to downgrade my rating from 5 to 1.  I'm not sure what it is about this place (in comparison to their Markham location), but every time I eat here I get a really bad stomach ache the next day.  I'm thinking it has something to do with the oil they use, but not sure.

As a result, I've completely stopped coming here."}
{"text":"The customer service here is non existent, and if there is its terrible. The only thing I like about this place is the cheap food tbh. But then sometimes my food would come out with way too much oil which makes the food terrible."}
{"text":"Checked this place out a few weeks ago and had some of the egg fried rice and the Bombay chicken, and some chicken wontons.

For $5 you get a ton of chicken wontons that are pretty decent. The bombay chicken is really good, i highly recommend it as its all white meat if thats what you like.

Also tried the dry chili beef which was just ok but not comparable to the dry chili beef at my fav hakka restaurant asian garden. 

Worth a try if your in the Markham rd. area!"}
{"text":"So i've heard great things and happy this place opened up close to me.

I've been a couple of times now and i have to say, it's decent as a take out joint and the food is acceptable. 

It's not as good as Frederick's and the service can be a little rude. Actually that's probably the worst of it - the attitude, it's a little strange for what they say (albeit with a smile) especially for a place trying to establish itself."}
{"text":"2 locations to choose from but this one is new.  Food it excellent. Spicy Beef with Pakoras.  DONE."}
{"text":"This place is loved by many( it's my father's favourite restaurant) but I just don't get it. The portions are very large and the prices are extremely low but the food quality really isn't great at all. I've been there around 3 times I believe. I wouldn't want to bring friends here. If rather pay more and receive better food."}
{"text":"Great place: if I were to describe it in two words:  great fast food! Oooops, that was more than 2 :-) Anyway,  I'd like to say that even though the place doesn't look like much in terms of interior, ambiance, etc., the food is consistently good! I wouldn't call it authentic, but it's the best westernized version of generalized Asian cuisine I've tried, considering the price point. Service is good, food is good, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant especially for vegetarians. Love the mango paneer, Bombay paneer and the tangerine veg. Balls."}
{"text":"Great. I often go there with family and coworkers. We usually ask for many dishes and share them. The proportions are good. Price good as well."}
{"text":"We had another excellent experience here tonight for dinner.  The manager was very welcoming.  The food came out quickly again and was great.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm not so much of a Pakora fan, I dont know why perhaps it is an acquired taste which I have not easily adopted to but this place absolutely changed my mind. Came to this place to meet up with friends (God Bless their good taste) They ordered the food before we arrived and every single one of them tasted delicious (not kidding! thankful again for such friends). Chili Chicken , Chili Fish, Chicken Pakora, Sesame Chicken, Crispy beef and Stir Fried Chinese Broccoli.  A variety of flavour with good portions enough to serve a small group of 10. Service was prompt and attentive . We were too hungry and food was soo good we didn't get the chance to take pictures. Alas an excuse to go back asap."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time two days ago. Let me start off by saying they did not disappoint! The food was cooked so good, flavour was on point too. The chicken fried rice was not heavy and greasy either, it was very light and flavourful. I wish I would have known it came with eggs in it as I don't like eggs; but you couldn't even taste them. We also order lemon chicken and general tao. The lemon chicken came as fried chicken pieces with lemon sauce in a separate container for you to pour it over yourself. Which I thought was smart incase someone didn't like it. (By the way the lemon chicken without the sauce was amazing.) As for the lay out  I wish that they had a separate waiting area for take-out as you have to walk through the entire restaurant with people eating to order your food, and wait for it. Though the food was cooked relatively quick. The restaurant looked clean and well organized from what I could see. The waitresses were well mannered and had great people skills."}
{"text":"The establishment need to learn the concept of customer service. Absolutely rude server, who seemed like she hates her job and have no idea how to treat customers. Yeah so thats what i gotta say about it. Food is decent, thats the only reason i would ever think of coming back."}
{"text":"Decent dining at a good price!  Fast service for lunch specials, generous portions of tasty chinese  food.  Limit of $10.00 or more for Credit Card use.  But you probably won't go over that unless you're a big eater for lunch. Busy during lunch, but has several tables for a small place in strip mall setting.  I would return again..."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that my family visits occasionally.  They have some tasty dishes that we enjoy, like crispy ginger chicken (or beef), general tao chicken and their awesome chilli chicken wings. 

Now lets talk for a moment about those chilli chicken wings (sips tea). You might think it's chicken wings coated in chilli chicken sauce but nay. It's well coated fried chicken  wings tossed in ginger, pepper flakes, garlic and a sriracha kinda sauce (yah I basically just gave you the recipe). It's my favourite thing to order from there. Never had chicken wings like that at any other place.

Lastly, the chicken balls are awesome here. A lot of places you go to are pure batter with a tiny hidden chunk of chicken....here has big golden chicken balls with huge chunks of chicken. Further their sweet n sour sauce is soooo good - I wanna drink it. But alas! I resist.

Nice setting, clean restaurant and friendly, prompt staff."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place based on reviews. Wasn't disappointed. Ordered something safe Crispy Ginger Chicken with veg fried rice. Was tasty! 
Place was clean and inviting.  Service was good (not busy at mid afternoon)."}
{"text":"Went there today had the lunch specials. We ordered the chili tofu and substituted the plain rice for veg fried rice. We also ordered the manchurian eggplant with plain hakka noodles.
They both came with the option of spring rolls, pop, or soup. We chose the soup it was veg manchurian and was rather tasty. I suggest adding a touch of soy sauce to it too really bring out the flavour.
Both of our dishes were good size, and tasted really good."}
{"text":"Hakka and Chinese cuisine - very popular place and can get crowded at times especially with take out.  Good to order ahead.

Ordered the sesame crispy beef, chicken balls, and vegetables in black bean sauce.  All the food is pretty good!  Also portion size is huge whether you dine in or out.

Only complaint is that in the past they will turn away business on takeout for a busy night like New Years or on a busy holiday.  Not unreasonable but when they have an empty restaurant why not still offer take out?"}
{"text":"I wish I lived in Richmond Hills, even anywhere in Toronto, just so I can come here often. I've been craving asian food for awhile and decided to give this place a shot. I didn't know what to choose at first because everything looked good. There's Indian inspired dishes to Chinese dishes.

We ended up picking the Bombay fried rice and the spicy garlic tofu that came with white rice. Both were phenomenal! Both had that perfect amount of spice that didn't make you sweat but had a lot of flavor. The price point was great. A plate was around $8-9 CAD and the amount they give you is worth it. You might not even be able to finish it. 

Overall I'm SOOO happy we decided to go here instead of Hero's or Pizza Nova next door. And shoutouts to our server who was friendly and funny!"}
{"text":"Near the Mississauga corporate area, you have a vast amount of fast food chain stores that offer little to distinguish themselves from the other stores and then you have these small little local stores that try to compete.  This area has tons of Asian offerings from Indian, Chinese, and the plentiful Hakka cuisine... or all 3 in this restaurant.  This is new and just opened a month ago.  Does this guy compete against the ever popular Eddie's, Ming Room, Asian Wok n Roll, and Hakka Magic... YES!

For starters, the plaza is dingy ... the strip mall is old and difficult to get in and out.  If anything, I would be hesitant to come here because of the looks.  Once you step past the giant pot holes in the parking lot, the interior of the restaurant is SUPER clean and modern. It's bright and spacious thanks to the well spaced tables and big front windows that face west.  I can see this place being a bit on the dark side at night time since most of the decor is black (including the ceiling).  

Service here stands out much better than the 4 other restaurants. When I entered, the front person actually held open the second door, greeted me with a smile in perfect English, and sat me down ... all in 30 seconds.  He even said he'll keep an eye out for my dining partner who is coming in after me.  We were given our menus immediately and clean glasses of water arrived at our table a minute later.   The tables was spotless.  It helps to be a brand new restaurant but it was apparent the staff was cleaning up immediately after each table was finished.  This included a full wipe down of the table surface with a spray.

When I opened up the lunch menu, I was shocked at the sticker price.  Not because it was high... but because it was MUCH lower than the other restaurants.  Asian Wok n Roll, Ming Room, and Eddie's all hover at the $9 mark for lunch.  This place has their set lunch menu starting at $5.95 up to $6.95!!! This includes things such as Thai green curry chicken or seafood, General Tso Chicken or seafood, lots of vegetarian options, and shrimp with lobster sauce.  How they make money... I don't know!  So the selection was plentiful and affordable... big bonus for them over the other restaurants.

As for the taste, I would say this is possibly the best out of the bunch.  My chilli garlic vegetables were crispy, bright green, and fresh.  No over cooked, boiled to death, or dying in a puddle of oil.  I do not have the dreaded MSG headache so it tells me they don't use it or use it sparingly.  The flavour had a great punch of garlic without being too over the top spicy.  I would say the spice level is closer to mild for me.   My colleagues Thai green curry chicken was large with lots of coconut milk used to make it very creamy.  He really enjoyed it as it also had good amount of eggplant and green beans in it too.  He said it medium hot to him but still had great flavour.  It wasn't heavy.  The crazy part of this... these plates arrived to our table in less than 7 minutes from the moment we ordered!!

So for under $16, we had two really big lunches served in a nice clean place with great service.  I know they're brand new but it's clear they're here to take away business from the other Hakka restaurants.  If they keep it up, I'm sure they will.  Let's hope this place doesn't start to cheap out and stay the same so I can keep the 4 star rating here!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. We have  a VIP card since we used to come here when it first opened, so we get 10% off all orders.

I like the chili chicken the best. The service is ok, not great. And the portions could be larger, but the food is damn tasty!! For those who like spicy asian food, you will love this place.

Located right at Markham and 14th.

Oh and they spell Wonton's.... Wanton's, hahaha, just a funny thing I noticed on their take-out menu's that they placed at Milliken Mill's Community Centre."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the food and service here!  Lawrence is so warm and welcoming to all guests, and always has a smile on his face. 

I suggest the House Fried Rice, Spicy Deep Fried Prawns and Spicy Eggplant. They're always done to perfection. 

Take-out service is fast, and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Markham Road location quite a few times and it was good.  I was really excited to see one opening so close to my home.

Was there yesterday and the mango salad came out with a hair in it. I have worked in the restaurant industry in the past for about 10 years, so not the end of the world.  They brought us a new one. Eating the chicken wan-tons and inside there was a long hair cooked into the meat.  Took it back and said the owner was cooking that night.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Lunch deals here are amazing!! $7 for a big plate of food that will sure fill you up and satisfy your taste buds! They have everyone's favourites on the lunch menu such as mango chicken, pakora chicken, and basil beef! Any thing from fried rice, to meat on white rice, and stir fry noodles!

Hakka cuisine are one of my favourite kind of asian food - the mix of chinese stir fry-style cooking with flavourful spices from india are one of the best combinations known to man kind."}
{"text":"Tangerine Asian Cuisine is really a great lunch restaurant! This is especially if you want good cheap spicy lunch!

This place is packed during lunch hour. Got there around 12:40 pm and there is a wait for table. I got to share a table with another single guest. So I guess I am not eating alone ? :)

The lunch menu is huge compare to Ferderick's or China Cottage. Anything you can think of is in the menu for $5.95 or $6.95 which includes a spring rolls and a can of pop.

The waiter is really nice and family. I ask him to recommend something really spicy. He recommended the Manchurian Chicken ($5.95) and make it extra spicy for me. 

My order arrive quickly. Yes the order is huge. The chicken is deep fried first then cooked in spicy sauce with chilli and garlic. Not too spicy for me however it makes me feel nice and warm in my tummy.

I really enjoy my lunch, but I do wish there is some veggie in the dishes, since veggie are good for me. OK there are some cabbage in my spring roll.. but that would not have count? I guess I can be unhealthy once in awhile.

I will definitely be back for lunch and try out other items! It will take me a long long time to try them all out!

They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Ok food. Bad service. Food has too much MSG. Value is ok for quantity of food , but food quality is not there."}
{"text":"This place is halal and a great sit-down joint for the family. Things can be spicy here but you can tell them to tone it down - and mild will actually taste mild. When we arrived it was quite busy but we only waited a few minutes to be seated and our orders were taken promptly. Their service is superb as we had our appetizers come out quickly and the mains following soon after.

The food is delicious and affordable which you just can't beat. I'm in love with the Hot and sour soup in any variation - veggie, chicken or seafood! I also enjoy their Bombay chicken, Lollipop chicken, and Beef with snow peas & mushroom. You're bound to go gaga over something here so gather round a group of foodies and order a few things to try off the menu."}
{"text":"We took dinner for 6 and loved it. So we went back for a eat in dinner. As usual the staff are very friendly and informative about the dishes. 

The restaurant has a mixture of different Asian types of food. What caught our interests was the Hakka style. We found it a nice blend of Indian and Chinese food. If you like Thai they have that too. 

We would certainly go back try different varieties of Asian food the this restaurant offers. It's a bonus that it's in the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Great value in regards to price and portion sizes. Very consistent when it comes to quality of food as well. Unfortunately, I've yet to try anything from their dessert menu. My only gripe, is that at times, you don't always get the free cup of rice that normally comes with particular dishes; this also happens when you take out.

Good, helpful, and friendly wait staff. Clean restaurant as well. 

And for those that do decide to take out, there's 10% off if you pay with cash."}
{"text":"Good food, cheap prices but poor service!

The food is good considering the price and the amount they give you. Tangerine caters towards their take-out customers rather than their dine-in customers. Called in to ask if they accept reservations, they just said \"come now\" and hung up on me.

Once we got there, the waiter pointed at a seat for us to sit. Waited long to order and to receive our food. 

I'm only offering 3/5 stars because the food was good and cheap. Ordered General TSO chicken, 8 spring rolls, Canto Chowmein. For dessert: Chocolate mouse and fried banana. Among 4 people, it came up to $12 each."}
{"text":"I ordered the mixed vegetables and the Bombay chicken. This mixed vegetables was not bad, a combination of tasty and cheapy veggies.

The star of the show was the Bombay chicken. As a light weight in spicy food this spice blew me into sweat oblivion crying for my mamas uncles wife. The chicken had a nice crispy texture topped with delicious satayed onions. My mouth was burning hot fire but I kept gobbling it down. Had to lick rice to keep going"}
{"text":"The food is just fantastic and excellent host. Very friendly and extremely polite 

Would definitely recommend eating there."}
{"text":"FYI....the restaurant is now called Hakka Legend, same food, menu and staff as before, seems like only the name has changed."}
{"text":"Tangerine - a long standing establishment in Hakka cuisine for the Markham area. I've gone here a couple of times over the years and while my South Asian friends just keep coming back, I am definitely not as excited as they are. 

I order only one thing, and that's honey garlic chicken. It is quite good and the flavour is nice. Also their crispy lemon chicken is good as well. For roughly $10 you get a medium sized dish of your entree of choice and also a small bowl of rice as well. (The ones at like dim sum, very small) One of my complaints is that it's definitely not enough rice. The ratio of meat to rice is way off and while I have almost half my chicken dish left, my rice is almost depleted. Ahhh!!! This leads you to paying an extra $1.25 for rice that should have been included. 

Service is eh. Inattentive and uncaring. It was hard to track a waiter down and they did not add to our experience and did not care at all. 

3/5. I like the food, but the lack of service and the wrong ratio irks me. I'd rather not come back again but I keep ending up there lol."}
{"text":"Service seems to be going down compared to how it was a few years back. Food used to be fast and better portioned. And they seem to be always running out of spring roll or are trying to get rid of it from the combo. Staff are always friendly but been disappointed with the food lately."}
{"text":"Very Tasty, love the chicken singapore noodles.  The new revamped layout is much nicer than the original restaurant.  Staff are very friendly as well.   They have excellent prices on their lunch specials and they don't skimp on quantity."}
{"text":"We order takeout from here a few times from work.  Had the different varieties of chicken, all were good.  Never tried the chilli chicken yet but coworkers say that it is better than the competition down the street.  Gotta make one thing clear though.   This is not traditional Hakka food.  It is Indian-Chinese food made by Hakka Chinese.  This is a common misconception by non-Chinese folk.  The majority of the Chinese community in India are Hakka Chinese descent, so they created a type of Chinese food that suited the taste of the Indian population, causing the misconception of real Hakka food.  Go Wiki authentic Hakka food and it is nothing like what you see here."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.. Absolutely love the sesame and chilli chicken here. So good! 

Renovated back in 2013 ish, the restaurant expanded into the neighbouring unit. Much more seating available now. 

The service on a Friday night was great. I got my order in within 10 minutes, food came out super quick and we were checked on 4-5 times throughout our meal. And the bill was $21! Winning!

All in all its a great joint for Asian food. Love it. 4/5 for me."}
{"text":"This is where I discovered my love of Chili Chicken. The soup here is great, prices are decent for what you get. But dried chili chicken with the sauce on the side is amazing. The deep fried fish was really great. The portions are huge. Definitely wouldn't over do the ordering as I've had so much leftover to take out every time...But I'm not complaining. 

The place has been turned into Hakka Legend but it definitely still has the same feel and people working there. 

Definitely my new go to place after work when I want some comfort food."}
{"text":"Hungry for FUUUD!  No other way I can describe my being H'Angry (Angry from Hunger).  I haven't eaten since breakie and was running all over the place.  Yup...all over the place chasing a little white ball all over the green pastures of a golf course!  I know, I just bought no sympathies from anyone!  :P
Tangerine isn't a bank branch, it is a Hakka/Fusion/Chinese food place in North Richmond Hill.  I think this is their 3rd location.
Since I'm still on my Hakka binge, decided to give this place a try.
The new place is pretty nice.  Well designed seating areas with a simple bar area that the cash register is located.  It wasn't that busy when we were there but a few tables were ordering quite a bit of food.
My bud and I ordered the Hot and Sour Chicken Soup, Crispy Ginger Beef, and the Chilli Chicken with Gravy.
The HSS looked appetizing, however, it was neither Hot or Sour.  The Crispy Ginger Beef was crispy, however, it was really soggy with oils and more breading than beef.  The fact was I couldn't taste if there was any beef at all as it was so overly sweet.  The Chilli Chicken had no heat and there was more gravy than food.
All in all, it was disappointing.  It did fill me up but was not a great meal experience.  May try again if I am going through the area.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"I went here and ordered some food for takeout. I paid $80 for the food. After, I asked for 6 chilli oil as we enjoy our food spicy. The lady at the cash hesitated to give it to me and wanted to charge me extra for it. I was very DISAPPOINTED. I literally told her off and said charge me if she wants to. Then the other person at the front said to give it to me. I got 8 dishes from them. I had to remind her that and she gave it but wasn't happy giving it. There are other Hakka food places around that area. Next time I will definitely hesitate to order from them again. And yes I know in most places it does state they charge extra for chilli oil. And that makes sense. If you two dishes and want 10 chilli oil. Yes charge extra. But not when you order that much food and you are asking for a reasonable amount since lots of people are going to eat it. 
Otherwise Food is fine. Taste is fine. Portions wise- the meats or vegetables come in the black circular take out dishes. 
The rice or noodles come in the half size styrofoam containers."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant to get your Hakka Fixing
Everyone who works at this location is very friendly and all the wait staff are very attentive! Our party of 5 were seated at a very large and spacious booth.

After being seated with menus another wait staff came over and took our drinks orders.
Pop is served in the can....so no free refills. Green is freshly steeped with real leaves and served in a tall mug and they provide you with extra cups so you only need one order.

We decided to order many different things to try. Portions here are HUGE so just order one of each item and white rice comes free with most dishes.

Appetizers
Chicken Pakora -Crispy & spicy battered chunks of chicken served w/lemon
Fried Chicken Wontons -Super crispy morsels of chicken deep fried in a wonton wrapper
Mango Salad -refreshing slivers of sweet peppers, mango, onions, & cilantro

Meats
Chili Tiger Prawns - Spicy & flavorful *definitely recommend if your a fan of prawns
Bombay Chicken - Spicy battered dry chicken dish *a favorite at our table
Honey Garlic Chicken - Very flavorful battered & tossed in a delightful honey garlic sauce
Manchurian Chicken - this was the least favorite meat dish at the table, not spicy mild and tangy sauce

Rice/Noodles ***substantial portions of both
Chicken Fried Rice
Manchurian Chow Mein

Service here was just amazing. All the waitstaff come around to check on you even the owner even came over a few times and gave us recommendations on what to order and made sure everything was to our liking. Food is delivered hot, fresh, piled high and quick. Empty dishes were cleared on time and they pack all your leftovers to go for you. We were too stuffed to even glance at the dessert menu however the fortune cookies served with the check was just the perfect amount of sweetness we could tolerate after that glorious meal."}
