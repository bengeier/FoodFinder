{"text":"This place is so inconsistent with its food and wait staff went there once and the food was excellent then the next 3 times I wouldn't feed it to my dogs last time we were there we left after trying to order our food when the waitress walked away yelling about how I ordered my food how it was stated on the menu. we left money to cover our drinks and a tip and left will not be going back there for sure. I have never been treated that horrible in any food establishment ever not even at a fast food place if you are planning on going here for the first time you will get better food and service at Wendy's it's in the same parking lot"}
{"text":"I'd recommend this to friends.  Happy hour prices are decent.  $2 for a shot.   The wings are OK, they aren't a reason to show up, but they weren't horrible. I have eaten several burgers/sandwiches here, and have never been disappointed.  The past few times have had a bit more of a wait for the food than I'd like.  The waiter was super-cool about it, but it was still a bit unexpectedly annoying."}
{"text":"Sadly, I've been disappointed here on my four visits since moving to Aurora a few months ago.  While it's conveniently close, adequate parking, decent beer and wine list, clean and neat: 1) the staff seems tired, as though they've given up inside, at least they're nice and they smile at me (or grimace, I can't detect the difference actually). 2) the food couldn't be more uninspiring. If you've ever been to Cleats you know what I mean. A $12 hamburger should cause me to utter at least one \"mmmm\" when I bite into it.  If the plates and server uniforms bore the Classic Sysco label we could argue whether it's iconic or just truth in advertising. 'Classic' being Sysco's budget line of frozen foods, not to be confused with the Imperial and Supreme grade  line of product offerings. I generously offer three stars for consistent mediocre food and service. Sure, I'll still stop by for a beer or three, (but I'll bring food from the grocery store deli across the parking lot.) Dec 2014."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the lunch service is incredibly slow!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials...$2 - 20 oz drafts include Killian's and Blue Moon, not just the cheap domestics!"}
{"text":"What's below 1 star? Besides being dirty, the food stinks. If you rate this place anything more than 1 star I have no respect for you restaurant opinion. But the worst part is the owner, who is far from qualified to run any business. When approached about issues, he was condescending, rude, arrogant, but most importantly, told us, the CUSTOMER (who is always right) we wouldn't like his place in the future. He's wrong...we will love when his restaurant will be out of business in 6 months and something else moves in. What a dump"}
{"text":"Terrible food terrible service terrible ownership. Plain and simple. Don't waste your time or money. Awful negative environment as well."}
{"text":"I had the fried mozzarella appetizer and the  pork and pear salad for dinner. It was all amazing!"}
{"text":"The Aurora location has a boring bar atmosphere. They have a lot of  big screen TV's all around the interior, but none with sound, and the staff keeps changing the satellite radio to different stations. The menu has been pared down quite a bit, which would lead you to think that the limited number of items would be less challenging for the kitchen staff, but that's not the case. My husband's burger was under cooked, and the chicken on my salad was over done. Our server seemed uninterested,  and we had to ask twice for extra napkins and ketchup. The women's room wasn't very clean.  All in all, this was an average, not going to be back place."}
{"text":"It was A balmy Sunday afternoon so spouse and I though to enjoy the patio and maybe a movie after lunch here at Doogans. We both ordered chicken Gorgonzola salads. Sounded great. Had walnuts, raisins with a balsamic dressing with grilled chicken. Chicken was perfect: moist inside, grilled outside. All ingredients were fresh. It just didn't have the zing I expected from Gorgonzola. So it was good. Not really good. Last time spouse had the same salad she recalls it was \"really good\". Now the close: we had a coupon. But it was turned down because the & amount was too low before tax. !!??  Now I'm just pissed I had to spend an extra dollar."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and it is slowly going down hill, sad to say. It took 45-60 minutes for our food to come out. Once we got our food, the pizza was burnt. I actually spoke with the owner. He apologized and voided the pizza and sent a fresh one home. So, great on the customer service....not so good on the wait time and quality of food. I wish them the best and hope things improve soon.  UPDATE: Silly me. Someone reached out from the restaurant claiming the menu was totally overhauled and under new management.  Nope.   And still no knowledge of happy hour specials, server had to go check the price on every beer we asked about.   Just here to use my $8 coupon.  It's sad, really.  Maybe Panini's or Winking Lizard will buy this place?!?!"}
{"text":"Typical bar food and bar atmosphere. The food is decent but very greasy. Also a decent beer selection. If you want great food and an astounding beer selection, I would give Doogan's a pass and go to The Winking Lizard Tavern."}
{"text":"New ownership and no more Alex.   Service went way down. I'm not sure about the food. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Needing some food after a long day of shopping, we stopped here on our way back from the Aurora Outlets. I had read the reviews so wasn't expecting anything awesome and pretty much that's what we got...just average bar food.  We started off with an order of boneless chicken wings (medium heat). They tasted like they had been heated up from a previously frozen status (like you'd get in the freezer section of your local grocer). Surprisingly enough, I really liked them, although I also really like the freezer ones that I heat up at home too...(Oh shoot that should be my little secret...hehe). Anyway, on to the main meal.  My boyfriend ordered the Whatcha Want Burger  (pick any 3 toppings, he chose cheese and onion straws). He ordered it medium and said that it was cooked right and tasted okay, but believes it was also previously frozen.  I had the Pretzel Club (smoked turkey, ham, bacon, honey dijon and Swiss & American cheeses on a pretzel bun). Again, not to repeat myself over and over, but I didn't find this sandwich anything to be excited about. It was okay.  The service was the best part of the place. We sat at a booth in the bar area. It wasn't really busy when we were there, and the bartender was also the server. He was quick to attend to us and friendly.  So in the end, not horrible, but not great. If in the neighborhood again will definitely try to find something else, but if this is the only place open I'd go again."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and stopped here after a day of unpacking the house. The wait/bar staff services was pretty pathetic. Hot young blonds who don't seem particularly interested in showing up at your table for 20 minutes. At one point the bartender or kitchen staff guy came over and realized we hadn't been helped. We weren't in a hurry, so, while it was annoying, it wasn't a meal ruiner for us. My husband went back with a friend another time and had the exact same experience- very lackadaisical service, so I know it wasn't a one-time thing.  The saving grace of this place is that their bar food is actually pretty decent! I was pleasantly surprised. My FIL got this enormous corned beef sandwich that looked to die for. It was seriously as large or larger than some New York deli reubens. I had a burger and it was tasty, fries were good. Overall, I enjoyed the food a lot, and on nights when we aren't in a rush, we'll probably be back for a beer and some food, but certainly don't expect stellar service here. They are in need of a new manager in that department, badly."}
{"text":"Doogan's is in a good location, right by the movie theater and grocery store. Though, I would never feel the need to come back. The food is greasy and just not good. It does not look appealing. The wait for food is long. The staff is not always friendly and seems to forget about you. I once just estimated my bill and left, because there was no one around to get the bill. No one. I wouldn't go back. There could be a better restaurant there."}
{"text":"Average bar food.   Good fries.  Below average service.   This place is kind of a last resort when you need something relatively quick and kid friendly (read: mac n cheese and burgers).  The decor needs serious updating.   Seems a little run down."}
{"text":"This used to be the place to go to catch up with friends and enjoy some decent bar food.  Unfortunately, it's taken a turn for the worse.  Our community deserves better than this, and the legacy of this restaurant deserves better.  It saddens me to say that I don't support this longtime business anymore, because I truly do miss what it provided to Aurora."}
{"text":"I had the club on a pretzel bun here and it was positively orgasmic!  My husband had the Reuben and he loved that, too!  The atmosphere is friendly and well done but definitely sports bar.  Get there early on any game day!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for close to a decade and it has not failed but to be a favorite. Impressively wide variety in the menu, but I find my self getting the same meal each time, the chicken wings. Absolutely unbeatable. Large, tender and flavorful. Easily one of the best wing you can find in the entire area."}
{"text":"Don't let these 4-5 star ratings fool you (or the pics which are outdated). Most of them are from the people who are trapped in the Aurora bubble or friends of ppl who work here.   Doogans has gone downhill over the past 10 years. This used to be one if my favorite local spots when I was in HS. They used to have hands down the best burgers, hand cut fries, French onion soup, etc.. Now you can expect below average bar food.  Stopped in for a bite after not dining here for almost 6 years. Chicken tasted like it had been warmed up and had a bad smell to it.  Hand cut fries are gone. My buddy had a taco salad which consisted of crunched up Doritos and microwaved taco meat.   Looks like they still have good beer sections but unless you want a HS reunion every time you stop in, I would avoid this place. Staff is friendly tho..  Better off going to Mad Jacks just right down the road if you want some top notch food! It's a shame I don't know what happened to this place (change in ownership??) I might of just ordered the wrong thing my last time stopping in but coming back is not high up on my list."}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars bc there is not a lot to pick from in aurora and its very kid friendly after a sports event.  Its average with good fun.  Just another sports bar but its good.  Also has pretty of space for the 'team'."}
{"text":"The food was good and the place was clean but the service was really slow. I had to wait about 10 minutes just to get a glass of water and my food took about an hour just to finally come. I was almost thinking of just going to Wendy's which is right by this place and cheaper. There was only 1 waitress there and I was in a group of about 30 people. They had TVs on the wall but no captions were showing so you don't know what they're saying on the TV. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This restaurant is near Cinemark so we came in before a movie, and the restaurant was pretty packed, so service was slow and sporadic; we waited 30 minutes after we ordered to get our food and part of our meal had been forgotten - but at least rectified quickly.  We ordered wings with firecracker sauce (reminds me a bit of Asian Zing from BDubs in heat and somewhat in taste) and the spinach and artichoke panini. I enjoyed the wings (somewhat small pieces for the price) and the panini was tasty but very greasy and had an off-balance of too much bread in my opinion. We have been here once or twice before, and I've always thought the food was decent - with that special diner feel, although personalized service is just not quite there to justify frequent return visits.  All in all, not bad... Just meh."}
{"text":"AC broken. Floors greasy and dangerously slippery to walk on. Broken bathroom stall and sink.  Ordered a Taco salad which I brought a friend there specifically for.  Totally different that what Doogan's used to serve.  Service very poor.  Gnats and flies all over.  Salad were spicy hot and of very poor quality.  I would never recommend Doogan's to anyone again.  Not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. We were there over an hour before we got our food and I wish they would have forgotten it altogether. My General Tso wings were so salty I thought I was licking a salt block - I ordered 10 and only received 5 thank goodness. My husband got the prime rib special and it came out with the salad and cold. We were there an hour and a half and never got our drinks refilled either. Worst meal and even worse service. Definitely won't be going back ever."}
{"text":"They were out of burgers.  Half their beer selection was out.  The staff was standing near the door smoking.   1st and last visit.   Appears to be going under."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I always order a turkey burger. They are really flavorful and not dry at all. I do not eat beef and I am picky about my turkey burgers. Many are dry but this one is not. The fries are also really crispy and tasty. The service is usually fast and friendly and the food is quite good. The coffee can be a hit or miss but when it is fresh it is good too."}
{"text":"Stopped by and had wings and a corned beef samich today. The garlic wings were great and the corned beef was excellent.  As for the service,out waiter \"Jennifer\" was fantastic.  Was real happy with our first stop at Doogans"}
{"text":"Wings above average.  The haddock is the real deal.  I haven't been served such an authentic filet since vendors just started call fish whatever they wanted."}
{"text":"Loved it! First of all our waitress Jen was a very nice woman...served us well. I had the Pulled Chicken Philly, incredible...with garlic mayo, sauteed mushrooms and a perfect amount of cheese. I met one of the Doogan boys...great guy. Go there, what a place! Only problem was, my wife vomited all her food up shortly after we got home."}
{"text":"Came here for a company event and a prix fixe menu.  Appetizers consisted of spinach/artichoke dip, breaded zucchini and buffalo wings. None of which tasted house-made.  I opted for fish and chips. The fries were okay but the fish was not crispy enough. The staff was accomdating and the open bar was good as we were able to request additional beers and liquors from the front bar."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly, but the whole place was a little run-down & dingy. Food was only okay. We ordered a pizza & some wings. Nothing I would go around recommending, or go back for. Saw a \"shot of the month\" special that sounded pretty good so we stopped at the bar on our way out to try. Really just tasted like an even sweeter (too sweet) malibu. Oh well"}
{"text":"Inconsistent food, and has been inedible as of late. Will consider trying soon since I believe there is new management."}
{"text":"My most recent review of this place (about 10 months ago) was removed for my foul language. I literally got an email from Yelp that said I was naughty and they were removing it. Here is my cleaned up version: do not go!  The 16 year old hostesses and the 30 something owner are always huddled at the hostess station and as you walk in, they look at you as though you are interrupting their conversation. As you leave, they don't even bother to say good bye or thank you.  A sign of a place that does not care. I won't comment on the food as the service is worse."}
{"text":"We always get the same waiter. The service is great. Doogan's Dogs are so bad for you but oh' so good."}
{"text":"Was looking for a bite to eat within walking distance from the hotel we were staying at.   Good service, the pretzel club sandwich was terrific, and the beer prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Went with friend and suprise! Summer Shandy on tap and on special!!! Had a sloppy runny burger with bacon and a huge tomato slice that really hit the spot!   ff were hot and fresh~!!  She had a well prepaired house salad and NE style Clam Chowder. VERY nice!  Server was  attentive so overall a great  night!"}
{"text":"Four words: Sweet Potato Tater Tots.   It might have taken some time, but I have established a respectable relationship with Doogan's - a standby that has proven to be a great option for both weeknights and/or weekends.  The husband and I tend to stop by and unwind for happy hour: $2 well drinks, $3 select drafts, among other daily specials. Oh right, and for a side of those sweet potato tater tots!  A nice selection of martinis, craft beer (both on draft or bottled), and wine. My über \"selective\" spouse has happily gulped down many 'o Great Lakes Seasonals, a Stone Arrogant Bastard, and a Ithaca Cascazilla, among others - all on draft.  The atmosphere is casual and perfect for enjoying a Tribe, Browns, or Cavs game in the bar. The main dining room also seems like an ideal spot for families, although I must admit it has been ages since I've sat there.    We typically grab a seat at a tall bar table to enjoy a couple drinks, share an appetizer, and potentially dinner - highly recommend the nachos or chorizo chips (obviously not diet food, but well worth it). For health nuts - there is a wide selection of salads (caprese, walnut and bleu cheese, and cobb to name a few). My better half typically gets a buffalo chicken wrap, pretzel bun club, or meatball sub (with a side of green bean fries) that he scarfs down in minutes.  Go to Doogan's if you just want to relax over good food and drinks with family or friends - a simple place with simple pleasures*"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for about 7 years we used to really enjoy this place but it seems to have gone downhill somewhat the staff has never been overly  friendly everyone from the hostess not even greeting you to say hello to unfriendly servers the food is average at best not to be negative but we just had a very substandard dining experience including a filthy bathroom."}
{"text":"I've been stopping here for years. It seems like things have slipped a bit. The menu is now primarily sandwiches with a decent selection. The variety of appetizers and other entrees is no longer there.  Decent bar, good selection of beers.  Wine list limited.  Service remains good"}
{"text":"After reading reviews of this place I was skeptical about selecting this place as a pre-movie dinner with a friend, but I figured we'd give it a shot. I will agree that there was hardly anybody in the place at 5:30; even for a Tuesday it seemed pretty slow. But I will say the service was quick and professional, so maybe it was just one server who is getting all these negative reviews.   The food itself was mediocre bar food, nothing more. The fries were definitely fresh and delicious, and the burger I got was just okay. I was surprised to see that it was actually cooked medium as I had ordered it, but it seemed a tad bit \"off\" to me, like it had been previously frozen. My friend got the chicken tortilla soup and the french dip sandwich and she said both were good.   Overall, I wouldn't say \"stay away!\" like some of these other reviews. It's an okay place to get \"just okay\" food before a movie. I probably wouldn't seek it out aside from that."}
{"text":"Decided to hit this place up after a weekday evening trip to the outlet mall nearby. Since there really does not to appear to be much in the area. This place has a pretty cool atmosphere lots of Televisions with various games on. It is super bright and the jukebox played intermittently and was sometimes super loud and sometimes barely audible. I think it depended if a regular played the song or not. We ordered beer and food per usual I got the porterhouse pork chop. Which was a nice huge piece of meat but sadly it was relatively tasteless. My guest got the Czar burger which is their take on the roman burger from Mr Hero. It was awesome and huge. The fries were crispy and tasty. I did find a hair in my dish however once the manager was made aware she resolved the situation promptly. Overall the place was ok. If you find something else in the area you might want to try that but if you want to it would not be a waste to stroll into Doogans."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome and got the kitchen to prepare something they no longer have on the menu for me. Food is average bar food. Wouldn't go out of my way to stop back but would eat here again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Not impressed. We started with the skillet nachos which weren't bad. However, opted for a salad with chicken after that and it wasn't great. My son got the boneless wings. It was processed frozen crap chicken and the BBQ sauce was gross. Service was good, Bar looked ok and they offer nice happy hour specials. If I was going back it would be to sit at the bar and watch a game. If the family and I are going out for dinner this place would not be the first choice."}
{"text":"Reminds me of an Applebee's or not-so-kitschy TGIFridays. If you like stuff like that (which I is fine by me), then you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Solid pub fare. If you want to clog your arteries for a meal, definitely go here. I also love just stopping by for a drink and some fried green beans after a work day. You should definitely get the fried green beans if you stop by here! It's bigger than it looks and always has an interesting crowd."}
{"text":"Used to be a decent place to go in Aurora.  However, since Jeff Walter, the new owner took over, things have gone down hill quickly.  While the food was never great, the service was always decent.  For some reason, the entire staff has been turned over.  The new staff is a reflection of the new owner, arrogant and unwelcoming.    The food is average and even some of their staples, like the Firecracker wings, seem to have less sauce and were under cooked.   Aurora seems to have noticed too. I have been in there 4 times over the last 4 weeks during prime times (Browns' football game, Sunday night football, Saturday afternoon, etc) and the place has been empty.  I asked some of the staff if it had been slow, and they all agreed that it had been.  I expressed my legitimate concern about their ability to stay open with such poor numbers.     Yesterday, after I placed my order, the owner approached me and asked why I was \"causing problems\" the last time I was in.  He mentioned that it was inappropriate and disrespectful to comment on the lack of guests and that I shouldn't talk to his staff.  He then canceled my food order and asked me to leave.  I will never return."}
{"text":"This place used to be great, NOT ANYMORE.  7 pm on a Fri night and the place was dead and still the service was terrible, an hour to get a sandwich."}
{"text":"First time we were there we were so impressed. Not the same place the second time around. Food was terrible. Wait staff was lacking basic knowledge of the menu. Which in turn caused the owner? Or manager? To then treat us badly. No napkins no silverware. Customers were chasing waitresses down."}
{"text":"Food: great Service: bad  I go to Doogan's regularly and the service this time around was sub-par. They did immediately fix my wife's order after it came out missing a couple of things but we didn't get any refills and had to wait a long time for everything (order, food, check, etc.).  It also was apparently the first time anyone had ever heard of Groupon. That was unfortunate for me. I *did* give them my Groupon before I ordered and it still took them up to 20 minutes after we were finished with coats on and kids starting to melt down before they figured out how to apply the discount. Then another 5 minutes to process my credit card. Odd  I will go back because I know this visit was unusual."}
{"text":"The food here it really, really good.  I love the chicken quesadillas, and the sweet potato fries are awesome.  Why only 3 stars? They service is very, very slow, and this place is expensive.  Yes, it is in Aurora where there aren't that many options, and this area has a lot of married couples that make a lot of money.  But I am a single person making a decent single persons living, and I think paying $14 for a chicken quesadilla is a little much. Still, I don't mind coming here and paying a little extra every once in awhile because, like I said, the options in the area are limited and the food is good."}
{"text":"This place served our very large party not only quickly, but accurately.  The food was fantastic.  Burgers are top-notch, and the apps are great as well.  Every person was pleased!!"}
{"text":"Just horrible food didn't look appetizing at all presentation of the food sloppy I guess if I needed a drink that's the place to go but to call your self a restaurant not for me."}
{"text":"The service was great! Ali, Alex, Lauren, and Sarah are great bartenders! The chef made me up an awesome wood fire pizza! Happy hour prices are pretty good too! Never had anything other than a smiling face serve me here!"}
{"text":"Doogan's is a great place to come and hang out with friends.The Residence at Barrington, located down the street, has a Happy Hour at there every once in a while. That's how I found out about Doogan's. They are always having awesome drink specials. If you go there, be sure to try the gyros!"}
{"text":"Always sit at the bar and service is always consistent.   Hurricane (Alex) takes care of me and friends all the time even with fulll bar & servers service.  Menu has been condensed over the couple of years,  but always like the Burgers to order.  Great time"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience.   We had been to Doogans a few years ago and had a good meal.   Tonight our food was cold and just not good.  The waitress really had no idea what was going on and when she asked another one for help the other waitress was just as dumbfounded by is asking for a beer menu.  I have never written a review before but this was so bad I had to."}
{"text":"Very good service.  The food was average and the place could use a little updating.  The beer selection was good.  If they updated the place and focused on the quality of the food I bet they could really do something with the restaurant."}
