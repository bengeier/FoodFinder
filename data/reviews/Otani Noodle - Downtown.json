{"text":"Love this place! Service is always fast and friendly. Food is great as well. I will definitely keep coming back. So glad they took over Noodlecat's spot."}
{"text":"Otani Noodle had good food and very friendly staff. A pleasant atmosphere in the new, cute location downtown."}
{"text":"OMG!  Absolutely fabulous!! Udon was full of flavor and fresh ingredients. The staff is friendly and courteous. Restaurant is clean and cheery. Loved it here!"}
{"text":"I had the beef curry upton while visiting downtown Cleveland. The curry was on par with the flavor and the beef was cooked well with out being dry. It also had corn, onions and broccoli in it. It was very good. My only suggestion is I wish  the menus weren't hanging on the wall right by the register so you have a little more time to review it before the pressure of ordering. There was a long line so it would have given everyone plenty of time to review the options."}
{"text":"Great expansion to the Otani ramen empire.  It is similar to the one close to Case Western but has a significantly larger space, more appetizers and side dishes.  I think this place has the best ramen in Cleveland. Wish there was better parking available but this probably won't matter to most of its city dwelling clientele.  Appreciate having the option to have another serving or ramen noodles after you've slurped down the first.  Don't think that the original one had it last I checked.  Enjoyed the fried chicken wings though they weren't cheap, not expensive either.  Met the owner, she was very friendly.  I tried to convince her to open a branch on the Southside of Cleveland.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious place to get sake and warm noodle soup.  Friendly service compared to other Asian places.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service! Ive had the pork belly ramen and its very rich. The broth is really quite tasty and not too salty. The bubble tea is ok, too much ice and not enough bubble. The teriyaki wings were a bit on the soft side, I wouldn't reorder those."}
{"text":"Very good miso and vegetable ramen.  Clean friendly and nice modern mural art.  Music upbeat and not too loud.  Good edamame and good vibe."}
{"text":"After discovering that many of the restaurants around this area are closed for lunch, my boyfriend and I stumbled onto this place. 

We decided to share a spicy pork ramen (#11), curry shrimp bbq and pork belly bbq. We also shared a pot of green tea. 

The service here is super friendly and helpful! She knew we were sharing everything and gave us extra bowls and plates. She also let us know that hot tea we ordered is actually an entire tea pot and recommended that we share it. 

Overall we were very pleased with our lunch experience and the prices here were very fair compared to their portions."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Finally, a good ramen place in Cleveland. So superior over its previous resident Noodlecat. Quite a large portion of soup for $8-11. I couldn't finish all the perfectly cooked noodles in the miso ramen. Fast service and fitting decor in a comfortable space. The modern country music playing was a bit distracting and out of place.Looking forward to a second visit."}
{"text":"Great addition to downtown cleveland. This place is like fast food (order at the register and they bring your food out based on your number ) 
We got the fish balls (they were doused in a great Japanese sweet curry sauce) for our app. 
I got the spicy ramen (I wish they had bamboo on the side to add) that came with pork slices as well as corn and Chinese mushroom. The noodles were chewy and plentiful. The broth was flavorful and thick. My only issue is that it wasn't hot enough! Ramen should be piping hot (esp since the broth is premade). Next time I will ask them to heat my soup double before adding the noodles. 
My bf got the pork katsu curry don which was awesome (esp with the chili oil on the table. We also used the excess fish ball curry sauce as  well. Really was couldn't get enough of it). 
Def will be back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best vegetarian ramen I've had in Cleveland. The bowl is filled with crisp vegetables and delicious broth and incredible noodles. It was very filling too. The decor is fun but I could do without televisions."}
{"text":"On a grey winter day in downtown Cleveland, stop in for a hot bowl of ramen to lift your spirits.  Otani features a hip, trendy, colorful interior with bright and bubbly digital wall menus and flat screen TVs.  Sharp and clear pictures of each dish allow you to size up the many choices and their different toppings.   The dishes comes out quickly in sleek black bowls, and do not disappoint the palate. While the ramen here may not be Ivan Orkin from Chef's Table Season 3-level, the core \"umami\" qualities are there: a well-balanced broth showcasing a meaty richness and a sweet, miso finish, melt-in-your-mouth char sui pork, chewy noodles, soft boiled egg, and a medley of dried mushroom, scallion and corn.  

With stellar places like Otani popping up, Cleveland continues solidify its reputation as a foodie city.  Throw it into your rotation as a nice alternative to pho, and a handy restorative elixir after a good night of drinking."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken don buri but got rice with chicken with a fried egg on top and sweet sauce! Nothing like a don buri."}
{"text":"We found this while at the asphalt convention, off of our Yelp app. It is so great to have the help of all u who take time to write reviews!! This was excellent food!! Fast service."}
{"text":"Loooove the fact that Otani Noodle decided to open up downtown as well! This location has so many more options than the one in University Circle. We got appetizers and bubble tea here! All time favorite is the Char Siu with my beloved Strawberry flavored bubble tea. At first I fell in love with green tea and gave Thai tea a try (no bueno, uber sweeeet), but quickly fell in love with strawberry. This is the ramen shop you should stop by especially on those cold snowy/rainy days to warm the soul."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Each dish has been beltway so far:  the #12 spicy and #1 with noodles and rice dishes are all great.  (I need to remember to ask for forks; eating noodles with chopsticks can be messy)"}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about ramen so I can't give it any more than 3 stars but if you're looking for something that's \"good enough\", this place fits the bill. Plus there isn't any good ramen in Cleveland so if you're really craving ramen just come here if you're nearby."}
{"text":"Food came fast, it was delicious and very nicely satisfied a ramen craving. Will be coming again, tho it is 45 mins away!"}
{"text":"Just tried Otani noodle for the first time and it was good. I went with the pork belly kontotsu ramen soup. The pork belly and ramen were tasty. Good job Otani"}
{"text":"Two words: HOLY SHIT. Cleveland FINALLY has another delicious noodle house. You know how Cleveland is notorious for blind date-esque experiences pertaining to food? Like, the pictures make you salivate and your heart starts developing palpitations, but when you see it in person it's the Catfish of the culinary world? You won't experience that here. The pictures match the experience. 

Ramen AND udon are fresh, hot, and full of robust flavors. Noodles are fresh and chewy and you'll be slurping up every last bite. 

Today my party of 3 ordered the curry beef udon, OG veggie udon bowl, and the pork belly ramen. All of it was super tasty (and under $11 for HUGE portions!). Otani has a decent sized menu but you can tell they pour their heart and soul into each dish. They have carry out as well! 

Decor is pretty stellar-- very modern Japanese. Super bright and colorful murals and paintings throughout that really set the bar for a unique and pleasant experience. 

I cannot wait to come back and devour more of the delicious menu."}
{"text":"Came here looking to satisfy a hard ramen craving and was not disappointed! They have an efficient system of ordering/paying at the counter and then having staff deliver your meal to your table. I got the pork belly ramen and my boyfriend got the tempura ramen. Broth was flavorful and came with a half egg. We also ordered the pork belly buns which were delicious!
Wasn't sure if I should tip at the counter when paying but I think you definitely should (or leave tip at your table when you are done) because there are servers that serve you/clean up after you are done. 
I think the quality of ramen is even better than Noodle cat which occupied this location before. Looking forward to coming here again!!"}
{"text":"Ordered karaage, and pork belly ramen.  Dry and hard,  either it's leftover from the weekend because I came on a Monday but i have never been more disappointed eating ramen before."}
{"text":"The food was made hot. The location is on a main strip. You will not be disappointed if you eat here."}
{"text":"Really happy we found this place. Not busy at all before the Cavs game and super fast friendly service. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! It replaced the NoddleCat location that used to be here and it did not disappoint. The ramen was hot and fresh! The staff was beyond helpful and the view is a great add on!"}
{"text":"An amazing ramen shop in the heart of downtown. 
I've never minded driving from the west side out to University Circle for their delicious food. Now I only hope they have a skip the dishes or UberEATS to bring it right to my door. This is going to be a great winter with this ramen in my belly."}
{"text":"This new location downtown is great.  The other one by Case is pretty small, but this one has plenty of room in the old Noodle Cat space.  And this is a huge improvement over Noodle Cat in every way, even tho they don't serve alcohol.

The pork belly and broth is super rich, and I  can't finish it, so instead I get the roasted pork, miso or chicken for something a little lighter.  You can't go wrong really, everything is great. 

The service is friendly and fast.  Just order at the counter, grab a drink, and in a few minutes they bring the food to your table.  Literally fast food. 

The tables are quickly cleared and cleaned for the next patrons.  Everything is clean including the bathrooms.

Like the \"uptown\" location, parking here is also not convenient, so it's not easy to just pop in, unless you work or live downtown.  It is worth the effort once you do arrive."}
{"text":"This ramen place is far from being authentic. The noodles taste like the ones you get from the frozen/refrigerated section from the supermarket, then corn tastes like canned corns, and the soup base is lacking. It's alright if you see it as a convenient fast food place, but it's not like a bowl of authentic Japanese ramen."}
{"text":"Good casual ramen joint near the university. There are not a lot of tables, but usually not too crowded. No frills. Just the way I like it."}
{"text":"It's a small and modern and clean place, with decent ramen for the area! 

There's pictures of the dishes they offer and you order at the cash register, then they give you a table top #, and bring your food out when it's ready/ we got 1. Char Sui & 2. Pork belly -- both solid choices. The food came out fast and piping hot. Th char sui had a flavorful broth and the roasted pork in it was delicious. The pork belly broth tasted a bit milder, and the pork in it was tender and had a good flavor. It's not over priced ($10-$12 average per bowl). We did not try any of the beverages, we had lovely Cleveland water (haha yuck).
We did go with our two small children, and thankfully they had 2 high chairs you could use, and low top tables with bar stools. 
We will be back the next time we crave ramen :)"}
{"text":"So its like 25 degrees and windy tonight in Cleveland and a piping hot bowl of Ramen really hits the spot! We got a vegan and a seafood ramen. The portions are generous and the soup delicious.  They also make their own red pepper sauce if you want to spice it up a little. The staff is friendly and Otani is open late; so you cannot go wrong enjoying some hot Ramen on a chilly Cleveland night. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Lunch time on a Friday afternoon was cray cray here at Otani Noodle, but I managed to breeze through the line and place my order.  The woman taking my order down was so nice and patient with me, I changed my order like three times but she smiled on and didn't make me feel stupid.  I decided on the #2 Pork Belly Ramen and now I am hooked.  The tonkatsu broth was amazing-the depth and flavor excited each and every tastebud.  The texture of the noodles was just right, not too slimy, mushy or chewy. The pork belly melted in my mouth, I barely had to chew.  it was cold outside and it was just what I needed for a FriYAY lunch.  I appreciate the bits of corn, and seaweed in each bite and the egg was a nice surprise.  The quickness of the staff added to the pleasant experience.  I swear it only took 5 minutes from the time that I ordered to receive my ramen. The cost was reasonable too, $10.95.  That is a steal compared to the $20 I spent at Momfuku in NYC for their famous ramen. Definitely adding this to my work lunch rotation and so should you.  The Cleveland winters are harsh and you are going to need this"}
{"text":"Had pork belly noodle there, you could see a layer of oil floating on top of the bowl.  Broth was really good but an hr after eating the three of us had diarrhea, we were also very thirsty, so they must have put MSG in the broth as well.  Not sure if I will go back there again.

Just a suggestion, the oil needs to be removed after the broth is made.  When I was in Japan, the tonkotsu ramen had very thick broth but oil was removed.  And if it's 100% tonkotsu broth, why adding more MSG?"}
{"text":"OTANI!!! I love you. (First off, know this review is based on delivery only, I have yet to visit the physical location). You guys, the ramen struggle in Cleveland is real. We crave it, but it's in such short supply. When it does come around, it's not always great. I treat new ramen places like a skeptical internet date... and I'm so happy to report that this place matches its pictures.

I ordered the Char-Siu with ramen noodles and tonkotsu soup and my friend ordered the Udon Bowl with udon noodles, soy sauce soup and added a boiled egg. I have several feelings. First, I had ordered the Char-Siu, but REALLY liked my friend's Udon Bowl. Soy sauce soup didn't sound appealing to me at first, but it had the most appealing flavor that mixed well with all the veggies. The udon noodles weren't too thick and the entire dish was a slurpy heaven. Don't get me wrong, the Char-Sui was also good, but it's definitely the safe choice on the menu. Its mild and has a great pork flavor.

I'm really excited about Otani Noodle, and I can't wait to check it out again! Be sure to add an egg to anything you order - it will automatically make it more awesome, I promise."}
{"text":"Happy to see Cleveland diversity especially with Japanese food which is scarce in downtown.

Food here was ok the pork belly was rich full of star aniseed very Chinese not Japanese.  But the meat was rock hard but still tasty.  Broth lacked a depth and richness i loved in best tonkatsu ramen.  Service was self serve with a smile.  Want to support mom and pop shops like this."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot - quick, moderately priced for lunch, and very filling. Enjoyed the ramen tried the pork belly bowl, the steamed buns, and split some skewers that were really good.

Overall a great dining experience - would do the ramen agin probably try one of their other bowls, but the pork belly is the best meat. Would nix the steamed buns - the dough wasn't good. And might get a side skewer of the pork belly to add to the bowl."}
{"text":"Happy to see a ramen restaurant replace the old Noodlecat location.  Been there twice - the first time was good, and the second was much better.  I got the tonkatsu both time, and based on the second, i'll definitely be back again.  Thanks for filling the ramen void downtown!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Cleveland.I am from California and I know good Ramen. The noodles are bouncy and the broth is complementary. Try the Tonkatsu ramen and get extra noodles ;)
I have also had their Unagi Don and it is super delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to Otani Noodle last night and it was okay. I didn't agree with the Yelp 5 start rating. The ramen noodles themselves were really good. But overall the ramen seemed very simple and something you might be able to throw together at home. I had the Char Sui and my boyfriend had the chicken cutlet.  The char sui was better than the chicken but I still miss the unique flavors of Noodle Cat."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with a co-worker and ordered a rice bowl with chicken, veggies, and curry sauce (#14). A few minutes later, our food was brought out to our table.

The bowl was hot and tasty. The chicken was breaded and had a savory flavor to it. The rice was plain white rice. The curry sauce was excellent and it provided a little heat. I added a little soy sauce, but I shouldn't have as it made the rice in the bottom very salty. With a bottle of water and dinining in, my lunch was over $11. I find that a bit pricey for a small serving of veggies, chicken, and rice with water. The flavors were good, but not amazing. I'll try ramen next time, but I'd rather go to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Go here eat all the things! You will not be disappointed. The ramen is a nice size portion with many different options including pork, pork belly, shrimp and seafood. They also have pork belly buns and different appetizer options. 

This is a comfortable laid back place. You walk up to the counter pick what you want sit down and they bring you your food. 

This is especially good in this cold Ohio weather."}
{"text":"We went here after going to another place for ramen which turned out to be terrible. We definitely should have just went here in the first place. I got the Tom yum bowl and my boyfriend got the udon noodle bowl. Tom yum is kinda of sour which I love but it's not for everyone. This soup was delicious and spicy and had great flavor. My boyfriends had an earthy soy taste and was delicious as well. He added pork to his and mine came with huge shrimp. The owner was working and we had a wonderful conversation with her about the food and her other locations. She and the other gentleman working were super friendly and made sure we had a great dining experience. We will definitely be going back and if you work downtown you should check this place out."}
{"text":"Otani is a great addition to downtown Cleveland. I prefer this location over the one in University Circle. Seating is more spacious and additional options such as bubble tea and steamed bao buns are available here.

I've had both the char-siu ramen and miso ramen during my two visits and enjoyed both so much that I sipped up all of the broth. The noodles were perfect, not too soft nor too chewy. My boyfriend really enjoyed the pork belly ramen. I do wish that portions were bigger though.

I recommend going here if you're short on time or taking your lunch break at work. Service is quick and you'll be in and out in less than thirty minutes. I will definitely be a regular here."}
