{"text":"Went to Sahib today after managing to avoid it for four years and I was not disappointed, they confirmed my suspicions, it was mediocre at best. It is a basic Indian joint, a bit too dark, probably to hide the food that you are eating.   I ordered the Tandoori meat platter just to sample a bit of everything and my wife the thali. Flavoring was okay but nothing to write home about. The vegetables they served were the frozen kind...yuck, but that is standard Indian restaurant fare so I can't complain. (My fault for giving in and trying this place). Food service was sporadic, waiter apologized several times for slow service from the kitchen., even said \"its not my fault\". My plate was served in several parts as they forgot a portion of it.  My wife's thali arrived 5-8 minutes after my plate. The nan bread arrived ten minutes after the meal. The last piece of chicken was brought to me after the nan. I guess Rajiv was not in the building.  Overall not for me ever again, but certainly to please the pallet of  the West Islanders judging by the reviews. Enjoy folks."}
{"text":"My gf and I had dinner at Sahib's since we both like Indian food.  We were not disappointed!  The food was excellent and the service top notch.  Beware that when they have a double chili icon next to the dish, it really means it's spicy.  I had that and loved it, but it was probably at the edge of my tolerance level :)"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible. Ordered plenty for 4 people and noticed after the driver had left we were missing items in our order. Called up and was told they were busy and would only offer credit for our next order. Guess what, they're won't be a next time."}
{"text":"so call for a take out tonight...pick it up in 30 minutes they say.... ...45 minutes still waiting... ....order comes out but its wrong, as they doubled on one dish....customer behind me they forgot 2 rices (PS. check your food before leaving) ....they correct my bill and I gladly pay by credit card so get get home.... ....as they bring my order, so i can leave, the front head chief lady, very rudely states that they made an error (ie. on their correction of their error) on my bill and I owe them $1.41 and WANTS my credit card back..... ....you kidding me, I say.....no she says, in all seriousness & rudeness..... .....okay I say....but last time you see me again..... .....all this time waiting, took time noticing how not clean & un-organized this establishment is, imo...."}
{"text":"Consistently Good food and very busy the night we visited."}
{"text":"Above average Indian restaurant for West Island. Lunch buffet has great selections. The service is not bad, just not consistent. Sometimes they are attentive, sometimes you feel ignored or they give you the annoyed look when you ask for service.   Also, watch out for the butter chicken. It's not tandoori chicken, but simply dry white chicken meat. The sauce taste good but it is quite tomatoey and not so buttery.   Good selection of dessert on the a la carte menu."}
{"text":"The ambience is very nice. Though it is a bit small and often crowded, the dining room is very clean and has a cozy feeling to it. The lunch buffet doesn't have that many options, but everything there tasted amazing and seemed to be of good quality. The price is also very cheap, only 18$ per person taxes and tips included. The only downside is that service isn't outstanding (the staff don't smile a lot nor do they make small talk with you) but it isn't bad either. I will definitely be back!  Weird thing to note, but their bathrooms are very clean. Sometimes you go to a restaurant that serves good food but has dirty bathrooms, which is a huge turn off, but that isn't the case at Sahib!"}
{"text":"Although not my favourite Indian restaurant Sahib is the place we often fall back on because they deliver in Pointe-Claire. The food is fairly good quality and the quantities are good. The \"feast\" packages are what we usually order and it will feed a good number of people."}
{"text":"I always look forward to indulging at Sahib from time to time. If I could give 3.5 stars I would. I can go on and on about how great the food  is! I have two slight knocks about the restaurant. First is the consistency of the food. What I mean by that is, I will order the same dish a few weeks apart and they will taste completely different. The second is the attention to detail or lack thereof the staff tends to take from time to time, especially when confirming the contents of a pick up order."}
{"text":"Not bad Indian for west island and reasonable. We usually get take out so this is not a commentary on the facilities. Dishes will vary from week to week, but still usually good. Discounts on take out and coupons for birthdays and anniversaries are a plus."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sahib for years. Last week I went with a group of friends from work and I found the butter chicken even more delicious than usual. The naan could be fluffier. And the vegetables less mushy and soft. But overall the flavours are delicious...except for one problem. The raita was gooey and slimy when picked up with the naan. I was eating it wondering if I was going to be sick today. And sure enough, todayI have been running to the toilet all morning! This happened once before about 2 years ago. The watermelon was fizzy and slimy. It is obvious that after the food has been out on the buffet table it is recycled for the next meal. And possibly the next or mixed with some that is fresher to extend it. This is how food becomes contaminated. Consider that buffet food has maybe over 100 people passing by it breathing, talking, coughing etc.. Buffet food, especially protein foods like meat and raita, should be thrown in the garbage after having sat out for 3 - 4 hours...yes, even if you feel it has been kept hot or very cold as required. The butter chicken was very, very hot which I never recall it having been in the past. But the raita was not cold at all. I am sure that same raita was served the next day and people will get sick from eating it. I am tempted to call the 'Inspection des aliments de Montr√©al'."}
{"text":"Loved the samosas, bread. Curry was OK. Fairly certain my bf and I both got food poisoning from there though"}
{"text":"The food here is actually pretty good, but the service is absolutely terrible when the owner Rajiv is not around. And forget about the delivery, the food is always cold and then they blame you if they can't find the place.  They really need to work on the service."}
{"text":"This is a good option for Indian food lover at lunch time for their all you can eat buffet. The buffet section is very small but the selection is decent and they refill quickly. The must-eat butter chicken and Naan bread are good, but the beef and lamb meat are a little on the tough and dry side. Nice place and proper service."}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in all Montreal.   Great choice, consistent excellent quality and moderate prices make this place a local favorite."}
{"text":"The food is A-OK. Nothing to rave about. The naan bread is good, and so are the starters. But the curries are just okay. The Biryani isn't great either. And the food lacks consistency. The dishes taste different every time you order. The food is pricey and not a good value at all. The decor is very good and the location as well. Being on the corner of St Jean and Hymus it attracts the office crowd with their lunch buffet.  The service is dull.  They have Indian beer on tap, which are good if you like strong beer. (which is good) But most of the clientele is non-Indian and probably that's why the taste is not very authentic."}
{"text":"On a Friday evening, I really wanted to try Indian food for delivery. There is not so much choice in west island and this one seems ok based on the reviews. Not surprisingly, the delivery arrived 1h10 minutes after my order, I was starving at the moment. However, the food was delicious. So my suggestion is that if you want to go with this restaurant, be prepared to receive the delivery late."}
{"text":"At the recommendation from our hotel driver, a coworker and I went to this restaurant today during their lunch buffet. We were told that the restaurant got \"The best Indian restaurant in Montreal award a couple of months ago\". It was fabulous and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, especially if you love Indian curry. Unfortunately, this restaurant's flaw is in the speed of the service. While our waiter was very nice and attentive,  it took over 2 hrs to get our food from the kitchen. If that can be fixed, I would completely recommend this resturant...but now no. Sad because the food is good."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was outstanding.  Guri,our waiter, was very pleasant and patient with us novice eaters.  The food is spicy by default so if you don't like spicy make sure to let them know and they will accommodate.  A great experience and I will definitely be back to try more items on their extensive menu - or maybe try Thai lunch buffet.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Sahib is located on the West Island, in a commercial building off of Hymus. The decor is a little old-school for my taste - lots of brown and well, brown. They have a full bar and the dining area is a decent size. They have a wide selection of dishes to choose from, and also offer a lunch buffet during the week.  Not having a huge appetite, I kept my order simple: Tandoori Prawn and basmati. The prawn were large and cooked to perfection. They were juicy with a hint of crunch and lots of flavor - quite delicious! That said, I did find them to be salty but overall, I really enjoyed these shrimp. I don't have much to say about the rice - it was good. My friend ordered the Chicken Tikka, which was served in large chunks, and was very tender.  To complete the meal, I ordered a cup of Chai - it was quite underwhelming. It was lacking in flavor and I couldn't really taste the spiciness of the Chai. Also, way too much milk.   The reason I gave this place a 3 is because the service sucked. First of all, our waiter had ADD - he couldn't keep our orders straight (we were only 3 people) and after taking our main order (and writing it down), he came back twice to confirm what we'd ordered. The same thing happened when we ordered dessert. I found him to be a little brisk and indifferent, and while he didn't check in on us often, when he did, he came off as pushy. As well, I'm pretty sure he forgot about us because after we finished our meal, it took about 25 minutes for him to come over to see if we wanted anything else (i.e. dessert, tea etc.). When we were done, and finally got our bill, there were mistakes on all three. We asked that these be corrected and the rude waiter (different from above) begrudgingly acquiesced. When he came back, our bills were still wrong - but according to him it didn't matter because 'it's only a few dollars so no big deal.' Really? So this establishment thinks it's acceptable to over-charge their clients because it's 'only a few dollars' that THEY pocket? When I told the guy what I thought of his attitude, he blew me off and walked away in a huff. Someone new came to our table - I assume it was the manager or owner - and took us to the bar to pay. While he was very courteous and willing to correct our bills (with no attitude - which was appreciated), I doubt that I'll be going back to Sahib. When I pay for a meal, I expect some degree of courtesy, not to mention an accurate bill. I can go to other Indian restaurants where the service is client-friendly."}
{"text":"Went on recommendation from a friend because it was near the hotel I was staying at and I love Indian food. Had the lunch buffet. It was small, not a lot of choices, the usual Indian regular stuff. But seriously delicious. I will warn you it's packed at lunch, but most are in and out quickly. Service isn't over the top but plates were quickly cleared and water always filled and well it's a buffet. The fact is most people are on lunch break and they are trying to accommodate that. The staff there is constantly moving. There were moments there was a line up at the buffet (like I said its small and in a small enclosed area) but two minutes later it's clear again. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday, had made reservations for lunch for 11:30 when they opened.  I recommend that you make reservations too - even if you are 2 people.  It is a buffet during lunch (not sure how it is in the evenings or weekend).  This is an ok Indian restaurant for Montreal, but a good Indian resto for the West Island.  There are only a few food options served during the buffet, but don't worry, they are the common ones i.e. nan, butter chicken, samosas, beef curry...  At Indian buffets, I typically go for the butter chicken, but, I didn't like the taste of it here ... it really tasted like it was just tomato sauce.  My lunch companion said it didn't taste tomato sauce-like at all and that it was actually his fave butter chicken.  I think maybe it's because I've only known the sauce to be creamy-like.  The samosas was kinda bland.  I tried it with the tamarind sauce, but the sauce seemed, and tasted water down....again, maybe it's because I am used to something thicker.  The service was good; my water was always re-filled, and the plates were always cleared.  I'd come back if my companion needed a Sahib fix.  By the way, when we were leaving at 12, the line up to the buffet was long.... this may be because the buffet area is small."}
{"text":"Sahib is my go to Indian in the West Island. The food is always good and I feel it's very consistent in terms of spices. Not too hot, not too mild, just enough. Love the chaana masala and the lamb vindaloo, delicious. It's been open for a while and if you go eat there at night you'll see it's a popular spot. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is the place for an all-you-can-eat Indian buffet!  Mid-week lunch - mostly full - but not over the top. good dining atmosphere. good selection on everything. I ate too much :) but still had to get desserts! Would come again!"}
{"text":"I have only good things to say about Sahib's all you can eat lunchtime or Sunday night buffet. The choices of meats are all saucy (except for the Tandoori chicken, of course not saucy), hot and delicious, their nan  bread is (dangerously) good, their fried foods are also (dangerously) good.  The restaurant itself is a classy looking English pub style which is quite unusual (for me at least).  I like to sit at the bar and listen to the staff argue and stress out then become very friendly when customers come to pay. Always a flow of people coming for take out. I don't remember if they play Indian music (if not, they should!) . There is even TV screens where you can watch a cricket game or a polo match!  I've never tried their \"√Ä la carte\" menu but it's probably even better than their buffet (it always is).  Great place to bring the gang, bang for the buck is good. I expected the place to be much smaller from the way it looks outside. The only negative thing is the washrooms are in the basement at the end of a Harvey Weinsteinish creepy and cold corridor. Otherwise good place."}
{"text":"I used to think they were a decent Indian option in the west island. The food has been very inconsistent: there are much better options such as chapouti Bombay on sources.  The management doesn't care if a dish is badly prepared. They've lost touch with their clientele"}
{"text":"Good food. Beef curry just like moms.  Delivery takes forever. Orders often a little messed up."}
{"text":"Awesome Lunch Buffet!! All you can Indian food for 14$ they have nice selection of dishes. Naan bread, rice, butter chicken, meat, vegetables, samosas,. Just delicious. Nice and friendly and service is good. Great ambiance with music and decor. Must go for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"Food and services very good and The ambiance was good and positive. For sure I will recommend it for all my friends"}
{"text":"Du lundi au vendredi le restaurant offre un buffet qui vaut le d√©tour.  Soupe aux lentilles, cari d'agneau, poulet au beurre, bar √† salade dessert etc. Le prix est tr√®s raisonnable.  Tout est en place pour bien manger et sortir rapidement et retourner au bureau. Le stationnement est facile."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better indian restaurants  in the west island. Was here for the weekend lunch buffet. A fairly large selection of dishes  was on offer. My favourite was probably the lamb and the bhindi. The chicken pakoras were pretty disappointing as were the samosas. The was pretty hard and did not seem that fresh. Overall a pretty solid buffet for under 20$ with tax and tip. The service was great."}
{"text":"Nice place! The food was exactly what I expected!"}
{"text":"I have ate the lunch buffet at this place several times. Qutstanding Indian food for what you would expect on a buffet.  Definetly better value than the burger type joint with overproced beer across the street. I think it was about 13 bucks for lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Fantastic ambience. Fantastic food. An absolute pleasure dining in! It was busy for a Monday too.   At first you walk in and are unsure what to expect. The small little restaurant bar opens up to a comfortable sized area to dine. The smells captivate your nose and set your taste buds up for an equally wonderful experience.   Thank you for making the night!  5/5 for me!"}
{"text":"I came for dinner.  No buffet but the food was fantastic.  (My company picked up the bill because I was on business, but the prices seemed reasonable for the quality.)"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service is excellent. Probably the best Indian restaurant in the west island. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great service, they delivered to my hotel when no one else would. The delivery man was very friendly and pleasant as was the lady from whom I ordered on the phone. That's where the praise stops. I ordered chicken tikka masala and it was honestly the worst I've ever had. I'm no expert but I've probably eaten the dish at least twenty times at different restaurants and this was disgusting. The chicken was a very strange shape and texture. The sauce had gigantic chunks of bell peppers and onions and the sauce was soupy and flavourless. Not the creamy and smooth dish I'm used to. The garlic naan was yummy, which is lucky cuz I threw the rest out. Very displeased."}
{"text":"Bland. Very very bland. And greasy.  Went for the lunch buffet, and arrived just as they were opening, so the food was \"just put out\". But some of the sauces already had that top layer of \"fat?\", so must have been sitting there long. My mom called ahead to ask if everything was fresh, and they said yes, absolutely. Something is suspicious here.  They had a nice variation of food, and I tried almost everything. It was pretty much all tasteless, except for the separate 6 sauce area that's supose to be an add on to anything. Those were the only things with flavor, but what's the point in relying on only that for taste? The dishes themselves are supose to be the main event. This was like cafeteria quality.  The naan bread was good, as well as the thin crispy bread. At least they have that going for them.  All the meat dishes were very dry and had a tough texture, even the \"lamb\". But the butter chicken was very tender, just the sauce was super bland, unfortunately.  They had a big thing of white bazmatti rice, with pieces of carmelized onion, as a base for the entres, but the rice was very greasy, and tasteless as well, and the saucy entree dishes didn't give it any taste either.   The rice pudding had a very odd texture to it. The fruit cocktail was obviously canned, and not good. The fried sweet balls of dough were oversaturated with some sort of greasy like syrop pool, and gave an awkward texture.  I've had plenty of different home cooked indian dishes before, which is why I love indian food. As a restaurant, they should be better than home cooking, or else what's the point in coming?  This is a good place for old people to eat, since flavor can overwhelm the pallet, so bland helps. Also good for drunk people, since grease helps alchohol move along. They had a cool looking bar.  After eating, we sat for a good 30 min, waiting for a waiter to make eye contact with us, which oddly they kept avoiding, might be because the place was getting more people. They were really polite and nice otherwise. When I finally caught one's attention, they explained that we had to go to the front desk at the bar to pay. ok... and when i personally handed the waiter a 5$ bill as tip, he didn't keep it, he put it in the cash register. Maybe it was because the owner was behind me and they're not allowed to keep tips? Very strange.  When my mom called earlier, to also ask about the pricing and if anything extra needed to be paid (I dunno why), they said no tip is required since it's a buffet, but if we wanted to tip that's ok. I guess I won't be tipping next time since it seem like the waiters don't get to keep the tips anyway... The food sucked, the restaurant doesn't deserve my tip money, that was supose to go to the waiter for tending my table.   Not sure if I'll come back. I asked a friend who ordered from their take out menu, and they said eventhough it was different dishes from their buffet selection, the quality was the same. So I guess this is not authentic indian  cuisine, like they point out on their adv. It's more like white-man dimmed down versions of their national dishes. So sad. What a waste of calories :("}
{"text":"The food at Sahib is wonderful. An extensive menu of items to choose from and they prepare many favorites. I prefer vindaloo and the chicken and lamb vindaloo are always tasty and very spicy. Prices are very reasonable and the portion size makes 2 meals for me. The delivery drivers are always friendly and confirm my order with me as I pay. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for take-out when i don't feel like cooking. The portions are huge!!! I always have leftovers. I usually get the butter chicker with nan bread. I think just the nan bread is already worth the trip. The sauce for the butter chicken is not very thick, which goes great on rice too."}
{"text":"We place orders for delivery from this restaurant all the time. Food is always amazing. Love the combos"}
{"text":"I arrived with at 6:59 ready to order food for take-out and have a drink while I waited. I asked if I just made the happy hour drink special. By the time he checked his computer, it was 7:00 so the owner refused. Pissed off I ordered a round for my gf and I. The beer was piss flat. When the food finally arrived I rushed out of there.  It's only when I got home that I realized they didn't take 10% off the bill since it was a pick up. It's weird, I've never heard of a cheap Indian... The meal was mediocre at best. The naan tasted like it was reheated from the night before and the lamb curry was probably stewing since that morning since it was practically mush. It was my gf's first time trying Indian and I'm upset we wasted her first impression on Sahib. She promised me another chance so I'm taking her to Tandoori Bellevue, where I know the staff are more professional and the food is better."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Its a very calm spot. The decor has a more pub style with subtle hints of Indian decor. There's a soothing music in the background that isn't overwhelming at all. Just beware of the bathroom, it's a little bit creepy.  FOOD: Always delicious. Every time I come here, everything is always packed with flavor and never disappoints. Their basmati rice has bits of onions in it that give it that subtle kick of flavor and their naan is soft and delicious. All of their vegetarian plates are amazing and saucy (perfect for the rice) and their meats are tender. And of course, their butter chicken is to die for! I highly recommend this place, honestly my favorite place!  PRICE: I usually go for the all-you-can-eat at lunch time so it's very affordable. Especially for a buffet! It's my go-to spot for Indian food.  SERVICE: Service is okay."}
{"text":"Came here with a work group. Place was clean and food was pretty tasty. Ordered a spicy chicken dish but it wasn't all that spicy. Ambiance was good but service was a bit slow. Despite this the naan was great and food was good enough that I will return."}
{"text":"Je lunche l√† souvent car c'est vrai que la nourriture y est assez bien et c'est plut√¥t convivial comme endroit, vite fait bien fait. Par contre depuis 3 ans que j'y vais je crois que les s√©lections du buffet n'ont pas vari√© d'un iota. Je commence √† m'en lasser."}
{"text":"Sahib is a solid Indian restaurant, with reasonable prices and a really nice atmosphere to dine in all in the heart of the otherwise limited dining of the west island.  The food is consistently good, with a wide range of choices. The buffet is more limited, but the sit down menu has never let me down. The staff are friendly. And they have Cobra beer on tap.  This is a frequent stop on trips to pte Claire."}
