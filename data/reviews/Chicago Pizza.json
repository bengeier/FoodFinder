{"text":"Delicious pizza! I'm not a fan of the wings, the burger, the Poutine it's shredded cheese, the subs are good but not delivered ... I've been calling them for the past 5 years when I have a home craving of pizza. And I ask for it to be cooked well done. I've made many people try this pizza and everyone has loved it. And I alway receive it in less than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and good food. The submarines are very good and so are the hamburgers. Prices are great!"}
{"text":"Poor - Delivery promised in 30 minutes, took more than one hour. Just shrugged it off when I called to inquire.   Asked for Smokin' Hot with no green peppers. Instead of just leaving green peppers off they also unilaterally left off the green olives, the black olives and the bacon. Could have had a much less expensive one with same omissions. Sauce was almost nonexistent - whole pie tasted no better than a frozen supermarket variety!  They've certainly \"fooled me once\", but never again!  Stay away."}
{"text":"Cheap! Little toppings, tasteless and these people only take cash which makes it a hassle when you are at home with no cash and decide you want to order in"}
