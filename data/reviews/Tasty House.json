The store front lady is the cutest little thing and she is always extremely happy. I find it quite welcoming to order from here. Even if I stand there for a little, trying to decide what to order, she won't get impatient and will even suggest some things to help choose.

I need to come back here ASAP and try all the different flavours!"}

My go-to drinks are the mango coconut milk with sago and the original milk tea.

{"text":"This place's been open for 15+years. I  have been a customer of them since I was younger. I read most comments are great but hate to see people say the bubble teas are powdered. Unless it's their special Hk style bubble tea or otherwise specified, ALL BUBBLE TEAS by definition are flavoured (powder or syrup) UNLESS It's a fresh fruit juice with bubbles. All fresh and flavoured are available at the store. That's why fresh juices with bubbles are normally more expensive than the normal bubble teas. And if you see a store that charge you cheap for a \"fresh fruit\" bubble tea you have to think what are they really giving you at that price. This is the only place I know that are still using real teas in their bubble teas. A lot of the other places are using \"fake teas\" where you won't even see them ever boiling tea."}
{"text":"Formerly a huge fan, as this is one of the original bubble tea shops in Markham. I've been coming here for almost two decades and they have decent drinks.

However, my last visit I found out that they would not honour my various reward stamp cards. Bare in mind I wasn't trying to redeem anything, but only to get them together on one card. I was told the cards would have to be separate and as much as I understand their policy, I've literally never, not once, redeemed a free drink in over 17 years of being their customer.

I informed them I had been going since they first opened, but apparently that didn't matter, or simply they didn't care.

As a long time customer who's always supported their business and recommended them to my friends, this felt like a slap to the face to loyalty to their store after all these years.

What's a drink or two worth compared to regular customers? 

Do NOT go here, go to Chatime, Green Grotto, Coco, Real Fruit, Tutti Frutti, any other shop but here cause customers mean nothing to them."}
{"text":"Great food! My fiancé and I definitely under estimated how cooking everything was. I order noodle ribs stone pot, plain noodle roll, fresh shrimp noodle roll, and pork blood congee. After the congee and two rolls we were stuffed! The noodles are all freshly made, very chewy and bouncy. The ribs were so tender the meat fell off the bones. The congee was so flavorful as well! The success they use for all dishes were perfect!

I was thirsty after eating but I think it was on the stone pot sauce cause the congee and the noodles I was fine.
Overall I enjoyed the food ND would definitely. come back cause I heard the rice stone pot is delish!"}
{"text":"$2.50 bubble teas, need I say more? The quality of the teas has been maintained over the years and their tapioca is always fresh. I would say though, you are paying $2.50 so do not expect extremely high quality drinks. Their original milk tea is dtromg with a hint of milky flavour but their yakult isnt the greatest."}
{"text":"I am typically a fan of Tasty House's bubble tea, but not happy with today's order. I got the \"fresh watermelon juice\", which was falsely advertised and definitely not as claimed. I was okay with the fact that they added sugar, but the artificial watermelon powder that they also put in the drink made the entire thing taste like a crappy jolly rancher. The drink was far from being refreshing, authentic, and fresh.

That being said, my parents got a salted lime soda, and my sister ordered a grapefruit lime Japanese soda. Both drinks were substantially better.

I will likely continue to frequent this shop, but definitely not for the watermelon juice!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in over a year, and couldn't help but order the Japanese burnt coffee! I guess my aversion / sensitivity to sweetness had increased, as has my tolerance to strong coffee, as I found the Japanese burnt coffee to be on the sweet side with not much coffee flavour. It definitely tasted like an ice capp - a delicious but definitely overpriced ice capp. Interestingly, my sister found the drink to be extremely strong in coffee flavour (therefore complained it was too bitter), although she too could see the resemblance to an ice capp. My parents likewise enjoyed the drink, and praised the strong coffee flavour. Next time I come, will try the matcha red bean slush."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea at First Markham Place!!!! This was my go to spot for bubble tea whenever I went to the movie theatre (when it used to be at FMP). Their bubble tea is so cheap and the quality is not bad at all. A regular costs $2.50 and they offer stamp cards! I have gone through multiple rows. A row counts as 9 drinks and you get the 10th free! They offer various flavours, but I always swear by the original black milk tea with tapioca."}
{"text":"We came here hoping to try some scorched rice dishes (clay pot rice).  Tasty House came up under a Yelp search for \"clay pot rice\". A Yelper had commented about it being the best place for scorched rice in Scarborough.  I inquired about clay pot rice from one of the staff on hand and she had no clue what I meant, then again I think there was a language barrier issue as well (don't think her English spoken skills were that strong).  If clay pot rice is on the menu it is not clearly shown.

There is free WiFi available, along with a TV (but only playing Chinese content).

Since it was super busy, service was on the slower side, there was apparently only 2 service staff working the dining area at the time of our visit.

This establishment is CASH ONLY, NO Plastic accepted.  I would rate this place as $   (dishes from $1.00 - $9.99).

They have good steam rice rolls, we ordered the bbq pork (char siu) rice rolls, though the char siu was a bit more on the fatty side, we would definitely go back for that.  We also ordered Home Style Noodles along with Shrimp and Egg sauce w/rice to go with our char siu rice rolls.  The home style noodles I'd rate at about 3.5, wasn't mixed properly imo, the sauce they used didn't coat all the noodles.  As for the Shrimp & Egg sauce they mixed in a large handful of frozen mixed veggies, first time I've seen mixed veggies in this dish.  I'd rate the Shrimp and Egg sauce w/rice dish at about 3.0.  I found the shrimps they used to be much smaller along with not as juicy.

Be careful what time of day you visit though, we visited between 11:00am and Noon on a Friday and they were super packed.  Guess most customers were there for the breakfast special (large bowl of congee and free steam rice rolls for $4.99+HST from 8am - 11am).  Didn't make it in time for the breakfast special..hehe..maybe on another visit.  

We thought they served us hot tea when we sat at our table, but to our surprise it was only hot water.

Since my wife and I try to search usually budget restos we shall add this to our list.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best bubble tea at First Markham Place. The ones next to it are not so good... even though the prices are the same.  The tapioca has the perfect chewiness and sweetness. Not too sweet or chewy, nor too flavourless and mushy. It's just right! And I love how they are happy to customize your order- you can ask for less sugar, no sugar etc without any fuss or eye-rolls.
I only wish they had more options for fresh fruit juice and flavours in general.
The price is reasonable- much cheaper than Bubble Tease at Markville, and better tasting too!
They also make nice crepes.... mmmmm."}
{"text":"If you want delicious bubble tea, look no further. This might be a food court stall, but other bubble tea shops have got nothing on it. I have been a loyal customer for 10 years and the quality of the drinks and customer service will keep me coming back (even if it means fighting for a parking spot at First Markham Place). 

The drink flavour selection is massive, try some of the most popular selections: taro milk tea, almond milk tea, green apple green tea and my fiance's personal favourite grapefruit milk tea. This place is so popular, the turnover is quick and the tapioca is soft and fresh. Don't settle for a place that gives you hard tapioca. 

Today, when I ordered the lychee milk tea - they made it with ice, I wanted it blended. No problem, they took it back and made me a new one. The service is exceptional, the owners are great (have not changed the whole time I've gone). 

This is a must try, trust me!!  

Tasty House - you will forever be my bubble tea benchmark."}
{"text":"This place specializes in drinks and crepes.

Looking for drinks? There's two lists full of different kinds of drinks, from juices to milk tea.
Looking for food? There's two lists full of crepes; the sweet kind or the savory kind.

Milk tea goes for $2.50 for a regular. Smaller and larger cups are available, but the price is around there.

Crepes are also not too bad, around $4.50 for sweet crepes and $5 for meat crepes.

I had the regular milk tea with tapioca (topping's free) and a crepe with corn beef, eggs and mushrooms.

Crepe was pretty good. Generous amount of filling, and the size of the crepe is comparable to the ones downtown (though of course since you're paying a third of the price there's not AS much filling)

For the milk tea, I thought it was alright. Friend said it was good and it tasted just like HK-style milk tea. Given this context, I don't really have anything to compare with since I've never had milk tea in HK."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh juice!! 

Have never really ate around in Market Village much but Tasty House caught my eye because of the various drinks sold, typical Chinese sandwich and coffee combo and they sell ice cream crepes too! 

Ranging from bubble tea, hot coffee, tea, slush, fresh juice and tea leaves are being sold here as well.

I went for the Watermelon Juice because god knows this weather has been burning haaaawt and I needed something to cool me down. Always had a love for watermelon juices because of how refreshing and naturally sweet it is.

The lady spoke perfect English and Cantonese to the customer before me. It costs $5.10 for a large which is slightly steep in my opinion. I was also hoping that it wasn't powdered watermelon flavour because I saw some jars with powder in it - probably for the bubble teas. 

To my delighted surprise, she actually pulled out a watermelon and cut it infront of me and made my drink!! I was expecting more like a jug of fresh watermelon juice from the fridge or something but I was really happy!! The juice tastes absolutely fresh and knowing it is fresh, I don't mind paying $5.10 for it.

I think this is also the only bubble tea store in Market Village and I've seen a couple of people buying bubble tea from Tasty House as well.

Will be back whenever I need a juice fix!!!! :D"}
{"text":"Good place to go if all you want is cheung fun and congee. Most popular special is a plate of cheung fun plus a huge bowl of congee for $4.99 before 11am. I do like the texture of this style of scrunched up cheung fun; bit chewy. There's a fair amount of filling/ingredients in both cheung fun and congee. The congee is tasty and the bowl is very big for one person. For small eaters, you may want to share a combo and add a small sandwich or something separately. Fill up quickly early weekend mornings. Decor is pretty drab though and they do not make any fried dough sticks (yau tiew) that you normally could get with congee elsewhere. Service is decent. Food is always freshly made to your order and arrive at your table piping hot within a reasonable period of time. Definitely a good go to place if you mainly want simple tasty congee and cheung fun at a good value."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.

We got congee and this beef noodle thing along with rice noodles as well.

This place is owned by legitimate villagers back from where my parents are from in the south part of China. They make it just like back home and it feels great to hear the accent flowing around the restaurant. This is where people from that small place come to eat, and popularity is due to it being so similar to what is back home. 

Come here and enjoy the local village cuisine."}
{"text":"Yummy congee and rice rolls. Breakfast special is only 4.99 for the congee + rice rolls. After 11 am it is 3.99 for congee and 2.99 for rice rolls. Highly recommend. Wait times are long..At least 15 mins and longer if they are busy..Worth the wait"}
{"text":"We were an accidental patron.  The dim-sum place 3 doors down was renovating, and we needed some grub.  So we sheepishly slid into this unassuming place.  It looks clean and elementary, and a sneak peak at the somewhat messy kitchen does not pleasantly impress one, but the two noodle dishes we ordered were very decent, while the yu-choi in oyster sauce tasted fresh.  Their 'cannelloni\" with shrimp is different from the usual, as these are not cannelloni at all, since the shrimps sit on TOP.  They have great prices, although I was momentarily embarrassed when I went to pay - this is the place where I found out they (and other businesses) no longer take pennies.  The penny is an obsolete Canadian currency unit, apparently!

p.s. my friend Jennifer K. wrote a great review, I only just found out (as she usually does), but just to be clear, what she said about the noodle dishes being $5 and free soy milk drink apply ONLY to the breakfast specials.  Also, they have free wifi, but don't take credit cards.  Pretty good trade."}
{"text":"This place has been here FOREVER!  Almost before time itself, at least before Pacific Mall existed.  My parents were the ones that would come here for HK Milk Tea or Yuan Yang (Coffee/Tea Mixture).

Over time, I began to appreciate the drinks and when I was younger I would get Bubble Milk Tea there but now I have a more sophisticated(?) palate I really tend to enjoy a cup of their Hot HK Milk Tea or Yuan Yang.  Those 2 drinks are part of the HK culture and has years of history.

If you have time, you can just shoot the breeze chatting with the lady/owner behind the counters.  They're not your typical part-time school children you'll see at Pacific Mall making your drink.  

It's not meant to be an INSULT of other's skill in making drinks, it simply means that the person making your drink has made MORE drinks than the others have had dinners.  Chinese proverb \"Ate more salt than you've had rice\"."}
{"text":"This place definitely used to be a high school favourite of mine back in the day. As in, I'd get on the 40 yrt bus, transfer onto the purple viva and come straight here with my 'friends' from high school to get some $2.50 bubble tea almost every week!

The owner is super nice and that has never changed. The best part is.. even through the economy and everything, the prices always remain the same. $2.50 for a bubble tea with any topping (tapioca, lychee jelly, mango jelly etc) and that's tax included. The other drinks are all relatively cheap, I think the most expensive is $3-4. My favourite drink to get here is the japanese burnt coffee. It tastes like iced coffee with a nice kick and its definitely difficult to find in the GTA (If you know where else I can get this, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TELL ME)

I've never tried the crepes or any of the food, but I heard they're pretty good for the price. The only thing I don't like is the 'fresh' fruit juice- it tastes like they really wanted to conserve on the fruits and only used one piece while watering it down with water and cream. Not good! 

They also use this little stamp card thing and you get a free drink after a certain amount. Honestly.. I've never been able to complete one because forgetful me always manages to lose it!"}
{"text":"We went to the Tasty House, 18 March 2018 and the service was fine, the establishment was clean and the food came at a reasonable time.  My husband had the Rice Noodle Roll with shrimp and I had the Rice Noodle Roll with shredded mushrooms and chicken.   However the mushrooms were sliced and I didn't see or taste any shredded chicken. Also it tasted quite bland."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and the quality is always amazing! For $2.50 you can get a regular size bubble tea with tapioca included. Or upgrade to a large for $3.50! 

Staff is also great. I've known the women working there for years and she's super friendly! 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"The spicy seafood noodle soup at Korean Food Express sent me searching for a bubble tea joint to cool my taste buds. Thank you yelp for helping me decide out of all the bubble tea places in this mall to try Tasty House.

You can't beat the $2.50 price. I ordered an Almond Milk Tea with Tapioca pearls but I also wanted to order a mango shake which they didn't have on the menu. After a discussion with the wonderful and helpful cashier, she suggested that I order a fresh mango juice and add ice cream (50 cents extra) and she will blend it into a shake SOLD! I walked away with two drinks for $6.45!

The mango shake was good with a hint of tartness. The Almond Milk Tea was better than any I've had here in Toronto, I would give it 5/5 by itself. I would definitely recommend Tasty House for bubble tea and fresh fruit drinks. I'll have to come back to try out their food.

They're located in the food court to the right of the stage."}
{"text":"Best crepes, bubble tea and hot milk tea! The owners are very nice and the crepes are always made perfectly - the crepe itself is thin as paper and they give you plenty of fruit and ice cream for what you pay! 
This place has really been consistently great for the past 10 years and they always have the best prices!"}
{"text":"Best place to buy bubble tea from! Plus, the owner is super friendly."}
{"text":"This place is in the foodcourt of FMP. Compared to the other bubble tea places next door. This place does the bubble tea right. At least I think so.

Whenever I come to FMP, I always try to grab a drink from here. I like the way that they are well-mannered, price is good and they listen to what you want and ask. So places just do their own thing with YOUR DRINK. I always ask them for 1/4 sugar syrup in my drinks and they do it right. I can't take such sweet stuff makes me sick in general.

The drink comes out almost perfect every time I come here. They have alot of flavours like most other places, some tea sets and snacks are availible as well. I haven't tried those before but no harm in trying them.

The crepes they make are delish. No matter sweet or salty type. I don't collect the stamp card whenever the lady ask me. So she gives me a discount when I told her I don't collect it. 

I am fan! Yayyy!! =D"}
{"text":"I don't normally give 1 star but the service was horrible. I called in advance for takeout. It was for three of the \"rice rolls\". I went in to pick up 20mins after my call, and they said they don't have my order. As in, they couldn't find the slip. So my order was not there or in the process of making. They didn't apologize, the counter lady suggested that she will take the order at that moment and she said it should be about 10minutes. I was on the way going somewhere so I didn't want to wait but since it's just 10minutes, I agreed and paid. 

20minutes later, still not ready but I see many rice rolls coming out from the kitchen to serve the guests eating in. I asked the counter lady if mine is ready yet because I clearly see them coming out of kitchen. She says those guests ordered before me. BUT she forgot that I called in wayyyy advance but it was their fault they lost the ordering ticket. I was upset because I have been waiting way too long. 

The counter lady also said it's slow because they only have one steamer and many order steamed rice rolls in the morning. Well if this is true, why did she make that promise of saying it should only take 10minutes ? She only said that so that I buy and pay right away. 

I was very dissatisfied with the service . Never coming back. It was my first time, their rice rolls are just like any other rice rolls I had in the area."}
{"text":"This is my alternative to Sam's Congee when I am not in the mood for long lineups. This place can get quite busy but since it's pretty big space the wait is usually not too lengthy.

The food is okay I would say. The congee tastes a bit on the bland side but the portions are on the larger side and they don't skimp on the ingredients either. The star of their food is probably their soy based \"cheun fun\" - kinda like various meats and vegetables wrapped in a giant soy pasta sheet and steamed. They are okay too, it won't be keeping you up at night craving for this stuff.
Perhaps, the best part about this place is their breakfast specials. For $5 you get a giant bowl of congee and a inappropriately large plate of cheun fun.
I am extremely disappointed that this place does not serve \"yau tiu\" - fried dough or any other of it's cousin sidekicks to go with my congee. This mystery mystifies me every time I visit!"}
{"text":"This is an updated review since I stopped by today.

They finally updated their banner to indicate that all bubble tea is $2.75.  They covered up the \"+tax\" part but be warned -- they will apply tax to your drink.  It used to be no tax and you could get a bubble tea for $2.50 but those days are long gone... some flavours are currently $2.75, some are more at $3.25.

I ordered one Mint Chocolate bubble tea ($3.25) and one small hot lemon tea ($2.10).  The lemon tea I got for free from my stamp card and the bubble tea was charged 5% tax ($3.41 total).

Here's where the experience went kind of downhill...

I had my green/white Tasty House stamp card for the FMP location and the lady who took my drink order quickly looked at it, and told me that she was going to give me their newer one and that I could get the lemon tea for free since I filled up that column.  Fine.

What wasn't fine was that she flipped the back of the old card which had two stamps for drinks that used to cost $3.50.  She rudely asked me what they were for and, before I could answer, immediately said \"ok I guess they're just juice drinks\".  She then wrote down $3.75 to reflect the new prices and stamped the card 3 times. (One additional stamp for my $3.25 drink as part of the transfer to the new card.  I guess she was too lazy to write down \"$3.25\" on a new column???  I don't even buy juice drinks here??? wtf)

I had my old Market Village Tasty House stamp card with me as well and asked about it (note: same owner for both locations, with the exception that MV location always had drinks priced 25-50 cents more) .  The lady made such a huge fuss about why I was carrying it when \"it's so old and worthless\" (Also see Jason L.'s Yelp review about old loyalty cards not being accepted.)  I last visited this FMP location at the beginning of April 2018 and spoke with the owner (young Chinese guy, mid/late-30s) and he told me I could keep using it...

Instead, today this woman at the counter takes my card, waves it around to the employees working in the back and loudly asks them whether they still take it... Apparently they don't anymore.  Ok, that's fine.  My card was half full on one side and I asked the lady to give it back. \"Why? It's garbage\" and she tries to throw it out and I loudly asked for it back again before she gave it back.

It's one thing to say \"yeah, it's worth nothing\" to my face but it's another thing to just rudely take the card and try to rip it up and toss it without asking me... I got my drinks and my old and new stamp cards and just left after that.

I was hoping that my loyalty would mean something but I guess not.  Back before the Market Village location closed, the owner's mom (Chinese lady in her mid/late-50s) would actually work at the FMP location and I'd actually be able to chat with her while I waited for my drinks.   I guess now that there's only location, the owner's mom isn't working there again -- I would've asked her about transferring loyalty stamps if she was there; even if she said no, I'd be fine with it since she was always polite.

Now her son has hired/retained rude af staff -- I'm told this woman worked at the Market Village location since my mom was sitting at a table nearby and witnessed my encounter unfold.  Apparently my mom's encounters with her at Market Village were just as rude then as it is now. This lady working the counter today has short hair, looks like she's in her late 40s/early 50's, and/or could be a family member helping out.  Either way, I've never had someone working at Tasty House be so rude to me.  Amazing. /sarcasm

I don't think I'm coming back here again. Based on this recent interaction, I would rather go to the Presotea across from them instead or the Chatime near Birchmount/Enterprise."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get crepes that taste good and are relatively inexpensive.  I really like the way they do it, I mean nothing fancy like richtree marche or crepe it up but this place is a ok.

The price is reasonable too.  You can get a strawberry with ice cream filled crepe for under $5.  

First markham place is one of the most reasonable places to get bubble tea.

One thing I do want to note is that their frequent buyer card may be good but for people who had cards before they changed their prices (used to be $2.99) and it's been $2.50 for the longest time to compete with other places in the mall, they refuse to let you combine the cards.  IE, I had accumulated 4 stamps when bubble teas were $2.99 but since the price dropped those 4 stamps are no good unless I were to buy extra extra tapioca, unlikely.

To the person that said they paid for a drink and didn't go pick it up.  You are lucky, I remember years ago when I paid for drinks and the young girl was there (daughter of someone), she didn't give me back my $5 change and I had to kick up a fuss.  They claimed to have counted the register the following day and there was no discrepency (as if they would admit it).  I had to make a fuss to get a comp drink, overall watch your change when they give it to you and even then don't make a move after you get change in case they short change you.  If you move slightly they will claim to not be responsible."}
{"text":"The shop had signs advertising bubble tea for $2.50 and decided to give it a try. I got the lychee bubble tea and I was given the choice of tapioca or jelly as topping. I got the tapioca. $2.50 tax included. The drink was ok. Tasted like jasmine tea with lychee flavoring. The tapioca was soft and chewy."}
{"text":"Came here quite a few times for bubble tea. They have probably close to 40-50 options, so there is something for everyone. It is in the food court, and the price is definitely reasonable. From what I remember, it is around 3-4 for a large bubble tea. If you have ever tried to make bubble tea from scratch, this is a bargain, because it takes quite a bit of work. If you are looking for a quick bubble tea fix. this is your place to go."}
{"text":"I went to first markham place for bubble tea and saw multiple places sell the same thing. What made me buy from this place was the lineup And the number of people waiting for their drinks. I also noticed that they were cheaper compared to other stalls but quality is pretty much the same. 

Don't forget to ask for a loyalty card so they can stamp each purchase. I believe you get a free drink after purchasing 10

{"text":"I was on the hunt for hot & sour soup to sooth a man-cold; I saw this place from the street and decided I'd give it a try. There were only 2 tables occupied and I was greeted promptly but the server had to go back and ask somebody in the kitchen about the soup - I'm not sure if she was asking if they had any left or if they had it at all. Some guy from the back peeked out to see who was inquiring and quickly withdrew with a startled look on his face after checking me out. The server told me yes they indeed had it and that it would cost $5.60 (a little steep) and that they only took cash. I went to the Scotia Bank a few doors down (not my bank) and it wouldn't give me any money so I rustled up some change from the car (luckily I had that much, I normally don't) then I went back to place my order and proceeded to wait almost 20 minutes for 1 soup!! The place is very dated and needs repairs but there was a steady stream of people coming in, some who appeared to know the wait staff so they must be regulars.Since I don't live in the area I don't think I'll be back again with other better options around."}
{"text":"This is the BEST bubble tea place!  You just have to sit in the food court and watch all 7 bubble tea places...and you'll see this one does more business than all the others combined.

I believe it's for 2 reasons:
1)  They make it right!  the tapioca is boiled perfectly, not mushy, but not raw.  the flavouring is also good...not too sweet, but still very tasty.
2)  Friendly service - the owners are just nice people.  They own the business, they smile, and they genuinely like to make and serve bubble tea.  Other places are manned by students, or low-paying employees that don't even bother smiling when you order.  This is the exact opposite.

so bottomline is....all the people that line up for this place while there's other stores without a line, and maybe even a tad cheaper, means a lot.  it means the people have chosen, and it's \"Tasty\" that's #1.

Note...I've been going there since they opened about 11-12 years ago, and I've tried all the other ones in the same food court.  Tasty has never disappointed.  

One last story....one time I ordered a drink, went to get take-out food, and forgot to pick-up my drink.  The next week I went there, the owner recognized me and automatically gave me a free replacement drink even though it was me that did the brain-dead move.  now that's a place I like!"}
{"text":"I dropped by for lunch.  The way I rate places for lunches is always about deliciousness, value/price and portion. 

I ordered a Fried Rice with Guilin Minced Pork ($5.99) that came with a cup of soy beverage.

- Deliciousness - it was tasty.  It was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't really.  The rice was a little burnt to be honest.  I digged hard to find the minced pork and I found only a few.  At this price point, I should not expect a lot of meat.  The key words were \"should not\", but I still expect to find some.  Anyhow, the rice was not bad; it just could be better, easily.

- Value/price - it costed $5.99, and it came with a beverage, so the value was very good.  It was cheaper than some food courts

- Portion - big portion.  I ate only half and doggie bagged the other half.

Overall, the value and the portion saved the day.  In fact, all other menu items seem cheap, too.  I guess I would have enjoyed the food more should I order more ordinary entrees such as a bowl soup noodle."}

I usually buy from the booth next door because that one has honey and ginger hot drink.  I wanted bubble tea today, and this booth had a big sign saying it was $2.50 bubbles/jellies included, tax inclusive.  I ordered a cold Mandarin Orange Green Tea With Jellies.  The flavour was bold and maybe too intense for some, but I liked it.  My BF ordered a Red Bean Milk Tea with Bubbles.  I found that the red bean flavour was not intense enough.  The drink was sweetened, so some might not mind.  Both drinks were quite refreshing."}
{"text":"This is pretty cheap bubble tea booth located at the FMP food court. The bubble teas are $2.50 for regular size, which is like half the price of Sharetea outside. 

However, you do get what you paid for. The flavors are made from powder and I feel like the ingredients (most likely, milk) aren't fresh. My friend ended up having to go to the bathroom after drinking and I felt bloated. 

There are around 5-6 bubble tea booths at the food court, so I probably won't be back considering my poor reaction from the bubble teas at Tasty House."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch. The place was full but within 2 minutes we were seated. This was like a true HK style cafe. You got like half the kitchen exposed so your table could be right beside where they prepare the drinks. You also got a kid probably about 7- 10 years old serving tables. Hilarious. 

The food here is cheap and really good.

The scrambled egg sandwich was done just the way I like. Soft white bread with no crust. Eggs buttered up and a bit runny. 

The rice rolls were also done really well here. Soft with a bit of chew to it.

The dish that really impressed me was the satay beef with noodles and soup. The bowl is super large portion size. Choice of noodles which made me happy since I prefer the thicker noodles. The satay beef was so plentiful and it was also soft and tender. Also came with some veggies too. 

Meals come with soya drink.

Service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Came here and had a crepe with bbt.
The bbt was a mixture of sago, mango and grass jelly. Tasted pretty good and when all combined went well with each other.

The crepe can be made the way you like. We got our crepe made with a thicker batter which made the crepe more chewy. We got the crepe with peaches and ice cream and once again the combination of everything went well with each other."}
{"text":"Great affordable drinks at Tasty House at First Markham Place. In addition to their $2.50 bubble tea there's also various Hong Kong style drinks as well. I find this place better than places like Chatime, less gimmicks and cheaper.

I've had the crepes a few times and they're also alright considering it's a food court place."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 2 years and their milk tea is my favourite as the tea flavour is very strong! However, I realized that whenever I order in Chinese, they never charge me tax but always so when I order in English... Today I ordered the $2.50 regular sized milk tea which says on a big sign \"TAX INCLUDED\". But charged me $2.65. When asked, they said they just changed the pricing today... which was clearly a lie. This just didn't sit well with me"}
{"text":"I've been to this bubble tea joint for 5+ years, and I have to say: it's my favourite. I've been to places like Chatime and all the other hip ones, but I keep coming back to Tasty House. Why? Mainly because it's a lot cheaper. The bubble teas are $2.50 for a regular. I usually splurge and get some lychee jelly added to mine, making the total around $3.50. My trips to First Markham Place are never complete until I have my Tasty House bubble tea."}
{"text":"this place was closed at 8:45 when Yelp said they were open till 10pm - really not impressed. I called to find out exactly where they were and they didn't bother to tell me that they were closing."}
{"text":"Save yourself some money and get your Hong Kong milk tea elsewhere. There is no flavour in the milk tea and it tastes extremely watered down."}
{"text":"The BEST HK Style bubble tea for only $2.63 w tax!  Get a frequent buyer card and receive a free drink of equal or lesser value after you purchase 7 of the same or similar price (she gives stamps based on $ amount so you'll get the same thing free - unlike bb tea shops that will give a free small bubble tea regardless of what you've purchased for the stamps (ex. Large slush...etc)

LOOOOOVE Tasty House!"}
{"text":"$5 breakfast for a large bowl of congee plus a plate of steamed rice rolls! Went here early this morning with 3 Toronto friends. Definitely a filling breakfast - ask for containers if you don't want to waste the food. Honestly could have split one breakfast special with another person since no one at my table finished their food.

Place opens at 8 AM, though it still says 7 AM on the menu. The TVs here have TVB playing in the background. They have breakfast sandwiches here as well. Plenty of parking too."}
{"text":"This is my parent's new favourite breakfast joint. $4.99 gets you a bowl of congee and an order of rice rolls.

For tonight's dinner, we ordered the chicken and mushroom clay pot rice (20 min wait - the scorched rice at the end was AMAZING!, rice rolls with beef brisket and bittermelon with egg.

Wasn't expecting much as this is a HK style cafe, but the price point, flavours and quick service earned its 4 stars!

FYI the fresh soy based rice rolls have a bit of a chew to it ~ I really like the texture."}
{"text":"Cheap eats here! My parents love coming here for Hong Kong style food. We got pork rice roll, congee, and beef noodle. 

I love the rice rolls as they are different from the traditional rice rolls. The pork congee was okay. The noodles came with a decent amount of beef and lots of noodles. 

The food here is really good for the price you pay for! We paid around $20 for 3 people worth of food, and we were super full. Service is okay here. Can't really expect much from a chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Rodick Rd. and Hwy 7 inside the food court at First Markham Place. Parking spots near the entrance are limited during peak hours 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Staff were friendly and the cashier informed us our order would be ready within 5 minutes. 

[DÉCOR] - 3/5 
Plenty of seating in food court, during non-peak hours. Average tables and chairs.

[QUALITY] - 4/5
Pretty good quality for a Chinese-style crêpe from a food court at the price. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Strawberry Crêpe with Ice Cream and Whipped Cream - $4.99: crêpe was warm and had more of an egg flavour than traditional French crêpes. Ice cream was average (there were no ice crystals or anything funky), and strawberries were fresh. 

- Taro Milk Bubble Tea - $2.50: Taro milk had the perfect amount of sweetness, and was quite refreshing. They had an extensive selection of bubble tea flavours, and includes tapioca, all for $2.50 each! It definitely satisfied my craving for bubble tea. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
The crêpe was a nice treat, but the bubble tea is the selling-point for this place. Overall, Tasty House is my go-to spot for bubble tea at a super low price."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the flavours. Ordered over 50 bubble tea for my party and my guests were NOT satisfied. They said the bubble tea tasted like water, and they did not like the drinks. Was not worth the discount."}
{"text":"Great place in the food court of Market Village if you want to get a good HK style tea or bubble tea or any of the over 50 different kinds of drinks!

They have special afternoon tea set that comes with a crepes.

Make sure you ask them for the frequent buyer's card that let you by 10 get one free.

Tasty House should be call the \"New\" Tasty House.

A brand new menu, A complete makeover, A new Chinese name...

Tasty House is not a Hong Kong Style Cafe anymore but more of a Congee/Noodle/Rice Roll restaurant.

There are quite a few new Chinese restaurants in the area specialized in this house made steamed rice roll and Tasty House is one of the better ones! I love how the texture of the rice roll has a little more chewy texture.

Plain Rice Roll ($1.99)
Fisherman Congee ($4.99)
Spicy Ox Tail ($3.99)

The food we ordered were all quite good. Come before 11 am and you can pick any congee with any rice roll for $4.99 as breakfast special! This is a good deal!

Most of the other noodles dishes are around $5 or so and comes with a soy milk drink.

Tasty House is a good place to come for some congee and rice roll and even some soup noodle. at a good price!

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Tasty House is inside the food court of First Markham Place.

Though under  the same name as the one inside Market Village, they are not runned by the same owner and they have separate frequent buyer program so you will have to have 2 different stamped cards. 

There is a little different in prices too, the one at First Markham Place is a little cheaper because there are so many competitive for bubble tea and drinks in this location.

The menu is really similar with the usual HK style tea/coffee, over 20 different flavours for bubble tea with tapiocia which is selling for $2.50, different kinds of fresh fruit ice, smoothies etc. They also serves sweet and meat crepes.

All the drinks are buy 10 get 1 free. The lady at the counter even remind me to stamp my card.

The bubble tea here are not too sweet and really delicious! It does not taste powdery like a lot of other places. The tapicoa is perfect and chewy. yummmmm

BTW, they have this gift card you can get $18 which will give you $20 worth of products if you buy 2 of them. Good deal if you buy drinks here often!

CASH only!"}
{"text":"Service is really bad. Staffere wont speak enhlish either.  Food also bad too. So many other hakka Chinese food are much better food than here"}
{"text":"Quality gone down and price went up. They no longer provide seasme seeds with plain rice roll, which is blasphemy in my dictionary!"}
{"text":"Great price for more than generous portion. Ordered the congee with preserved egg, stir fried beef noodles and cheung fun. Congee was bit bland but I didn't mind it. My favourite was the cheung fun which they made it really good. It would be 3/5 for food but plus 1 for the portion and price."}
{"text":"The trip to First Markham place wouldn't be complete without getting a drink or dessert from Tasty house. All bubble teas have been $2.5 (tax included) with tapioca for years. Definitely not the best bbt I ever had but for the price its pretty good.
I had crepes a few times; it was good and well worth the price. Service is usually very fast and friendly"}
{"text":"not bad, has a very homey feeling in a way. 

they have homemade ricerolls, but not the same as the ones you get at dimsum.  its quite different.  The only problem is that the servings are small. 

guilin noodles are okay, not too bad.  comes out in a big bowl but i did not feel full after i ate it.    still very worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Always great Bbt at a great price. Can't beat 2.50. I always come here for the white peach. Just sad there isn't star jelly anymore"}
{"text":"yo listen up

this place is affordable, delicious, and has friendly service. their bubble tea tastes original and i would chose this place over Chatime any day (and i love Chatime)

$2.50 for a bubbletea that tastes amazing?! unheard of!!!! 
I would recommend the HK Style Milk Tea with Grass Jelly"}
{"text":"Wonderful service!!!!! 

They always get my drinks right, they don't make mistakes and they're fast! 

Bubble tea is only $2.50 and it's delicious too. My all-time favourite is the blueberry tea + mango (or lychee) jelly. Today I had the almond black tea with sago (sei mei lo) and I'm pretty sure you'll hate it. I LOVED IT YAY!!!!

I tried the crepes out of curiosity. They make this SO fast. The crepes is fairly big for such a cheap price, one big scoop of vanilla ice-cream and your choice of fillings. We had the mango, it was pretty good. I liked it. Not too sweet and the crepe is thin."}
