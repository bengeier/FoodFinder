{"text":"I had the Entrecôte with a Monte Carlo and it was fantastic. Entrecôte was cooked chefs' choice. It came medium rare. Also ordered the endive salad because I was curious from other reviews and it's really great. My wife had the ribs and they are quite smokey tasting- very unique. Didn't get a chance to try the burger but we will be back."}
{"text":"This place was by far the worst place and worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. 
My mother in-law made reservations in advance for 16 of us at 6:30. 
We were seated on time and waited for a bit to order drinks. Then we ordered food about an hour or so later. We were told they didn't have ribs, this is what they're known for and we didn't understand how they were out when we were the only people there at 6:30. We all ordered and people behind us, who came in after us, got food way before us. It took over an hour for us to get our food. 1/2 of the party had cold food. The food was completely over priced and was not worth anything close to what we paid. I wouldn't ever ever want anyone to go there and give their money to this establishment. 
I would give them less than one star but that isn't possible."}
{"text":"Had a nice meal here the other night. We were a table of four - we all ordered something different and in all cases the food was pretty good. The service was very friendly and professional. All in all a good time."}
{"text":"Great relaxed setting especially winter next to the large fireplace. Food is always fresh and made to order, nothing pre-cooked and reheated. I like going there for lobster fest and anytime to enjoy the great barbecued smoked ribs. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Cela fait plusieurs années maintenant que j'entends parler de ce restaurant a Rigaud ouvert depuis maintenant 36 ans. Restaurant de style campagnard ou les viandes comme le poulet, le buf et les côtés levées passe au fumoir qui est sur place. Ils ont un très bons choix de vins au verre. Nous avons partagé une salade d'endives a la vinaigrette césar, fêta et melon. Croquant et frais.  Ma Partenaire a commandé la petite portion de côtes levées (voir photo) accompagnée de frites maison. Le goût de fumée est assez prononcé. La viande se détache toute seule et la sauce BBQ est aussi très bonne et préparée bien sur sur place. De mon côté j'ai pris le Burger Rube. Servi d'office avec des oignons, champignons et fromage, la viande est cuite au goût du client et sur un pain campagnard. Excellent choix. Un vrai bon hamburger comme a la maison. C'était ma première visite mais pas ma dernière."}
{"text":"The best restaurant you'll find out in this slightly remote location. It's got a traditional atmosphere. Their signature dish is the ribs but they also offer high quality steak & seafood. Nothing is pre-made, everything is made on the spot. People need to support high quality local restaurants like this one because there aren't many left!"}
{"text":"Customer service was amazing! 
Food was awesome we had a great time and we were a group of 11!!! 
This place is a must go!!!"}
