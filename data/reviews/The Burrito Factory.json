{"text":"is is the best burrito place in Charlotte I've been to so far. It's the only place around i know of where i can get a California Wet Burrito. You can't find these things too many places outside of southern California.  The salsas are excellent!    As someone who has tried many burrito places in San Diego, and recently moved to Charlotte, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My family has had this before but today was my first time. They were very friendly and patient. Allowing me to look at all ingredients before preparing my food to order.  The food was a huge portion for the price, making it a great value. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've been there once.  I did happen to go on a night they were offering a 5.99 anything on the menu (ups the value point) special.  I took that chance to get both a big chicken and cheese quesadilla and big meaty burrito.  Both came with chips.  The chips were good but the salsa bar was of the refridgerated variety.  While that's obviously good toward keeping things fresh, the problem was everything was so near the freezing point that you couldn't each your chips with salsa.  The excellent queso stepped in for a save.  The two entrees were bland and the seating area left much to be desired.  All in all, it's not bad but not so good as I'd want to return.  It's a home grown effort with out the million dollar budget chain restaurants use to get the details right, I know.  It's when a small mom and pop's joint still manages to get the details worked out, you have found a winner."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go try the burrito factory for a while, but never had a chance,. Today 6-14-14 I finally made it, and I'm glad I did. I was greeted by who I believe it was the owner, I got the Wet burrito and it was the best burrito I had in years. The burrito was huge and it was filled with yummy goodness(beans,rice,meat,french fries,cilantro, etc) I also got chips inside my bag. The burrito was really good and so were the chips.   They have a Salsa bar, don't be afraid to try a few of them. Next time I will try the Fish Tacos ,   PS. Chipotle has nothing on them. Chipotle's burritos might be a little bigger but are bland, no flavor at all.    Give them a try, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"This place has the best burritos! You need to try the Burrito Al Pastor. It's delicous and the burritos are huge.  Way better than Phat Burrito or Chipotle! They even deliver if you're close by.  I highly recommend this place.  Great food and good service."}
{"text":"Delicious. Friendly staff. Huge portions for a great price. Worth every penny. Everyone I introduce to it loves the food."}
{"text":"Best place to be! Felt like I was back in San Diego! Fish tacos were perfection! We will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, reasonable prices.  The pastor taco was plenty spicy and authentic"}
{"text":"The food was very good, small place and clean near ale house. I actually really enjoyed their tacos it was good. Had great flavor will definitely come back and try their burritos and. Come for taco Tuesday's"}
{"text":"Probably not a place I would have normally stopped at had it not been recommended to me. The staff is ridiculously friendly. The food was great, and the salsa bar was my favorite. What a simple, yet great idea. I will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best burritos I've ever had. The meat is perfect but the toppings couldn't be more fresh,  every time I come in it's as if they were just prepared.  The finely diced jalapeños are the heat!  They have a Salsa bar with lots of variety and an excellent drink selection,  the regular stuff as well Mexican specials.  This is my first 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all of the time when it opened on University! I loved this place before it came to University it was just so far of a drive. The people working in here are so nice and friendly and they usually let me get extra sauce without charging me lol. I can't tell you how much I love this place, you just have to go and try it for yourself! You won't regret it. Also- taco tuesdays are LIT"}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm obsessed with burritos and these by far are amazing. They have many different options and they will make pretty much anything you want. The employees are very friendly and it seems to be a family-owned business. They offer many different options/sauces that you can't get at the chains. I've been several times and recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and have been in Charlotte for 5 years now. Burrito Factory is the first place I've found in Charlotte that does California's version of Mexican food justice. California burritos (the ones with french fries inside), fish tacos, shrimp burritos. It's spectacular.   This place is every bit the small, delicious taco shop that one sees on every corner in Southern California. And Sam the owner is awesome. We can't wait to come back - this place is going to be a regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. It looks like a hole in the wall, but the food was amazing. They cook it to order so it's fresh and yummy! Only reason for four stars instead of five is it was very hot in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and good prices. Super friendly staff. Be sure to try the orange and green sauces."}
{"text":"Went here for taco Tuesday with some friends who all told me this was the best place for tacos around.  I tried chicken, beef, and pork tacos.  Out of the selection the beef was the only edible one for me.  There service was not great, I couldn't get past the pineapple in the pork tacos(if I would have known I may have steered clear) and the pico was full of cucumber which threw the flavor off.  It was such a let down.  I bought 6 tacos and only finished the 2 beef.  Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Ok, this is not the first negative experience I've had here. I forgave the first couple to maybe it was a bad time for them. Well, this afternoon was not too impressive either. With all the rave reviews, I just don't understand. They are always so slow. Disorganized is an understatement. I say it's for here and you pack half the order to go. You want cheese dip? Ok, give me several minutes to go find that size souffle cup, wait you need a lid? Let me wander off again to go get that. Before they had a salsa bar. Now, they gave one cup half full for my daughter and I to share. You need two salsas? Yes, one for each of us please. Thanks for the cold, runny cheese dip by the way. The guy running the register never smiled, not friendly at all. I guess I always catch them at bad times. I won't give them another try, too many other options out there."}
{"text":"You cannot get a better deal than $.99 taco Tuesday. The sauces are amazing and the employees are very friendly and happy."}
{"text":"Last week was my first time to the Burrito Factory and it was Awesome!  It might not look like anything special from the outside but inside it's completely redone in industrial chic. The food was fast, affordable and delicious and the staff was so friendly and helpful.  Get there early for lunch because it's so good, by 12 there is a line out the door.  I go every Tuesday for $1 tacos!"}
{"text":"They hit it out the park once again. I love there food and customer service. I only wish they had a location in Raleigh, NC. There burritos are amazing and on Thursdays everything is $5.49. This is a staple when I'm in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Seriously, best burrito in CLT! They have amazing options and I had a difficult time choosing what I wanted. Everything is fresh, spiced well, and super yummy. My burrito was HUGE and served with chips on the side. They have a great selection of salsa choices that were TO DIE FOR!    Didn't know they had a taco Tuesday so I def have to go back and check that out."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with this fresh burrito joint! Being from San Diego,CA and having great burrito joints everywhere I was a bit nervous but was impressed with the food quality and service was great very friendly staff! Would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"My favorite taco/burrito place in all of Charlotte! The quality of food is very high and you get a lot for your money. The staff is always friendly and helps me with my orders when I'm not sure what I'm feeling like. Service is also always fast. I'm in and out in under 5 to 10 mins everytime. I recommend this place to all my friends looking for a quick, affordable, somewhat healthy choice for lunch lol."}
{"text":"THANK GOD FOR BURRITO FACTORY.  I was beginning to get worried about the burrito scene in Charlotte. if you like a giant (and i mean HUGE) California style burrito, this is exactly 100% without a smidgen of a doubt where you need to go get your fix.   The staff is always friendly to everyone that walks in the door, and fast at what they do as well. All of the veggies are fresh and colorful, and they offer some unique options that other burrito spots do not; like banana peppers and these delicious pickled red onions that add a nice little sweet bite to your meal.   The menu offers more than just your average burrito, too. My advice: try the curry chicken, pork, and wet California burritos- ypu won't be disappointed there. Also make sure you make it out for Taco Tuesday, where you can grab pork, chicken, or ground beef tacos for 99 cents a piece.   Oh yeah, don't miss out on the salsa bar. Everything is made in house, and the guajadillo and tomatillo salsas come highly recommended. I love this place, as it's become a go-to for me and my friends!!"}
{"text":"Came in craving taquitos. Low and behold my wish was granted with handmade chicken rolled tacos made quickly and happily by a young man working the front bar. Service was wonderful with him explaining the kind of chicken I would receive, that it was semi spicy, and even asked my preference of \"crunchiness\". Food was quick, cheap and delivered with a smile. Restaurant was clean and appeared upgraded recently. Only thing I didn't like was the extra dollar fifty charge for a small ramekin of guacamole."}
{"text":"I've been to the one on South Blvd several times so i decided to try this location. It was excellent. I always get tacos so i can try several meat options. The pineapple pork taco is excellent, the ground beef is very flavorful and the chipotle chicken is also very good. Their ingredient are very fresh and like their 3 salsa options. The mild is a typical red chunky salsa, the medium is creamy deliciousness & their hot is a unique salsa verde. Service from Curtis was awesome making my delicious tacos, he even checked on us twice. I will say there are ways to improve this place as it doesn't seem very busy....which it should be, alla Sabor. I think with quicker service & staffing the place with more people as well as some new decor, this place could be a 5 star place. Take some tips on how/where Sabor is operated/located and your business would double because the quality of food at the BF is excellent."}
{"text":"I WAS a huge fan of The Burrito Factory. My boyfriend and I usually come every Tuesday for $0.99 tacos and for Factory Thursdays  (entire menu $5.49). EVERY Thursday we order the same thing (shrimp burrito) and pay the $5.49 price . Well for some reason today , I get all the way through the line to pay and the lady says that shrimp is excluded and that it has ALWAYS been that way. Mind you there was NO sign specifying this. Another lady comes along and says \"we tell everyone that it's only for chicken, beef, and pork\". Well she nor anyone else told us that when we came in. We didn't have a problem with paying; HOWEVER, i informed her that we come every week and pay the same price, so this is a policy that is new. She then begin to argue me saying that it's always been this way and I never paid $5.49 for my shrimp burrito on a Thursday. We've noticed lately they have been taking things away and adding on extra charges without proper signage or notifying their customers. More specifically on Tuesday's and Thursday's . It's SHADY. Needless to say this was my last visit there , which is unfortunate because we have been loyal customers and think they have great food . Very disappointed in the customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, 99 cent tacos on Tuesday! And the pico on the salsa bar is wonderful."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating my first Shrimp Burrito at the Burrito Factory (BF) - incredible!  As a recent transplant from Arizona, I've been on the search for GREAT Mexican flavors, and the Burrito Factory has it.  The chicken and steak are very good, and the shrimp is cooked to order in a wonderful chipotle sauce.  Featured are the typical fillers of a Quoda and Chipotle - black/pinto beans, rice, pico, guacamole - but BF takes it to a whole-nother level with 2 choices of fresh cheese, fresh chopped cilantro and jalapenos, and other sides you won't find at the chain restaurants.  To compare with other very good fresh burrito/Mexican flavors in town (Phat Burrito and Cabo Fish Taco), BF sets itself apart with a well-balanced mix of authentic Mexican spices/flavors.  To top it off, you get a generous portion of homemade corn tortilla chips and access to a FREE homemade salsa bar.  The salsas attest to the skill and authenticity of the staff, showcasing a wonderful bouquet of roasted peppers, onions, and spices.  The inside decor is every bit as clean and sleek as a Chipotle with the simple casualness of a real California-Style burrito joint.  Also, the staff is friendly and helpful.  BF gets a 4 out of 5 for excellently prepared food, great flavors, and a level of authenticity that simply can't be found in other fast-food burrito joints in town.  If you have an adventurous palate or are looking to experience true Mexican flavors, the Burrito Factory is a must eat in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burrittos! And a great delivery option if you're staying downtown. We put in an 11-burritto order and Burrito Factory got it to us correct and hot. While I thought they were right on time, the man delivering our order thought he was too late and refused to let me tip him. I wanted to write this post to say thank you and I will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"One of the best charlotte local burritos. You got to try California style curry chicken burrito. The yellow flavored rice with curry chicken and other few condiments. Oh my god. Taste explosion in mouth.   Don't get fooled by the exteriors. It has awesome interiors and people are very nice here. Place is really clean. Good luck with your burrito. Yes, I will keep coming."}
{"text":"Excellent burritos and many other food choices. We are from Florida and wished we could've brought this restaurant home with us."}
{"text":"While this place seemed to have quality food for a reasonable price I have to say you get what you pay for. I was the only person there initially, around 6:00, I had a quesadilla asked for everything except meat and it came out with beans and cheese. I asked for guacamole and sour cream which came on the side and was no more than a table spoon in a tiny plastic cup. I had to go back and ask for Salsa for my chips and again, a table spoon in the plastic cup.  If you want .99 burritos this is probably a great idea as I saw other people getting those a little later. Very cheesy machismo videos on the TV without sound. No me gusta mucho..."}
{"text":"A former co-worker recommended this place last time I was in the area and now I drive 30+ minutes from Steele Creek to get their burritos.  Hands down the best burritos I have ever eaten, especially for this town.  Owner is extremely friendly and always makes sure we are enjoying our food.  Very affordable, with a $4.99 special every day, and $0.99 taco Tuesday.  I recommend the Cali chicken curry burrito, AMAZING!  This place puts Moe's and Chipotle to shame, they don't even hold a candle to one of these burritos.  I honestly don't know if I'll ever be able to eat another burrito from one of those chains again because it just won't compare and it'll be more expensive."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday it was my first time so I was unsure but as soon as I walked in everyone was so nice they gave us Intel on the menu and just my like the special was everything on the menu is 5.49 it was so many item I didn't know what to choose from so I ended up with a burrito chips guacamole and queso. All their food was delicious and fresh. I was highly satisfied and the owner was really friendly. I would recommend it to any one is looking for quality fresh cuisine in charlotte."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many many times and would have never thought to stop in. Thank God for Yelp! On the recommendation from a few awesome fellow Yelpers, my husband and I stopped in for lunch on Saturday.  First thing I noticed when walking in is the salsa bar! Salsa bars rock!  There are few tables in there. We ate in but I got the impression most people ordered to go.   We decided to split the California fish burrito and a side of chips and queso. I was a little nervous at first cause it took a little time to get the burrito together....what i didnt realize was it was becuase they were frying the plaintains on the spot!! The burrito was ginormo (thank gosh we split it cause i was full for like 8 hours after!) and had rice, beans (half black, half pinto), tilapia, pico, and plaintains. Super messy, yet super delish! The queso was that white queso and was really good. I love me some queso!   Good thing for me is that soon we are moving really close to th Burrito Factory......bad thing for my workouts cause Im gonna have to amp them up to compensate for discovering this place!"}
{"text":"Great Burrito!  On Thursdays they have $5.49 Burritos and it's a steal.  I had the Chipotle shrimp burrito and my wife had the fish and plantain burrito. Both were excellent!  Try the Salsa bar as well!!  The owners were so kind as to bring our 3 year old a free cup of milk and a side of rice and beans (also free). It's service like this that makes customers for life!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden jewel in Charlotte! If you like great food and friendly staff check this place out!"}
{"text":"After being a chef for almost 20 years, I am usually not wowwed by much but this place is great. First off the kitchen is super clean which is a huge deal for me. And the food was fresh and amazing ill be back often"}
{"text":"Love this place! Clean and simple decor, nice staff, salsa bar and the best guacamole in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"They are just very dank. The name is burrito but don't let that confuse you, it's more than a factory. It's a lifestyle"}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome friendly service, never overly crowded, great deals - awesome alternative to the greasy Mexican food joints out there Try the veggie burrito with steak, nomnom!"}
{"text":"New to Charlotte. Staying in the University area and wanted to try some food in the area. While checking Yelp for local restaurants I came across the Burrito Factory. This place is amazing. Great customer service, great food and great prices. Today was there Thursday special where all items are 5.49. Food was so good I forgot to take a picture lol. Needless to say I will be back and will have pictures next time!!! Must try if your in the university area."}
{"text":"Great fat heady burrito. Cali burrito is my go to. Great prices too. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Really nice and friendly customer service. Burrito was good. Better than average, but not memorable. We'll be back to try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"This place might fool you since it's very small. But this place is like mini- chipotle. The employees are super nice and this place is very family-friendly. They have really good Happy-Burritos and and pricing is very convenient. I would totally recommend this to anyone that sees this place while driving! L"}
{"text":"The best and biggest you will find for a great price. California burrito has French fries inside it will not disappoint. The wife had the chipotle with no less than a school of shrimp.  Also have a fresh salsa bar with unique items you will not find anywhere else."}
{"text":"I had my food delivered and everything was pretty good and fresh.  Too bad they don't have drink menu on Yelp delivery"}
{"text":"I use to absolutely love this place. But lately they have been a major thumbs down. Every time I go in there is something different that costs extra, or they forget my chips, and I have to go back! They really need to regroup as a restaurant if they want to keep loyal customers. They have maybe 1 more time to win back my loyalty."}
{"text":"this was a pleasant (AND TASTY) surprise! never been here and the first time i went was for lunch with two friends and we smasheddd. great portions for the price and the staff was so friendly. def going back again!"}
{"text":"Was pretty good and the burrito was good size for the money. Chips and choriqueso was yummy!!! I'll try again and get another meat other that plain ol steak."}
{"text":"good food, though over priced, in my opinion. I will probably give them more stars after a while though. They seem to be quick and the food IS good. they are also investing in the imaging.  it's just that the 5$ special turns out to be around 7$. But all in all I think it's a nice place to grab n run."}
{"text":"WOW!  That's all I can say about this place!  Authentic and good.  Great fillings and fresh meats.  I loved Moes but graduated to Chipotle and thought it was the pinnacle peak as far as burritos go.  But I got a wild hair and decided to look for more burrito spots.  I came across this place based off it's solid reviews.  I drove 25 minutes just to get take out from here.  Solid sauces, solid chips, GREAT BURRITOS!  Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"In from out of town for the week and came across this please thanks to Must try restaurants on Pinterest. It did not disappoint. Food was amazing and the customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Quick recap: delicious burritos. Unique flavors. Friendly staff and overall a great value. Strongly recommend the burritos and the fried plantains.   If you like burritos, you need to come here. They give you fat burritos that are jam packed with goods. Got the price it's an amazing deal.   Tacos are also good but if I had to choose, I would go with the burritos. I strongly recommend the fried plantains as well. They taste authentic. They don't mess with it, it's just fried and served."}
{"text":"REALLY good shrimp burrito. Lots of shrimp and nice and juicy, not some dried out husk of a burrito. Sauce station could use some love though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time today and I was blown away! Everything was immaculately clean and the veggies/meats all looked so fresh. The bathrooms were small but very nice and clean. The customer service was outstanding! Upon walking in, a man who looked like a manager suggested a few customer favorites and explained a few of the menu items (very helpful). The woman who made our burritos is definitely a professional. She stuffed it so full of goodies I thought for sure the wrap would tear trying to roll it. Nope. And then they put your burrito in a HOT PRESS to finish it!!! So warm and delicious. Everyone go here."}
{"text":"My burrito was not good. I had a wet burrito. No bueno. Fish tacos were so wet that it made the soft she'll like rubber. So much cilantro that you couldn't taste the fish. My fiancé had a chicken quesadilla and she took 2 bites and tossed it. We had ours delivered so we couldn't send it back. The plus is that they deliver. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great linch spot in University.  Burrito was really good and the sauces for the chips are really good too! Staff was super friendly! I'll def have to come back for me! I got a burrito with chips and a drink for under $10."}
{"text":"Another great visit  Friendly and quick service. Taco Tuesday 99ea  Choriqueso burrito with chips meal very filling. 3 taco w/chips great. 1 beef (good) 2 chicken (tasty &  moist). Choriqueso dip little greasy like meat wasn't drained but still yummy took what was left home!  Plantains with yogurt sauce such a yummy desert!"}
{"text":"Great food , but they try over charge you all the time ,I order 4 taco 2 beef and 2 steak all the time Same way   I got charge deferred all the time  One time $13 last , last wk $16 and today $20 I guess it's time to find anther Mexican place"}
{"text":"Whaat? Where have you been the last 17 years, Burrito Factory and why didn't you send a tweet/carrier pigeon/smoke signal when you opened? My husband and I ventured down South on a grey Sunday, but it was all smiles and sunshine in the Burrito Factory. The owner was super friendly and walked us through the whole menu and told us his story (we asked).   I was so excited to not only have a place with several delicious homemade salsas - some without Cilantro - HALLELUJAH!!, but also California style burritos that as far as I know aren't anywhere else in town. For me, the most exciting thing was that they had Sopes. Not sopa (soup) but Sopes, which is kind of like an ultra thick corn tortilla fried which is used as a base like a tostada. It's only made in certain parts of Mexico, so until now, most of the Mexicans who owned restaurants in Charlotte were from non-sopes territory apparently. At the factory, they top their sopes with spiced pulled chicken on top of the beans and I usually like mine with ground beef, but they're so nice I'm sure they'd customize. They also had a number of really good looking salads that I will definitely try. Even their chips are delicious, and their tomatillo salsa and an orange creamy chipotle sauce is to die for.   In addition, they had flavored waters (like uncarbonated soda) and the pina colada was really delicious. We got a horchata to go as a dessert. :)  It's exactly what you want a burrito place to be - fresh ingredients, unique combinations, great salsas, fair prices and delicious salsas. Perfecto! My only complaint is its location, but word on the street is they're looking into a location somewhere closer to uptown (Dilworth maybe)? Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I was in town for an interview. It was late in the evening. I was fighting nerves and hunger that kept welling up when anxiety was unable to keep it down. I needed food fast, safe food that wouldn't haunt me in the morning. Pickings in the area seemed scarce.  When, 'lo, a burrito champion revealed itself for the win.   I had a delicious chicken burrito with black beans and guacamole. It was fat; I was happy. My only disappointment were the lackluster chips. I have been spoiled by the variety found in wheat chips, and TBF's were just too plain jane.   But, what made TBF such a pleasant discovery still was that, despite it being late and there being only two customers, service was beyond exceptional in this rundown stripmall location.  I was greeted upon entering, and offered a taste of a curried chicken they were featuring. Delicious. The hospitality, warmth, kindness I found in TBF, not to mention the cleanliness and presentation of what is otherwise a fast-food joint, bumped them from an a-ok to man! I want another the next time I'm in town. They even have Jarritos, my non-alcoholic comfort drink during hard times.   I left calm and content, ready for the next day's intensity."}
{"text":"I cannot rave about The Burrito Factory enough! The staff is amazing and the food is delicious. Get the ground beef and sample every salsa, you won't regret it. Tuesday's are $1 tacos and on Thursdays the entire menu is $5.49. We will be back."}
{"text":"I was expecting a little more from this place.  Prices good, but not much ambiance.  Good for something  quick, but honestly I think I would have been more satisfied at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Great people, Great food. Definitely worth a try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"You had me at $.99 tacos!   So I've literally driven by this place hundreds of times and always say I'm going to give them and try...and it just never worked out. Until a few weeks ago when my coworkers and I gave them a try for Taco Tuesday. I mean $.99 tacos....always count me in!   When we arrived it was a long line, which is always a good sign. I tried three tacos: a steak, spicy chicken and beef. They were all yummy. There were plenty of toppings to add and they all come with chips and salsa.   You can't ask for a better lunch deal. It's fast, cheap and yummy!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but if you are looking for a typical steak burrito - chipotle or freebirds is better.  Same ingredients, but kind of bland."}
{"text":"After having this joint bookmarked for months, my wife and I finally decided this was the perfect Friday night to venture down South Blvd and see what the hype was alllll about.   I opted for the fajita veggie burrito with steak. Plenty of options for toppings, all of which looked fresh to death. Also decided to give the chorizo queso a spin. The best part of the Burrito Factory experience? SALSA BAR! This is without a doubt the best salsa bar in charlotte (sorry all of you Sabor lovers, don't hate me). The green salsa was my overall winner, but you can't go wrong with any of them. The steak on the burrito was cooked to perfection and had a great carne asada flavor. I think the chorizo queso might have been the real MVP of the night, though. The perfect blend of cheese/chorizo with the perfect amount of spice. I'd endure the 50 million stop lights down South Blvd on the reg just to get that queso.   Pro tip: all burritos/tacos come with chips. Perfect way to try all of the sauces."}
{"text":"I ordered this from Postmates at work. I am sure glad we did. I had them Choriqueso Burrito and it was super good. It was packed with food, hot and not lacking in taste. They gave me a side of Chips and Green Salsa/Guac that has a really nice bite to it. I dumped it on my burrito and it was perfect. I wish i took some pictures but once I remembered I was already almost finished.   I will be coming for more Burrito Factory! Juicy Steak burrito... you are next."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte last week with my wife on business so we stopped by this place I had bookmarked in Yelp that I was anxious to try.    When we first drove by (had to do a U-Turn) it appeared they were closed as I didn't see anyone in the parking lot.  Once we got there the parking lot was definitely empty but the sign said open.  Once we arrived inside this local place I was impressed with the customer service we received.  These people are very friendly and we had the pleasure to get to know the manger on duty Issac.  Such as great guy and was really interested in hearing about our experience as well as information regarding Yelp.  We probably had a 10 min conversation discussing YELP alone which we always are gratefully to give our experiences since we have the BEST YELP ambassador in Asheville (Kipper !!!!)  Onto the meal as that is what you want to hear about right?  My wife was looking for a Gluten Free (GF) meal but had nothing on the board labeled as such...BUT they accommodated her by making her a bowl with the ingredients she chose.  This made her very happy.  HAPPY wife = Happy LIFE.  I chose the steak burrito since they were out of tamales which I was really craving but they were out.  HOPEFULLY on my next trip they will have these for me to try!.  The meat was tender and all of the ingredients including the rice were on point.  The habanero sauce was a nice touch of heat.  We also had chips and queso which were yummy.  My only wish was this was about $1-$1.50 cheaper per item which would really make this 5 stars in my book.  Great place give it a try you will be glad you did and support the locals!"}
{"text":"I ordered the carnitas and carne asada tacos thru postmates...I'm so glad they left the receipt in the bag so I knew where it came from. So good! I'm definitely stopping by this place to order these again!"}
{"text":"ad·dic·tion devotion to, dedication to, obsession with, infatuation with, passion for, love of, mania for, enslavement to  That is all.   Okay so I do have more to say, but that pretty much does sum up my relationship with Burrito Factory.   I, like many, first stumbled upon Burrito Factory through yelp and also because of their, wait for it, $1 Taco Tuesdays!! That's right. ONE DOLLAR. With that dollar, you get the most seasoned and flavorful meat I've ever had in a taco (choice of chicken, ground beef or pulled pork - YES to all) and a hearty serving of chips. You also get over 20 different ingredients at your fingertips. Mine are always filled with lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, onions, cucumber, corn, feta, pico de gallo, habanero sauce, fresh jalapeños and pickled jalapeños. I like it HOT! Guacamole and queso are available for a small charge. I recommend queso. Always queso. ALWAYS. Also, on Thursdays, EVERYTHING on the menu is $5.49!   So what has kept me coming back (basically twice and week.. And way more than I'd really like to admit)? Well aside from the food, of course, the people are some of the sweetest I have ever met. I'm actually writing this review because we've reached this comfortable, embarrassing zone of our relationship where the employees recognize me. Today, one of them asked why don't I just start working at Burrito Factory since I'm always here (see.. embarrassing). Well, Burrito Man, that would just be feeding an addiction that I'm already having trouble quitting! Plus, I don't see how that is a good business choice on your behalf, as I would eat everything I touch.   Can this place get any more magical, you ask? Why yes. Yes, it absolutely can, because they have a SALSA BAR. Made fresh every day and filled with a variety of yummy deliciousness! I always mix the pico de gallo with the green sauce (properly named as the tomatillo mild) and that is my happy place. The first time I came here, I tried every single sauce that they have. One was out and one of their employees actually SAW that I didn't get that one, brought it from the back and to my table, without me ever saying a word! Mind you, this isn't a full service type place. It's casual. It's fun. It's delicious.   Basically, I will probably keep coming here every Tuesday for the rest of life.   Recommendations 1. Taco Tuesday 2. Nachos with Pork 3. Cali Style Chipotle Shrimp Burrito"}
{"text":"Super fresh. Absolutley delicious.  Salsa bar is wonderful.  The wet burrito is killer.  Way too much food, like thats a problem.  THREE DIFFERENT HORCHATA DRINKS ON TAP.  Really good."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. Was in the area figured I'd try it. Customer service is 10 out of 10. Salsa bar has about 7 selections nothing too spicy but good flavor. Sweet and I sweet tea as well as pins colada and other drinks! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"After just moving here from the west coast, my husband and I havr been in desperate need of a good hand-held burrito joint. He's from San Diego, and we are both rediculously picky when it comes to mexican food. So, we were very excited after ready all the great reviews on yelp. Unfortunately,  we were both extremely disappointed. I give it a two star because I'd be willing to give it another chance, but it'll be a while. If I were asked \"Do you want to go to Taco Bell or The Burrito Factory\" I'd ask, \"Which is closer?\"  I'm a sucker for little \"whole in the wall\" joints so the decor and the location didn't bother me. But I was immediately turned off by the way you order. I thought if you ordered a burrito it would just come with everything on it that was listed, but it's just a typical conveyer belt like ordering counter. You have to ask for all the toppings individually. It also set me off that the only types of cheese they have are, feta, mozzarella, and nacho cheese sauce? How is this an \"authentic californoa burrito\" without jack or cojita cheese?   After my confusion at the counter, I finally got my bean, rice, and cheese burrito. Meh! That's it. Absolutely no flavor with the rice or beans, and the tortillas aren't fresh. I thought the only saving grace would be the salsa bar, but each salsa was just as bland as the next. They had no flavor, and no spice. What's the point of having a salsa bar if they all taste the same?   My husband got the tofu burrito (we are both vegetarian), and it was the worst cooked tofu we've ever had. If you are vegetarian DO NOT get the tofu burrito, it is wet and slimy. Terrible texture, and as bland as the rest of the meal.   I'm willing to give this place another shot based on all the amazing reviews, but I have a feeling this is not a good place for a vegetarian. Even with all the veggie options, it's not worth it. If the rice and beans are flavorless, even if I order another dish I'm worried it's not going to get better.   This place might have great meat dishes, but based on the flavor and quality of ingredients, this is in NO WAY \"California style burritos\". This is just another americanized, bland, burrito joint. Nothing special."}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood and this will easily be a regular spot for us when we don't feel like doing dishes.  You can't beat the deals on Tuesdays ($1 tacos) and Thursdays (all burritos are $5.49).  My favorite is their fish taco with the fried plantains - delicious!  Service is friendly and quick even with it being cooked to order.  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is that the last time I came in, they waited until I already ordered to tell me they had no plantains - I would have ordered something differently if they told me first."}
{"text":"Tried burrito factory for the first time today. First off,  customer service was outstanding. They were very patient, kind, and helpful.   The burrito is huge and filling. It's good for the price! I ordered the curry chicken burrito with pinto beans. It was good but I feel like my meat and beans could have had more flavor though. I'll definitely go back to try the steak and the shrimp burritos!!"}
{"text":"Taxi Tuesday is the bomb.  I'm here almost every Tuesday for lunch.   Their carnita with pineapple in it is amazing.   I put pico, cilantro,  guac, jalapeño and their habenero sauce is very flavorful and had a great kick.  They are quick with the lines out to the door.   They are friendly and know what the regulars order."}
{"text":"my favorite!! The shrimp burritos are mine and my boyfriend's favourite! We go here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Call before you attempt to go. Tried to get some California style burritos and they were closed 3 hours before they were supposed to close."}
{"text":"This place sucked. The person who served me was extremely rude and whispered the whole time so when I couldn't hear him he would roll his eyes. He told me the queso wasn't ready but then I saw another guy give it to a customer after me. They literally put two barely fried, cold French fries in my burrito. The ground beef was salty. I really wanted to love this place and rarely give one star reviews but I left so disappointed. It must've been a bad day for them."}
{"text":"After braving the crazy crowds to go shopping on a Saturday morning (seriously though, people need to learn how to chill), I was wiped and had to grab something to keep my stomach and road rage in check. As I passed by the Burrito Factory, I remembered the delicious fare they had to offer and decided to swing in. The short and sweet version is really good tex mex at a stupid low price.   I have been here (or taken out) food a few times. The tacos are great and are a buck a piece on Tuesdays. I have also had the burritos, which are about the size of my head and have the same density as a brick. Also the meals come with chips and access to a salsa bar. Everything I have had is fresh and you really get a good bang for your buck.   The decor is pretty simple and nothing to really write home about. Either way, it gets the job done. Also the few times I have been the staff always seems a bit overworked. However, it was never enough to keep me from coming back. Keep up the great work churning out awesome food!"}
{"text":"Best burrito I've had since moving to Carolina. The ladies that work there are super helpful and friendly. Lots of choices of burritos or tacos. I had a California burrito. The burrito was massive, so a really good value. The fries they put in the burrito didn't have any flavor so it wasn't my favorite. I would definitely go back though and try something different."}
{"text":"Wow..  this really is California style mex. I am so used to being disappointed by Mexican food in the south, that I wasn't really ready to try another \"burrito\" place, but I decided to give it a try for lunch one day and was very impressed.  I am from Southern California - born and raised - and had an Aunt and Grandma who made the best latin food in the world.. it's not easy to impress me and I am not fooled by \"hipster street tacos\" or \"build a burritos\".   This is authentic style Mexican. I wish I could eat here more often, but unfortunately - there really isn't such a thing as low calorie latin food. Ha ha..  A great find in Charlotte for people seeking real Mex food."}
{"text":"I love their burritos and staff, every one is so nice. Way better than the tryon location though, just heads up."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the burrito factory on south blvd weekly, but moved and it put us closer to the other location. I was excited to at least be somewhat near one of the locations, but I have excitement no more. They dont seem to have the same work ethic at this location as the other one. I have now gone twice during posted \"business hours\" and they have been closed, as in they closed early and they were still inside and walking around, but decided to close, just because. Im not talking about 5 min early, i'm talking a minimum 30-1 hr early. I refuse to go to there any more, which sucks because I barely ever make it to the other side of town to their awesome south blvd. location."}
{"text":"Stopped here after reading Yelp reviews and was happy I did.  Great service from Sam, the owner, who was enthusiastic about his food and had reason to be.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Great food for the price, especially taco Tuesdays. Not so great service. The guy was really nice, but the girl who took our order acted like we were an inconvenience. I understand you are busy but with $1 tacos, what do you expect. Oh well, I can manage taking someone's attitude for a minute to be enjoy good food!"}
{"text":"Had a great burrito on my first visit, and noticed that a taco salad with flour tortilla is also on the menu.  What appeared today was a delicious salad on a giant taco shell.  I've always had a passion for these, and the Burrito Factory did not disappoint.   Such food is not even bad for me!  The taco shell is light and mostly air.  Not a fancy place, but a great lunch spot with plenty of parking and seating.    As mega-restaurants are swallowing family businesses left and right, I know that Burrito Factory would appreciate your patronage.    This is another great yelp find, as this place is the only Mexican one nearby with four solid stars.  On second visit, BF continues to amaze.  When ordering the flour tortiila for my taco salad, was told that none was available.  Then told they would make one for me in the back.  Seems that this took only 2 or 3 minutes.  Bet you can't find such great customer service at a chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is easily the best - think Chipotle, but more fresh and more options. The prices are great, the salsa bar is UNMATCHED, and the service is always friendly. We have this delivered to our office whenever possible and it is always a HUGE hit."}
{"text":"I'd rate this  3.5 if half stars were an option. The food is solid and it's certainly better than most burrito options in Charlotte but it's not as good as I was expecting based on the reviews.  You get a lot of food for your money here and for the most part, I enjoyed my burrito. However, I wasn't crazy about a lot of the sauce and salsa options and that's an important part of a burrito. They have several different hot sauces so I was initially pretty excited when I saw the salsa bar but I had trouble finding one I really liked. They all had a strange creamy taste to them and none of them were really spicy. The habanero one is the best (you have to ask for this one) but I've had better habanero sauces before. The spicy chicken on my burrito was fresh tasting and tender but it also was over salted.  In summary, it's a good place to go if you're craving a burrito but I'm not sure it lives up to the five star ratings I keep seeing."}
{"text":"11:30a on a Friday afternoon and they were closed, no sign, nothing.  Not sure if they're gone for good, but maybe... how disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and has great deals! We got some chicken burritos and some queso and they were really good. They have fresh ingredients and don't skimp. Some people said they take their time but I'm glad they did! They made sure it wasn't a soggy mess. They actually want it to taste good and seem to care about what they are serving rather than some chain restaurants. The ladies working there were really really sweet. This is our new spot for Mexican!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite burrito place. It's so fresh and the customer service is amazing. Plus the prices and portions are great. I always have left overs! My go to is the streak burrito with a side of guacamole."}
{"text":"The doors were locked but employees looking at me from inside! Open your doors when you're open Sunday at 6 :("}
{"text":"Place was great!  Burrito was overfilled and burrito bowl was delicious!  Steak and chicken were not very seasoned and the food was a tad bit bland. For that reason alone,  I'd give it 4.5 stars of i could. Great service!"}
{"text":"They have gotten better!, I love burrito factory there is a line at times because they're cooking the food fresh so for the idiots who comment under this they need to realize that it's cooked fresh to order... the food is worth it, I always get chicken tacos with a little habanero on top, and some days I get a speedy house salad. Don't listen to the negative reviews, look at the positive ones. I guarantee you, if you go you'll enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm conflicted about Burrito Factory. I'd probably give 3.5 stars if that was an option but it's not so I'm sticking with 3. There are a few things on this menu that I'd give a higher rating to. The nachos for example I really love. You can put basically anything you want on them to build your own and that's awesome!! The burritos are okay. We've tried the steak fajita, the chicken, and the california wet burritos. The first two lacked any kind of real flavor. No spices or salt or anything else appeared to have been used. However these burritos are packed full of ingredients and they don't skimp. The California wet burrito is better but again just okay. They give you salsa, and they have these other sauces. The orangeish looking sauce is my boyfriends favorite. He always wants me to order extra extra of that stuff as he can't get enough. It will save the burritos lol!! The plantains are good (hard to mess that up) and the queso is good but could use jalapenos in my opinion. We order delivery from them frequently and the poor delivery guy apparently has issues. He's really nice but sometimes I feel like he lacks awareness. He's delivered to us like 4 maybe 5 times and he still calls to ask exactly where our complex is because it doesn't show up on his GPS. I really am going to need him to update his GPS or use google maps!! However our food still always arrives pretty hot so that's a plus, the negative is my sour cream arrived melted into a soup so I just don't order it anymore lol. This place is a convenience factor for us so we'll probably continue ordering from here on occasion. I feel like if a few kinks were worked out this place could really shine."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients as you would expect with a California style burrito. This was my first time as the Burrito Factory just opened this week. I a had chicken burrito and everything was good."}
{"text":"I dare you to find a better salsa! The green salsa, the orange, and the burrito factory salsa at the salsa bar are hands down the best salsa I have ever had. I seem to always get the curry burrito (yeah sounds odd for a Mexican place) but it's a very barely there curry taste. The tofu burritos great too. The owner and servers are very kind and nice. But I'm serious...THE BEST SALSA.  I don't know why but south blvd has a large Hispanic community and horribly bad restaurants but the burrito factory is a rare gem!"}
{"text":"Lived in SoCal for 14 yrs btwn LA & SD.  This reminds me of an upscale Tijuana joint w blasting Tenants music & Univision on the TV.  Great remodel - difficult to get into if you are going north on South Blvd.  Funniest thing - I've never seen a sign that says if you are wearing a mask or hoodie don't come in.  Stale chips. I had the CA Fajita burrito - large but something just wasn't tasty maybe the peppers & onions which had no color.  My better half had the juice steak & really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Best burritos in Charlotte, they are gigantic. Must try the California Wet Burrito,  ground beef, queso, and french fries. Very nice staff, clean restaurant, and consistently fresh ingredients. Also must try the orange salsa, easily my favorite. Thursday special of $5.49 for every burrito on the menu, all day. Great chips as well. Makes me never want to go to Moe's ever again."}
{"text":"Definitely won't be back. My friend and I had the steak burrito and another friend the chicken. Steak tasted like it could've came from a can (not that it did bit could've lol).   Paid $1.25 for a little teeny thing of sour cream (takeout order). $21 total for 2 steak burritos,  fries and sour cream. Had I known before we got back home I definitely would not have put that on my tab.   Fries we're greasy...they looked burnt but didn't taste like it. My friend with the chicken burrito enjoyed it. All meals came with chips and another teeny thing of Pico de Gallo. I was so hungry I ate half of the burritto and then stopped....it was pretty bad. Granted we got there a half hour before they closed but that shouldn't be an excuse :("}
{"text":"OK, so I'm now finally convinced that The Burrito Factory makes the BEST Burrito's in Charlotte! I had to give them the final and 5th star because you just cannot help but LOVE the passion and enthusiasm of the brother/sister team who own/run/manage/work this place. They are SO nice and you can tell that they LOVE what they do and that they LOVE their food. What's NOT to love about a big burrito with very fresh ingredients that YOU choose! They'll make anything you want and the way you want it. No skimping here!  Not the fanciest place, but you get one HELL of a deal always served with a super friendly face, with yummy food. Doesn't get much better than that! People are really starting to discover this place so you may expect waits at peak times. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After Moes, Chipotle and even local joints like Phat Burrito, I have to say this place is the best burrito place in Charlotte HANDS DOWN. I've never gotten a burrito as full and thick as I have here for the price of all the other places.  Their salsas are even amazing. This place was crowded and the service was even fast.  Must try for those craving a burrito."}
{"text":"Ding Ding Ding!   We have a winner!   Forget McDonalds owned Chipotle, forget Phat Burrito and Salsaritas.  This place beats them all in price and friendly service.  And the food?   Delicious!   Great Flavors all around.  Salsa bar?  Yes please.  Fyi the medium is an americans version of HOLY SHIOT my nose is running, \"may I please have some sour cream nice sweet chica behind the counter?\"     Decor is trendy and urban. But seriously, are we here for the decor or the food?   Give me a picnic table and paper towel dispenser on the table and I am happy.    If you have any doubts, I promise they will fade promptly as soon as the counter lady says hello.  If not, then shove that awesome burrito in your mouth, shut up and enjoy.  You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a California style burrito or tacos, everything is fresh and customer service A+ all the times I been there."}
{"text":"Not much to look at from the outside, but the parking lot decor isn't as important as what is inside. I'll echo some of the other Yelpers, this place rocks! I try to skip  carbs, so I avoided the rice and bean filled burritos. I ordered a salad, and had several choices of protein. I went with the steak, which was a great choice on my part. The toppings bar took a beating, I told the woman behind the counter to load me up with all the hot stuff, especially the diced fresh jalapenos. My wife ordered a shredded pork burrito, with no hot stuff. We are the odd couple.  After receiving our meals, I headed to the vaunted salsa bar. Other places might have more choices, but few have more creative choices. Regular & spicy pico de gallo, several mild to medium salsas, and a few with some heat. My favorite was the Guarillo, a medium heat orange colored smooth salsa.   How was our meal? Que delicioso! I chose the lime mint dressing for my salad, which blended well with the flames shooting from my bowl. The only complaint I had was that the lettuce could have been cut smaller or maybe shredded. Otherwise, my salad was far better than the other Mexican places we have tried. My wife's burrito was huge, she only finished half, she took the rest home with most of her tortilla chips. I rarely give 5 stars, tbf came pretty close. Maybe if one of the staff wasn't wearing a Jets cap, they would have gotten all 5. My wife is a Jets fan, I see enough of that crap at home. We will be back."}
{"text":"Decent burritos and quesadillas. Def needed more cheese for the \"wet burrito\". Chorizo had great flavor and the queso was very good. Will try again for sure."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The chorizo was more like greasy ground beef, did not have any flavor. Tacos ans burritos are not authentic like they claim.  The employees were very nice and their salsa was delicious.  However, you are better off going to luptias getting a pound of meat and tortillas and calling it a day."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers knew my obsession with Mexican food so he recommended that I try Burrito Factory. At first when you pull up to this place it looks a little sketchy. Almost looks like an old fast food restaurant turned into a Mexican restaurant- but don't let this stop you from trying it!  On the inside they have about 10 tables, a line setup Chipotle style (order as you go) and a salsa bar! Burrito Factory also has a salsa bar with about 5 different salsas. My favorite was the green salsa, but they were all delicious. Plus, all meals come with free chips so try them all!  Now let's get to the food, I was recommended by my friend, as well as the staff, to order a burrito for my first time there. Obviously it's called Burrito Factory so it just made sense. I went basic and got the chicken burrito. I topped it with lettuce, cilantro, pico, cheese, black beans and rice. The burrito wrap was soft and held the massive burrito together nicely. The flavors of the burrito were awesome- just the right about of spice. In addition, I also ordered a side of the queso! OMG was it dynamite! It was so cheesy, but remained a great consistency while I ate it. You can also add chorizo to the queso for a slight uncharge. OR even ask them to add some chopped jalapeños to it! I loved the different options they offered for toppings and I think only the guac was extra....   In addition, on Tuesdays, all of their tacos are only $1! I mean you can't go wrong- pick from chicken, beef, chorizo, veggie or tofu. The tacos are good size- plus add a side of queso and you're golden! I have tried the tofu tacos and they are pretty darn good!! A must try- even if you are a meat eater.   For the value this place is worth it- and the food is pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"So rumors are true.... it is a little sketchy looking on the outside, but inside is a GEM! From the second we walked in we were greeted by the friendly staff behind the counter. It is clean inside and there are a few places to sit. We opted for take out.    I ordered the Tofu burrito and my husband had the steak burrito. You are able to choose from a variety of toppings such as lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, onions / peppers, and hot sauce. Now my husband always goes for the hottest sauce restaurants have, and this one was his favorite! Towards the bottom of the burrito he actually started getting red in the face .  Then, they hot press your burrito so that it stays together and nothing falls out. Huge plus! When we checked out they gave us chips with both of our burritos! Chips included.... what?!   Overall it was a great experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"$1 tacos on Tuesday, what more can I say. I've only been here for the tacos but they are great. Fresh ingredients, tasty toppings, fresh salsa bar, I'm a fan. The only downfall was when I went they were out of pork. Try their tomatillo salsa is seriously the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"No frills spot for some fantastic food. Got the curry chicken burritos with fries added. Fantastic! Screw chipotle, will be supporting this establishment moving forward. Gracias!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but unfortunately people with massive orders ruin the experience for everyone else. If you are in line and hear someone at the counter say \"I've got multiple orders\", just save yourself the trouble and leave."}
{"text":"TRASH! Their food is trash, their customer service SUCKS and the dining environment feels like you're slumming in a hood bodega! They're ALWAYS empty (NO BUSINESS) and I can see why! The only thing I can't understand is if you are always empty why does it always take you so long to prepare the food? There is absolutely no reason to dine at this establishment!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall. Cheap food that's good. Taco Tuesday = tacos $0.99. Cheese dip is good too. The restaurant is nothing fancy but a good find. :)"}
{"text":"I showed up at 1100, doors weren't opened till 1103.  When I came in I was asked to wait, it was obvious they were not ready for business yet al though sign says they open at 11am. After 10 minutes of waiting patiently I decided to leave as they were still not ready to take any orders. I was excited to eat here but the lack of professionalism and lack or customer service will def keep me from egging back to give the food a try."}
{"text":"Had high hopes. We ordered steak tacos, everything looked tasty and fresh. I got mild salsa on the side and my wife got pico.  None of it had any flavor. The steak tasted like boiled meat. The cheese might as well not have been there. The salsa was almost definitely tomato paste with cilantro. The pico was bland. The chips were also pretty flavorless.  I don't know what everyone else is eating here, but it can't possibly be what we ate. Hard pass indefinitely...  It gets an extra star because of the friendly staff and Mexican drink selection."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for work and decided to get some tacos on #TacoTuesday. When driving up to the location, it's hard to get it , had to park at the plaza next door . Not much curb appeal. Once you walk in, looks like any other TexMex place. First time here and was confused on how to order, or even where to start ! The ladies inside were nice, spoke both spanish and English.  Decided to order in spanish. They could barely hear me due to the loud music.  Got to the register, and paid $15 for 3 tacos, chips & guacamole and a soda. Like whatttttttt!!  I wouldn't complain, if the food was at least edible.  The presentation was nice but my steak tacos lacked flavor, were super wet and cold. ... the guac had absolutely no flavor. . & the chips, well they wrre soggy. . Couldn't even finish . It wasn't even worth it ."}
{"text":"99¢ tacos on taco Tuesday! Their service is great and so is their food. They can be really packed on taco Tuesday's but the line goes fast and the food still comes out just right. Also, free chips with your order!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time last Thursday which was coincidentally $5.49 for anything on the menu day, score! The language barrier while ordering does exist but not too bad. I got the chicken curry California burrito which was pretty good, a little bland but still miles above Chipotle-it amazes me how many people like that place..  Salsa bar was a nice touch but for me the only one that had any flavour was the factory hot. Habanero I believe. Even for a seaoned chili head I will give warning- take it slow. Ordered a bit too much on my burrito which I was warned of, caution to the wind I said!! Still great taste even if my eyes were watering :)  The food could use a bit more flavour but at it's price point I'm not complaining. BTW, the manager or owner-not sure is very friendly and helpful. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Terrible behavior of the employee who made my order. Got it wrong, then wrongly accused me of cheating, all the while groaning about how I was making him work harder than he usually does. Never going back! The food was average anyways."}
{"text":"Moe's on steroids.  Ordered the veggie burrito and was asked if I wanted chicken, squash or tofu. Not daring enough for the veggie chicken, I chose the squash. The burrito was made in standard fashion with a nice selection of ingredients. Shockingly, the cook in the back had sautéed fresh zucchini which was added as well. Not sure they managed to fold it up, but they did, and then heated it up in the press.  Fresh jalapeños were fresh and adequately spicy.  This was really good. Heating in the press added just a bit of texture to the exterior, which was pleasant.  Every meal is served with homemade tortilla chips and choice of mild, medium or hot salsa. The hot was a little cheesy, and not really hot, but good.  Highly recommended for burritos in the university city area. Would be 5 stars except furnishings were a little beat up and interior overall felt thrown together and unfinished.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am so addicted to this place, I'm starting to wonder exactly what they put in their sauces. I am there at least twice a week, sometimes three or four times. Due to some language barriers, it can be difficult to get your order across, so consider just going with the \"easy burrito.\" Speeds things up. Avoid Tuesdays and Thursdays because they have lunch specials, and the lines can get super-crazy. But definitely go. And go often."}
{"text":"Great FRESH Mexican food.   We ordered the curry chicken burrito (special for 4.99) and the shrimp burrito (8.49). You pick your toppings from the back side of the glass counter (like Chipotle, Salsarita's and Qdoba). It's a tiny place with small trays of toppings. They had fresh and pickled jalapenos, fresh guacamole and a few basic burrito fillers. Unlike most chains, they serve Tilapia, shrimp and tofu. You also have the choice of wheat OR flour tortilla. We were told that soon quinoa will be on the menu.    Pro's: fresh ingredients, lots of flavor, assorted salsas at the salsa bar, good value, friendly service, healthy choices (tofu and wheat tortillas). They serve burritos, tacos, salads and quesadillas. Kid's menu too.   Con's: One person working the counter (don't go if you are in a hurry), chips were thick and a little stale.   I would have given them a 5 if their chips were better, the serving size was a little bigger and the service was faster.  They just opened and will have some teething pains. I hope they make it.  Comparisons  Salsarita's = TBF had fewer choices but the food tasted better with the exception of the chips. Wish they had fajita veggies.  Love the fresh jalapenos.   Chipotle = Same as above. Service was WAY BETTER than Chipotle. TBF had smaller portions. TBF has queso and Chipotle does not.   Phat Burrito = TBF has more flavor and a more interesting menu. About the same interior size but no awkward line out the door like PB. TBF has more windows and feels cleaner. Salsa bar is better too."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of burritos in my day, and this one was exceptional. In fact, the best I've had east of the Mississippi. The employees here as a bonus were fantastic. They filled me in on everything and thanked me for coming in. I stumbled upon this place and soon realized they served the burrito of my dreams. A traditional California burrito with French fries mixed in. It sounds weird, but this is authentic SoCal style.   The two gentleman in front of me spoke no English and I saw upon entering they serve horchata. Instant legit authentic burrito joint points awarded. The interior was clean and had ample space. The hot sauce station offered a little bit of everything. Even the chips served free w/ the meal were refreshingly crisp and delicious. I could find no wrong with the Burrito Factory. What a knockout meal!"}
{"text":"Got take out on a road trip. It was oh so good. The kid's burrito was huge. Between the 3 kids they only ate about one total. Tamales were excellent.   Fish tacos and veggie tacos were worth the money. I think I'd try one of their specialty items next time."}
{"text":"I really hate to give only two stars. But there really wasn't  anything special about my one trip here. Service was good. Both people working took my order  and put the order together quickly. I was disappointed because what I ordered all tasted bland. I had a chicken quesadilla and two beef tacos. I didn't even eat one taco. It was overly greasy for my tastes. Nothing stood out, not even the chips. Maybe I was there on an off day or maybe I am missing what others seem to really like about this place. Eh, sometimes things are a miss."}
{"text":"My second time here was just as good as my first. Owner is super friendly and staff is very nice. The best thing about the food is the freshness. They definitely use fresh ingredients and you can taste the difference. The salsa bar is a must try here as we'll. This is a go to spot for lunch and bring an appetite because you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday - $1 dollar tacos. I had a spicy chicken,  beef, and pork taco and found the meat to be nothing special but the variety of fresh toppings and salsas more than made up for that. And you really can't beat solid $1 tacos with free chips."}
{"text":"Ordered this through delivery so that I could eat it the next day at lunch. Requested SPECIFICALLY no cheese because I break out into hives. My burrito was full of cheese. Awesome, now I'm hungry and itchy."}
{"text":"There is a Taco Tuesday for every preference in Charlotte and the Burrito Factory fills the niche of takeout flour tortilla, especially in the middle section of South Blvd.  $0.99 tacos with chicken, beef, or pork, plus a smattering of other fillings like cheese shredded lettuce, pico, cilantro, and others. Sour cream and guacamole are extra. Queso dip with chips and the slightly spicy special (orange) sauce are a must.  The service here is much friendlier than it necessary for such a solid deal on tacos. I've enjoyed a hearty burrito here in the past, but find that I don't veer to far from my spicy chicken tacos these days. Only thing I would change would be to use a different serving utensil for the meats so that you wouldn't have any residual liquid poured into the taco, as it makes it a bit messy. Really though, this place has it dialed in for a good Tuesday lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We picked this place solely on the good reviews --- and we were NOT disappointed! I highly recommend this place if your looking for a quick/sit down type restaurant.   The environment is definitely a dive but most dives have THE BEST FOOD! Similar to Moes and Chipotle, this places offers a massive \"wet\" California style burrito. Food is fresh and prepared to order. Reasonable priced with ongoing daily specials.   Not only is the food good, the customer service is absolutely amazing. The staff is outgoing/friendly and willing to go above and beyond to make the customer feel welcome."}
{"text":"First wrong move was getting a salad here.  I ordered the \"Bambas\" salad but then was basically asked to assemble my own salad, instead of them just putting together the pre-designed salad written on the board.  The tofu had a weird seasoning, and gross slightly-luke-warm temperature.    If I got a burrito I would obvi be more satisfied, but the line moved so slowly that I don't think my rating would have been much higher.    Bottom line: burrito or bust, and be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place on taco Tuesday since the tacos are only 1.00!!! I ordered two vegetarian tacos. The tacos were absolutely delicious they came on corn tortillas with your choices of beans and toppings!!! I also love this place because it is vegetarian friendly if you don't want meat you can get tofu which is a huge plus. You also get chips with access to the salsa bar. The chips provided to me were not so good they tasted over fried and oily the salsa bar was good though because it allows you the option to try a variety of salsas. I'm happy to say that I found a great place to grab Tacos on Tuesdays!!!!"}
{"text":"With all of the previous raves, I'm thinking that I must have visited on an 'off' night. I was in the area a couple of weeks ago and thanks to my yelp app, I saw that BF was literally a hop, skip and jump from my location. I went in and noticed that the place was empty which may have had something to do with the fact that they had a sign posted on the door stating their A/C was down (mind you, this was during one of our heat wave weeks). I looked at the menu really quickly and decided to go with the juicy chicken burrito.  What I immediately found odd was that I couldn't see any of the ingredients. I had to rely on the list that was posted on the plexi glass in front. Maybe they were keeping the ingredients covered due to the inside conditions (no A/C and all) but I was really turned off by that. I like to be able to see what I'm choosing! The guy who was working behind the counter was very friendly and made sure that I was aware of all my meal and sides options.  However, I wasn't all that satisfied with the taste of the burrito. I couldn't place the whether the 'different' taste I experienced was in the tortilla or rice but I was not a fan. I am more than willing to give this place another try and will probably stick with the tacos on my next go-round."}
{"text":"My mouth My mouth My mouth is on Fire!!!  Best Nachos in Starmount, hands down. ---------------------------------------- In my opinion the only Nachos in Starmount worth paying for.  Just speaking for myself, I leave a tip when the food is good, and maybe sometimes if the food is okay and people are working harder than I am, that's when I leave a tip. It's not a scam."}
{"text":"Went there last Sunday just to find it closed. It's way I ended up at the American burger co.  Could have been great but wouldn't know it. No signage to indicate why they were closed either"}
{"text":"It's made to order and their staff is very nice. It can be a challenge, though, for them to hear and understand with the giant fan blowing behind you when you order."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes. Go on the days they have deals! They have burrito thursdays where all burritos are like $5 and some change. The beef is a little greasy to me, but the overall flavor is real! It looks like a tiny hole in the wall, but it is so good. I recommend trying it as a lunch spot. It's similar to a moe's or chipotle in that they make it right in front of you, but the taste is better!"}
{"text":"Hiving them 5 bc its my first time going, and it was great. Awesome value and taste. Salsa aioli is great with the chips and on the taco. Highly rec"}
{"text":"Had an amazing tofu burrito, so flavorful and filling! The home style, yummier version of moes, chipotle, salsaritas. Love supporting local businesses!"}
{"text":"Not a fancy place by any means, but it doesn't have to be. I give this 5 stars because it serves its purpose, especially being so close to UNC Charlotte. There are specials almost every day, including 99 cent tacos on Tuesdays and kids eat free on Sundays! Also, the owners seem to be great!"}
{"text":"I Love Burrito Factory! We used to go every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday! Had to slow down. Have to watch my waist and my pocket! Lol Check them out! You won't be disappointed. Everything on the menu from taco's to queso is delicious! The staff and the owner are very friendly as well. Oh yeah, do not leave without some orange sauce! Thebomb.com!"}
{"text":"Really surprised at how nice this place was. I expected a dump and got a very pleasant first impression. Inside looks a lot like Chipotle, although nothing will ever beat Chipotle's burritos in my very biased mind. They had interesting toppings so you can choose a Mexican or American style wrap. Their salsa bar was cool, although I didn't really care for any of their salsas. I think one of them was actually a little rancid but it didn't turn me off to the experience as a whole for some reason. I got the chicken burrito special which came with chips for only $4.99. Can't beat that! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has the best burritos ever. I got the Wet burrito and it was beyond delicious. Everything was very fresh and they give a good amount of chips with each burrito. The cashier was also very friendly. The parking lot is very small so if you see a spot don't assume there is one closer to the door."}
{"text":"I've been looking around Charlotte for a good, Mission-style (as in, San Francisco Mission District) burrito.  I thought that the best Charlotte had to offer was its many chain restaurants  with flavorless offerings.  The Burrito Factory on South Blvd is my eureka moment.  Their burritos are huge and flavorful; the rice is good and moist as it should be, and not dry, hard and crumbly.  Jesus I think I will head there for lunch now -- that will make it three visits in one week."}
{"text":"DON'T GO ON TUESDAY! I've been here multiple times and have had some great experiences and some terrible ones. All three of my terrible ones have all been on Tuesdays when they do Taco Tuesday. On that day the service goes down dramatically, lines are long, food is sub-par, and they are consistently out of their most popular items. Do yourself a favor and go on another day when they are doing their best."}
{"text":"So good!! I think this is my favorite burrito/taco place in town.. Traditional Southern California burritos.. Beef w fries? Yes!! Try the curry chicken burrito it is so good.. Fresh and the salsa bar is killer.. They have juices too.. 5 stars all the way.."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give them 0 stars I would! Worst delivery service ever! Took them 2 hours and I only ordered 2 burritos some cheese dip and chips and their dessert. When they get here (2 hrs later) he didn't even have the cheese dip so he gave me 2 coca colas instead and on top of that the chocolate that was on the dessert spilled all over the inside of the bag! Needless to say I will never order from here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped into the Burrito Factory for a quick bite.   I love Mexican food and always are looking for the next great burrito.   Had seen all of the reviews and was intrigued.     We had the Al Pastor and the Shrimp Burrito.  The Shrimp was freshly made and had good flavor.   The Al Pastor was good.  I guess that I was expecting more.   The burritos also come with chips and salsa.  We tried both the mild and medium sauces.   I thought the the mild was better but both good.    Overall it was a good experience and would return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"So my friend and I had a craving for some Chipotle but the line was ridiculous. I then turned to Yelp to look up other places to satisfy our hankering for burritos and it led me here. Happened to be taco Tuesday so most tacos were .99 each. I am blown away that I haven't heard of this place sooner. I will be back and will probably end up frequenting this place weekly. Phenomenal service and incredible food. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAY!!!! Best tacos around. The guy working (cannot remember his name to save my life) is so sweet and works very hard! He always has a positive attitude and smile on his face! I love this gem of a taco place"}
{"text":"Totally unassuming from the street but the inside is remodeled and awesome. Food was fabulous and the staff was also great. Will defiantly be back. They offer delivery which is a always a bonus."}
{"text":"Love love. The people here are so very nice. I like the small salsa bar. The sauces are amazing."}
{"text":"Looking for fast lunch in south Charlotte that wasn't \"Fast-Food\" chain and found Burrito Factory.   Wow! Huge serving and under $10.   It's similar to the Moe's/Chipotle/Qdoba format but more authentic and flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is great!  They have this salsa that is heaven in your mouth.  Strange orange color but oh so good!  Tacos were very good and they have a good topping selection.  I can't say enough about the great service.  The owner greeted us when we walked in and checked on us during our meal.  I really hope this place succeeds.  They have a good thing going."}
{"text":"They have good beverage choices here such as the Horchata drink. I ordered the veggie and fish tacos. I liked the veggie tacos better than the fish tacos. They give you a lot of toppings except they charge extra for the sour crème and the guacamole. They also have the salsa bar. The staffs are super nice. Plenty of parking in the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place!  You order burritos with whatever ingredients you choose. I got a burrito with guacamole, tomatoes, corn, lettuce, onion and ground beef - everything was fresh and delicious. I also ordered a side of the plantains which were also amazing. Everyone was very helpful.  I don't usually like burritos but this place definitely changed my mind."}
{"text":"Huge portion!  Fresh and filling burrito. Prepared in front of you!   Had the quest and chips.  Nice and creamy.   I definitely will return!"}
{"text":"This was really good!! Much better than I expected! I had the spicy chicken burrito, better than chipotle and qdoba! All fresh ingredients and they were happy that we were there! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Heard good stuff about the burrito factory. I was in the area getting my car detailed so I decided hey why not $.99 tacos as ever ties on the sign so I would walk over and have a taco or two while waiting for my car to finish. Entering the Stabley Schomann it was neat and clean with a taco bar there's a sign post that said exception $.99 tacos only on Tuesdays. This was not a Tuesday so I decided to order a taco anyway. They don't have hardshell tacos so I ordered a softshell taco with fish and lettuce and tomato jalapeño sauce, and a few other toppings. The softshell taco, stuck to the plastic wrap they put the taco. I will give the taco itself a 7 out of 10.  OK experience I may come back and try something different next time."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the best tacos ever. We came here on Taco Tuesday (99 cents) plus .30 each topping and ordered 6.Loaded with flavor and the brother that made our tacos is a Taco Jedi. His detail game is boss. We will be back here chowing down on a regular.  The Chipotle Chicken Taco is a plus. This is my third week coming so they are doing a lot of things right"}
{"text":"The people who work here are super nice and the veggie burrito is SOOOOO GOOD! Zucchini, kale, squash, feta, omg I love it! So glad a burrito spot by my house is this delicious!"}
{"text":"Here's all you need to know about Burrito Factory in two words: Taco Tuesdays. Fresh-made, delicious tacos with your choice of fillings for a buck apiece, and they aren't skimpy with the ingredients. Choose from chicken, spicy chicken, marinated pork or ground beef (if you're boring) protein, and a plethora of toppings.  Being my predictable self, I go for the heat with spicy chicken, diced jalapenos, hot pico de gallo, queso fresco, lettuce, salsa, fresh cilantro and cheese. Skip the .75 extra guacamole in favor of the addictively sweet heat of their creamy green tomatillo sauce, free on the self-serve bar. Seriously, it's so good I always take some home in the little clear containers. Oh yeah, free salsa and chips with every order. Since it's so good and prices are so cheap, please also bless the tip jar and go home happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"A true hidden gem! This place is authentic fresh food at a great price! The atmosphere is completely chill. The service was fast & friendly. Try the California style chicken curry burrito! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to eat here at first because it looked like just another typical Americanized Mexican fast food restaurant, but the food is much more interesting than the name implies.   The burritos here are huge and very filling, and they seem to be closer to the traditional San Francisco Mission style than the generic Chipotle style. They have unusual (to me) toppings like al pastor, pickled onions, French fries, and a very spicy hot sauce. I usually stick with the al pastor, but last time I tried the wet burrito, which was even better. I only tried the tacos once, and was not impressed."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! They're so friendly, the food is good, reasonably priced and super fresh ingredients. They don't go light on meat or toppings like most places do! We are now regulars!"}
{"text":"The prices are really reasonable.  The 90.5 rating by the health department was concerning.  The service was slooooooooooow.   The most important part is the food though.... and it was good enough to go back again.  I had the California wet burrito - which means it has cheese sauce and French fries on it as well as your choice of protein.  It was filling and I left happy.    My biggest complaint is that the French fries weren't crisp - they had sat for too long on the fryer."}
{"text":"I have been to burrito factory for taco Tuesday and it has yet to disappoint. 99 cent tacos!!!! Where else in Charlotte can you get this cheap of tacos? Let me know because I'd love to find the competitor and see if it even comes close to competing with burrito factory.   Be aware, Tuesday's do tend to get busy. There may be a long line but they are very time efficient and it usually goes pretty fast. It's set up like a taco buffet, two things I cannot resist! They have every topping you can think of and the choice of chicken, spicy chicken, pork, or beef-all delicious. Your tacos come with chips so no need to order extra! The size of the tacos may seem small,  but don't be fooled, once you have the toppings and chips, you will be more than satisfied! I have not tried anything other than the taco Tuesday deal but the whole menu looks really good and definitely worth trying!   The staff are sooo friendly, especially the first guy you hit who asks how many tacos you want. He is constantly smiling and can't help but put a smile on your face too.   Burrito factory is a little bit down south boulevard but worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"yesterday was my first time coming to the burrito factory and i am so glad i did. it was taco tuesday with .99 cents taco. Everything was extremely fresh and the staff was friendly. I will definitely have to come earlier because they ran out of a few items but i did come 30 mins before close. cant wait till next tuesday"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a bunch of times and always resolved to try it, but didn't get the chance until yesterday.  I actually checked its reviews on Yelp which helped solidify my decision to check it out after a long and painful meeting at my credit union.  Anyway, I got the chicken curry burrito and a fish taco, and my girlfriend got two veggie tacos and an order of fried plaintains.  I got a normal fountain drink and she got horchata which I took a sip of and it was quite tasty.  My burrito was excellent.  They have a ton of options to add, so I tried pickled red onions, hot salsa, shredded cheese, iceberg lettuce, and diced hot peppers (not sure which kind of pepper, coloring seemed like a mix of jalapenos and Thai chiles) to go along with the curry chicken, black beans, and (delicious) seasoned rice that came standard.  On the fish taco I got some more of the diced hot peppers, raw red onion, hot salsa, corn, and diced cucumber.  Both the burrito and the taco were delicious.  I was shocked that I actually even preferred the taco, which surprised me because it contained tilapia, which is a relatively bland fish, but everything else I added worked perfectly with the well-cooked, tender fish.  The burrito was also excellent but I ate the taco first and had a hard time finishing it because it's very large - think Qdoba-sized.  I really appreciated how they briefly pressed it in the tortilla steamer which helped keep it coherent and added a slight bit of crispness.  Their prices are very reasonable and we will certainly be back.  The only thing that detracted from the experience (but not so much as to knock it down from a 5-star rating) was the ordering process, which was a bit chaotic as they had two line workers handing off between helping us and preparing takeout orders so it could be a little confusing at times.  The gentleman working the register was very courteous and warmly greeted everyone who walked through the door.  Overall it was fantastic and I can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"Yummy! Went on a Thursday and everything on the menu was 5.99. Everyone was really nice and gave great recommendations. Get there early because the guacamole runs out! Best burritos in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"My husband and I spent the day in Charlotte last week.  Apparently my husband had bookmarked this place.  I'm so glad he did.  It was a little scary at first.  There wasn't anyone in the parking lot, it looked desolate.  It was 11:30 and we had just beat the lunch rush.  Right after we ordered and sat down, it got busy.  They don't have anything labelled Gluten Free (GF).  When I asked, they were more than happy to accomodate.  They made me a bowl, a steak burrito without the tortilla, not on the menu.    We were fortunate to also get to meet Isaac.  He made sure we were satisfied with food and service.  Zero complaints....thanks for the great lunch!"}
{"text":"We liked the food and the people.   We couldn't find the napkins which is hidden off to the side of the restaurant. Odd.   We enjoyed the pork burrito and veggie burrito.  I really liked that they cooked the zucchini and squash fresh in front of me. They had a variety of salsa to choose from.   We also enjoyed the like and mandarin natural sodas. The lime was better than mandarin."}
{"text":"This is one of the few options near our apartment (other than pizza and Chinese) that will deliver to us. We have ordered from them three times, and I still have not been impressed. The rice is not seasoned and it should be because the majority of the burrito is rice. They are very sparing with the beans and the chicken.   Last time we ordered from them (estimated wait time of 30-40 minutes) the driver called 50 minutes after placing our order to say he couldn't find the address in his GPS and was still at the restaurant. When he finally did arrive the cheese fries we had ordered were cold and the queso was congealed."}
{"text":"Had the California wet burrito, it was fantastic.  Fresh food, quick and very polite service.  Will be back"}
{"text":"This place looks like a total hole in the wall, but it is really good.  Everything seemed so fresh and made to order.  The salsa varieties were excellent and quantities are large enough for two meals."}
{"text":"I literally signed up for Yelp just to review this place, because I was so disappointed and am hoping for answers from the establishment. The employees were very friendly - although overwhelmed, and the one salsa available at the \"salsa bar\" wasn't terrible. Because of the food though, this place deserves a 1.   I'd been so excited to try this place forever - I always drive by it. Today I saw a \"tacos 1$ Tuesday\" sign and decided it was the day. I stood in line, got my food, and the result was underwhelming to say the least. I am so saddened by the food, I don't understand how the reviews are so positive! Maybe it was an off day, I don't know.   The vegetables (pico de Gallo and corn) were fresh but not ripe enough, aka pretty tasteless. I ordered two bean and veggie tacos, and was charged full price as \"veggie tacos are not part of the deal.\" This didn't make sense to me, considering meat is more expensive than some lettuce and corn. It would've been nice to have a note or a warning made b4 I chose that option. Just a note, because overall the employees were super friendly and made the visit almost worth it.   I also got a salad with chicken, and to my horror, apparently the only option is shredded chicken? Like the oily, putrid lunch meat shredded chicken in greasy red tasteless oil. Is there an option for grilled chicken?   Thirdly, the salsa bar was non existent.   I ended up eating my non-grilled, cold tacos out of starvation and trying to pick at lettuce from my disappointing salad. (It should be noted, the shredded chicken meat was so foul and so mixed in that the taste permeated the entire salad and I had to throw it away. I couldn't eat any of the veggies without tasting foul chicken.)  I hope to try this place again and see if it's better. At the moment though I really feel cheated out of my $.   Sorry, Burrito Factory. I wish I would've enjoyed it. I've eaten at Mexican and South American and Central American joints all over Charlotte and beyond. I love everything from Qdoba to Sabor to authentic food trucks on the side of the S Blvd. My family even owned a popular Latin restaurant here b4 selling it to retire.   So, I don't know what palette Burrito Factory is catering to, but if you tend to like authentic and tasty burritos or tacos... or yummy taco salads, this isn't the place :( ."}
{"text":"Would you like some fries with that? Sure, why not put them in the burrito. Huh? Actually, it's a grand idea. I mean usually at a burrito place you get chips - and you do here as well - but they actually put the fries inside. Who ever thought of such nonsense? I don't know, but they are a freaking genius.  The decor at the factory is not going to win any prizes, but let's face it - you aren't here for the decor. It's all about the food. And chances are, you probably aren't here for a holiday meal anyway. As you are across the parking lot from a couple of drinking establishments, it may be after you've had a few, so you just want to stuff your pie hole, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  Saunter up to the register and order your burrito, get the fries on the inside, add whatever other toppings you like and gorge yourself. One word of advice: It's better when you eat it there. Leftovers are not so tasty (many things are not in the harsh light of day). Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"This place was a great for a  lunch date. The line was kinda long but understandable since the orders are made to order.  Had the California wet burrito and it was amazing. Hubby had the fish tacos and already asked when we will be back. Definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"First things first- they offer a 15% discount for UNCC students with their student ID. The menu boasts quesadillas, tacos, taco salads, and burritos. I'm surprised they don't have nachos. On Tuesdays they have taco Tuesdays - tacos are 99 cents. On Thursday's all menu items are 5.49. I went here on a Monday and it was slow. I will say that I love the Mexican rice. Portions are huge as u can see from the pictures. There is more than enough to share a burrito. They have a verde and a red sauce. They are delicious. Your meal comes with chips. I wish they had a chips and salsa option on the menu. Just a warning that the ground beef is rather greasy and I think I will try the steak next time. The staff was really nice and the portions are extremely generous. I will be back for sure. Check this out next time you are in the area!"}
{"text":"The owners were nice and the serving size was great. The best burrito is the one with the fish and plantains in it.  Make sure you get the plantains because one night, as they were assembling the large burrito, they failed to tell me they had run out until it was too late.  But they offered free queso dip.  The salsa dips on the side don't range far in variety but its enough.  It's fine since we just loaded up on the fresh condiments that come with.  For the budget-friendly, Tuesdays are $1 tacos and Thursdays have a discounted any-burrito price!  Don't mind the exterior, just come on in"}
{"text":"Not bad. The prices are decent. I feel like my burrito could have been better. But I've only been there once so I'm not gonna give up on it. I wanna try it again. My daughter was satisfied and she doesn't eat much so that was a plus."}
{"text":"I went during lunch on Tuesday. They open at 11 and I got there around 11:45. There were already a good amount of people in line. The line moved at a decent pace. The food was very fresh and they have a good variety of toppings. One thing I dislike is that they don't have any salsas to add to your food. You can buy the little cups of salsa if you want for 35 cents. Guacamole is also extra (about $1.00), but it is very good. I would definitely go again. The prices are excellent!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our vegan burritos and the salsa bar.  I'd like to have seen the salsas marked with either ingredients or letting us know if the one was vegan friendly but it was no big deal.  It took five minutes or so for them to make our tofu but the man was extremely apologetic about it and offered us drinks and chips while we waited.  We'll be back, it was tasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place...you have got to support this restaurant! Owner is there everyday and super awesome. He puts real pride into his business and providing the freshest ingredients. Try the tacos in every option...and the salsas have got to be some of the best around!"}
{"text":"In a former life, I lived near Montford and I would drive past this place all the time without giving it a second thought. Thank God for Yelp. 4.5 stars strong? I had to come see what all the fuss is about.  Dollar tacos on Tuesdays? Yes please! They do beef, pork, and chicken options for the special. I went with two spicy chicken and a beef. Sidenote: the woman in front of me got a salad. Listen honey, you're doing Tuesdays wrong. I love the long laundry list of toppings you can choose from here. I can't really think of anyone else who does this. I was really impressed by the size of the tacos. At a lot of places, a Taco Tuesday special is pretty skimpy. Not here. My tacos were loaded.   Another bonus: THEY HAVE A SALSA BAR!! You know my motto, all places should have a salsa bar. Hell, I would put one in my living room if my roommate would let me. Wonder what she would do if she came home one night to find a salsa bar in place of the coffee table? My tacos came with free chips, so I was super happy to try #allthesauces.   It was pretty warm in there for lunch, but it was 103 degrees outside. Every place in Charlotte is warm right now in this heatwave. I didn't mind it a bit. I enjoyed eating my lunch alone and watching all the action in the restaurant. All the workers were really nice. There was a pretty steady stream of people coming in and out for lunch.   I don't live near here anymore, but I will definitely be coming back. It's well worth the drive. My only regret is that I never gave this place a chance sooner. However, that may be a good thing or else I would weigh 300 pounds.  Kudos, Burrito Factory. I really dig what you guys are doing here."}
{"text":"I live near The Burrito Factory and naturally I stopped in for Taco Tuesday to grab some dollar tacos and they were great! I always get spicy chicken tacos which are nicely favored, the topping are fresh. The staff is very friendly.    Bonus: The Salsa bar with great tasting salsa and other sauces for the tacos.   You can't go wrong with Dollar Spicy Chicken tacos and a Pineapple Jarritos."}
{"text":"I came on a Sunday afternoon and the employees were very friendly. My burrito was prepared quickly and it was quite huge and delicious and not pricey.Great addition for food choice in the area and I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is clutch..99 cent tacos...very fresh...nachos and salsa all great"}
{"text":"I had the burrito al pastor.  Disappointing, as it's 95% rice.  Also, I didn't care for the pork, what there was of it, seriously loose the pineapple."}
{"text":"Delicious! Well flavored, huge portion - it was great! Im not sure exactly which one I had, my husband picked it up for me and said he got me the Choriqueso Burrito but it had shredded pork or something in it instead of the ground beef, so I dont really know what I had. I didn't taste the queso in it but my husband insists he watched them put it in it. But they filled it up with lots of toppings. Took me 2 hands to eat it - my husband ended up with some of it, huge burrito! The queso dip was my fave, it had a little spice/flavor, not really spicy, but it had a little something that made it pretty great. I tend to like light, flaky chips and these were just your normal chips like everywhere so not my fave but they were all I needed to devour the queso dip! Lots of salsa options too. I would go here over Chipotle anyday!"}
{"text":"Really  good... I like the freshly stewed meats for the burritos, u won't leave there hungry. People were nice and the bar had great sauces and limes cut in halves .. I'll be back, thanks Burrito Factory. I like the choice of the pineapple juice in the fountain drink area. I got the carne fresh off the stove , girlfriend got the pastor stewed pork and it was really tasty."}
{"text":"First off let me say that this is a perfect location for a restaurant such as this one. Located on North Tryon St. behind UNC Charlotte, this Tex Mex gem is a must visit.   Their meat options are full of flavor and the toppings are fresh. I get a bit overwhelmed just thinking about the flavor profiles and the different combinations that can be created when they are putting together your tacos or burrito. They also have a house made salsa, as well as a tomatillo and guaillo sauce. I personally love the guaillo one. It's got a nice kick to it, and goes great on the side or in your dish of choice. All of their tacos, burritos, and quesadillas come with chips on the side.  The workers there are very nice. This location has only been open about a month, but I must say the management did a great job with training their staff.  Overall, I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a unique Tex-Mex experience."}
{"text":"Its nothing amazing. The only amazing thing about this place is that each time I wanted to eat there, they were close and that made this place to be saved under my bookmarks. I tried it and...meh! When you are in this part of town, I suggest you go to another Mexican place to eat. The prices are OK, the food is OK, the service is wonderful, the environment not the greatest to look at. So, yeah..pretty much not a charmer. However, I am still interested to see how the $1 Taco night are. So, I will be returning on a Tuesday night and maybe I might change my mind and add or possibly even reduce the rating by a star. But one thing is clear, the owners or if they are not the owners and rather workers, are def. trying their best and are super friendly."}
{"text":"Meh.  I was excited to try this place but came away disappointed. I had the California Wet Burrito and found it to be on the bland side. Service was quick, burritos were huge and well-made, I just wasn't feeling the flavors. For what it's worth, my fiance enjoyed his burrito.  With all the rave reviews, I'll probably give this place another shot someday."}
{"text":"Very solid burritos here. I usually get a burrito bowl it is a really huge portion especially if you opt for the bowl variety.  Do your self a favor if you like shrimp try the chipotle shrimp burrito.  It is the absolute truth.."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food!  The burritos are huge and so flavorful.  The chicken juice burritos with chipotle chicken are off the chain.  Tried the fish tacos, omg delicous!  Fresh talapia, with pico, lettuce, and cheese.  Great daily specials so you can try something new each time you visit.  The staff is always super friendly.  One of my favorite spots if Ian heading to or from uptown on south Blvd."}
{"text":"Cucumber in the Pico is what gets me. Also, if your sign says all menu items are x price, don't wait and tell us it's only chicken and beef when paying."}
{"text":"Hello Friends,   The Burrito Factory is a South Side Staple in the community. Great service. Fast Service. Good quality toppings, meats, chips, etc. The last i was there they had a sign saying \"We apologize for the inconvenience but we are installing a new AC unit\". It was hot as heck in there and it was still people dining in and ordering take out. Food MUST be good for people to take that kinda heat inside a building.   Tuesday is 99 cent day Thursday is One Price day $7.49 (I believe)   The different sauce that you can get with your meal are great. From mild to hot. I like this place, you go for yourself and i think you will as well.   Go Enjoy,  TTFN"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I LOVE Mexican food & this was a pleasant surprise of a find! So many fresh toppings to choose from. Seafood items are cooked to order and the flavors are amazing! Also the prices are great. Taco Tuesday boasts 99¢ tacos & $5.49 burritos on Thursdays. I absolutely recommend! I've already been 3x!"}
{"text":"Great experience for a simple burrito spot. Great service, excellent food, & nice salsa bar."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a chicken burrito so we yelped (lol) a spot. We read good reviews so we decided to give this place a chance. OMG! The food was delicious. The burrito was so big we couldn't eat it in one sitting. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We love coming here, the food is delicious and the staff are all friendly. we aren't vegetarian but we always order the veggie burrito. It comes with freshly cooked squash and kale and it's so yummy. What I love about this place over a Chipotle or something is the toppings. Feta, pickled onions, olives, etc. you can really make a yummy unique burrito. Also really love their guajillos salsa. They have a very spicy version behind the bar as well as the mild one they serve on the side with chips. Its the best thing about this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's better than most of the chain burrito places and has some ingredients you won't find just anywhere. The guy behind the counter was a bit chatty but he ended up giving us some free authentic soup I would've never known about had he not talke"}
{"text":"Being a So Cal native now living in Charlotte I can confirm that this really is California style Mexican food. Everything is fresh and made from scratch. If you are looking for Chipotle or Salsaritas  - then go there, this is what a real Mexican burrito tastes like! Now - if only Charlotte had a beach..."}
{"text":"I got the \"wet\" burrito from there. It was terrible. Also the first time I had French fries on a burrito. The salsa bar.....only one kind had any flavor whatsoever. The Pico de Gallo was basically chopped vegetables, no lime juice or even salt. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food love Taco Tuesdays. However the last time I went I ordered plantains. I was so excited to eat them. Once I got home I noticed they were so burnt. Tried to mask the taste but ended up throwing them away. A waste of $4. So I definitely will open my food up there before I leave. Made a great food taste horrible."}
{"text":"OMG! The burritos are huge and delicious. Excellent tacos too. Their guajillo salsa is excellent on the al pastor burrito. Their beef burrito is super savory. All around awesome."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for awhile so on a recent cheat night, we went here for a quick dinner. It's definitely not fancy inside but it was pretty clean, which is the first thing I look for. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by super friendly and helpful staff who helped me with recommendations. I opted for the California Wet Burrito with chicken. The portion was huge and I couldn't finish it all. Definitely a great bang for your buck. The only two things that kept this from being five stars were the chips (kinda stale to me) and the mini-cup I was given when I ordered water (this is a personal pet peeve of mine -why can't I get the same size cup for my water that others get for soda?).   Overall, this was a solid spot and we will be back."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about the Burrito Factory:   It's clean, the food is fresh, the workers are very nice, they have a television inside, there's a salsa bar, the nacho chips are yummy, they have a cooler full of Jarritos and the Coca-Cola made with cane sugar (it's better than our stuff), they deliver, there's space inside to eat as well, their beans and rice will make you want to throw something because they're just that good, they have daily specials...   Most importantly, you will never be disappointed. Seriously. Just go."}
{"text":"Oh, how I wish Chip Nutty had worked out (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chip-nutty-cookies-charlotte), but alas, it wasn't in the cards. Instead we get The Burrito Factory. I usually select local, one-store, type businesses over the chain ones for two reasons, to support local business and because they are usually fresher, better and made with more love than those chain factories.  Unfortunately, The Burrito Factory didn't have that local feeling I was looking for. Now, their food is NOT bad by any stretch of the imagination. But there really wasn't any real flavor or soul to speak of. My burrito was very bland despite the fact that I added nearly everything they had to offer. My mother ordered a couple of tamales and they literally just plop two tamales on a place and put some weird cheese-base sauce over them. Nothing else... That's not how you serve tamales.  The day we went they had a local Latin radio station truck outside, which is how we noticed the place and decided to stop. Unfortunately, aside from what looked like an excessive number of servers and what I think was one of the owners and his buddies, there was nobody there but us.   Their menu is simple and has some good offers. One of the cool features is their salsa bar, which has some very unique salsas you usually don't see anywhere else.  Not a bad place to eat, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"If I don't come here for Taco Tuesday, my whole week is shot. The California style  burritos and tacos, the fresh salsas, and the aguas frescas keep me coming back at least once a week. It's delicious, fast, and cheap, with friendly staff who will remember your order if you're a regular, even though the place does a lot of business."}
{"text":"The place is amazing and one of my go to spots for lunch during the work week. The food is fresh the staff is nice but you better get there early before the lunch time rush.   They offer taco specials daily, burritos, salads, quesadillas, and a nice kids menu. You have options in meat but also tofu which is great. The pricing is amazing for the amount of food you get most expensive is approximately $9 and trust me you will be full to the brim."}
{"text":"Save yourself the trip and go to Chipoltle or even Taco Bell! This place is way overcrowded and not worth the wait. I ordered 6 tacos on taco Tuesday and my date had a steak burrito. I had 2 of each (chicken, pork, and ground beef) and the chicken was good beef was ok and the pork was inedible. The salsa bar was nice but not enough chips. My dates burrito was overlooked for steak. Also just for sour cream is an extra .50 cent! Most places don't charge extra for that!! Will not return due to price and quality. Overall bad experience with some below average food. Next time will get a quesorita at Taco Bell and save 10$!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The owners and staff are very nice and the food is outrageously delicious! All the ingredients are fresh, like just chopped kinda freshness! The burritos are MASSIVE! So delicious. Just get here, and quickly."}
{"text":"My first time visting. pleasantly surprised. Will try again. Burrito good. Place was clean and prices reasonable. Got the steak burrito lunch special and came tortilla chips and sauce bar. Yum."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just recently moved here from the west coast and have been searching for burritos like home! Factory burrito has the best burritos in the whole Charlotte area! Sam, the owner stayed open an extra 30minutes just so we could get from Concord to Charlotte an enjoy burritos for dinner. Amazing owner, amazing staff, an amazing food!! My girlfriend and I recommend the wet California burrito you can not go wrong! Thank you Sam we will see you again soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken curry burrito.  Very bland flavor.  Ingredients was definitely fresh and salsa bar was very good."}
{"text":"Love this place. It is right next to my house so we frequent regularly. Highly recommend the Beef tacos (not a beef person, but these beef tacos are unreal). They also do a great job keeping the food fresh and letting you add whatever/and as many toppings you want at no additional charge. Taco Tuesday is an awesome deal - we had 6 tacos with guac and were out of there paying around $10 total. great service, convenient salsa bar and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Not actually open till 9 pm on Sunday's. The sign on the door says otherwise but I was informed by an employee that they in fact close at 6pm on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Nope, not a dancing burrito but \"The Burrito Fatory\"  will leave you dancing out of the establishment. This place stands out on South Blvd where there is a surplus of Tex-Mex and California style food establishments. This is a usual quick lunch spot for me. On Tuesdays they have 99 cent tacos and they have a massive burrito which will rival any Moe's or Qudoba burrito. Unlike chain restaurants The Burrito Factory actually sells fish and tofu, plus different types of tortillas. The salsa bar here is 2nd to none in Charlotte, The downfall about The Burrito Factory is that their chips are harder than what I'm sure anyone is use to, though they may pile them up with whatever you order they should really work on that recipe.  The Manager/Owner is very cool and hip to what's going on. Overall if your looking for a Big Ass Burrito at a great price and your on the South side of Charlotte you have to stop by The Burrito Factory."}
{"text":"So, The Burrito Factory is located on South Blvd. and can be missed if you are not paying attention. Although the outside is somewhat blah, the interior is clean and designed with a somewhat trendy feel & TV for your enjoyment. Upon arrival, we were a little confused at the layout, where to order (being the only ones there), but was questioned by the cook  who stepped out behind the counter. We ordered one chicken burrito & one chicken quesadilla w/ chips & guacamole. Being there is only one cook, things do move a little slow, but everything is fresh & you select you additional items from behind the counter, that included cheese, lettuce, jalapeños, onions, etc. We paid and hit the salsa bar, which offered a variety of flavors. Although others Yelpers enjoyed, we thought some were a little too hot, too bland, etc. nothing seemed to hit the perfect mark. And, the soda machine offered no ice, so the owner/manger took our cups to the back to fill with ice, strange.  However, the food & chips arrived fresh, hot and were delicious. The chicken burrito had rice & beans, along with the additions and was great. The chicken quesadilla was just as good. Both fresh chicken, great rice & beans! I did enjoy the guacamole, but do wish I enjoyed the salsa as much.   I would love to give them a 3.5, but that is not an option. I will be back, knowing how things work, but recommend to those first timers, don't be in a rush & try everything.."}
{"text":"Better than chipotle! The chicken is juicy and flavorful. Large portions and fresh selection options. Staff very nice and it's affordable! Got a huge burrito chips and salsa and a large drink for 10$!!"}
{"text":"Had for lunch in Friday for the first time. Delivered to our business. Late then forgot one of my colleagues' salads. When we called to ask that they bring it, they didn't even consider it and instead just said they would refund the money for the salad. Not acceptable.   The food was okay. The chicken burrito is undoubtedly one of the biggest I've eaten. But it was pretty dry and was mostly filled with rice - which I like but is not what I want my chicken burrito filled up with. The chips were good and my colleagues were all relatively happy with their food too. But not enough to worry about ordering there again."}
{"text":"I am a big chipotle fan, and this place is better! Better service, clean place and the food is so fresh and delicious. You can taste each flavor and ingredient. The avocado, the unique cali style burritos, the quesadilla, fantastic. I highly recommend this place for lunches. And it's even cheaper than chipotle!"}
{"text":"A local spin off Chipotle, this place was fast and delicious!  We ordered the Nachos and California Style Fish burrito to split. I have to admit this was my first fish burrito and I loved every bite of it. It had grilled tilapia, plantains, cheese, jalapenos and guacamole. Made to order. I put a little bit of everything on the nachos with extra cheese sauce. We were stuffed before we could finish our meals.  Best part of Burrito Factory is their sauces/salsas. All meals seem to come with their signature medium sauce. I upped the ante and got their habanero salsa (a must if you love spicy). Great spot for lunch, not too far off the beaten path from Southend. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"New favorite lunch location. Sam is great and willing to do whatever it takes for his costumer to love the experience. Chips are pretty good, could be a little warmer. Very friendly staff. Very fresh and healthy burrito toppings.   I usually get the burrito on special or .99 cent tacos on Tuesday. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Along the stretch of road that we Charlotteans call \"Burrito Way\" is of course, the Burrito Factory (which shall be referenced as BF). A shining star in a desert of Central American \"burrito special with rice and beans for $5.95\" restaurants.  A bit like the Californian burrito joints that have gone mainstream like Chipotle and Moe's, BF has a menu board of various meats and recipes already put together, but this is America and if you want to add or remove, you go right ahead.  I opted for the Curry Chicken Burrito and asked for extra tomatoes and onions. It was extremely tasty. For my wife, I got their veggie burrito with extra cilantro and she absolutely loved it.  Chips were great - maybe a little thicker than I like. Salsa bar was decent. The pico de gallo was really great - not hot at all. Yum.  I wish this place every success!"}
{"text":"We stopped by The Burrito Factory for lunch based on all the reviews we read. I got one each of the fish, chicken, & steak tacos. The fish tacos aren't part of the Taco Tuesday deal, but I still wanted to try it. I have to say it was my favorite. The spicy chicken was not spicy at all. The steak taco wasn't as flavorful as I would have expected & had a strong flavor of I believe cilantro (but I could be wrong in that). I topped my tacos with guacamole, pico de gallo, & sour cream. I did like the green & orange sauces I received to go on the tacos. All of the staff were friendly and there was no wait time. I'm giving 4 stars because although not as flavorful as I expected the tacos weren't terrible and I would return to try out one of the burritos."}
{"text":"Probably 3.5 stars but hey what with the great service I had, in the really really fresh salsa ingredients I rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"This place is very wonderful , you can select from various choice from the menu ,I only tried few items on the menu and so far I had great meals.they have specials on Tuesday and Thursday."}
{"text":"Part of me wants to keep this place a secret but it wouldn't be right to hide it from the public. These are the best burritos in town and possibly one of the best burritos I have ever had. Try the carnitas. They also have great specials. Clean, nice staff, burritos made with love."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Burrito Factory, especially the shrimp burrito.  Service is great and the staff are extremely pleasant!"}
{"text":"Not great but ok. 90 on their food service score. Service was super slow. The guys working seemed very nice and friendly just took forever to get through the line. Food was not worth the wait"}
{"text":"Finally got to try the Burrito Factory for the first time the other day.... I see why people rave about it now.  For a [Taco] Tuesday, they had a steady flow of customers, but never really a huge line out the door, unlike some other (cough, cough) places.  99 cent tacos only applies to chicken, pork, or beef tacos, but I had a regular priced fish taco that was super tasty.  Also tried the chorizo queso dip with chips... I can probably eat through a bucket of that stuff and die a happy person.... just don't open up the coffin anytime soon...  The restaurant itself is nothing glitzy... the focus is on tasty food that only sticks around a little bit cause people keep consuming it so fast.  I want to say the place has the bones of a Long John Silvers or Captain D's... but they've painted away the blue and white with black and gray.  A few tables can be pushed together to accommodate large groups, but probably only 1 or 2 large groups.  I noticed some extra chairs stacked on the side, so it's a bit of a free for all in the dining area.    The staffers are super nice and want to make sure you have the best experience possible. We got there at 8pm... and totally forgot it closed at 9pm.  They didn't rush us out or anything... so we only really \"got it\" when we were the last ones there after a mass exodus to the doors.  I'm sure they were tired from all the tacos they had been slinging all day long....  I need to come back and try other stuff on their menu... what I tasted so far was really great."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos!  I've been looking for a local alternative to Chipotle and found it in The Burrito Factory.  This is not a fancy place but a place that serves good food dosn't have to be fancy or trendy. You start off like any build to order place...starying at the menu. They have burritos and other options but the thing to get here is the burrito. I've had the chicken and choriqueso with my choice of other ingredients. Both ended up being the most flavorful burritos I've had.  Their proteins are seasoned well and their hot salsa is killer!   Top that off with a friendly staff and decent prices and you have a winner.  This is now my go to burrito place in Charlotte. Forget Chipotle!"}
{"text":"it's honestly the best. I come every week. I don't understand how anyone isn't obsessed. The staff is so sweet. I'm always happy to wait in line on crazy days. I've had days where I went for lunch, got home and craved it for dinner. Their fried plantains are the best around."}
{"text":"I got the shrimp burrito and it was better than anything I have had. You must try this place if your in town or make it a destination"}
{"text":"Had to write a few notes.  This place is great.  Its a rarity to always have a good experience somewhere.  Great food, great service, excellent staff. All in all a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burrito in Charlotte. The spicy chicken burrito is my favorite. Make sure you try their homemade sauces, the green one + the orange one = heaven."}
{"text":"99¢ Taco Tuesday!! Do I seriously need to say any more?! You're right... I should!   I arrived around 12pm having never eaten nor heard of this place (I know, I know) and the line wasn't that bad. It did get longer around 12:15-12:20p so I got extremely lucky. The employees were pleasant and served everyone as quickly as possible without making you feel rushed to choose the variety of toppings.   I ordered three tacos (2 spicy chicken, 1 beef) and I was pleased to learn that I was supplied with a nice amount of meat on all three. I also appreciated that the meat remained covered until someone wanted it (it's the little things, that make my tummy smile).   The food was good and filling. The only missing was a side of salsa for the chops that came with it. I will definitely be returning to try a burrito in the [near] future."}
{"text":"First burrito and taco spot we've been to in CLT. They offer a Cali menu of options, that gave us the excitement to go since I grew up in CA, been in TX. So hubby and I wanted to check it. We are always on the hunt for amazing food. Ordered the Cali burrito which was good, steak taco and fish tacos which weren't so great, just wish they weren't frozen. I'll stick to the steak.  May return if we're in the area and feel like having tacos and burritos. Service was ok."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Always on the lookout for a good shrimp burrito my partner suggested we stop here before heading back to Atlanta. We both grew up in the West/Southwest and know what Mexican food should taste like.   She loved her shrimp burrito! She was still talking about it when we drove away. The secret ingredient seems to be their yummy chipotle sauce.   I'm a vegetarian so I was glad they had the tofu burrito. The rice in my burrito was perfect! It took me back to the days when I would sit at my neighbor's table and she would say \"Here mijita, have some rice\". Like home cookin. Yum!  Also, the creamy red salsa and creamy green salsa are on point!   I had one of those Jarrito (pineapple) sodas I used to love way back when and I was in heaven. Our meals were tasty and filling at a fair price.    The restaurant was humble but clean (the women's restroom was tidy). The service was excellent. It's clear that they take pride in their food.    I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place but wasn't very impressed. I got a shrimp burrito & the hubby had a steak burrito. Both were pretty bland. They need to add more seasoning to the food. Chips and salsa were good. The customer service is superb, very nice staff. I may try this place again but not in the immediate  future."}
{"text":"We HAD to check this place out after we saw the amazing reviews. We all loved everything!!  Burritos, tacos.....  And the salsa bar!!?!  Perfect. I love the variety of drinks. My kids LOVE the horchata!!  The people that were working there were very kind, and offered fantastic suggestions. The whole place was really clean, and we enjoyed the atmosphere. We will definitely be back."}
