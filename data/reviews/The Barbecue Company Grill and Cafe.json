{"text":"i discovered this restaurant via a referral and i'm lucky that i did. the staff were all very polite. i stopped in on my lunch break and i was pressed for time, my order was made and i was walking out of the door very shortly after i arrived. the bacon and ranch chicken sandwich was good, the little homemade snickers cupcake was even better. the barbecue company will be seeing more of me!"}
{"text":"If you want good food quick with great service...go here. The sauces (I can't remember the names) are awesome. I got the pulled pork with bleu cheese coleslaw. That was great. I also got the sweet potato fries which were not that great, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. The price was right, the service was right but most important was the great food. 

This is a place to try."}
{"text":"I have gone here a number of times with work people during lunch and it has been ok, but this was the last time.

1 star because they exist, and the second because the food is actually good (as long as they bring you what you order). Service on the other hand, awful! Our waitress' appearance was less than satisfactory, she was rude, she took forever, didn't split the check correctly, the food didn't come timely (about 30 min) and it wasn't even right."}
{"text":"The best barbecue in town...hands down!!!!! The rub on these ribs mixed with the tang & sweetness of the sauce is a match made in heaven! I stumbled upon this place with my coworkers and was completely blown away with how great it was! I now go at least once a week for lunch."}
{"text":"Very good barbecue. I've been here a few times and almost always get their pulled pork sandwich. It is very tender and flavorful. It's too bad their hours are so limited!

The place can get a little crazy during the typical lunch hour so be prepared to wait for seating or be patient with the service -- they are great but spread way too thin during rush hour."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix !!  I've foumd my new favorite BBQ place. The prices are constant with other BBQ places I have been to. Complimentary Drinks ! ! I had 4 chicken wings, 1/2 lb of rib tips, and seasoned Fries for 11.10 that includes tax."}
{"text":"Just ate at the Barbecue Company like to do that every once a week good food good service it never fails you always run out of iced tea and you have to tell them to get traditional tea why can't they have to does a traditional they never run out of the other stuff sounds good"}
{"text":"Came here from recommendations from people.  Was particularly intrigued that they only open during lunch time, which I assumed they would focus all their efforts in that short span of time.  We got there pretty early...10mins after they opened, luckily because the place got filled up quickly.  We both got the sampler and was pretty good.  Briskets and pulled pork was my meat of choice and were tasty.  Potato salad and fries were ok."}
{"text":"Awesome place and Elva was a great server.The pulled pork and smoked brisket was so tender and flavorful. Believe it or not the salads are excellent and you have to try the bacon cheddar chipoltle meatloaf."}
{"text":"After trying several of the other bbq joints in the valley, I might have finally found the \"ONE\"! Had the 4 bone rib meal with sweet corn medley and potato salad, and it was all delicious. The ribs literaly melted in my mouth and weren't smothered in sauce like some other places. The service was super warm and friendly as well. I will definitely be back! 

This place is only open Mon-Fri 10:30-3:00. The place gets crowded for lunch. Get here right when they open or after the lunch hour."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I really expected more from this place.  Their pulled pork sandwich was not very good.  The meat was tough, and there was no smokey flavor whatsoever from the meat, just an incredibly sweet sauce with ketchup consistency that overpowered everything.  The other sauces on the table were just as bad.  The sides were pretty good, however.  I liked the blue cheese slaw and the cowboy beans, but sides are not enough for a BBQ place to stand on.  Normally, I like to visit a place several times and try multiple things from the menu before I can say whether I like it or not.  Because the pork was so bad, I'm reluctant to give this place another shot.  I'm from the South, and I haven't really found any place in AZ that can cook pulled pork properly (only Pork on a Fork comes close).  However, the pulled pork I had to day at the BBQ Co. was some of the worst I've had in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Location is in an industrial area. The staff is very friendly but the food was just ok. Maybe my rating would be better if I've never experienced Little Miss BBQ but I have. Look at the pictures from Little Miss's and the pictures from this place and you can see who wins the eye test. Glad I came here to try but if I'm craving BBQ I know where I'm going. Got 2 meats and 2 sides for about $20."}
{"text":"One of my favorites, now that I'm working in Tempe it's a bit of a trek to get here as often. The Pulled Pork, Ribs and Brisket are great. I tried the BBQ Meatloaf and was very surprised how good it is. Wednesday buffet is a great chance to try a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the slowest service. Waited for 7 minutes up front before we were seated, another 15 minutes before our server showed up to greet us. No food quality check from the server.  Another 20 minutes for the check.  They only have one soda machine which you have to get up and get yourself. Not sure what that's about.  Food was okay. Nothing special.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Right off the bat I had problems had to wait almost 20min to be seated was seated BY The Waiter then accused of seating myself. after getting that settled I ordered the slider trio and found a hair in my fries ugh. after having to argue with the waiter again that it was indeed not my hair I finally got a new plate only to find there pulled pork tough and disgusting overall crappy service crappy food do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been to The Barbecue Company on quite a few occasions and they always do a great job.  It's in line with realistic expectations - good service, good food and comfortable/clean atmosphere.

The staff is always helpful, however our server said she doesn't eat meat.  I have no problem with vegetarians but if you're going to work in a restaurant I expect some first-hand knowledge of the product.  She did a great job at explaining popular favorites so it worked out.  She was a very good and perfectly attentive server in all aspects (other than my petty preference outlined above).

I ordered their famous meatloaf.  It's pretty damned good.  I'm stuffed right now, and even the meatloaf burps are good.  ;-)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a couple years on and off for business meetings. The food has always been good and comes out fairly fast, hidden location but gets pretty packed so get there before noon. 
My only complaint is that the last couple times I've been in they are extremely under staffed, there is no hostess and we have to wait forever to get seated so it makes what should be a fast lunch way too long. I was in the Friday before forth of July around 1, there was one server and no hostess. Same server we had had a couple times in the last 6 months and she literally took 5 mins to say hello and then told us to get our own drinks. Never checked back to make sure food was good didn't take our payment and no one was at register to let us pay.
This has happened too many times and we won't be coming back.
I would have normally complained to the manager but apparently our server was the manager, so here's some advice, hire some staff to help you out and put your phone away while in front of customers.
It's not professional especially when you have 15 tables that are waiting for your service."}
{"text":"My husband has been telling me about this place for years, and since they are only open for lunch I have never had a chance to eat here! Well I finally had my chance, and he was right! The decor is nothing fancy, but the service is friendly and the food is amazing!!! I had the four rib combo with two sides. The ribs were delicious, and generously slathered with a great BBQ sauce. These were some of the best ribs I have ever had! As for sides, I got the garlic mash potatoes and the blue cheese cole slaw. The portions for the sides are a good size. The cole slaw was good, but the garlic mash potatoes were to die for. My husband ordered the thick sliced brisket and loved it. It was very tasty and tender. He also had the mashed potatoes as well as the grilled vegetables. He said they were very tender. If you love great BBQ this is the place to come and eat."}
{"text":"Rib tips... Yuck!  So tuff I couldn't eat. Waitress never asked. I left hungry.  Never again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, had the new pork chilies Philly sandwich (cheese steak but with bbq pulled pork ) very good combination. give it a try."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a brief trip into Phoenix.  I'm from the South and have had the pleasure of eating at many top notch BBQ establishments throughout the country.  The Barbecue Company is solid BBQ that will hit the spot.  It is not the best I've ever had, but I did not leave disappointed.  The pulled pork sandwich was well cooked and well sauced and the accompanying sweet potato fries were excellently crisped and seasoned.  If I returned to Phoenix and was in the mood for BBQ I would return here without hesitation."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. Food is always good (other than rib tips - I am from the Midwest and may be a rib tip snob). Meatloaf if good. Salads good. Pulled pork sandwich good. Prices have been increasing and service declining recently. Place is always busy and it seems they never have enough servers anymore. They run around like chickens with their heads cut off and it seems we are still waiting for too long. Wait to take the order. Wait for the food. Wait for the check. Wait for her to come back and take your pay. Wait for it to come back. What used to be an in and out in 30 - 40 minutes is now an hour plus. Almost 2 hours one Friday!"}
{"text":"Delicious. If you like BBQ and you don't mind adding an inch to your waist, this is a great place. I had the BBQ nachos, which I was told that they were new on the menu. They were great. The cheese was ballpark style and not \"fresh,\" but it sure was delicious. All my coworkers had sandwiches, which looked delicious. This is a great place with a good-sized menu. And you won't leave here reeking of BBQ smoke. Great lunch place if you're in Tempe b"}
{"text":"I wanted to try all types of BBQ meat, so I ordered \"BBQ Slider Trio\" brisket, shredded pork, and chopped chickens are so tender, jucy, and was very flavorful. Buns were fluffy and heavenly sweet.  I also, ordered \"MaxiCali Pork Salad\" romaine lettuce was fresh and crunchy. I loved a little bite of roasted poblano peppers (green chilies) just right amount of feta cheese and cilantro lime vinaigrette dressing was refreshingly delicious. I had very happy tummy :)"}
{"text":"Really good barbeque... Not out of this world barbeque, not southern or KC or Memphis barbeque, but really good.  Great work lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Q-Spud=greatest lunch ever.  It's a baked potato with your meat of choice, bacon, cheese, bbq sauce, green onions and sour cream.  I can generally eat half of one in a sitting.  With the Q-Spud comes my single complaint about The Barbecue Company: The menu lists \"Q-Spud...with chicken/turkey, with beef/pork, or with no meat\".  Twice I've asked for the Q-Spud with no meat, and the waitress argues about if that's called a \"Q-Spud\" anymore.  I don't really care if \"Q-Spud\" implies meat, the menu lists a meatless spud as an option.  Don't argue with me about it, I didn't write the menu, you know what I'm asking for, so just write it down however the cook will understand.

I've also had the brisket sandwich and chopped chicken sandwich, which were both good.  I've heard rave reviews on the Caesar salad.  There are three different BBQ sauces on the table to dress up your lunch, ranging from sweet to spicy.  I would love to try the pulled pork, but I stopped eating pork :-(  Overall, the food is very good.

We've had company lunches catered by BBQ Company a few times, and that's also always been great.  We get chicken, ribs, beef, a couple of sides (the coleslaw has blue cheese in it, which is a GREAT touch) and cookies.  Always hot and plentiful!

There aren't very many real restaurants in this business area, so this one gets pretty busy around lunch time.  Even so, I've never had to wait an absurd amount of time.  Prices are good, considering you get a full lunch (and leftovers, for me!).  There are frequently lunch specials to round off the deal."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to go for lunch...chicken and ribs are awsome!!! I have been eating here for the last 3 years and food is vert consistent."}
{"text":"Ordered the 4 dry-rubbed ribs with sides of sweet baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes. Very, very tasty and a ton of food for lunch.

Service was quick.

I will return.

F"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good and the ribs here are some of the best I've ever had. They're very lean and perfectly seasoned. The service is very fast and courteous. The Groupon deal for this place is awesome. I've been here three times and would definitely return. Try the St. Louis style ribs, they're out of this world."}
{"text":"I am REALLY SHOCKED by the other reviews...  This place is the worst!  And I say that with a lot of evidence.

As it's near my office, I am continually conned into going back (always against my will).

I have tried almost everything here and nothing is good in my opinion.  The ribs are awful (definitely not \"fall off the bone as stated in another review\").  Every side item is worse than the next.  I've tried the sandwiches, chicken, rib tips, salads, you name it...  

I am embarrassed that our guests from out of town think that this place represents American barbecue..."}
{"text":"After hiking a mile to it!! Closed till spring!' 0 stars.   Don't say your hours and post your open when your not !!!!"}
{"text":"I was exited to try this place but it did not meet my hoped for expectations. If you are spoiled on good Southern BBQ then this probably isnt the place. I think Famous Daves Chain is better than this place.

The hole in the wall feel of thjs barn shack of a place in and industrial park had me thinking good thoughts. The wonderful smells when you walk in and the great menu choices if pulled pork, brisket, ribs, chicken, sandwiches or plates made me want to try several things. Unfortunately they didn't have a small combo plate to try 2 meats and veggies (they have one option for $19 which is too big for most lunches).   I went for the standard pulled pork sandwich and slaw and ordered a rib on the side. I got to try the fried okra and sweet fries my buddy ordered too. 

Positives - good sides options (okra, homemade slaw, sweet potato fries, cornbread).   Staff were very friendly and welcoming and helpful. 

Sad items: pulled pork sandwich was drenched in sauce. I judge a sandwich by the tenderness of the pulled meat and smoky flavor and then add some sauce to balance for taste. This one had much sauce which is usually an indicator of hiding the real goodness of the pork.

Ribs - they were not tender baby backs but very fatty and not fall of the bone variety which I adore. Glad I didn't get a whole rack here. 

My friend who got the rib tips platter wasn't too happy either. We wouldn't say it was bad tasting, just not great BBQ."}
{"text":"First time here and I really enjoyed it. The staff was really nice the the brisket philly was delicious"}
{"text":"I've never had anything from here that wasn't good, from the wings to the ribs and even all of the sides I've tasted, everything is delicious! My favorite meal is the smoked turkey BLT and the meatloaf!!"}
{"text":"not to bad  a place  for BBQ had a lite smoke flavor brisket was tender fall apart I didn't care for the sauce to sweet but the meat was good the bread for the sandwich didn't care for I wish I could just order 1 lb of beef but I did not see that option on the menu a little on the pricey side form what you get and the. service is weird you have a server that takes your order and brings the food to you but you need to get up to go get you own drinks so you only get half the service so does that mean for only tip half not bad if in the area I'll stop bye agian 3 stars for the half service"}
{"text":"The first time I had this place was for a catered work function. Being the organizer I wasn't familiar with the place but it was reccomended by the accountant so I went for it. This experience was very good. Everything showed up on time, they delivered directly to the room requested & went over my order to ensure completeness of my order. The utensils from that event 5 years ago are still used here in the office for events. The BBQ company is in close proximity for my lunches & I do go about once a month & enjoy it thoroughly. I personally reccomend the Texas Twister, Ancho BBQ Beef Meatloaf & Smokin' Bleu sandwiches. Best side to me is the potato salad but all are very good & included in your sandwich order. 
Tip - They finally have to go cups for your drinks so order one of those when placing your food order."}
{"text":"This little gem is hidden, it sits off the road less taken for sure. My visit took place on a Friday during prime lunch time, noon.  On the door it says they close every week day at 2:30 and they aren't open on the weekends.  On Yelp, it says they close at 3pm.  I'm not sure which is correct. When my co-worker and I arrived it was a pretty packed house with just a few empty tables (maybe 4).  We grabbed one.  The waitress said help yourself to a soft drink (Soda or unsweetened tea) and I'll be right with you.  By the time we both grabbed our drinks, she was back at our table ready to take out order.  As mentioned, it was a pretty packed house so I was able to get a glance at all of the food that was coming out of the kitchen.  Everything looked great!  I heard a couple of people order the pulled pork sandwich so I knew I had to try it. 

I said to the server, I know they're on different playing fields but which would you choose as your best, the Pulled Pork Sandwich or the Beef Brisket Sandwich.  She said that's a hard one but my absolute favorite is the Smokin' Bleu, which the pulled pork sandwich with homemade cold slaw on top. I went with that and the seasoned fries as my side.  My co-worker went with 4 ribs, mashed potatoes and the sweet corn medley.

The food came out insanely fast and boy was it delicious. Everything was, the pulled pork, the slaw, the seasoned fries (Bomb), the bread ... warm and toasted. It was great.  I plan to return again for lunch next month."}
{"text":"Good place to eat - BBQ is always good and they have a wide selection on their menu. Beat the lunch crowd by arriving between 11-11:30 a.m.!"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed. Went to lunch today with coworkers, we were greated and sat right away. Everyone was friendly, the waitress sat us at 1105am then took our order at 1115am okay cool... she disappeared and came back at 12 o'clock noon and said she never put our order in??? We reordered and ate at 1215, then had to rush our food down, did not intend on spending 90 mins there. The food was pretty damn good but we returned to work late due to her mistake. She did apologize but charged us full price and that was that. We might try again another time. The food was really good!"}
{"text":"This is the best hidden treasure in Phoenix. Best BBQ I've had in Arizona. My daughters and I came with the intent to be food critics for the day, 

I Joe had the meatloaf plate with mash potatoes and the mac and cheese. Honestly it's the best meatloaf I've ever had, the chipotle flavor along with the smoky cheddar is killer! The mash potatoes were pretty good, but the mac and cheese is amazing. 

I GisseI had the best mac and cheese 
Ever!! The BBQ pulled pork was delicious 

I Bryanna had some of the most amazing ribs I ever had !!! The St. Louis ribs and fries."}
{"text":"I eat here once a week & Love it.  I usually get the Big Spud w/the work on it.  Also chicken plater or wings.  Very good food & you receice alot of it.  Tell your Friends & Family about this place.  Yummy for your tummy!!!"}
{"text":"Rand H. and myself went here today for the buffet and it is only on the first Wednesday of the month. Well I wish it was every day of the month because everything I had was great, pulled pork,chicken,beef briquet,smoked rib tips,baked beans,whole kernel corn,potato salad,coleslaw and potatoes. For dessert I had bread pudding and chocolate pudding with strawberry syrup on top.Everything I had was great and I can not wait for a return visit. I think they might just need an update every month (lol)."}
{"text":"Everything here is so awesome!  the pulled pork cannot be beat.  They have several different BBQ sauces to pick from too!  The corn side dish is THE BOMB!   Awesome salads too..   If you crave some pork, this is the place to check out!!"}
{"text":"Went here again after a long hiatus. It's just not convenient for me that they're only open for lunch. I don't know if they've changed or I've changed after trying other BBQ but this isn't my favorite anymore. We shared the sampler plate and got ribs brisket and pulled pork. The ribs were tough the brisket was good and the pork had less flavor than I remembered."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here and again another great experience. The restaurant is located in an industrial area so it may be a little hard to find because it's set back down 36th st. They are only open until 3:00 pm everyday so be sure to get here early before they run out of BBQ! 

Right know on Monday they have all you can eat rib tips and Wednesday all you can eat wings for $12! I haven't tried the rib tips yet but they look good and the wings are massive and come in a few sauce options as well as a dry rub.  Worth a try for sure so come hungry!

Today I ordered takeout and tried the ancho meatloaf which had great flavor and just the right amount of moistness.  You have to try their side of chipotle bacon mac n' cheese....yum!  Good service however a did had to wait almost 15 min for my order."}
{"text":"Put in a catering order to feed our team at work (7 guys with BIG appetites) we got the #1 catering combo with 1.5lbs brisket, 1.5lbs pulled pork, 1.5 lbs mashed potatoes, and 1.5 lbs cowboy beans. Added on 1lb Chopped chicken and 1 dozen soft rolls. We ordered for same day pickup, and it only took them about 20 minutes to put that all together, which is impressive.

I now have 7 happy team members, with 7 full bellies, and NO left overs. All of the meats were fantastic, so were the sides. I'm generally a tough critic on barbecue because I've spent a lot of time back east eating delicious bbq, and this absolutely did not disappoint. 

I can't say which of the 3 meats I liked better, as they were all 3 astounding. 

I will definitely be eating here again, and I'm definitely going to have to check out their all you can eat first Wednesday of the month like all the other reviews here suggest."}
{"text":"I meet up with my husband here for lunch since we both work nearby.  You have to get here early (before 1130)  or the lunch crowd will have you waiting a while for a table - especially if you are bringing a group.  Food and drink are basic but good.  Sometimes the service is a bit slow but it's not intolerable."}
{"text":"I got the sampler plate with 2 ribs, pulled pork, and smoked turkey, Blue cheese slaw and mac and cheese and corn bread.

First the good: the ribs are delicious, not especially tender (more on the firm side, but pleasantly so) and very tangy. Not a lot of smoke flavor, very sweet, but still a treat. Best part of the meal. The turkey was good too, not amazing. The pulled pork was a bit confusing. Every bite tasted different, some good, some quite nasty. 

The slaw was very good, not much bleu cheese flavor, but not overly creamy, nice and tangy and crisp. The mac and cheese was a disappointment. It's rare that I don't love any version of mac and cheese, so that's saying a lot. It was grainy, mealy, with odd flavors. Even the bacon sprinkles on top didn't salvage it. The corn bread was good, almost like a cake, in that it was spongy and very sweet. I ate it as a dessert, basically. 

I enjoyed my meal basically, but given how amazing great barbecue can be, there's a lot of room for improvement here. There's too much sweetness overall, not enough smoky/savory flavors. Service was fine, though the line to get a drink at the fountain was often very long. A place like this needs more than just the one fountain."}
{"text":"Quick review: got here b4 11, luckily as it was packed when we left. It is very popular for good reason. The pulled pork sandwich was very good! The only thing I could ask for slight improvement on is the bun. Other than that i was very happy with the food and service. Fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"Just happen to be in the area picking up some parts from a vendor for the shop and happened to ask the UPS dude where is a good place to eat. He said check this place out. UPS drivers are the best for food places. A little tricky to find. Located in a light industrial park. Good thing I had my smart phone to ask it for directions.

Got the Dynamite Sandwich with hot links and fries. Also ordered a side of Kentucky Bleu Cheese Coleslaw to check out the flavors. Large portions for a decent price. Food was tasty. Pretty good sized menu with a range of items that differ from most BBQ places. Different types of sauces on the table to choose from depending on what you like.

Service was extremely friendly and helpful. Inside was nice and clean. I hear they have an all you can eat buffet on the first Wednesday of the month for a great price. Looking forward to going back again to try more stuff. Smokin!"}
{"text":"Man, this place is just around the corner and I'm just discovering it now. Lots of other people in the area apparently are all in the know though. It's a small brick building, but inside it resembles a kind of weird mix of wraparound lunch counter (circa 1960) and tables. Never asked what style of BBQ these guys use, but it is likely some form of Texas with sliced brisket and thicker ribs, but they sauce the meat here. The chopped chicken is mixed meat and cashier steered me towards the turkey instead of the brisket.  This was an excellent pile of smoked turkey on a sesame bun - simple and to the point. The sauce was good and I got to sample all three including my favorite sweet and hot variety (not hot at all, just a twang). THe sandwich at 9 bucks was worthy with a side, but use the $1 off coupon on the website and you will feel better at $7.95. Tough choice on the sides, but being a blue cheese addict went with Kentucky Blue Slaw. Yeah, nice try, but even though the slaw was excellent with a thicker chop, there wasn't enough blue cheese present to give the slaw anything other than a watery blue cheese/mustard? taste. Still good though.
   I got here almost right after it opened at 10:30, but about 11, things were humming already in the lot. Go early or late or call it in. Brisket and Beans on the next visit possibly in a baked potato which is clearly a Southern item."}
{"text":"My first visit to this barbecue joint. I had high hopes based on the rating. I originally came to try the barbecue, but saw the meatloaf special as featured on TV and decided to try it. I really like meatloaf, so I'm a pretty tough critic. First off the presentation was a bit weak. The meatloaf was presented cafeteria style and looked pretty unappealing, but is the taste that counts right? It had a nice chipotle flavor, but the texture was too fine as I prefer my meatloaf to be a bit more chunky. I probably would try the BBQ next time. Likewise I was not overly impressed with the blue cheese coleslaw, cornbread, or spicy cowboy beans either. It was all good, just not great. And for $13, I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"I ordered the special. Several minutes later the server returned and said \"that was yesterday's special.\"  I asked what today's special was and she said \"I don't know yet.\"  J ordered another player and asked how the slaw is prepared and the server responded \"I don't know.\"  I gave her three options to choose from and she replied \"I don't know.\"  After a long uncomfortable pause she said \"do you want me to ask?\"  I said \"no thank you\" and left."}
{"text":"I've heard several people mention this lately and ask me what I thought about it. I figured it was time to give it a shot and see if it was worth adding to my list of BBQ options in the Phoenix area. Let's just say that I won't be back and won't be recommending it to anyone. The meats all seemed undercooked and were lacking in flavor. You shouldn't need a knife to cut brisket but you do here. The only thing saving it from one star is that the sauces were decent and I didn't hate the seasoned fries. If you want good BBQ, this is not a good option."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Had the wing plate with onion strings. It was very busy, but they did good at keeping up. The only negative are the ladies at the register/front door. They do not greet anyone or try to seat you until asked.  Instead they just stand there talking amongst themselves ignoring people coming in the door. Even when people are stacked waiting to be seated, they never engaged a customer until they were asked.  I sat and watched this happen each time someone came in. Very strange."}
{"text":"First time at BBQ company. My company ordered the catering. 

I had the potato salad, pulled pork and brisket. The salad was good, with a blend of spices, herbs and mayo. The brisket was drenched in BBQ sauce which is not my idea of good brisket. The pulled pork was decent but a little tough. I'm guessing they give their inferior product to take out orders. 

For my money, I'll stick with Texas BBQ House which has incredible brisket."}
{"text":"I will preface this with saying I have had the pulled pork sandwich in the past and it was decent..  Sides are WAY too small for what they charge.  Beans, Macaroni and Cornbread are cheap! why skimp on your sides???  We had a Groupon coupon and decided to try them again.  Got a to go order today...1st strike, is hubby gets home and they did not give us our 20.00 credit from the Groupon coupon.  I let them know, we will see.  Hopefully I won't have to argue with them again.   2nd  strike, is we bought the 12 bone St Louis ribs, for 27.00!  It comes with a measly side dish, two of them not enough even for 1 person with 12 ribs?  12 ribs is way too much for one person, why not size up the sides to accomodate 3 to 4 people???   One piece (small one at that) of cornbread that was much like a boxed cornbread.  Strike 3, we paid 4.00 for about 1/2 cup of BACON mac and cheese...well it was all dried out and no cheese, and more importantly no BACON!  What the heck???  That was the last strike and they are OUT~! I will  not be buying from them again.  Very dissapointed, and on top of that, the ribs tasted so old...and not fresh at all.  They were tender enough, but did not taste good.  I make much better ribs myself, and I can get St. Louis ribs on sale for a whole slab for 7.00!   You guys need to address all this stuff.  Do not serve OLD dried out food, especially for what you charge.  sorry, just being brutally honest. But someone needs to be.  Do not buy at the end of the day when they are trying to 'get rid of' the stuff that they have left over."}
{"text":"I agree with Michael H wholeheartedly!  Unlike him though I always get the same thing and it is not BBQ:).  I always get their Lazy A Chicken sandwich and it is awesome!  I have dined in and have received delivery through their catering.  This place is always jam packed at lunch time but it is a pretty big place so the wait is usually minimal.   Everyone that I have taken here loves it.  It is a hidden BBQ gem and I almost don't want to tell people about it:).  So if you work in the area definitely give them a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This bbq is actually pretty darn good. We ordered their massive samplers and and pleased to say we liked it all. The meat just falls right off the ribs and the pulled pork was super tasty. The atmosphere and food options kinda made it feel like we were at grandparents or something. We will go again"}
{"text":"We went today for lunch and used a recently purchased groupon - so we ordered more than we would ordinarily. The bill came to $30 for 2 large entrees and 2 sodas - not cheap, but there are leftovers for at least 1 dinner. 

The restaurant was neat and clean, and we were greeted and seated quickly. It took a few minutes for our waitress to take our order, but the sodas are self-serve, so we didn't have to wait for them. And our waitress did apologize for not getting to us more quickly. The food came quickly, but we were probably there after the lunch rush. We wound up with 2 servers, and they were both friendly and working hard. 

We ordered the sampler plate, which comes with 2 ribs and your choice of 2 of the 4 offered meats, so we got the pulled pork and brisket. And we ordered the large pork sandwich as well (I figured it would be good to make a meal out of the leftovers.)

The brisket came in strange shaped slices and bits, and was swimming in the very good and slightly spicy sauce. I thought it was really good, but my husband was less than thrilled with it - which was pretty much what we thought of the pork as well. His comment was that it was too salty, but I love salt and didn't notice that there may have been too much. The ribs were so-so. Not a lot of meat, and they took some effort to get the meat off of the bones - which I'd rather not do. 

The side of seasoned fries that came with the sandwich was tasty, and a very large portion. Some of the other sides offered are out of the ordinary like blue cheese slaw and a corn dish with peppers and cooked on the griddle.

I only tried 2 of the 3 sauces as the sonoran spicy scared me off, and I liked mixing the sweet with the original. 

I will definitely be back here. Thanks to Groupon and Yelp for making the offer, and the chance to see other reviews before purchasing."}
{"text":"I could not wait to try this place after reading the reviews. I started a new job that the Barbeque Company was in the general vicinity of so I took the first lunch trip I could to the Barbeque Company. After getting lost on the way over, I finally made it. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and blue cheese slaw. The sandwich was good but was too small and didn't make the impression I was expecting. The coleslaw was good. I didn't feel that I received the value that I paid for and left a little disappointed after all of the hype. I believe that I possibly just ordered the wrong item and will probably be back to give it another try and probably try one of bbq plates rather than a sandwich. I will re-edit if the experience is better which I expect it to be from the decent reviews."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix. No question about it. In fact, I travel a lot for work and it could top any BBQ I've been to on the road. And yes, I've been to the South and Kansas City!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place.  I wanted a yummy BBQ place near home that I didn't have to wait in line forever (Little Miss).

We got take out of the thick sliced brisket plate with mashed potatoes, gravy, veggies and corn bread & the rib tips with sides of sw mac & cheese, blue cheese cole slaw and seasoned fries.

Thick sliced brisket - Icky.  I didn't care for it AT ALL.  Tough, flavorless and the gravy with mushrooms on it just wasn't what I was craving.

Mashed potatoes w/ gravy - okay

veggies - a really strange fake butter taste.  Didn't like.

corn bread - kinda mushy and weird

rib tips - my favorite part of the entire meal.  These were yummy.

sw mac & cheese - really spicy.  Strange and not very good.  Like Kraft with extra liquid and taco seasoning.

blue cheese cole slaw - my second favorite part of the meal.  This was really good.

seasoned fries - not my thing but the kids were happy with them.

I really can't imagine I will go back.

Inside of the resturant is cute and I would recommend dining there instead of pick up like we did."}
{"text":"LOVED going to this place when I lived in Phoenix! Always thought it was a bummer that they were only open for lunch M-F.  Never had a bad meal and always looked forward to the next lunch with co-workers.  It was always worth the wait for a table.  Recommended to everyone that was looking for good barbeque."}
{"text":"Wonder where the  guys hang out at lunch?  Looking for manly men who still eat meat?  THIS is a real BBQ shack, no namby-pamby dishes served!

Fish sandwich outstanding, great tartar sauce!  The Reuben with the blue cheese slaw on top Fabulous.  Tortilla soup, just spicy enough to show it has personality!  Salads - the JR sizes are just right for lunch.  

I have never had anything from the menu I didn't LIKE or LOVE.  Service is excellent.  The Iced Tea (prickly pear) is most excellent & refreshing.

Go Here. Go Now.  Go Often!  Support your local biz or you will be stuck with corporate chain food with no one to blame but yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is in a very strange area. Easy to find if you have a phone and a map app. I had a pulled pork sandwich and fries. It was pretty good and the sauce was very tasty. The service was just ok. You have to get your own drink and we did not realize that until we ordered. The waitress was not super friendly and was annoyed I ordered a specific drink. I would still go back, the bbq was good."}
{"text":"Honestly the best barbeque restaurant. I always prefer pork for barbeque and they have the best pulled pork. Their fried okra and seasoned fries are really good too."}
{"text":"Really close to my work. I love the open faced sandwiches and their brisket. Too bad their hours aren't longer. :("}
{"text":"Hadn't been to the BBQ Company in years .  Decided to try it since we were so close by.  They must have changed ownership, managers or the pit master.  Had the brisket and beans. Brisket was lean and tender but absolutely no hint of any smoke flavor.  I think they must have prepared it in a conventional oven not a wood fired BBQ pit.  The beans were different . All you could taste was chili powder.  The brisket and one small side was $12.00 plus tax. Very expensive for what they served. 

What a shame, as it used to be a very decent BBQ restaurant !!   Go to Dickey's Pit BBQ or Andrews for real Texas smoked beef brisket in the East Valley !!"}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough. I like to try out the local eateries instead of the chain food places when I travel. thanks to yelp and you yelpers I found this place and well worth the the time it took to find it. Our group tried a little of everything and the staff accommodated us as we ate the food family style so we could try a bit of each others."}
{"text":"I've been going to The Barbecue Company for a while now.  I used to go once a week.  Then I started going twice a week.  The last two weeks I've been there three times each week!

I can only speak to two menu items.  For a long time I got the Rib Tip Plate every single time.  It's a pound of delicious smoked rib tibs and a side.  They have great sauces, but I usually get them dry.  I always pay a little extra for the steamed (or grilled) vegetables, but I've heard their blue cheese cole slaw is fantastic.  

Recently I have been ordering their Wing Plate.  The plate includes 6 whole wings smoked then fried.  They are absolutely the best wings I've ever had.  They have two sauces, regular and hot, but they're fantastic without any sauce at all.  The Wing Plate also come with a side.  

So what's a hungry man to do when he can't decide between wings and rip tips?  They have a solution: The Wing and Rib Tip Combo Plate.  Booyah!"}
{"text":"Had the  Dynamite Sandwich, which is described as so on the website:  

\"An explosive blend of sliced brisket, peppers, chilis, onions and jalapeños, sauteed with Red Diamond sauce, and piled on a jalapeño roll with melted pepperjack.\"

It was very good, very spicy, and I'm definitely getting more of them.

Our favorite item was the Fried Onion Strings, however.  You know the problems with ordering onion rings at a restaurant:  too much breading, or the onion is nasty, or you take a bite and all the onion pulls out of the breading and you have nothing left to eat except empty breading, or they are too greasy?

These don't have any of those problems.

Very light crust, super-light, and the onions can be tasted and they are good onions, not too strong or too sweet.  No grease at all.  We loved them for $1.95 and next time I'm ordering more of them, since the plate is a little on the small side.

That's my only complaint - the portions were a little on the small side.

But you can remedy that by going back on the FIRST WEDNESDAY of every month, when they have a $12.95 AYCE lunch buffet.

One last problem - they are only open for lunch, and weekdays only.  Hours: 10:30am - 3:00pm Monday - Friday.

If they'd expand hours and make their portions a smidgeon larger, I could give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had a bunch of coworkers tell me that I need to go check this place out because they had great BBQ, and just as many coworkers tell me not to bother because it wasn't good at all. Finally I had to try the place and I have to say- 1 of the groups was right. 
The place is aptly named \"Barbecue Company\" because that is exactly what it comes across as. I walked in to a place where it looks like they took a lot of time to make it look all rustic and Midwestern; with picnic tables, rolls of paper towel, etc... so I thought that was a nice touch. I ordered my food though and wow- what a disappointment. 
BBQ to me is one of the few foods where you can't fake it. It's not like a burger joint where all you have to do is throw some meat in between 2 buns and you're golden. With BBQ it has to be authentic and flavorful or else it's crap. I will say that the meat on my \"Fat Butt\" sandwich was tender with not too much sauce- but it literally tasted like they went to Safeway, got some jars of generic brand BBQ sauce (not even the good stuff) and put it on their meat. It's like if McDonald's tried to streamline production and open a BBQ restaurant. There was no flavor, no spice, no kick- just Blah. I ordered it with the \"seasoned fries\" and here again was the same problem- they didn't take french fries and season them up or anything, they just ordered \"seasoned fries\" from their distributor, dropped them in oil, then served them on a plate. You can get the same things at Jack in the Box (and those are at least curly). Maybe I'm spoiled because I like places like HoneyBears (which I'm sure this and every other BBQ joint in the valley is tired of being compared to) but at least there you get actual flavor in the sauce and you can tell that it comes from people who really know how to do BBQ. Same with the fries. Go to Five Guys if you want to taste seasoned Cajun fries. But if the BBQ Company didn't want to go to the trouble of doing them right then just server French Fries and leave the seasoned part out of it because you really are doing yourself a disservice. 
In the end, a Barbecue \"Company\" is all it comes across as being. I don't know the history or the owners- but it tastes like some investors got together and wanted to capitalize on the BBQ fad so they bought into it and tried to paint by numbers. Save your money instead of going here and go to one of the true BBQ restaurants or even just go to a burger joint. At least there you know what to expect."}
{"text":"Came here because of a business meeting. Considering how the inside looks, their cheesy logo, and so-so reviews, I didnt have high hopes. I wasnt far off on my predictions, but its actually OK (depending on what you order).

I ordered the three meat plate with mac and cheese and potato salad. The pulled pork is garbage. Super sweet, super soggy, drowned in BBQ sauce, barely had flavor, and was super stringy. Stay away at all costs. The brisket actually wasnt that bad. There were a couple of bites that took me by surprise. It had a decent amount of smoke, wasnt super dry, and had some marbly pieces. Even though I asked for just marbled brisket, they still gave me a few pieces of lean brisket. The ribs were probably the best part of the meal. They actually required you to tear into it, rather than fall off the bone. The meat had a mild smoke, but were still savory than sweet. They had a nice glaze on the outside. Most of the meat was moist (minus a few dry spots). The dinner they give is horrible. Apparently the cornbread is better, so I would say get that. The house BBQ sauce was sweet, but at least was more savory than Bobby Q's sweet BBQ.

I wouldnt eat here again, but its a better option than chain BBQ by a long shot. Get the ribs and dont order pulled pork."}
{"text":"Pricey $14 for two small pieces of meatloaf and two sides.  Didn't care for the sauce spread over the meat slices."}
{"text":"Who says the West Coast don't know good BBQ

Its been said that BBQ is one of the only true American forms of art, and sadly, the valley isn't really known for its great BBQ. However, that doesn't mean the valley doesn't have its fair share of great BBQ joints, and The BBQ Company Grill and Catering is one of those joints.

I have visited The BBQ Company Grill and Catering many times and never been disappointed. The food is \"comfort\" style, with lots of options, sandwiches, salads, and of course great Bbq. The varied selection of entrees can satisfy most everyone. 

The food is really good at The Bbq Company. The Pulled Pork Sandwich and Turkey BLT are delicious, with the right amount of spice, sweetness, smoke and a touch of \"heat.\" These sandwichs don't even need sauce, as the smoked meat speaks for itself. You can't have a sandwich without trying the potato salad, which is spot on and don't forget  the cornbread, its delicious.

 This place gets busy and parking is limited, but worth the wait and extra effort."}
{"text":"Yes there are lines, yes it is busy. Because it is awesome. Best BBQ in the area. Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good BBQ, and actually measures up against the good BBQ places of other cities.

Baked beans aren't sweet, but has a pop of cinnamon flavor each bite. If you're expecting the Texan experience, then you might think that the portions are small at first-- but it's definitely a full meal. I had the brisket sandwich and baked beans, which was enough but very slightly on the pricey side at $10.75 total.

Great food, and they serve it up quick during the lunch rush which I generally weigh a lot of value to. It shows that the kitchen has it together in the back."}
{"text":"This is a really good bbq place in a weird area. The building clearly was meant to be an office building and is surrounded by other warehouse and office type buildings. We arrived for Friday lunch at about 11am and there was absolutely no wait and plenty of parking.

What to expect inside: table service with self serve drinks. BBQ sauces and paper towels are on the table already. I would consider this to be a no frills place. However, the menu is large and the food was good! At my table we ordered wings, brisket, and side salads. Everything was great and we cleaned our plates. 

I came here for a business lunch and we were in and out pretty quickly. Our service was okay, I wasn't quite sure our server was really following as we placed our orders, she seemed confused. However, our food and our to go order all came out correctly and quickly."}
{"text":"I had lunch at The BBQ company a couple of times now, first time was pretty good, yesterday's lunch not so good.  I had the chicken and ribs, the chicken was pretty good, the ribs tasted old.

When I ordered my two sides I was informed that the salad would be an additional up charge so I opted for the Southwestern mac and cheese. When I got the Southwestern mac and cheese it was really bland and the texture of the macaroni was mushy (yuck), could not eat it. The spicy BBQ sauce was not spicy at all and was hard to tell the difference between the mild.

When I received my bill I noticed that there was a $.50 up charge on the macaroni and cheese that I could not eat. This place is expensive for what you get. My lunch came to $21.00 including tip."}
{"text":"I guy I worked with took me to this place and just when I thought I has found all the great BBQ places in Phoenix....

The Big Thang is an awesome brisket sandwich and also try the BBQ chopped chicken.

The service is outstanding !"}
{"text":"As BBQ in Phoenix goes - this is one of the better ones.  Get there early - they fill up FAST!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch thinking it would be reasonable to get out in less than an hour.  Seated quickly, ordered quickly, after an hour waiting for food the waitress came over to tell us the computer screwed up our order.  We then watched her go over to the computer and enter it, food came out 10 minutes later.  The brisket was over cooked at fatty, and only 2 slices.  I've been coming here for years and it gets worse each time."}
{"text":"I didn't know about this place until someone works in the area took me here.

I ordered the famous as seen on the travel channel meatloaf. This meatloaf lives up to the reputation. When I arrived, I quickly read several reviews here to decide what to order, but as soon as I opened the menu, I saw this meatloaf and I had to try.

This meatloaf was so good, I am trying to think what meetings can I schedule to make me come to the area... Quite a way from my office, and they only open for lunch, I need to create a meeting in the area to come back here again.

I ordered corn bread, grilled vegetables, and baked beans on the side. All of them were so good, in fact I hadn't had corn bread in a while, I ended up baking one at home last night.

I also ordered pumpkin spice cupcake. It was so good, ordered one to go.

I can't wait to come back here and I want to try BBQ next time."}
{"text":"This place is close to my office so we hit it up for lunch from time to time.  I've only tried one thing on the menu, and it was pretty tasty.  The portions are healthy and the service is quick.  I planned on trying a few other items on the menu so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Slider trio for lunch. Pulled pork, chicken & brisket.  All on dinner rolls with seasoned fries and pickle spear. I enjoyed the pulled pork the best. Brittany (server) was vey friendly & nice."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a good groupon, so of course when I saw one for this place I was on it. They are right by my office, and my co workers have raved about it for years. The voucher was $20 bucks worth of food for $8 (cant beat that right!). We came here on a Monday around 1130, and luckily just barely got in before the lunch rush. The place is much bigger than I thought, but it did get crowded quick. I ordered the meat trio (may not be the name on the menu) which came with brisket pork and chicken, with a side. I did the potato salad. I normally don't eat much meat aside from chicken, but really wanted to sample this place so it was the best option. I didn't care for the brisket, it seemed dry and not much flavor, even with the bbq sauce. The pork and chicken were pretty dang good. The plate ran I think $12 bucks, and with the amount of food I do think its fair, I actually could have split it with my little one. The potato salad was good too, some places no so much so I was pleasantly surprised. I love the old fashion new version of the coke machine, with like 1000 different options, although you'll pay for it at I believe 3 bucks a soda. (free refills though). The waitress was very prompt and friendly, although I didn't catch her name. I would come back here, and would recommend to any bbq lover. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't anything out of the ordinary, compared to other bbq places. Nothing against the establishment."}
{"text":"Well I went here today and I was so anxious to try this BBQ place and man am I disappointed first off I had rib tips and wings with beans and another plate with ribs. Okay let's start with the rib tips being so dry it was like eating jerky I couldn't even eat one it was so hard to bite into then when I figured that wasn't working I just broke it with my teeth wow I can't believe how inedible it was. I thought well maybe it's just what I ordered nope my husband told me his ribs were dry and hard save your money and stay away I wouldn't be surprised if it was cold left overs and it's not cheap but I love food so I didn't have a problem spending my money until I taste the food this is a very honest and unbiased review o I forgot to mention greasy so greasy"}
{"text":"ok well being from the chicago area i have had my far share of rib tips since i was a kid, and i would have to say these are one of the best in the country! they are amazing and i will never get anything else, well unless i get a pound of tips with it. you have to go to compton ca ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/bludsos-bbq-compton ) or to the south side of chiraq to even get close to these heavenly rib tips! but just go here and you can leave your bullet proof vest at home and enjoy some tips for 10 bucks n not have to dodge bullets! trust me and go and get a couple pounds for you and your family now! the only really bad part is there hours, only open for lunch, i love tips for dinner too! can't wait to try the buffet one year i get around to it! well its time to finish my online 3 pound rib tip order n pick them up lol"}
{"text":"It was OK....
I got a pulled pork sandwich with one side, the SW mac & Cheese.... I paid a $3 upcharge for more meat... and got a drink, they have the digital soda machine with the flavorings, pretty nice.

Not so impressed to be honest... The pulled pork was both very tough and very very fatty, the bread was stale (tasted a week old, I looked for mold it was so bad) and the SW mac & cheese was not for me, tasted like an experiment a kid made with mac & cheese and some salsa... but hey, the soda was good.

I was really surprised when the total was just short of $17.50, with a tip, I'm out $20.... FOR LUNCH..... for a mediocre lunch at that.....

I won't be going back unless I'm a guest at someone else's expense. If the total were $10 out the door, I would have possibly given this place a second chance as every single meal can't be perfect. But certainly, no second tries at $20.

Honestly, McDonald's quarter pounder with cheese is much more appetizing..."}
{"text":"BBQ, plus. 

You will find you're regualr ribs and pulled meats. Plus, wings, sandwiches, burgers, even wraps and salads. 

My absolute favorite is the The Big Tex -- A pile of thick-sliced smoked brisket with melted pepperjack, horseradish and onions on a jalapeo cheddar roll. Not for wimps!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Yelp today, and I'm an idiot. I'm about to tell you all about someplace you apparently do not know about. If you had, it would have multiple rave reviews.

The BBQ Company is more of a caterer than a restaurant, the hours of their dining room are are only 11:00 - 3:00 Monday to Friday and their location is in an industrial park south of Sky Harbor Airport. Do not let anything in that previous sentence dissuade you of making a trip, though.

It would come as no great shock to you that one of the primary menu items is BBQ. They do BBQ real good, and rank second on my list of rib joints (first place being the Country Tavern in Kilgore, Texas). What really stands out to me about this place is that every damn thing is good. I have visited this place about 10 times, and have made it a personal goal to not order the same thing on the menu twice.  In addition to the smoked brisket, Turkey, pork and chicken, they have excellent sandwiches, salads, and a pretty good Tortilla soup. A friend of mine swears they have the best tuna salad he's ever had, the Ancho BBQ Meat Loaf is awesome, and in addition to the regular menu, the specials are generally fantastic. The day I go back and they have their Chicken Fried Steak special is the day I break my vow about ordering the same thing twice.

The sides are very good, the prices reasonable, and oh yeah, the catering is pretty good too.

Check out their web site at http://www.thebbqco.com/ and plan your trip. It can be pretty difficult to get in to Fridays around noon, it's easier earlier in the week or away from the peak lunch time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a fine BBQ lunch today. One element that stuck out to me the most was how friendly the waitress was. We were a group of 15 and asked for separate checks and the girl was still just as nice as can be. She smiled when she came to our table and was very helpful when we were all trying to figure out our orders. The BBQ Co. has an interesting drink setup where the cups and fountain drinks are set out and you get your own, then they just add your drink to your tab. It was cool - the only problem I ran into was being in the middle of the booth and not being able to get a refill because everyone else was eating...so I sipped on my ice. 

The meat was tender, and the sauce wasn't too runny. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"An old work buddy told me to try this place out, so once I switched jobs to a closer location, I tried it.  Let me tell you, this place is fantastic!  I had the dynamite sandwich with their kentucky blue cole slaw.  The brisket was nice and tender and very flavorful.  The dynamite sandwich comes with slow cooked pepers and chiles - not making the sandwich spicy hot - but adds a notch flavor to the brisket.  BBQ Co's sauces are all sweet with a variance of spice.  I liked both the Red and Sonoran Heat.  The staff was awesome.  My waitress was very polite and took care of my bbq needs :)  You can tell that the owners/management know how to run a restaurant!  Just look around and watch the staff as they prepare your meal proficiently and take good care of their customers.  Im adding two thumbs up to my 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times already after passing it one day while at work, amazing food and decent prices, if you enjoy barbeque this is a place to go!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet!

If you haven't been here for lunch you are most definitely missing out.  There's a reason why I go here and can barely find parking every visit but I wouldn't care if I had to park a block away and walk.

The barbeque is better than any adjective I could use to describe it.  If you're not sure what to get, just get the sampler plate.  I'm partial to the brisket sandwich.  If you like barbeque, I recommend giving this place a go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I work nearby and I love coming here! The food has never failed me. I've gotten quite a few menu items from here and I've never been disappointed. My go to BBQ spot."}
{"text":"Yelp deserves the shout out for this find! As soon as we landed at PHX for the first time we were hungry. Where to eat? I dunno, ask Yelp. Yelp directed us to not only the closest place but the place with the most reviews.

And thank the lord. This place wins on a lot of fronts.

1. French fries: I know it's a BBQ joint, but their french fries are fantastic. Especially if you order like we do, \"extra crispy.\" This is the first time I've ever heard my dad approve of the french fries he's received for being the right amount of crispy.

2. Ribs: Saucy, fall-off-the-bone delicious.

3. Salads: Cobb Salad was huge, covered in delicious meat and vegetables and ended up being two meals.

4. Mashed potatoes: They be real potatoes.

5. Unlimited refills on soda.

This place is super comfortable and family friendly. There are a lot of booths and big tables so I can see it getting really crowded at times. I'm pretty sure we showed up at an off hour and got seated immediately, but I definitely see a long wait piling up. 

I deducted a star for the parking lot and random things that weren't great. Like, forgetting to bring us boxes to take our food to go or those wetnaps to clean up after a messy, messy lunch. Small things, but just enough to remind us that nothing is ever perfect every time."}
{"text":"The BBQ Co.is the first place we think of when we want to order a meal for lunch at the office. Its been in business since 1987 but you would never know it's there unless a someone told you about it. It's hidden pretty well in an industrial area off of Broadway and is often so busy you might need to park on the street.

They close before dinner so don't show up after 2 or 3pm because you will be SOL.  It's a lunch spot and they handle the lunch crowd pretty well. The servers don't usually hang around to chit chat because they are much too busy and they know most patrons have to hurry back to work after lunch.

The food is filling and comes out quickly - today we ordered the Friday Fish Tacos. Fried fish, with pico de Gallo, cilantro, red onions, and cabbage topped with a sauce that tasted just like tartar, wrapped in a flour tortilla and garnished with a couple of lemon wedges.  It comes with fries and their blue cheese coleslaw, but the drink is separate.  I must have enjoyed it because it was gone before I finished this review! 

I added a photo of the Fish Tacos from today as well as a photo of The Big Tex from one of my recent visits."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for 2-years, and the food is always good. Its mostly a lunch place for nearby businesses I think. They just introduced 4 new BBQ sandwiches, and me and a co-worker both tried different ones. I had a Indiana style pork sandwich, which was great! Reminded me of home.. 
The price is just $3 or $4 more than fast food, but oh so much better!"}
{"text":"I managed to hit the AYCE buffet (all you can eat).  I was psyched!  Then disappointed.  It was fair but not what I made it out to be in my mind.  It's honeybears for me next time for a change but I will be back.  The cobbler was decent for an AYCE buffet."}
{"text":"I got the ribs and chicken which were both really good.  The cornbread and potato salad were good.  The issue with this place was it took literally an hour to get our food.  They had to retake our tables order and the servers had to be reminded for everything.  It was just chaos.  When we mentioned the bad service, it was stated \"you should have seen us a few weeks ago.\"  What a shame, good food with horrible service."}
{"text":"The service was great here, but I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about! The food was average...really nothing to write home about!  I had the bbq pulled pork sandwich and I really didn't care for it.  The sauce was to sweet.  I guess I'll give it one more college try, but I'm not too excited about returning! (sigh)"}
{"text":"We went to this rootin-tootin' BBQ for 2 of my friends' birthday. They are both Scorpios and the venue was a \"huge debacle\" with both agreeing - *sigh*. 

There were 7 of us and got seated right away. I had my eyes on the 4 piece BBQ ribs, but didn't see any bibs in sight and these bitches watch their weight so I went with Plan B. The chicken flavor and ingredients were delicious but why does you chicken have to be dry AS FUCK!??? I could hardly the tiny bits of leather that felt like there were left baking out in the Sonoran sun - blech.

My crew had the stuffed baked potatoes. They dug their own dishes but brought up the question - why do they only make a set \"x\" amount per day to sell to patrons. Why do you do this? ARE you that CHEAP that you can't spare to make extra for ppl asking for them? Shit, if you have leftovers, bring em home and make so damn hashbrowns for you family?

I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I used to love love love this place.  I own a business down the street. I don't go to the office anymore so I don't come down here often anymore.  Last night I thought about how much I missed the crispy chicken salad so I drove from chandler just get that salad...
That was a mistake!  First the chicken came out grilled. Then she took it back and we had to wait again for the crispy chicken.  We'll that was burnt. The waitress brought us our check before even asking us how everything was.  Later she came over to ask how everything was and I told her it was inedible. She agreed and walked away.  She came back taking $1 off each of our meals... really??
I guess I won't be driving all the way backnthere for lunch anymore!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  I got the MexiCali Pork salad which had a generous heaping of pulled pork!  It didn't have much else but the pork was delicious.  I looked at what the others in my group got and everything looked a-ok.  Which is why I'm giving this 3 stars"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place for lunch! You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorite is the salsalita chicken salad and chicken BBQ plate. Delicious food and portions are large. I always have to take left overs for dinner. Too much to finish in one meal. Heard their pulled pork burger is a must try. Always going back for more :)"}
{"text":"First time here.  Actually showed up on Buffet Day which I'm told is First Wednesday of every month.  So it was great timing.  But, they didn't have Ribs on the buffet which is what I wanted to try.  So I ended up ordering the Q-Sampler to get a taste of 2 meats of my choice and some ribs.  I went after the ribs first and they were really delicious.  Super smokey and really moist.  I immediately regretted not going after the full rack of ribs.  But I got into the brisket which was also fantastic and moist.  I also got some corn bread that was amazingly moist and tasty as well.  So the theme here is good BBQ that is very moist.  I highly recommend the ribs!!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ and pulled pork I have had since Virginia! I was told it was good but could not fathom it until the first bite, then the second and third.......... The flavor carried over to all of their meats served and everything else at the buffet was worth the 20 minute lunch wait. I got the buffet not because I actually eat enough to get a lot of food but so I could try a little of everything. Too bad only open for lunch but in today's economy that tells you something if they can make it only serving lunch.
NOT greasy as some have tried to say - I cannot stand greasy food and it's a BBQ joint of course the meats got sauce........
Now GO!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who has been here many times and recommended it.  I wasn't disappointed.  First, we came during the lunch rush and it was busy.  However, we were still seated immediately and served by a friendly waitress quickly.  The food then came out in about 5 minutes!  I had the rib tip plate, and it was very good.  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich which was also good.  It's out off the beaten path but worth the trip.  When you pull into a place out in a strange location, and it's packed?  Good sign."}
{"text":"I love this place. They are close to work and they serve the food in large portions. I have to get my hands dirty and they don't judge me when I use utensils to eat ribs. If you do use your hands though there is paper towel on the table that you are free to use. I would like to call on an artist that I like and I think his song illustrates what this place is all about. 

Robert Earl Keen \"Barbeque\"

Ooh, when I was a little boy, only one or two
First thing I did enjoy was a plate of barbecue

Barbecue, sliced beef and bread
Ribs and sausage and a cold big red
Barbecue makes old ones feel young
Barbecue make everybody someone

If you're feelin' puny, you don't know what to do
Treat yourself to some meat, eat some barbecue

Now there was once this girl I knew, she treated me so mean
I offered her my barbecue, she licked my platter clean

Barbecue, sliced beef and bread
Ribs and sausage and a cold big red
Barbecue makes old ones feel young
Barbecue make everybody someone

If you're feelin' puny, you don't know what to do
Treat yourself to some meat, eat some barbecue

Now don't give me no broccoli or any Swiss fondue
Baby, if you want to rock me, give me good ole barbecue

Barbecue, sliced beef and bread
Ribs and sausage and a cold big red
Barbecue makes old ones feel young
Barbecue make everybody someone

If you're feelin' puny, you don't know what to do
Treat yourself to some meat, eat some barbecue

Don't send me to Heaven, it ain't where I should go
'Cause the Devil's got a charcoal pit and a good fire down below

Barbecue, sliced beef and bread
Ribs and sausage and a cold big red
Barbecue makes old ones feel young
Barbecue make everybody someone

If you're feelin' puny, you don't know what to do
Treat yourself to some meat, let your feet hit the street
Find a good place to eat, get some barbecue"}
{"text":"Advisory for all new college grads working in this area: 

So, you thought the \"Freshman 15\" was horrible? Well, prepare to meet its not-so-distant cousin, the \"Cubicle Cincuenta\" if . . .

1) You have a sedentary job 
2) Said sedentary job is nearby The Barbecue Company (The BBQ Co)

My work was in this area three years ago, and I know I packed a bit on. Chalk that up to taking two years off from Track & Field. 

It's not the best barbeque you will ever taste, but it makes for a delicious lunch. My coworkers and I would go WAY too much. Everyone leaves happy.   

Some of my favorites . . . 

1) The Texas Twister: Brisket with barbeque sauce capped with fried onion strings
2) Classic Pulled Pork Sandwich 
3) Q-Spud: Behemoth loaded baked potato with your choice of meat 
4) Caesar Salad with the Salsalita Chicken 

As far as sides go, don't miss out on the Kentucky Blue Cheese Slaw. Seasoned fries here are just OK. Sorry, no alcohol is served for all you lushes out there looking for a pint or three. 

Always friendly service; the ladies here got to know everyone in our office by name. Oh wait, not sure if that's a good thing . . . Someone get us into The BBQ Co Addicts Anonymous. 

Hit up their website for Barbeque Bucks. Have to spend a minimum of $5. Don't forget that punch card, either! 

If I recall, the first Wednesday of the month they do a BBQ Buffet. Never partook, but looked ridiculous. 

Tip: NOT open on weekends. 

If you don't mind your jeans screaming in protest a la cutting into your skin from all the calorie-laden goodness, hit up The BBQ Co for a workweek lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"Yesterday my sister and I stumbled on to a local secret, excellent barbecue in a local industrial area.We knew by the smell as we walked in that we were on to something good.

They have all the usual meats, smoked Texas style, plus burgers and \"salads\". I had the brisket cheesesteak. My sister got the trio of sliders, pork, brisket, and chicken. The meats were melt in the mouth good! The house made sauces on the table were very good. The sides are generous, fresh, and tasty.  

At the table next to us, a woman ordered a salad the likes I have never seen. I think there were greens and vegetables, but it was hard to see them under the huge pile of meat on top. Great way for a carnivore to feel virtuous.

It's a pretty large, nicely decorated place, and was very busy.  Like most barbeque joints, they are only open for lunch Monday through Friday.  If you love Texas barbeque, you should add this place to your rotation."}
{"text":"Thanks to my friend Erin for showing me this place. Tucked away in an industrial park, I was finally impressed with a BBQ place in AZ.  The place fills up quickly, so she recommended we get there around 11 or after 12:30. On the first and third Wednesday there is a buffet - but this was not that Wednesday. 

Looking at the menu I ordered by name and chose the Big Butt. It was a huge pulled pork sandwhich and I couldn't finish it. I ate the pork, but left the bun and some of the fries. I found it to be tender and juicy. It has some sauce, but I sprinkled a little of the molasses on top and it was the best I have had so far in Phoenix. I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. 

I ordered online so i could take out my food. The online process was fast and easy. 
When I arrived the food was just being boxed up, right on time hot and fresh. Nice to know it was not sitting there for awhile getting cold and soggy. 

I ordered the Brisket burger. It is a cheese burger that comes with BBQ sauce, Brisket and bacon. There wasnt too much sauce which was nice, i hate having things smothered in sauce and making the bun soggy. The Brisket was okay, good flavor but could have been more tender. The burger itself was cooked well done. I prefer my burgers with some pink. I guess i should have indicated that online in the comment section while ordering. Overall the burger was just okay.

I also ordered a cup of chiken tortilla soup as a side. This was very good! packed with flavor, had a little kick. It was filled with shredded chicken and corn it was very good! I liked it better than the burger. 

Over all meal was good. I would come back and try other items."}
{"text":"Easily the best BBQ in Phoenix.  Love this place, don't let the interior fool you, the food brings people back."}
{"text":"Awwww yeah!  Get in here while the getting's got to be gotted (what?)!

Though only open for a few hours, TBC serves up some dishes that still makes me tingle in all the right places.  And wrong places!  Okay you can stop dry heaving, now.

The BBQ Sampler Plate seems a bit pricey at about $18 but you do get a nice spread of:

2 meaty-ass ribs
2 choices of meats
2 sides
Either a biscuit or cornbread

I went for pulled pork and beef brisket for ma meats and spicy cowboy baked beans and veggies for ma sides.  Everything I ate made me want to slap Chris Brown's mother in the face...with flavor!  Beans were indeed spicy and smoky, veggies be awewsomely buttery/oily/delicious, the pulled pork was tasty but the brisket....

Oh.

My.

Beef.

Shitgoddamn that brisket was good!  So tender, so juicy, so moist!  Like what I imagine Olivia Wi...nevermind - rambling of the mind.

Bottom line: Eat.  Here.  Now.

Grade: Everything really is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I'm trying to find redeeming qualities here. I ordered the brisket plate and was sorely disappointed with the brisket. The garlic mash was fine, the veggies were average, the coleslaw was decent, and the beans weren't that special. But the brisket was just awful! It was brought out in 3 long, thick strips with grill marks on them. All 3 pieces were tough and dry. Tasted like someone trying to imitate BBQ.  I expect brisket to be moist and juicy. I should be able to easily pull it apart with my fork or teeth. This was nothing like real brisket. 

On a positive note, the service was great!

Also, thanks Kris for the note. Because of your response I'll come back and give it another try."}
{"text":"Saw this place on TV and thought I would check it out. 

I had the rib tips and chicken platter. It was really good. There was good flavor on the tips and the sauce was Caramelized perfectly. 

The wings are the whole wing and had good flavor (I liked the hot better than the BBQ). 

If you are a Texas BBQ person go here with an open mind and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Incredibly friendly staff and very quick . They get busy during lunch but move people through quickly without making them feel like cattle."}
{"text":"Red rover red rover send my taste buds over.. to bbq company!

My father and I were in need of lunch and I wanted to try something different.  Asked a friend and he said this place was awesome.. then I realized it was on the same street as the ware house I go to weekly.


So for 5 years I have sadly missed out on this place and settled for soft food or waiting till i made it home to eat.. how sad.


Parking was easy.. walked in, place was clean and pretty busy but it was no issue to get a seat even at 1pm.

I had the Big Butt pulled pork.. wow! Bring the napkins! It was packed full of not just meat.. but also this little secret thing that only some restaurants have discovered called flavor..

say it with me..

Fl--aaaaa-v-ooorrrrrr... emphasis on the R at the end..

The mashed potatoes reminded me of something my grandma would whip up and I ate every last bit of them.

One thing I really liked.. you get your own drink. Now here me out.. I like service and all, but it can be a pain to wait over and over if you are real thirsty. And.. well I was :) 


I finished the whole sandwich, and the part of it that did not fit on the bread. I surly would have licked the plate had I been at home, it was that good !

5 stars, Ill be back next week for a meeting too!"}
{"text":"I remember coming to this place many years ago and totally loving it.  I recently went back and it was just OK.   I had the pulled pork sandwich and it wasn't very tender and covered in sauce (albeit very good sauce) and onions string as a side.   The onion strings looked really greasy, but once I tried them they were pretty tasty and crunchy.

I'll go back because there are so few dining options in this area of the Valley."}
{"text":"Well this place has grown on me a bit since my last review and so I am giving it another star (or half star i guess since i wanted a 2.5 before).  I have found a couple of sides I really enjoy (sweet corn medley, and cowboy beans).  They often have specials of the day that are very interesting.   They also have some pretty interesting regular dishes like the Q-spud (big baked potato covered in bbq meat and other fixin's and the Q-Turkey is a BBQ turkey sandwich).   I actually find myself liking the Sweet Sonoran Heat sauce they have on the table."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Rib tips & wings are my favorite. Less one star because of the hours. Would be a great dinner place."}
{"text":"If you like over cooked dried up brisket,  this is your place..... Is not for me.   The smoked meatloaf was very salty and tasteless.   The chicken salad was all dark meat which answers the question of where the rest of the bird goes when preparing the chicken plate toted as all white meat. 

Even cooper's town has better BBQ. 

Skip this place,  there's better places. 

Service was good though... Thanks Britney"}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered wrong, but the brisket was dry and didn't have much flavor, the sweet baked beans tasted like they were from a can, and the vegetables/mashed potatoes as the sides were a little odd when paired with my dry/flavorless brisket.  

An extra star for very good service."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is amazing. There is a large crowd especially on Fridays so you may have to park down the block. Luckily I work right across the street. You get alot of meat for you money."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I understand the mediocore reviews.  Some co workers took me here for lunch one day last week and I thought it was awesome!  I had the pulled pork sandwich and the pork was tasty and tender.  The fries that came with it were crispy and yummy.  I thought the price was good too.  Now I don't claim to be a barbeque expert by any means.  I have not tried every barbeque place on the planet, but this was yummy stuff in my opinion.  Will I go back?  You bet!  The staff were friendly and our order was taken quickly and served not long after.  One of my co workers had the brisket and he said it was tender and delicious.  

I would say the only drawback is that they are only open a few hours Monday thru Friday.  So if you're out this way at lunch time, try it!  I don't think you will be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Only stopped by once while on a job site close by, as you can tell by their hours (10:30 to 3 M-F) they cater to the industrial area lunch crowd.  We had the rib tips and dynamite sandwich both were very good, although a bit on the pricey side.  The place is quite clean and off the beaten path but I'd definitely stop by again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Parking can be a challenge at this place, especially at peak lunch times. You've been warned.

I normally get the Q-spud with pulled pork (big baked potato with all the fixins AND a pile of pork on top) or the sandwich with spicy BBQ sauce, topped with bleu cheese-infused coleslaw... I think it is called Dynamite or something. Can't recall exactly since it has been 'buffet day' the last few times I've been there. That's a real treat since they do an 'all you can eat' thing with beef, pork, chicken and rib tips along with all the sides, including dessert (normally cobbler and pudding). I think that occurs on the first Wednesday of the month, but would check the website to be sure -- it gets REALLY crowded on those days, especially around noon."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ for AZ. Limited selection however for what I like and they dont have a sliced moist brisket. this place has some of the best Wings in the valley and for that alone i leave this review. Get them dry rubbed!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in the brisket I had today. The roll, sauce, and onion strings on the sandwich were all fine...but the meat lacked smoked flavor. I paid around ten dollars for the sandwich (Texas Twister) and side (sweet BBQ beans- pretty good). I feel like this is overpriced. I can get a similar sandwich with a higher quality at Famous Dave's.

I ordered online and the food was ready when I got there, so that is a plus. I proceeded to eat my meal at the bar and was told by a manager that this is normally not allowed (so that people don't bypass the line that is sometimes there). When I commented on the food, she said we hope you can come back and try something else. Normally when I am unsatisfied with a meal and tell someone, they are apologetic...this was not the case.

Maybe there are other things on the menu that are good, but stay away from the unflavored brisket."}
{"text":"We've been to lots of BBQ joints in town and have had a hard time finding one that really stands out--until now.  This place is heaven on a bun.  It is in a bit of an obscure location with limited hours but SO worth going to.  Inside is spotless and the service is spot-on. But, the best is the food.  The pulled pork sandwiches on the amazing roll is the best you will ever get.  You choose a side to go along---one of us had fries and the other potato salad--and both were excellent. They had delicious sounding deserts but we were too stuffed to try them on this trip.  Guess we'll just have to go back and be super hungry!  You need to go here NOW!!!!!

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.We"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bbq place in the valley. I'm sure those out there will swear by others and they might be just as good or marginally \"better\" but this is the place for me. I always get a great meal and the prices are reasonable with friendly staff. Both the original and spicy sauces are fabulous and on the table for your unrestricted enjoyment. The only challenge you might face is parking scarcity and shortened hours with closed weekends. If you can make it, it is well worth it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. I came in with a coworker for lunch and we got sat down however no menus given. We waited like 5-7 mins before i got a menu and it took 15 minutes before they took our order. Waitress made us aware u get your own drinks, they were out of silverware and mac & cheese ! The food is tasty and good however bass on service alone i give it one star. Food i would say 3.5 to 4 stars. 

2nd time here and ill stick to ordering out."}
{"text":"Got seated by one person, another came over and introduced herself as our waitress, another came over and took our order and a completely different one came and gave us the bill??? Wtf? 
I ordered the brisket plate for 12$ with southwest Mac and cheese, beans and cornbread. 
I know what you're thinking when I say I got brisket, nope, not the melt in your mouth deliciously flavored brisket. This was dry and flavorless. The sauce they gave me was apparently for the mashed potatoes I didn't order ???  The food was semi cold by the time I got it so the Mac and cheese was disgusting and the beans were really good. At the end they asked how it was so I told them and they said oh you should have ordered the brisket that goes on the sandwich that's what you were wanting... Really? You asked me if this was my first time to which I told you yes and you didn't bother to tell me that you use two different types of brisket? Options are brisket sandwich and brisket plate, no description of any difference. I had high hopes for great bbq and was very let down."}
{"text":"Food was good the first couple of time,then all of a sudden the food as well as service went down hill. The Hostess have a horrible attitude on top of my food being extremely over cooked. Don't think I'll be back EVER."}
{"text":"Never trust a BBQ place that serves it's meats drowning in BBQ sauce and grease.  Mediocre at best, bordering on \"not good\".  Sides were \"meh\", BBQ sucked, prices were high.  I can't believe so many people come here."}
{"text":"Yeah the Pulled Pork sandwich is pretty delicious.  The Mashed potatoes are good too.  They are only open for lunch by the way and since they get busy if you are getting take out you should call ahead."}
{"text":"Very solid BBQ... My first meal was the Rib Tips and chicken wing combo plate. I loved the wings so much I ordered another wing plate to go with it. For the next 5 visits or so I only ordered the wing plate, highly recommended. The last visit I forced myself to try additional items... My waitress recommended the brisket burger... Very good burger however I wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked and it came out well done. I normally like the meat bloody, or at least a little. Next time i am going to try the Meatloaf since that was what got them on the travel channel and me to make my first visit there."}
{"text":"There's really nothing special about the food here. Same goes for the service. I ordered the BBQ brisket platter (comes with grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes) and the girlfriend ordered the chicken platter with sweet baked beans and potato salad.

The BBQ brisket was lacking in the smokey flavor and the nice outer char that you see in really good BBQ. Texture was a bit off too as it was more mushy than tender. It came with a side of gravy that was way too salty. Mashed potatoes were pretty ordinary and standard. The one highlight of this platter is the amount of vegetables that they give.

As for the chicken, it was little more than a simple grilled chicken breast with barbecue sauce on top. It wasn't marinated long enough for the flavor to really penetrate through the meat. It also lacked the nice char and grill lines that you see in better BBQ places.

Service was pretty lousy as we were rushed to finish. As soon as we walked in, she reminded us that the restaurant would close in 30 minutes. Before we were even finished eating, she gave the check and collected the tip. Meanwhile, another employee was already putting up the chairs and cleaning the floor. 

Considering the mediocre food and lousy service, I won't be coming here again. There are much better options for barbecue in the area."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time with coworkers.  The ribs had a tangy, slightly spicy (slightly) sauce which I really liked.  The fried okra was good.  The bleu cheese coleslaw was a little bland but still good (I just added a little s&p).  The cornbread was more like...cake.  It wasn't bad at all - just not what I expected.  I probably wouldn't order it again.  Service was friendly and attentive.  All in all, I liked it, and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Husband LOVES BBQ!!! I do too however I am often watching my calories- their salads are the freshest and I can order chicken filet  without sauce. And their dressings are homemade!!!  The food is always a generous portion and delicious! Now, for the service. you can literally feel the positive energy when you walk in!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my coworkers. It was crowded but they were still able to seat us. You still have a waitress to take and deliver your order. For sodas/water, you need to get it yourself. There is a line but moved relatively quick. I ordered a lunch combo. The meat was a bit tough for me. Seasoning is great. I also ordered a side of corn bread and sweet potato fries. They are both sweet and tasty. 

Service is pretty good. Considering how busy they are during lunch hour, they still tried to stop by to check up on you. I'll come back here again to try their briskets. Overall I think this restaurant is decent."}
