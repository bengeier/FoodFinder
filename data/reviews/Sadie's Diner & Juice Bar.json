{"text":"-5 stars literally saw the 'chef' lick her fingers over and over again while I waited for my orange juice. Then she started setting up people's dishes .... With her bare hands...Disgusting place... Extremely unsanitary!!!! After waiting 10mins to receive my orange juice while almost puking watching the levels of sanitation plummet more and more I was then presented with half a cup of juice. When I asked to upgrade to a full cup I was then told that's the only amount I can buy? Okay guess they don't want to make money.   Tip- save yourself the nausea go somewhere  else"}
{"text":"This place is so overrated. Based on others' reviews, I decided to try what they refer to as \"Huevos Rancheros\" which in actuality are nothing of the sort. They were served with salsa from a jar, on tostadas (as opposed to soft, fried tortillas), and with beans, lettuce and cheese. They tasted fine, except for the fact that the eggs were slightly undercooked for my liking, but they were about as similar to huevos rancheros as Taco Bell is to tacos.   My dining companion ordered standard breakfast fare. The eggs again were slightly undercooked (runny yolks are fine, runny whites are not). That could be personal preference though. The veggie sausages were excellent, the bread for the toast was good, and the potatoes were good but not memorable.   The next time I'm at the corner of Adelaide and Portland I will go into La Merceria instead."}
{"text":"I was starving after visiting Body Blitz and I noticed Sadies Dinner across the street.  Having heard good veggie things about this place I decided to have a quick brunch.  I ordered the tofu scramble with veggie sausage.  I read the paper while I waited and my food was brought pretty quickly.  Huge portion of tofu scramble, potatos, 3 veggie sausage and brown toast. I loved it and the fact that hot sauce was provided without even asking.  The prices were very reasonable and the decor charming.  All in all it was great and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan comfort food and good service :)"}
{"text":"Am I the only one who finds this place creepy? Those painting on the walls - I was freaked out by them.  I also don't feel that this place is clean. I've never seen anything questionable happen - just that it feels like it's unclean.  Ignoring those, the service was good, and the the breakfast we ate here was good as well. The portion was just right so that we weren't too stuffed (which is a problem at other places where everyone has learned to supersize). It felt homemade, which fits this place very well."}
{"text":"I am reminded of eating at grandma's house, tacky but cute decorations give a welcoming at-home vibe.   The breakfast was not as nice. A flat, half scrambled omelette with bland vegetables were accompanied by plain and undercooked home fries. The 'organic fair-trade coffee' was more of a warning than an advertisement. Other menu items being eaten around me looked far more appetizing, but if a staple item like an omelette is lacking I'm not sure I'd be willing to try the rest."}
{"text":"I love their Tofu Club! The fries are yum, the coffee is so good, and as a side I've tried their fresh fruit salad which was just right.  In my experience service has always been top notch, the prices are really reasonable, and I've always been able to snag a good table.  On occasion I've shared the veggie burger; the grilled cheese; had some of the [daily special] butternut squash and coconut soup, and enjoyed them all.  But did I mention I love their Tofu Club!"}
{"text":"The room in the back smelled and there were a lot of flies around the table. The toilet did not work and they did not offer all the options on the menu. The service was fine, but the food was a disappointment."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this little diner is crazy cute. It's an old-school, no-frills diner with healthy made-to-order food.  I can't get enough of the breakfast burrito. It's fantastic, a great size, and so incredibly healthy. I know I should branch out and try more, but it's honestly great."}
{"text":"Stopped by Sadie's with a few friends who swear by it.  Although the prices are up there (for breakfast platters at least) you won't find yourself with a big plate or feeling full when you finish. The food is good for what you get, but the price could be lower/serving increased.  Vegan and gluten-free options for most if not all things, definite plus.   Great fries, pretty okay grilled cheese, got the non-vegan cheese and it was quite tough to chew.  Worth checking out, but don't expect diner prices or plate sizes.  Waitress was friendly, service was on the slower side."}
{"text":"Okay, while I can't yet recommend the food (therefore the 3 stars) having not tasted it yet, the owner is excellent for having righted the wrong of our last experience of crazy service.   We called the next day and heard that something was very wrong with the chef working that evening.  After firing the chef, he refunded what we had paid, and gave us a credit for a new meal. Very classy.  Will update the review again once we eat there."}
{"text":"Sad to say after a few weeks of bugging my boyfriend to check Sadie's, \"come on, you butt, there's a groupon!\"  (and great yelp reviews), we went and were disappointed.   It was a mixture of blah food and a very unhelpful waitress that got me.  I was excited to eat here for the gluten free options and really liked the sounds of the lunch burrito - when I asked for the burrito filling to just be put on top of the corn torillas from the huevos rancheros to skip le gluten our waitress coldly replied, \"No, they won't do that.\"  And that was the end of it.  Confusing because ONE: who is \"they\",  and TWO: the toppings are really very similar aren't they?  If I'm not mistaken, just trade out the eggs for vegetarian chili and you'd have a happy (and maybe returning) customer.  Sometimes it's that easy.  And sometimes people are strikingly lazy.  Anyways, food was alright, nothing to write home about-  what's with the not homemade guac?  It's very easy to tell.  Overall happy I had a groupon so we didn't have to pay full price."}
{"text":"I like the food, but not so much about the service. Some are great, some don't even come back to see if you need anything else and just stand there when there might not even be many customers. I've served through school - check on your customers.  Also the huevos rancheros is just not that great anymore. The tofu chunks aren't blended enough - so it taste really bland. The tofu can't pick up the sauce/spices because the chunks are too big."}
{"text":"Waitress had some attitude, but otherwise this place was great. Free trade organic coffee. And of course tons of vegan vegetarian options. Try the huevos rancheros,  see picture below"}
{"text":"Nothing special. I went on a Saturday at 11:30am with a friend of mine for brunch, and there were only 2 tables left in the back. I ordered the Huevos Racheros, with a squeezed juice of Apple, Ginger and Lemon. Overall, there wasn't anything memorable with the service, the food or the atmosphere/vibe of the place. The freshly squeeze juice was amazing, but everything else wasn't out of the ordinary.   I might come back if I'm in the neighbourhood, but otherwise, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Ah Sadie's. This place is a go to for delicious vegan comfort food. The decor is reminiscent of a 50's diner but a little more run down. Its deceptively small, don't worry there's more seating in the back. I've been here on a number of occasions and have never been disappointed. My favourite dish is the BBQ plate- the \"chicken wings\" are on a cute little toothpick so it reminds you of eating chicken off the bone. The meat is very tender and flakey and the sauce completes if and makes it taste like a real chicken wing. And on top of that, it's only $13 so it's super cheap for a delicious vegan meal. Everytime I go, I tell myself I'll try something new but I just keep going back to the same dish. But hands down, one of my favourite veggie spots."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars, but since I can't input a half-star for this rating, I'll round it up I guess.  First, I LOVE the decor and tables. It's very cute. I felt like I was eating at my grandma's house. That was nice.  I had the perogies. They were delicious. The plate came with salad, which I did not really care for (the dressing ruined it for me). For dessert I had blueberry pie. To my dismay, it looked squashed, and like they just heated it up in the microwave. That was my biggest disappointment. They could have done much better.  My husband had the BBQ plate, and that's probably what I'll have next time.  Bonus points for having board games, which you can play too. Came in handy while waiting for the thunderstorm to die out."}
{"text":"Sadies is my hands down fave place for breakfast! Their tofu scramble and veggie sausages are the BEST. I haven't really explored anything on their menu other than breakfast though - I love it a lot so it's hard to deviate.   I do wish they had a patio though.."}
{"text":"Sadie's is tucked away in a very unassuming corner near Adelaide and Bathurst. It is pretty banal in its appearance both inside and outside. I guess probably all this makes the food very exciting as you go in with subdued expectations. I think the variety of vegan options offered is great. The food is average to delicious. The huevos rancheros was good & the carrot cake was not bad. I will definitely go back if i want a quiet, uneventful evening."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and good food yet the service could be taken up a notch or two."}
{"text":"Saw a deal on Groupon for this so thought I would try it out. Sort of like a hippie place if you're into that sort of thing.   Had the huevos rancheros which was OK but since the last rancheros dish I had I was in Vegas that maybe an unfair comparison.  However the eggs weren't hot and only warm when it came.   Also ordered the veggie burger which was disappointing. The milk shake I got was way to thick for the tiny straw they gave with it. Had a hard time sucking it up.   True, I'm not a vegetarian but in terms of the quality of food I didn't find it amazing even compared to regular diner food."}
{"text":"The best vegan food in Toronto. Their vegan fried chicken is tops, their grilled 'cheese' sandwich could beat your mom's and I bet you a nickel if you go enough you'll rub shoulders with LA transplant actors, keeping the meat free world alive."}
{"text":"I will say it straight out to clear the air; I am a meat eater. But I am not giving it 1 star because I am a meat eater. Seriously, the food was bad because it wasn't fresh, and it literally injured me. I think even if I was vegan, I would be kinda mad with this kind of dining experience.  I ordered tofu club sandwich. The insides of the sandwich were pretty good, but the sandwich literally sanded my tongue. I think the bread was too dry and they toasted it for too long. The top of my mouth was literally skinned by the dry, prickly, sand paper-y sandwich bread, and it took around 3 days to heal. It came with a little side of salad, and seriously, the salad was WILTED. This is a vegetarian/vegan place and their veg were wilted.....I was so shocked, and so were my friends.  The waitress was really sweet and nice, but...food is another story. And I also remember the food taking an hour to come...we didn't expect it to take so long for three mains at a diner. There were barely any people and the three of us were just starving there."}
{"text":"Good selection for vegetarians and vegans Delicious food Really nice staff We came in near closing time they were happy to still cook us up a full meal"}
{"text":"are you kidding me.. how can this place get more than one star.. i'll tell you.. people who go there are hipsters with no culinary palette..   the food is so gross.. and not like 'it's bad' .. you'd think a kid made it. The place needs a visit from the health inspector. So many flies. I had the huervos rancheros. All wet, and all bland  Do not patronize this establishment. It's filthy, and if the owners cared, it would appear both cleaner, and have better quality food. It's a step below cafeteria food.  BLAND x 55.  that is what the place should be called."}
{"text":"Awww ... I love Sadie's!  It's cute, quaint and has a great vibe.  Every time I've been there, the service has been excellent too! A+++  The food on the other hand is either AMAZING... or very so-so. The best things on the menu (in my opinion) are the Vegan Quesadilla, the \"Chicken\" drumsticks, and the Burrito =]  A lot of the other food is very mediocre.  Lots of spice. Lots of sauce, and LOTS of grease! (....great hangover place!) - but not the healthiest place. Oh, and steer clear of the \"veggie bacon\" blech. It tastes like cardboard. I think it's just the Ives 'bacon'...   So yea.. I know I sound like I don't like it, but like I said.. it's hit or miss.  The food that I LOVE... I LOVE!!!!!!!!! I go there for my repeat orders all the time! :) I swear I could eat that Quesadilla every day!   I recommend you check it out.  It's a gem !"}
{"text":"This place had been recommended to me by SO many friends- specifically my vegan buddies. I went in August and was underwhelmed by the whole experience. The decor is kitschy and cute, the location is set away from the busier parts of the city, but I felt unwanted there. It was a weekend brunch rush, so I understand that we had to wait- that's cool, really!! But no one there would make eye contact with me, service took forever once we were seated, and someone behind the counter legitimately stink-eyed me! The food was so-so; I got a big plate of breakfast vegan yumyums and they were just OK. I'd come back to see if they happened to be having a bad day when I visited. Dine only if you have high self-esteem."}
{"text":"The salads are great and they have vegan deserts and cupcakes. I've been there lots of times and always enjoyed my meals."}
{"text":"I went at 1 in the afternoon on a Sunday planning on having something from their all day breakfast, there was only one other table in there, so they weren't busy.  I don't eat processed fake meats, which the menu is pretty much made up of.  They had fruit bowl option, which I ordered & it was really nice, but I also asked for 2 poached eggs...they serve eggs with many items on the menu. They wouldn't let me order eggs as a side, even though I didn't want toast & fake bacon & all that.  They place orders by old fashioned slip of paper, so I don't see how it would have been so difficult to give me what I wanted.     Also, they have a serious mold problem. You can see black mold all over the bathrooms & there is a not good smell in the back part of the restaurant, I think their plumbing could use some attention.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a friend, needless to say, I love it. It's close to where I work so I plan to eat brunch there at least once week from now on. The coffee is superb, the decor is adorable and the service is great.   You don't have to be vegan or veg, the veg meat is just as tasty and they use free-range eggs. Everything I've had here so far as been nothing but delicious and quick to come to the table.   It's definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"When I lived at NIagara and Adelaide, I'd go to Sadie's Diner pretty often with roommates, or friends. I love how kitschy the place is, and the servers are always friendly. That being said, the food isn't great - the breakfast options are usually just okay, although portions are huge. My favorite item on the menu? Chocolate, peanut butter, banana smoothie - BEST IN TOWN. I really like their coney fries too."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. My waitress from today should be fired. Extremely rude, slow, forgetful, disrespectful and unprofessional. I've never encountered such a poor work ethic and attitude before, and I have eaten there many times before without an issue so it was just her. She forgot half of my order so I had to remind her when she finally came around to take my plate. When she left the bill and took my money she said nothing, did not ask how it was or say thank you. Then she stood next to my table for 5 mins texting on her phone (!!) and as I was finishing up, I stood up to leave and she grabbwd the money tray in front of me and claimed I didn't tip. I did actually leave a small tip for her shitty service. Here's a bigger tip: don't forget to serve everything your customer orders, don't stand by the table on your cell phone, behave politely to customers and you'll be rewarded with bigger tips. If your customer isn't satisfied and you behave rudely to them, you will not receive a large tip and will be yelped.  As for the food, it was delicious as always, but overpriced honestly. And after her rude attitude today I will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was on break.  If you choose to come make sure to sit in the front of the restaurant and not the back."}
{"text":"As a vegan, anywhere that caters to people of my diet is great....I can pretty much eat everything on the menu here which is a definite joy and probably how regular folks feel at any restaurant. Most of the vegan restaurants in Toronto seem to be asian fusion which I do enjoy, but sometimes you just want a good ol' North American home-cooked meal and this is the place for it! Sadie's fare feels like it's been cooked by a friend - a vegan friend who is a really decent cook.   I've been going to Sadie's since it first opened. Yes, sometimes the customer service can be hit or miss (usually the crap servers don't last very long) and seating can be rather cramped if the place is super packed. I recommend going on evenings and mornings when the place isn't too crazy packed. Weekday mornings, and Mon, Tues and Weds nights are usually the best.   For breakfast (and the greatest cure for hangovers for vegans), I recommend the Tofu Scramble with a side of veggie sausage, red pepper and tomato soup (mmmm), and a fresh squeeze juice. What I love about the crew here is their super awesome about customizing your drink for a wee bit extra. I usually pay extra for an orange juice base instead of the soy milk and add on a fruit. Best smoothie in the world is Blueberry, Raspberry and Strawberry with an orange juice base. It's a great way to kick-start the day and well worth the extra $$$. The coffee is fair trade organic and delicious black which is the true test of a good brew.  For lunch, the Vegan BLT is to die for.   Dinner faves are the caesar salad, the BBQ plate (although I find the corn on the cob can be rather cold by the time you get it - this meal is all about the vegan drumsticks), the vegan cajun quesadillas, and of course for desert, a vegan cupcake to complete the meal.  Avoid: The cooney fries can be hit or miss, the grilled cheese, and the burger (it's just an Yves burger and is something that could be easily made at home).   Check-out: The awesome Pez collection in the back of the restaurant. It's pretty epic."}
{"text":"In a word \"FIlTHY\".  I have enjoyed Sadie's food many times in the past. This was the first visit where I had to wait for a table. Standing near the front of the restaurant I got a glimpse over the counter. The grill, walls, floors, pans etc were covered in thick sludge. The chef repeatedly placed the spatcula he was using in a spot under the grill. I highly doubt this area had ever been cleaned!  The staff member that was making juice dropped an apple on the floor and simply rinsed it under water and placed it in the juicer. In the 15 minutes I stood there I had seen enough to walk out the door and never return. Shame on you Sadie's. Please clean up your act."}
{"text":"Walking Around Toronto, You Can Stumble Across GEMS Without Even Looking For Them. This One Was Obvious, Even From The Outside.

{"text":"The best vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Toronto.  I've been here multiple times.  The food is extremely reasonably priced and you get a lot of it.  When I take my girlfriend we share the entire three course meal as it fills us easily.  Extremely delicious.  Also, who doesn't love bottomless coffee?  You must try the vegan cheese cake.  The tofu sandwich is insanely good and well presented.  You can also customize your fresh fruity drinks!  They also have a very good selection of beer and wine, which also includes vegan options.    I highly recommend this place to people of all dietary lifestyles."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere that serves Vegetarian/Vegan food. I went around 5-6PM and the place was completely dead. The service was super friendly and were happy to give me information about what they offer. The laid back environment might be appealing to some people, but I found the restaurant to be outdated - in the sense that things were falling apart, unclean, etc. Very dim inside and empty restaurant makes it hard for people to feel comfortable to step foot in the restaurant. The smoothie was well-made, but nothing special for me to go back."}
{"text":"It fits the definition of what a diner should be: cheap, retro, laid back atmosphere, serving simple american comfort food. Go there expecting fine dining cuisine and you will be disappointed.  However, even though diners serve simple food a good one knows how to make it taste great. Unfortunately for Sadie's they failed at this for me. Everything tasted flavourless and imitation. I've had vegan/vegetarian versions of everything on that menu that tasted way better.  I would go back for the chilled atmosphere but I would stick to only ordering the drinks or deserts."}
{"text":"If you're into bland food and aloof service, then this is the place for you.   Sorry Sadie's, you give brunch and vegetarian food a (really) bad rep. Perhaps you should re-up on flavor town and hire some staff that aren't warily close to passing out?"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food (at this price point), 5 for other parameters.  Sadie's had a groupon deal so I snatched it rightaway and went for a dinner with my partner yesterday. At a first glace, the place does NOT appear to be vegan, you know, since there is no pretentiousness or faux modern decor. I thought that the place was built, for cooking greasy meaty diner food if I may add, in the 70s and never renovated since. Tables are old school laminate with metal rims and metal stands, chairs and cushions are bright red rexine and the decorations are tacky but really cool (including a showcase full of PEZ dispensers).. haha! I like such old style places.  We started with smoothies - blueberry-banana and banana-chocolatechip and these were absolutely delicious (made with soya beverage ofcourse). Our mains on the other hand were quite disappointing. The vegetarian burger was okay-ish but I'd suggest avoiding the vegan cheese thing (what an irony!) which tastes like chemical laden goo. I ordered the lasagna which sounded and looked very impressive, but it took one bite for my expectations to collapse like a house of cards. The salad was okay. I would eat the mains for, say, $6 or &7 but not for a double digit price tag. We finished off with a vegan cherry pie and our thoughts came to a consensus that vegan pies are not for us.  With one chef and one waitress working at that time they seemed to have things in control and indeed this was reflected in the quality of service and attention. Just for that, I will certainly go once again, bravely try something new (it's vegetarian, what could go wrong) and hope that the food, next time, tastes better."}
{"text":"This is a awesome place to eat if you are a vegetarian or vegan or neither for that matter.  It's a nice cozy place with super friendly service.  Originally I only went for their brunches but they have delicious dinner choices as well like the BBQ platter.   The best item on the menu is their egg-less Huevos Rancheros.  The Buckwheat Waffles was my first choice but their Waffle maker was broken for months so it lost the title.  Tofu Scramble is always dependable and delicious.  I'm a big coffee drinker and Sadie's has some of the best coffee I've had yet.  I think it's organic but I'm not too sure."}
{"text":"Best pancakes in the city? My vote goes to Sadie's. I absolutely crave these things sometimes! They have a variety of flavors of pancakes, banana, blueberry, apple cinnamon, chocolate chip. I have tried them all at one time or another and they are fantastic.   What they do is get the chosen ingredient into the batter of the pancake making each bite a delectable treat of flavor. You get three large pancakes per order which is more than enough. Only issue I have is with the crappy maple syrup containers they have, it takes days to get a good amount of syrup out of those things!  I cannot comment on much else here other than the wonderful smoothies they have (chocolate/peanut butter!) but it is very busy here on weekend mornings and early afternoons so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  Staff are a little rough around the edges but generally okay. I have noticed that they have changed their hours and are now open later. A great thing!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service was amazing, the waitress was really nice. I had the BBQ plate with vegan chicken, which had wooden skewers buried inside to serve as the bone. It was really authentic, to an almost scary degree but I really appreciated that.  It was comfortable and warm after a cold walk outside. I've been here before and had their french toast and loved it. Definitely visit this place, vegan/vegetarian or not!"}
{"text":"Many years ago, when Sadie's first opened around the corner from my then-office, me and a party of allies from work donned our mithril armour and set forth t'ward this diner of legend. (It was a long time ago, so the details may be a bit off there.) Alas, the experience was altogether displeasing, thanks to the attitude we got from our server. Long story short, we ordered the straight-up lunch burrito, got breakfast burritos (with filthy ova in them), and the server indignantly refused to apologize or acknowledge that this simple mishap was in some way her nefarious doing.  I vowed that I would never return to Sadie's.  Now, there exists some alternate universe where I more generally make good on my vows, and never did go back. This is a tragic universe, for Sadie's has since become one of my favourite vegetarian restaurants to frequent (or even occasion). The alternate-universe Andrew never did try their burrito, delicious diner fries, or even the scrambled-tofu version of the breakfast burrito he was so unfortunately handed on that fateful workday lunch. O how thinking about this universe doth sadden me. Let's never speak of it again. (That server, by the way, I've not since seen. I assume she never lasted long in the service world. The servers they have now are top-notch.)  I love Sadie's, but I can dream up more for this place. While their homemade offerings are certainly delish, my disappointment is in the dishes that they don't make in-house. The veggie burger, for example, is, I believe, the same Yves burger patties you can buy in a grocery store. Not a particularly appetizing or unique option, and not something that would get people coming back. I guess I'd love to see what they could do in the way of a house-made veggie patty.  Conclusion: Throw the Yves burgers to the bowels of Mount Doom whence they belong, and summon a lunch burrito for whatever daring quest you might have in the neighbourhood of Queen and Bathurst.  I wonder what alternate-universe Andrew is doing right now... (Twist ending: He's DEAD! Probably.)"}
{"text":"You know what? I think vegans are really easy to please. This place is..MEHOK.   Its got some some character on the inside, old kitchen tables that look like they're from the 70's, red booths, cool looking tattooed waitstaff, etc etc. Everyone around me was ordering the burrito so I had one, too.  It was sort of tasty - the way to describe it would be...taking some not so spicy veg chili and throwing it into a tortilla. Not very exciting. It was very liquid in its consistency- would have been nice to throw some rice in there and give this thing some body.   The side salad it came with was just some mixed greens and two slices of sugary canned tangerine (mmmm?).  For an extra two dollars, you can get a scoop of guacamole! Maybe two spoonfuls worth. Not great.   Should have stuck with a Bitondo's veal sandwich. Infallible.  PS: I noticed they were using the same shitty frozen fruit from Wal-mart that I use at home for smoothies. IF you're going to call yourself a juice-bar...use fresh stuff. And at least wash it first."}
{"text":"worst service i've ever experienced. My boyfriend and I walked in and were told by another couple to just take a seat or we'd never be seated. SO TRUE. We sat there for 15 mins without being noticed. Finally someone came by with a menu and water.   The food came promptly which was nice. The fries were awesome and the rest of the food was edible, but not great.   Overall, it was a disappointing experience and I would not go back."}
{"text":"I can't believe how many times I've walked by this place without trying at least one meal here, considered I used to work down the street for the last three years.  Well that all changed on Friday, when I used an ethical group deal (which they honored with no issues) and went for dinner.    I actually thought it was a typical greasy diner and was shocked (and pleased) to discover its a meatless restaurant that is also vegan friendly!  The menu is pretty big and they have a large selection of both vegetarian and vegan choices at reasonable prices. I tried the Veggie Burger with fries, which was extremely tasty and filling.  Extra toppings for the burger are $1 more (each) and you get add on's like soy cheese, grilled eggplant, roasted red peppers, veggie bacon etc.  For dessert, I tried the vegan mocha cheesecake.  It was just ok, not as good as I hoped, however, I'm not a big cheesecake fan in general so my judgement may be off on whats a good vegan version.  I'll definitely be back though as there are many unique items to try, the service is great and even at regular prices, its good value.  if you want a quieter, more private table away from the kitchen, there is a whole section in the back.    I was amused their menu is on myspace, I mean do people really still go there?"}
{"text":"Wonderful diner. Massive mugs of great coffee, friendly \"You want it, we'll do it\" service, vegan and vegetarian options... For everyone. Love it."}
{"text":"Update: The owner of Sadie's contacted me via Facebook.  He was very nice and apologized for my experience.  He let me know that the staff member was wrong regarding the Groupon terms, and was very nice about everything, including inviting me back for another meal.  I have not been back to Sadie's yet, I will write another follow up when I am able to make it back.  I took way too long to post this update, and apologize to Sadie's for that, I was hoping to get back to include my updated experience.   I've updated my Star rating to a 3/5 because the owner was very good with addressing my concerns."}
{"text":"Sorry Sadies - I would give you a higher rating but last time I went the food and service was so-so. However, I went the morning after halloween so they we're busier than normal.   1. really cute atmosphere - kitchy, low-key, diner style, nothing fancy. 2. Go for brunch after a night out of partying or for a casual lunch.  3. prices are very reasonable.  4. service is laid-back, i've had to 'find' my server on the odd occasion but that's usually on sat mornings so i am assuming they are as hung over as i am.   I recommend: vegan BLT, Chocolate chip pancakes, quesadilla, vegan sausage, home fries (i like more things i just can't think of them right now). i don't recommend the tofu scrambled eggs (some things just aren't meant to be mimicked).   i don't suggest going there if you're with anyone who is a 'bacon and egg' lover - this place will probably disappoint them."}
{"text":"Sadie's is a hidden downtown gem with the most awesome display of vintage Pez dispensers.  Very cute!  It's a perfect lunch spot if you're looking for something low key and casual.   I've recently come back from living in California for seven months so when somebody brings up going for burritos here to me I can't help but feel like a bratty, snob about it.    My friend really wanted me to try it so we had split a massive vegetarian burrito.  The waitress was kind enough to serve it on two separate dishes with a side of greens.  It wasn't bad!  I would probably order it again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a Sadie's review yet - what an oversight!!  I love diners and I love vegetarian/vegan vittles, so Sadie's makes me very very happy.  What I look for in diner food is: Hearty, Hot & Homemade, and I definitely get the '3 H's' at Sadie's.  Most importantly, the food tastes great and I get lots of protein, so I leave full.  Vital to a piggy like me.  For lunch I often get the tofu club sandwich with fries, which is a generous portion of delicious food at a crazy-cheap price.  I'm hoping that one day they will add veggie gravy to the menu and make my life complete.  My brunch go-to is the vegan huevos rancheros, which includes a giant mountain of scrambled tofu topped with soy cheese in place of the eggs.  They always bring you a yummy hot sauce, too.  I also get great service there; always friendly, the food comes quickly, and in the 50+ times I've eaten there, my order has never been messed up!  Really, my only complaint is that they're not open 24hrs.  Boooo.  Brand new to Sadie's:  vegan donuts, and apparently they're selling out fast!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sadie's a number of times and each time I walk out satisfied.   The staff and service is consistently top notch and I don't think I've had a Sadie's meal that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.   I'm a big fan of their breakfast/brunch menu. Their blueberry buckwheat pancakes are super tasty. My favourite item so far has been the tofu bacon club, using their yummy veggie bacon (I need to find out where they get it!)  Alright, I think I'm going to go for lunch today..."}
{"text":"Great food - great value - friendly staff - cool music. Worth the trip slightly off the beaten track. Try the chili."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  They really should make it bit more clear that they are a vegetarian restaurant though.    The real problem here is the service.  I don't know what the waitresses have on their minds, but it certainly isn't customer service.  I had two separate service staff forget a part of my order and just never came back to the table after our meal came so we just gave up and left.  Very odd - there were at least 4 people on and maybe 5 tables?  Take the extra 2 minutes and walk up to queen and go to Epicure - good food and service."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sadie's at least once a week for almost 2 years now. I can't recommend this place enough, everything is perfection.  The atmosphere of the diner is amazing. Collected, oldschool dining tables and chairs, new art on the walls every month, a HUGE pez collection, tons of great music.  The service is probably the best part. Right when you walk in you get a nice glimpse of the cooking line. Every staff member over the past 2 years have been nothing but pleasant and delightful.  The food... Ive had almost everything off the menu and let me say... ITS ALL FANTASTIC. The huevos, pancakes, burritos, vegan blts, samosas, eggs, coffee, desserts... you name it, its constantly made to please.   Taste is always consistent, service is always fast and Sadie's will forever be one of my favorite spots to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"Vegan - IF you want it vegan.  Otherwise vegetarian. (me)  Had walked by this place a few times over the last couple of years, and it caught my attention, but not enough to go in.  Then a co-worker recently mentioned it was vegetarian and known to be pretty good.  As a recently-turned herbivore, I had to check it out one day during my lunch hour.  I love the \"little hole in the wall\" places for the most part, which this turned out to be more than I expected.  A few booths at the front, lots of fun/retro/campy decorative things, along a counter and kitchen where everything is made.  Pretty much a true greasy, spoon.  But way better.  I got take-out, and another time since then.  My first visit, I asked to see the take-out menu.  The first thing on their 'all day breakfast' looked good to me, so I didn't let my eyes wander any further.  The Huevos Rancheros ($10) was pretty damn good (eggs, salsa, cheese, guac, beans & I think more than that, on a tortilla?).  I love Mexican and I love breakfast - so to combine the two is win/win.  Enjoyable fresh lemonade.  My next visit included the breakfast burrito ($8) - even better than the first visit.  Big, tasty, perfect.  Fresh cut, yum home fries on the side.  Gave in the Godiva cheesecake urge and don't regret it (perfect texture, not too rich or sweet).  Good blueberry smoothie ($5).    Not cheap, but you are getting what you pay for here.    Friendly service.  They are running around like chickens with their heads cut off at times, so be patient.  Also, go there expecting that you may have to do take-out since the tables may be all taken, depending on the time of day.  Can't wait to go back again!!!!!  I insist on trying something new each time thou"}
{"text":"I tried Sadie's Diner two days in a row and I have to say, my first experience was not great, but my second one was.  The first experience was for a Sunday brunch. The place was PACKED, stuffy and unbearably hot.  There were also fruit flies flying around everywhere and that really grossed me out. To be fair however, the service was excellent. There were 11 of us and our server was extremely patient. She even let us stay for as long as we wanted, which is extremely rare in breakfast joints that are packed full.  My second experience was yesterday. Since it was a weekday, the place was a lot less busy and a lot more bearable. It was not as hot and I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch get-together.   The food at Sadie's is good, especially for vegans and vegetarians. Their menu is composed solely of herbivorous options... and a lot of them at that.  The staff is accommodating and if you have allergies they will go out of their way to ensure you are happy with your meal.  The prices are extremely reasonable, especially for brunch places in downtown Toronto.  I highly recommend you stop in, but if you want my advice, go on a weekday rather than a weekend."}
{"text":"from what I gather I was just there on a bad day. I feel like a big part of  my dislike was the server. She was the worst! no sense of urgency or service skills. I ordered the veggie burger... it tasted like rubber, I was only able to stomach a few bites.  repeat.. I think not"}
{"text":"Good food and good selection. The ambiance was interesting, but a little bit stale. We sat in the back area and it seemed a little too cut off from the rest of the restaurant. Also, the washroom smell mixed with bleach cleaner wasn't overly appetizing. Great service though and friendly staff. We'd go again, if we were in the area."}
{"text":"My favourite time to go to Sadie's is in the evening during the week. Lunchtime and weekend brunch are too busy for me.  My go-to choices are the vegan lasagne, the veggie drumsticks or the Sheppard pie. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Sadie's is the vegetarian or vegan's go-to diner in Toronto. Accept no substitute! Gloriously kitsch decor, friendly servers, and a great variety of customers makes this one of my favourite weekend-morning hangs for brunch.   I've tried a variety of things from the menu: tofu scramble, club sandwich, french toast, waffles, and the grilled soy cheese which is a steal for a fiver (and comes with not just fries, but also a delicious pickle!). Sadly there's no espresso to be had at Sadie's, but the tea is just fine and refills are free. My coveted sinful pop Boylans is in stock there, and if you're feeling decadent,  the chocolate/peanut butter/banana smoothie is where it's at. Don't be afraid to stray into the more healthy range of drinks though, the citrus explosion juice is one of my favourite blends i've had anywhere!  Roll on in and experience some comfort food to the extreme - just make sure you're not wearing your skinny jeans that day."}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty. Their veggie poutine is awesome and different than some of the other stuff you can get in Toronto.  Real fries are a plus. Smells a bit wierd, which I'm assuming is coming from their bathrooms? But other than that the atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"Retro, old-age feel that takes you way back. The place is bigger than it seems, and has a pretty extensive PEZ collection and display of local artists. The food is pretty good. I had the vegetarian drumsticks and carrot juice. Definitely recommend the juice, it's good and cheap.   One criticism that I would make is the loooong wait for my entre. It took more than 30 minutes without many other diners, but at least the staff was friendly and gave updates on the progress of our food.   I'd come back but I'd make sure I didn't have anyplace to be afterwards."}
{"text":"I was a bit unsure of the place when I arrived because it looks like it's in an old house.  The decor isn't the greatest.  The chairs, tables, etc. are old.  My sister got me a Groupon for this restaurant since I'm vegetarian.  I don't have much experience with vegetarian or vegan restaurants so I was looking forward to trying it out but I was a bit disappointed with the decor.  I ordered a Tofu Club Sandwich and my boyfriend had the Tofu scramble.  We had an appetizer of deep fried tofu and we shared the vegan wild-blueberry cheesecake.  The food was all delicious.  The tofu on my tofu club sandwich didn't have much taste.  I would suggest just having a Veggie BLT instead.  Everything else was delicious!  The deep fried tofu was really good.  I LOVE tofu and we cook amazing tofu - almost all the tofu that has been cooked at restaurants has just been bla and flavourless.  I dipped it in the sauce they which was really good.  All in all - the food was really good and I'm very picky about my food, so - success!  I have another Groupon so I'm excited to try out something else there!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I love going to Sadie's for the food, great service and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"i had dinner here twice. i really like the decor, especially the glass encased display of pez dispensers! the service was fast, tables were a bit sticky.  i had the bbq plate the first time and loved it. potato salad, fake chicken on wood sticks, corn on the cob and vegetables. the second time, i went for the tofu club sandwich. this was a little bit disappointing. the tofu block was a little too thick and lacking in seasoning. i could've done with a bit more mayo too. it wasn't horrible by any means.  i'll definitely come back and try their quesadilla. the description sounds delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - the food is great comfort food and one of my favourite breakfast/brunch spots. The atmosphere is a little kitschy (in a good way) and really fun and casual. The service is laid back but prompt and super friendly. The crowd is eclectic and typically friendly and good-natured. It helps that the servers are all pretty cute!   The burritos (both breakfast and regular style) are my favourite. Definitely try them out and add some guacamole.   Also - your meat eater friends will be satisfied with most of the food here. The do serve eggs but can make pretty much all of the items with tofu instead.  There isn't a better place to get a good vegetarian and vegan brunch in Toronto right now!"}
{"text":"Usually I like to start my morning with a latte, but I decided to switch it up during a recent trip to Toronto and ordered one of Sadie's infamous smoothies instead.  A strawberry mango smooth...mmmmm.  I took a look at the breakfast menu and nothing was really calling my name, but if you're a vegetarian or vegan you'd probably be very pleased with the selection. Just a smoothie for me and I did end up getting that latte soon after, although it was down the street at Jimmy's coffee."}
{"text":"I'm not complaining about Sadie's - I wouldn't say that.  It's a decent brunch spot with a very good atmosphere.  We liked how it felt like an adapted house with multiple rooms for tables.  Servers were chilled out and perfectly good.  It was all...perfectly good.  It's just that nothing really wowed us and there are so many breakfast places to hit up in TO - not sure this one will tempt us again.    We started with big mugs of coffee and then shared the pancakes (we got chocolate and banana - mmmm) and the huevos rancheros since those were the items that have gotten called out the most on yelp reviews.  The verdict?  Perfectly good.  The huevos were generous enough and had a good combo of flavours.  I could nitpick that the beans were a little colder than I would have liked and the eggs were over-VERY-easy, so they were a little goopy instead of just having a nice, hot runny yolk.  I could compare them to the fabulous huevos at Insomnia on Bloor and wonder why I'd ever choose the ones at Sadie's, especially since the ones at Insomnia come with delicious homefries and a salad.  But I won't go there.  Pancakes were yummy and filling.  Nice touch to have them come with veggie sausages, although their choice of brand was odd.  There are so many good veggie sausages on the market and these ones were a little bready-tasting.    And, it's true, coffee is cheap but doesn't get refilled.  All in all, Sadie's is a sweet little spot (especially for vegans), but nothing that special.  We'll return for dinner one day to see if their other food is more exciting.  Vegetarian Score: 10/10.  It's a veggie restaurant, so it ought to get full marks.  We liked the choice between dairy and vegan.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"This is such a great little diner...I had the grilled cheese with tomato and a side of fries, and it was deeeelicious!  To top it off I had the highly recommended chocolate, banana and peanut butter smoothie.  Which, basically, was like dessert in a cup.  Soooo good, and I'm telling myself its healthy too!  I'm definitely coming back to try the waffles, as well as the buckwheat pancakes with cinnamon and apples.  And the Huevos Rancheros....which I guess means I'll be back MORE than once!"}
{"text":"I came here with Imran N. for a quick and cheap dinner before the Elite party.  It's a cute, quaint place. Pretty perfect for a casual meal.   I ordered the small poutine and Imran had the lasagna. He seemed to enjoy it. Unfortunately, I forgot to say \"vegan\" in front of \"poutine\" and inadvertently took a bite out of a real cheese curd. It was sooo good, but sooo bad for me. When I realized my mistake, they were really quick to fix it, giving me a vegan poutine within 5 minutes. She was also really apologetic, which was unnecessary since it was my mistake, but appreciated.  The poutine was great! And the price was right, $6 for a poutine I couldn't even finish.   I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Went here quite often when I worked downtown and when I feel like eating healthy. I usually go for their, Vegetarian burrito or their Veggie burger its better than any of the other vegeterian burritos ive tried such as soy meat burrito and the cactus burrito. Their guacamole was so fresh and i dont think thats even their specialty. It also came with a side of Mandarin Orange/Walnut salad which was amazing. All in all its worth a try and worth a trip from Scarb. The burger was better than licks but smaller, I ordered with the side of guac which was great and was fresh. Their breakfast is also good their Huevos Rancheros is quite filling which consists of 2 eggs with tortillas, salsa, refried beans and guac, I did not opt for the cheese as I am lactose intolerant.  The negative was that the waiteress wasn't very welcoming maybe they knew I wasn't a vegeterian or maybe it was 9:30 am on a Saturday.  Food - 4/5 Recommendation- Mandarin Orange/Walnut salad"}
{"text":"Went in because my usual brunch place was packed :( Retro brunch place feel homey and relaxed, perfect for a slow weekend morning. Crowd is mostly young hipsters and couples. I had the apple-carrot juice with vegan rancheros (were in a vegan restaurant after all!). Found the food a little bland but juice reviving and delicious worth the 4$. Might be back, but for lunch only."}
{"text":"Just what my long weekend of events and bars ordered...  a yummmmy vegan french toast dish with 'sausage' and a glass of freshly made apple juice! oh, and black coffee in HUGE cups ;) (sorry no soy 2 pump vanilla, extra foamy lattes)   portions were decent size and it took me a while to finish (read, I stopped for a bit and dove back in!)  def great Sunday morning breakfast/brunch! though a bit crowded, I can taste why ;)  I did feel a little under dressed seeing as none of my tats are viable and I hadn't put on my hipster uniform on that day (hehe I'm just pokin' fun :p ), but really, the staff was super nice, art on the walls was interesting."}
{"text":"It would've made 4 stars if service was better. The service was awkward because they didn't seemed to be approachable or friendly. Didn't know if we had to seat ourselves or wait. It looked like they were cleaning up to close. It's an Vegetarian/Vegan place and only reason I went is because my wife is really into healthy eating. I have to admit that the food was some good grub. I had the Western Omelet sandwich and the wife had the Huevos Rancheros, which looked really good and wished had ordered too. Coffee is above average."}
{"text":"What better restaurant combination could exist in the world than an old school vegetarian restaurant and a diner?  The fast, friendly, and not entirely clean atmosphere of a diner and the bohemian, pierced-and-tatted flashback to the 1990s before they were hip, classic vegetarian restaurant.  Sadie's nails both things so seamlessly, I'm amazed more places don't adopt this genre marriage.  Getting there at breakfast time, I figured I'd hit their wheel house and I was right.  I got an fried egg sandwich with veggie bacon.  While the eggs on the sandwich were just average, the veggie bacon was so realistic tasting, I put it on the side to savor last.  While I'm not sure the sandwich was worth $7 (the size was more about $5), it was a good sandwich.   The sandwich did come with french fries and a homemade pickle.  The fries were a bit on the bland (as in not salty) side, but extra salt and mustard really brought out their flavor.  The pickle was dilly, tangy brilliance.  What really makes this place really worthwhile though is the decorations.  It's a veritable Pez museum with what seems like almost a thousand dispensers against the back wall.  And the staff, while slightly aloof at times, definitely do a good job at getting food out on a timely basis.  I love that they offer both vegan and vegetarian options on most of their items and the crowd watching here is superb (it ranges from \"normal\" brunchers to dirty punk rockers).  And there's, of course, local art to check out (some of which is fascinatingly weird).  The whole experience of Sadie's is cool.  But not overly hip since it's still, after all, a diner."}
{"text":"All the classics of breakfast available in vegetarian/vegan form - what's not to love?! Sadie's Diner is a bit of a trek for me but it's well worth the effort. The decor is a bit dingy/eclectic and you might find bits of sand on your seat but embrace it and you'll be just fine.   Someone on here said they found the portion sizes too small but I thought they were very big! My fiance and I shared the breakfast burrito, which was more than enough for the both of us. The coffees also come in gigantic mugs and the waitress was good with refills.   Definitely check this place out if you're in the downtown area!"}
{"text":"2.5 Monday morning on a pseudo holiday, it was a great place to get an all day breakfast.  The menu has a lot to offer, with lots of vegan and veggie options, And they have Eggs as well.   I did really like their smoothies. And it was Banana Based and completely vegan (i.e. no dairy) and was thick, filling and tasted great! Loved the option to get supplements in it.  You can choose 2 flavours (i took strawberry and blackberry)  I wasn't too impressed with the service here for sure. The orders came prompt, but the extras took forever. She served my buckwheat pancakes without maple syrup (which were really dry) and and never came back to check on us or give me my syrup until we got her.  My friend ordered a grapefruit that had a huge black mark in the centr, but she did give us a replacement without fuss.   She never topped off my coffee, until asked.   For some reason she brought over hot water (for tea) in large mugs, which took up too much space on our already cluttered and small table, instead of refilling the teapot o bringing it to us in our own kettle.  Everyone (except) was having tea, and instead of carrying huge mugs back and forth (the empties) she could have made it easier on herself.   The orange juice my friend asked for took forever as well. And we were told that it's usually made my the dishwasher, who wasn't here today (??).  The food itself was okay, but nothing spectacular.  For $9 my buckwheat (apple cinnamon) pancakes were quite dry, and only edible with the maple syrup (in a half filled small pot that took a million years to come out).  Had to ask for a side of home fries with all dishes and seemed like an unnecessary extra cost ($2.50) that should come with the meal.   I was told:  The Huevos Ranchero looked good. The Grilled Cheese, was \"okay\".  The 2 eggs was okay too, but you can't really mess that up.   for 2 people, it was $35 for tea, coffee, Huevos, Pancakes, Smoothie and side potatoes."}
{"text":"the reason they call this place sadies isnt because of the owners name, its a pun on how sad of a restaurant it really is. i understand that this is a diner, hipster joint that is known to be a bit \"edgy\" but come on. we were seated at a filthy table outside which was infested with wasps. the server took forever to even come outside. i ordered the classic breakfast with bacon but seeing as how im lactose intolerant i had to go with the vegan \"bacon\" which i dont even know what the hell was. looked like dried beans cut up and stuck together with some soy paste. they were about 1/2\"x4\"x1/16\" looked and tasted the same as a popsicle stick. seeing as i was absolutely starving by the time the food came, i scarfed it down regardless. when asked if i was enjoyed my meal i told the server that it was a poor excuse for food and lacked any resemblance of life whatsoever. the server did not seem to understand. i told her it was fine, seeing as how i ate the food i would pay for it. she knocked a whopping 90cents off the total. and i left feeling like i just walked through the heart of compton plastered in gold, thats right i felt robbed. needless to say i will never be returning to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I love vegetarian food. My partner is a vegetarian. I think we checked out almost every vegetarian place in Toronto during our recent stay, and we were really excited about Sadie's. So, the one star is not about the meatless-ness. It's about mediocre, pretty greasy food, disengaged staff who are too busy hanging out with each other to pay attention to the food, and thus send out things such as my drink which featured a piece of scrubber sponge in it. Yup. When I pointed out to the staff the unexpected addition to my drink \"Oh...ok.\" I mean, I got a new drink, but not much else. I've worked behind a counter before, and I know mistakes just happen sometimes, but if that had happened on my watch, I would have been mortified, not nonchalant.  I tried to keep my spirits up and enjoy my meal. And then, I went to the washroom, and there were literally swarms of flies in each one. I gagged. I paid, I left."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Love the food, the service and even more so the decor."}
{"text":"Great veggie and vegan options. You have to try the veggie bacon. And it's so nice to have an all day breakfast place downtown with decent hours and great food."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect to get really greasy comfort food at a vegan diner, but you will at Sadies.   There's no meat at Sadies, although you will find some great food to fill you up. Their grilled cheese and fries are the perfect way to cheer yourself up during a bad day - it's greasy and cheesy and oh-so-tasty. The veggie burgers are also a solid bet, as well as the the quesadilla. They've also got a great breakfast menu with omlettes, buckwheat pancakes and a vegan BLT.   The diner is also decorated in a very interesting way - lots of mismatched furniture and a wall covered in a huge collection of pez dispensers. This is a great place to grab a bite of tasty meat free down home cooking and take in the unique decor."}
{"text":"I love the idea of a vegetarian diner and I wanted to like it so bad, but Sadie's falls short.  Don't think you can make a vegetarian happy by simply excluding the meat. Things still have to taste good and have a little bit of preparation behind them.  Their burgers are the same flavourless pucks that mean relatives will pick up from the grocery store knowing that you won't eat steak at the barbeque. Not quite worth the money, especially when you can almost see craft burger from your table.  I do hear the chili is good and prepared on site, but I can't imagine I'll be back to try it."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I've never eaten at Sadie's before this week, let alone never written a review about this cute little dineresque-spun veggie spot. I've lived in Toronto for about 2 1/2 years now, and as a serious veggie, I'm surprised I haven't been coerced into checking this spot out much sooner. When I first moved here, a friend of mine worked the juice bar at Sadie's, and I was always intrigued. Still, I opted not to, and then as I worked at Fresh for a year, it didn't seem necessary to broaden my veggie-restaurant-eating-experiences since I had so many options available to me at work. BUT LET ME TELL YOU: Sadie's is not to be missed! Its super casual and relaxed atmosphere is inviting and not of the somewhat pompous and elite attitude that I have encountered before in veggie/organic/raw restaurants.  I met a friend for brunch, and she had already downed a coffee, as I was slightly late. When the waitress brought me a coffee, and my friend a fresh cup, I was immediately struck with this thought, \"OMG this veg restaurants offers free refills on coffee!\" This is not something I have really ever encountered in a veg restaurant before, and for the tired or hungover, it's definitely a commodity. (VEG RESTAURANTS--TAKE NOTE!)  My friend is severely Celiac and so got the gluten-free pancakes, and I opted for the tofu and veg bacon club sandwich. Paired with a delicious side salad, the sandwich I was served up was the perfect size--not overly huge, it filled me up and left me feeling refreshed, not stuffed and gross. The tofu is lightly seasoned, the \"bacon\" cooked just right so it's soft and moist, and they pile on some sort of sauce. Add a little hot sauce and this sandwich is rad! Perfect brunch material! I had a taste of my friend's pancakes and was surprised at the texture--not the crumbly, dry, or sandpaper-like mush that usually suffices as \"gluten-free pancakes\" for the Celiac community. They were soft and perfectly sweet, but not overly so.   The bill for both of us was only $23... AMAZING! I have ended up spending much more than that for ONE at veggie restaurants, and for a modest meal.   This place is a hungover vegetarian's dream. Fairly healthy, but fun, diner food! And all veg! Plus, it looks like your cool, artsy (slightly boho) friend's kitchen. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sadie's is slowly becoming my second home.   I love everything on the menu, but the smoothies live in another world of goodness. The mango smoothie is simply out of this world. In the summer you'll find me sitting on one of the little benches out front, staring blissfully into Adelaide Street traffic while I sip on blended fruits. As people in their cars drive by and make eye contact with me, I use my powers of telepathy to inform them how wonderful my life is compared to theirs because I'm at Sadie's and they aren't.   Aside from smoothies, the burritos are also fantastic, both the breakfast (egg) and dinner (chili) versions.   In addition to stellar food, the service rocks. Everyone is incredibly friendly and I've never once felt rushed, even when I bust out a bag of post-dinner board games.  I will warn you, the summer is not kind to Sadie's. It gets *oppressively* hot inside. Why the owners don't install some form of air conditioning is a total mystery to me; if not for their customers, for their (suffering and sweltering) employees. I find it ironic that animal lovers would let people toil in such miserable working conditions. I'm not implying that it's simply warm inside, I'm talking more like \"I walked through a magical heat portal and am now dining in the Cambodian jungle\". It also gets a bit chilly in the fall/winter. Luckily I live around the corner and am not afraid of takeout if the weather isn't cooperating with my dining plans.  tldr: +4 for the amazing food and amazing service. -1 because the owners really need to install air conditioning."}
{"text":"We were expecting a vegetarian restaurant with a unique nice menu, but they had generic foods like veggie burgers and burritos, that looking at the place - how run-down it was and the seats were ripped, and we moved to the back because it looked nicer but it smelled like toilet so bad that we had to move back to the ripped seats of front - and looking at how expensive foods were, it was not worth it at ALL!!!  The one and only good thing about the place was their super nice server girl.   Food is too pricy, mediocre, and place is run-down."}
{"text":"Ohh I just don't know. Ok I would go back here based on seeing that the people next to me got these AMAZING looking wraps/burritos, and I would definitely get that they looked amazing, but my review is based on my experience which was very meh. I shared an order of large fried tofu as an appetizer and it was ok.. it probably would have been better if they had a bigger sauce selection but it was really just plain tofu deep fried which can be good with the right sauces. Then I got the vegan BLT which was very meh, the bread was nothing exciting/possibly stale, the tomatoes were ok and the lettuce... not good, the veggie bacon was just the stuff you can get in the veggie aisle at the grocery store, nothing special. On top of that it costs an extra $4 to turn your side fries into poutine which is just cray. My friend got the perogies which were fine but just really battered and deep fried. The best part was the vegan sour cream, and they have a solid beer selection!"}
{"text":"The food is great here, but the service is the worst I have seen. 25 mins for order taken, another 30 for food. Waitress does not come by or answer you when you shout out to them. Pretty poorly run spot."}
{"text":"This place was great. The atmosphere was nice not too busy and laid back. I ordered the buckwheat pancakes. They tasted really good. Portion size was perfect and the price was reasonable. The veggie sausages were decent and their fries were fantastic."}
{"text":"Live down the street, heard this place wasn't bad. Walked in alone to grab something quick to eat. Stood at the counter for 5 mins while the staff stared at me awkwardly.  I was kind of confused as to whether they were staff or not but eventually one of them got up and asked me what I would like. Not hi, not welcome, not can I get you a table, just what would you like.  I got a table and waited 10mins. No one came to the table to take a drink or food order of any kind. I got fed up and had enough poor service for one day so I walked out. I won't be going back.  I've been working in restaurants and diners for years. I'm a manager at the biggest sports bar in North America. If you can't even greet a customer and make them feel welcome you've already failed miserably.  It wasn't busy at all. The staff were just much more interested in having a conversation than doing anything resembling work.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Went back to Sadie's a while ago for the Huevos Rancheros and it is as good as they say!  In fact, just thinking about it now makes me want to go there...like now!  My non-veg friends love this place too!   If there is a Sadie's near my house, it would definitately be a regular spot for me.  They offer a good discount if you have a veg discount card (i think 15% off) AND I just heard they started using Daiya cheese!"}
{"text":"Pretty hipster restaurant, but great nonetheless. I had the cajun quesidilla which was delicious if a little sweet. Great crispy fries. Service was very slow but server was really nice. White chocolate raspberry cheesecake was decent, but not great. For vegetarian food it was pretty good."}
{"text":"A superlative hippie cafe.  Vegetarian friendly eating done right.  Huge servings.  Interesting touches and flavors everywhere.  The house baby green salad is rolling in dried cranberries and edamame along with a very kicky mustard dressing. Each serving is big enough to feed the entire Royal Vegetarian Army.  The house non-caffeine beverage is hot lemon juice with fresh ginger. They will offer you maple syrup or honey for it if you want but it is absolutely fine straight as served. Medicinal, bracing, energizing and it tastes good too.  Great omelets.  Savory breakfast potatoes with enough spice to be interesting without being distracting.  Huge plates of mexican style huevo dishes.  A keeper, definitely."}
{"text":"The actual restaurant is really cute, the menu is kind of limited, it's a lot of sandwiches (which they can serve with gluten free bread) and some breakfast. I ordered the soup of the day which was veggie ($5) however when I got it, it's seemed more like a mildly spicy chili (maybe the server got it wrong?) and it was cold :( . I was pretty full after that hearty 'soup' so I got the rest to go. I originally ordered the veggie burger but they were sold out of the that so I had to pick something else, the Vegan Rancheros: Scrambled tofu on corn tortillas with salsa, refried beans, guacamole & vegan cheese. ($12) This was actually really delicious, it's unfortunate by the time I got around to being hungry again it was cold as well but it was good even cold. It was a massive serving and I could smell it the whole time I walked home with it."}
{"text":"Tried the quesadilla; it's decent but nothing special.  The squeezed juices are good too.  If you're vegan, this is a place that may appeal somewhat.  If you're not vegan, and you don't like faux meat like \"vegan bacon\" - whatever that's supposed to be - this place is very limited in choice for \"hearty\" food options on cold days."}
{"text":"Sadie's Diner is a great place to grab brunch, especially when you're a vegan dating a meat-eater.  Ok, you're not going to find any REAL meat on the menu but they have eggs, milk and butter which is good enough for a carnivore boyfriend/girlfriend.   It's the best possible compromise on brunch.  My favourite item on the menu is the vegan Huevos Rancheros (which has been confirmed as being better than the one with eggs by two friends).  A very close second comes in the form of Buckwheat Waffles.  For the longest time I was a hater of buckwheat-anything, but Sadie's changed my mind.  You'll love their waffles topped with berries and banana.  Sometimes their waffle maker is on the outs, which can be a tad disappointing.  The diner, which plays rad music and has truly retro furniture, is equipped with a full juice bar.  You won't want to skip on getting a shake when you see that the person next to you ordered one.  Bad hangover?  Just go for the tofu club sandwich (two thumbs up) or grilled cheese and fries.  Insta-cure.  It can get pretty busy on Saturday mornings, so come early or swing by after 1 pm, otherwise you'll be wedged in between annoying girls barking about guys from the night before or you'll just have to wait."}
{"text":"I couldn't concentrate on the mildew or subpar food because this place is INFESTED WITH FLIES. Flew into mouth while eating. I left. INFESTED. Ugh."}
{"text":"I've only had a burrito there but it was excellent, too bad this place is not licensed."}
{"text":"I recently changed jobs and wound up working right next to this magnificent diner. It was already one of my favourite places to eat in the city, and then they put me right next door to it?!?!  This must be the universes way of telling me I need to eat here more. Fine universe! You win this time.  I can get a simple vegan BLT on brown bread, with some tasty mayo and a side of fries for only $6 (plus tax/tip). That's incredible! Also, very delicious and quite filling. Recently they started serving a vegan mac n' cheese that's honestly so good it might make you a little confused, sexually. It's not on the menu for some reason though, so you gotta ask for it.  I've noticed that everyone seems to think this is a brunch place, but I'll have you know that it's a great spot for dinner as well. There is a slightly different menu for lunch/dinner and if you haven't been you should check it out. I thought they were even supposed to be expanding their dinner menu but I haven't seen any changes yet, so hopefully that will happen soon. Then they'll be the perfect place for brunch, lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Wow! The tofu club sandwich tastes amazing!  Unfortunately, the portions have gotten smaller. I came here for dinner and left still feeling hungry enough that I had to buy a hot dog."}
{"text":"I admit I give Sadie's a star higher than I might normally because as a veggie, I can eat everything on the menu and the sheer fact that I've tried most of it and enjoy it all justifies the fourth star for me. Why doubt myself and feel the need to caveat before I start? Well...it a few things...but first, what I love about Sadies...  I do love a good diner. Sadie's delivers there. Eclectic decor, pez dispensers, classic red vinyl booths, old style kitchen chairs that don't match, adorable cow faced creamers - the works. I do much prefer the front section to the back but I'm not unhappy either way. Service is usually quite good. And they're almost always busy - especially for weekend brunch but I've rarely waited more than 10 minutes for a seat.  The food is delicious. The breakfast or lunch burrito is amazing. The traditional breakfast with baked beans mmmm, the huevos rancheros perfect! The french toast, the huge plate of pancakes - sides of veggie sausage or bacon, this is a veggie brunch lovers heaven. Portions are on the bigger side, I rarely finish the burrito and more often than not happily take half home for later. And it's pretty cheap for veggie fare which for some reason is often pricey (explain how veggie bacon costs more than real - which takes the manufacturing and processing of animals...but I digress before I lose you on my soapbox)...Sadies...is great price for really good food. You can go vegan if you like, they make lots of alterations - gluten free too.  Lunch options are just as tasty - perogies, my favourite blt with half salad, half fries, and real cheese!, tofu club, westerns, fried egg sandwiches, veggie burger, lasagna, soup...it's quite an extensive menu for veggie and non veggies alike. It's somewhere I don't mind bringing my carnivore friends as there is usually something to please everyone.   The smoothies deserve their own paragraph! Choose two fruits to go with your banana, add detoxifyer, immune booster or nothing at all - deliciously thick and sweet, and huge! The best addition to any Sadie's meal!  Now, my criticisms...the coffee...it's fair trade organic - kudos, but I don't know if its the coffee maker, but it's just not good. They serve it in a HUGE mug but it's rarely more than luke warm. I love a good coffee with my brunch and I just wish they had something better in that department. Then, there's the mistakes. My office orders quite often from here for lunch and for some reason, there's always something wrong with the order. I'm not talking like 20 orders, I'm talking 3 and all 3 have something mixed up. I try to avoid ordering over the phone which seems to return more errors than ordering in person. And then there's a consistency problem - one day the food is perfect and the next, you get a quesadilla that's only got eggplant in it, gross (no offence to aubergine lovers), they don't always have gluten free bread, not sure why.   But please take my criticisms lightly, I still eat here all the time and love it dearly - four stars! Its a danger when you're so familiar and so well versed in a restaurant and menu that you're bound to get picky. Try it, you may find me there!"}
{"text":"You may not get the most upbeat or friendly service ever, but the job gets done and this is mecca for veggie-friendly breakfast. Love this spot, and it's truly your best option for a weekday breakfast that goes beyond pastries."}
{"text":"After walking by and admiring their sign too many times to count, I finally entered Sadie's Diner yesterday! Don't ask me what took me so long, I don't have a good answer. I'm just glad that my friend Julia suggested it as our brunch spot and I ate their breakfast burrito with tofu, as I'd been craving something to serve as a hot sauce vehicle all week long.   I probably should have tried their famed juice bar instead of indulging in their giant coffee mugs, but I only drink coffee when I'm out for breakfast so my mind was made up.   It was my turn to treat and both meals with coffee came to $25. Not too shabby.   The central Queen Street West area needs more cute diner-y breakfast & lunch places like this. All the intriguing restaurants seem to be in Parkdale these days. Good to know there's at least one in the area. I will return to Sadie's!"}
{"text":"Awesome quesadillas, awesome fries. Quiet and relaxing in the evening,"}
{"text":"I come here for their omelette of the day occasionally (I used to go several times a week back when I lived closer), I like to get it with home fries and rye. It's been consistently fantastic for the past year and I hope they keep it up!  Keep in mind that it can be a bit busy during weekend brunch or lunch time.  I've only ever tried one thing on the menu, but I have been there around 40 times so I think it's fair to give a review :)"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on vegetarian dishes but the food here is tasty and delish, plus the decor is funky casual with helpful friendly staff, nice neighborhood hang out place.  These are the kind of places that define what a neighborhood is all about"}
{"text":"Cool place.  Cute, quaint, good food, cheap.  All vegeterian/vegan.  My friend invited me here. I invited another vegetarian too, and i'm happy she didn't know about the place. It's a hidden gem for the pricing. awesome selection of juices, smoothies, etc."}
{"text":"Sadie's Diner - Adelaide Street, Toronto - 3/17/10.  With much sadness, Belly Family prepared to leave their beloved Toronto behind. Belly Parents vowed they would return, perhaps next time with Belly Grandparents to watch Little Belly while they went out and partied their bellies off! Leaving in the morning, Belly Family decided to try for one last great breakfast before leaving. A search turned up Sadie's Diner.  After going the wrong way for some time, then getting lost, then making a wrong turn, then being on the wrong street, then reading the directions wrong...okay, you get the point. Belly Family got very lost..they arrived at Sadie's. Since Sadie's is in a very densely populated area, there's very little parking on the street, so Belly Family had to park around the corner in a metered spot.  The decor of Sadie's is fairly eclectic, and could best be described as a typical diner run by punk chicks. Bellyman had an asparagus omelet, which came with grilled potatoes (the called them home fries. They're not fried, they're not fries!) The omelet was properly cooked and very nice, but really not a whole all that spectacular. Belly Family had similar reactions to theirs as well.  Verdict: Bellyman approves. While there was nothing great about Sadie's there was nothing wrong with it, either. If you're near the corner of Portland & Adelaide and want a good meal, you won't go wrong with Sadie's."}
{"text":"Walking up to this place, I wasn't sure what to expect... it was pretty divey and in kind of an off the beaten path location in Toronto, near Graffiti Alley.  When I stepped in, I kind of felt like I was lost at a truck stop in Texas, and Sadie was going to pop up at the perfect moment to feed me and get me back on the road.    But it wound up being a little cozier than that.  Sadie's is a vegetarian/vegan place that serves traditional breakfast meals without the meat, and with substitutes that taste pretty close to the real thing.  The waitresses were super friendly and attentive.  I had the Vegan Rancheros, which was scrambled tofu with refried beans, guacamole and salsa on crispy corn tortillas.  I can't remember the last time I was moved to poetry by tofu but this dish makes the cut of one of the best non-meat breakfasts I've had in a long time.  I had a drink called the \"citrus sunrise\" with grapefruit and ginger that was memorably yummy.    Also, it seems that someone who worked very hard to collect Pez dispensers has found an installation space here. There is a \"Wall of Pez\" with hundreds of these things, lined up one after the other.  Without reading into why one may have collected quite so many Pez dispensers, it seems to have found a niche around the ambience and totally \"fits\".   I'll see you soon, Sadie!"}
{"text":"I went back because I believe in 2nd chances.  This time I ordered the scrambled tofu. And all I can say is if you can't do a decent scrambled tofu you have NO business being a vegan/veg restaurant.   What a bland pile of sh*t.  Crumbled tofu with a bit of bland salsa thrown in. Disgusting.  My friend had the huevos rancheros and its was the same bland crap piled on her tortillas.  She was laughing at me because she at least had the fake cheese and guacamole to help her stomach her pile of tofu.   Lacking from the scrambled tofu was, seasoning of ANY sort and um..vegetables, I like to see a little shredded carrot and mushroom...something!  It was so horrible that I had to say something to the server, who essentially admitted that they had 2 chefs, a good one and a bad one, so if you get the bad one, your food sucks. I got 50% off my bill, but nothing changes the fact that this was hands down the worst scrambled tofu I've had in my life."}
{"text":"VIBE  Tres hipster dirty chic. I think the cushions on the booths need a bit of a steam clean because they are so worn but otherwise, some of the most lovely staff I've encountered. It must be their diet. The veggies will be here (it's a veggie restaurant) and the creative folk in the area. It's a bit under the radar. Beside coffee shop La Merceria. My favourite thing is the Pez Dispenser collection. Amazing.   I ATE  Grilled cheese. OMG. Amazing. Perogies also strike the comfort food chord.  I'm not vegetarian and I loved it.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Don't be \"Sad..\" if you can't get to this location. They have another one in Kensington Market. Huzzah!"}
{"text":"I was pretty hesitant to go to a vegan / vegetarian restaurant being the carnivore that i am, but my GF and I made the trek out one Saturday morning to Sadies for brunch and it was great!  I had the Huevos Rancheros, which featured what tasted like some very fresh guacamole and crisp tortillas.  My GF got the standard 2 eggs breaky and even fake meat sausages were pretty decent.  Great service, quick, and pretty cheap too... I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I think I just don't like faux-meats.   My issue with my breakfast here is that... veggie sausage isn't sausage; it's not really even that close to sausage and I would have been happier with no sausage and a side of fruit.  The good: - the citrus explosion is a good juice  - the coffee was pretty decent! - my eggs were cooked nicely - reasonable prices - a lot of vegan menu options - they take debit and credit  The bad: - the aforementioned faux-meat (it's like when someone [Melissa B. circa 2004] offers you soy chocolate \"milk\" and says it tastes \"just like chocolate milk,\" but really it tastes like bean water with nestle quick powder in it) - is not really for me - the waitress didn't make a second appearance once the food had been dropped off - no coffee refills, no cheque and I had to chase her down to get a tea replaced  Overall, I will definitely eat here again and be pretty happy about it, but I would probably get the french toast or the pancakes instead of the eggs."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sadie's diner.  As a vegan, I'm always on the hunt for delicious brunch spots and this one is as good as it gets in my neighbourhood.  My meat-eating friends are fans of it too, so extra bonus points for that!    The fruit smoothies are delicious and energizing, but the chocolate peanut butter banana smoothie is to die for!  Definitely order this when you go.  You won't regret it.  As for the dishes, I tend to go with the all day breakfast offerings (love the tofu scramble) and the sandwiches.  My favourite dish is the vegan tofu club with the side salad.  It's the perfect balance of grease and goodness.  It leaves you feeling full but not at all sluggish.  Some might complain that the decor is a bit tacky or the tables a bit wobbly, but I think it adds to the old school diner charm.  This isn't a fancy restaurant but the food is always excellent, the staff are pleasant and the bill is very reasonable... and really, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, that's the perfect combination."}
{"text":"I have walked by Sadie's many a time and never even considered going in. I am so thankful that my sister suggested we go there for a late lunch last Sunday afternoon - I've been missing out!   The decor is absolutely adorable.  Don't expect anything fancy, but the kitchy retro furniture and the wall of pez dispensers has a remarkable charm that will definitely put a smile on your face.    The restaurant was super warm while I was there (just so you're aware - I don't believe they have AC of any kind), but as soon as my banana blueberry mango smoothie arrived, I was just peachy!   I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was divine. I seriously have nothing negative to say about it at all. Plus, anything that comes with a side of home fries is usually a winner in my books.  You can get guac with your burrito for an additional $3, but I'm going to tell you right now that it's just fine and dandy without it.  You definitely NEED to try this place out! Even if you aren't vegan or vegetarian (which I am not) you will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Sadie's is one of the few vegetarian/vegan restaurants that serious carnivores will agree truly rocks. Not only do they offer a great selection of contemporary North American brunch and dinner favourites that forgoers of meat may have grown up with, but now have to miss out on, there are even vegan options (like vegan cheese and sour cream) and it all tastes amazing!  If you're a tea drinker, behold the treasure chest that is a vintage cigar box full of individually bagged options. If you're a coffee drinker, refills can be expected to come around sooner than you can reach the bottom of the cup.  On my last visit, I found a trusty new favourite dish. The Cajun tofu quesadilla is wonderfully seasoned and perfectly accompanied by the vegan \"dairy\" options and tangy dressed greens.  The decor is adorable in that kitschy home away from home sort of way. The different salt and pepper shakers are small splashes of fun at every table. The art for sale on the walls feature local artists and changes often to keep things fresh. The collection of PEZ dispensers in the back room where larger tables are perfect for groups to gather over lazy brunches are fun to check out en route to the washrooms."}
{"text":"For vegetarian food, pretty good. Had their BBQ plate - really tasty. I didn't like the eggplant and wish they would replace it with something else but otherwise good. Not sure if it was just a fluke, but the food took super long to come out."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The restaurant itself is way too small, and always freezing cold...it is a extremely uncomfortable atmosphere.   The food is also horrible, the burger is very very bland. The tofu club sandwich was awful...I've made much better versions at home. I had to hide the taste of everything with loads of relish and mustard.   Don't waste your money going here. it is a waste. horrible!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as a group of 4 a while ago and we each ordered a dish and shared. Fab! Ordered a green smoothie (no longer on the menu?) as well and that tasted great. Sat in the back on a picnic table - that was fun."}
{"text":"If you're vegetarian and you crave a 'greasy-spoon' diner brunch, this is your place. Favorites are the Breakfast Burrito and Huevos Rancheros. Smoothies are awesome. Best vegetarian brunch place in Toronto!  It's a small place. In the summers, the wait can be quite long.   Servers are generally surly but competent. You're unlikely to get a smile or a chat, but you'll get your food while it's still hot (and what you ordered)."}
{"text":"Although I am on the opposite end of the vegetarian spectrum, I have to give this place 5 stars even though they don't serve any meat. They are deserving of my 5 star selection because of the menu that they offer. As my wife and I went for brunch and so a meatless dish can still be enjoyed even if we aren't vegetarians.  I enjoyed their menu for a few reasons. They have a bunch of specialty blended drinks that look very good, and although I didn't have one, there is a wide variety that should catch the eye of everyone. Also, they have a nice variety of breakfast dishes; pancakes, waffles, burritos, french toast, and the regular breakfast stuff. Finally, they have an omelet of the day that looked appetizing.   My wife had the Huevos Rancheros and I had the breakfast burrito. Both were winners and I would recommend this to anyone who comes here to eat. The rancheros were interesting because it reminds me of a taco salad with eggs on top. One thing that I really liked about my breakfast burrito was the fact that they used a thin tortilla, so I could actually taste what was inside. To top it all off, the organic (and fair trade) coffee was as good as the other reviewers have said. It comes in a huge mug that is probably the size of a large timmies.  With so many different options on the menu, I will be returning."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently went in for breakfast because we were awake really early for some reason. I had never been to this restaurant before and was excited to try it for the first time. I ordered the vegan rancheros which was tofu scramble, refried beans, whole black beans, lettuce, salsa, green peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, cheddar daiya cheese + side of guacamole on giant freshly fried tortilla chips. It was absolutely delicious. It was a huge portion and I didn't think I could finish it that early in the morning but I proved myself wrong. I'm vegan and have eaten out at most of toronto's vegan restaurants or customized some meals at regular restaurants but this was honestly one of the best vegan meals i've ever had. Definitely the best tofu scramble i've ever had. My only complaint is that I wish there was more guacamole but I don't think i'll ever be satisfied with a serving of guacamole because i'd eat the entire tub if they offered (i'm addicted). I had coffee with soy milk which was good also. My girlfriend ordered the breakfast burrito (non-vegan) and really enjoyed it too. I stole some of her home fries which were also very yummy.  Overall great experience. The server we had was very friendly and attentive. She stopped by a few times throughout the meal to ask how things were or if we wanted refills on our coffee.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere that was cozy and fun. Not too expensive considering the portion sizes and quality of the food. Mine had tons of fresh ingredients!  Will definitely go back- I want to try the vegan lasagne because I haven't had cheesy lasagne in forever."}
{"text":"I just wanted a to go smoothie. Waitress said it would be \"a few minutes\" because they needed to clean the blender. 20 minutes later everyone there is obviously avoiding and ignoring me. It was apparent they were just waiting for me to give up and leave and the smoothie wasn't going to get made. I finally gave in and told them i had to get back to work. \"Ok\". A little customer service and attitude would have gone a long way."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place out because of all the vegan options!  Upon arrival, my two friends and I were told to choose any seats at the back. A table with three seats was the one we chose, and a server came by and took away a giant platter of salt and pepper, and wiped the table with a cloth while we were there. This made the entire table wet and smell kind of funny. We then got our menus.  I ordered the breakfast burrito with the vegan option (scrambled tofu and daiya cheese), and got a side salad instead of home fries. I also ordered a custom beet, carrot, and orange juice. The food arrived quite quickly, and the portions were quite large and filling! The burrito itself was well seasoned, fresh, and very satisfying in general. Then again, I'm a burrito kind of girl. The juice was beautifully red, but a little too beet-y for me. I like beets in my juice, but I really had hoped the orange would come through a bit more.   I also ordered a vegan wild blueberry cheesecake, which I enjoyed very much. It was light, airy, and delicious! Would come back here just for that, and for more of their vegan desserts. I was excited to try their pumpkin pie, but the server had told me that they just ran out. Boo :(   The decor, although appreciated by other yelpers, actually kind of creeped me out. Has anyone watched that episode of Spongebob where Gary runs away and gets kidnapped by a creepy old lady? Yep. That's what I imagine the creepy old lady's house looks like. The restaurant was also really REALLY cold, and I felt the need to wear my winter coat inside to keep warm. Not cool.   Overall, I had a somewhat decent experience here. I really enjoyed the food, however, so I will probably be back to try more vegan breakfast options that are not really available in other parts of the city. Three stars for filling burritos and yummy vegan desserts!"}
{"text":"It's known as a brunch and juice hot spot but items such as burritos are great for dinner too. The staff are excellent. The decor is that of an old diner, rustic cafe or home kitchen like the brunch spot Aunties and Uncles."}
{"text":"Was ok, nothing spectacular. Waitress was nice but slow, potatoes could have been better cooked, as well as the eggs. Girl with ridiculously long armpit hair set it off.   Otherwise cool little vegetarian diner."}
{"text":"I find that when it comes to brunching, there's a divide between meaty and meatless brunches: if you're a meat eater, brunch tends to be a basic, usually greasy meal of potatoes, eggs, bacon and toast. If you go to a vegetarian/vegan restaurant, brunch is a frilly meal with fruit, fancy sauces, and garnishes. Sadie's is the perfect meld of the two. Their food is all vegetarian or vegan, but it's simple and basic. Think tofu scrambles with toast and home fries, or chocolate chip pancakes served with banana slices and maple syrup. No fancy garnishes, no embellished descriptions on the menu - just good, basic food. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little diner decorated with tons of retro knick-knacks. I was there for brunch, the waitress was very friendly and the food came very fast. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with their breakfast burrito. It was more of a egg omlette wrap with a little lettuce, a little salsa, some cheese and a lot of refried beans which tasted like it was from a can (and not refried at all) and took over the taste of the burrito. I had to add a lot of hot sauce and pepper to make it more tasty. I was expecting a large burrito smothered in sauce, like what most diners would do, but my plate looked rather sad and dainty.  The small portion of potatoes on the side also lacked any flavor or seasoning. The plate really needed some flavour and omph (a few slices of fresh fruit on the side would have been nice), I was left feeling unsatisfied.  Looking at the breakfast plates to the tables next to me, they too looked bland and mediocre. The large cup of fair trade organic coffee was good.  It's too bad since I would really want to like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sadie's is a great little veggie diner with some interesting food.  It's quick and cheap and while some of the recipes are not very authentic looking or tasting, I've yet to order something that was not at least decent and they have Daiya cheese, which is like the greatest thing ever."}
{"text":"Nice waitress but uber slow service. They made a mistake with my order and took about 45 min till I was finally able to chow down. My friend finished eating at that point. The waitress felt bad and didn't charge me, but from reading other reviews it seems like it's not their first time that this happened. Food was ok...nothing special though.   Wasn't sure if the spread on my rye was butter or margarine. Was never asked or mentioned on the menu."}
{"text":"I like the laid back atmosphere; it is quirky dinner with a pretty astounding collection of PEZ dispensers.    The service was very slow and my order was wrong.  It was corrected but it took nearly an hour for my meal to finally arrive.    The food was decent but not amazing.  I tried the Huevos Rancheros, the Vegi-Burger and the faux chicken drum sticks each of which were OK.  Having been a long term vegetarian, I've had a lot better in the city elsewhere.  Overall, it was a fairly flat experience"}
{"text":"Not what we expected.  We thought the fare would be unique vegetarian.  Instead, it was mediocre at best.  Veggie burgers can be had at Burger King so why order it at Sadie's?  We ordered a plate of edamame to share.  What we received was an over boiled bowl of saturated pods without the customary salt on top. They were bland, boring and a rip off at $5.50. Furthermore, the waitress never brought us an additional bowl/plate to put the discarded shells in so we used a napkin.    I had the burrito and it was quite doughy.  The filling was odd as it had imitation ground meat and lettuce!  Huh?  The accompanying salad was pleasant.  My companion had the bbq plate.  Why call it bbq when the food is deep fried?  The imitation chicken drumstick was tasty but deep frying is not for me.  We didn't bother to stay for dessert because the rest of the meal was so disappointing.  The decor was kitchy but the service was inadequate.  Although the waitress was pleasant, she really never went out of her way to ask if we needed anything nor did she provide service other than what was expected of her.  Sorry, this place is not worth returning to and if you haven't already visited Sadie's...don't."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast, competent and pleasant staff. I had the Huevos Rancheros. Love the dish but I did find the tortilla it was served on made for some real swordplay as is tried to cut it through.  In all it's a little pricey compared to similar breakfast joints, but I'm going to be back to try the other dishes and will update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Hidden gem when it comes to vegetarian resto!!  Friendly waitress and cook. Tasty food (BBQ plate) and yummy dessert (vegan chocolate fudge cake) all at reasonable prices!!   Definitely going back for more...."}
