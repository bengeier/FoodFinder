{"text":"This was the nearest restaurant to our airport hotel, so we ambled over without reserving a table. The restaurant was full, so we sat in the bar lounge, where one orders from the same menu. The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing, the service attentive.   The food and drink were surprisingly good for an airport hotel. The two of us shared the Roasted Red Pepper Hummus, Tomato Bisque (sensational), and the Big Hippie Salad. From the drinks menu we ordered the Ultimate Margarita and the Arizona-brewed HopShock IPA. Everything was fresh, tasty, and satisfying.   The Radisson's clientele is extremely casual. The lounge where we sat abuts the hotel lobby and hall, and we were treated to an endless parade of hotel guests in various states of dress and undress, some on their way to or from the pool."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great friendly staff. Romantic place for two or a quick up scale dinner."}
{"text":"I ate here because it is in the hotel that I am staying in. However I am not that impressed. It is really expensive and the help was less than average. The food was okay but not worth the price tag"}
{"text":"The service was great . Slow night but the wait staff was the best bit I wanted something simple so I hot the Western Burger I asked for it medium but it was done well done.im not going to bitch because it's just a burger the veggies were fresh it had good ingredients but it was put together like a fee reviews \" like at Denny's\" buy I would say Dennys would have been better. The dish came with a small basket of Fry's and a hell of amount of chorizo too much. 1/2 of the menu had it. 14.99 for it actually Wendy's or Carl's jr would have been a better bet plus a hamburger shouldn't be that price even if Gordon Ramsey made it, it's just a burger"}
{"text":"Good food overall.  We had fish tacos, chicken salad, basic burger and a fourth dish I forget but everyone thought the food was yummy.  Fish tacos got rave reviews!! Breakfast buffet the next morning was also very good."}
{"text":"Meh....got stuck in Phoenix due to flight delays. AA put me up in the Residence Inn and this was the closest bar to the hotel. Not that I'm a youngster, but this place is sparsely populated with septuagenarians. I like IPAs and the one they had was not bad. Hotel bar on a Friday night. Can't be too harsh. Nice folks. Don't put it on your to do list."}
{"text":"Seriously fantastic!!!  I wasn't expecting much given they are in the lobby of the hotel, Radisson by Phoenix Airport.  The hotel had given me a coupon good for free appetizer, drink or dessert with purchase of an entree.  At most, I was expecting mediocre hotel food.  The decor is nice, and the place had been busy  in the evenings on my previous two nights of stay here.  On my third night, I decided to go downstairs and give it a try because I was too tired to drive out.  I opted for the Chicken Wings as an appetizer (for my coupon), and then did the Cheeseburger (comes on a Pretzel bun) with salad instead of fries.  The chicken wings came out and they were huge, maybe 10 or so, totally excellent.  Not too spicy, but spicy enough.  They were crispy but not burnt crispy and the sauce was excellent.  I was going to ask for a to go box when I first saw them since I thought I wouldn't be able to eat them all plus my entree, but I devoured them all!  The burger and salad came out next.  The salad was nicely presented in a bowl and looked like it had radishes and some cheese and tomatoes, but I knew I couldn't finish the burger let alone the salad, so I asked for it to be boxed up which Erica the server quickly did.   The burger was absolutely fantastic, cooked perfectly at medium well and tasty.  The pretzel bun was amazing, not like some pretzel buns you get when they are way to hard and chewy.  Tomatoes and lettuce were fresh and tasty too.  The service was great.  It was a slow night in the restaurant, but I was there at 6 pm and the hotel seemed to be pretty empty.  If I lived here, I would totally make the trip over just to eat here.   It was fantastic, especialy since you pay $11 for crap burgers at places like Red Robin and this was only $12 for the burger.  The free appetizer promotion was great, but I totally would have paid full price for the wings cause the were great.  And btw... I have never came home and went right to the computer and raved about something, but I am a big fan of the underdog and I think for those as myself who snub their nose at hotel food should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I was about to fly on a red eye flight to New York and I wanted to have a few drinks before I left. I didn't want to pay airport prices, so I stopped by the Radisson bar right near the airport for a quick drink (or 3! I get really nervous when I fly!) the bartender was named Jeremy and he was such a sweetheart! He asked me where I was flying to and I told him New York. Apparently, he used to live there! So, since it was my first time, I asked him what kind of stuff I should do. He told me places to eat, museums to go to, and all kinds of other things to do. He made a damn good margarita too! Thanks to him, I went on my flight relaxed and at ease and had an absolutely blast in New York! Thanks for the advice and for making me laugh, Jeremy!"}
{"text":"This place is just awful. We were in Phoenix on business and two other places we walked to were closed and we were running short on time so we decided to give this place a try!  We came here for breakfast and I ordered the traditional which included white bread, eggs over easy, sausage, and potatoes. Where do I start? The potatoes were the only thing edible and they were just chopped up French fries. The sausage had a pocket of liquid on it. I thought maybe it was a secret maple syrup pouch that you would poke and delicious syrup would flavor the sausage. That was not the case. It was just grease. The bread was burnt and the eggs were over done. Simply the worst breakfast I have ever had. The waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be there either and did not even ask us how it was. Probably for the better!"}
{"text":"Salmon overcooked Waaaaaay overcooked. Ends were crunchy I politely told the server and a second puece arrived - waaaaaassay undercooked. Due to hunger, a lack of a rental car, a lack of eateries nearby to walk to in 109 degree heat - i ended up eating the crunchy one. Come on. Cooking a piece if salmon is a freaking challenge? Who is the cook? A Denny's dropout?"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite to eat while waiting for luggage to arrive on the next flight.  This is part of the Radisson, which I didn't realize until we got there.  The margaritas were on special, but they tasted pre-made and were so so.  Companions has burgers on pretzel buns, to mixed reviews.  I had the fish tacos, which I thought were excellent.   Service was on the slow side, disappointing due to the fact there were few people there.  Overall, a bit of a disappointment.  Good if you want to eat at a hotel, but I wouldn't go out of the way to find it."}
{"text":"I checked in and was starving. Ordered a cheeseburger medium and what I got was a frozen patty grilled like a hockey puck. Menu in my room was not the same as the one at the restaurant. Restaurant was empty at 8:30 pm. Nicely decorated. Its a shame something so simple came out so wrong."}
{"text":"Reviews of this place have been very hit-or-miss. Well, ours was definitely a \"hit\".  We were staying at another hotel nearby, and the desk clerk recommended RBG for dinner. We walked in through the back door of the Radisson and ended up sitting in a little bar/lounge section of the restaurant. It took us a while to realize there was another section (with surprisingly nice furnishings/ambience) and move there.  The service was terrific, possibly because we were nearly the only customers there. Our server was friendly and attentive, offering suggestions and refilling drinks.  I had a salmon sandwich on focaccia bread; it was excellent. One companion chewed his way happily through a substantial burger; another enjoyed fish tacos (which were a tad dry but did come with some sort of sauce); and a third enjoyed a salad with well-prepared veggies.  RBG isn't some epicurean nirvana, but for a grill in a hotel in some off-the-beaten-path part of town, it was startlingly good, and we'll certainly return if we're in the area again."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel so coming here was convenient.   Dinner- Tried the queso, which was not good at all. It was basically melted stringy cheese with no flavor. Don't waste your time.   Burger- Why do you ask how I'd like it cooked if you're going to give it to me charred well done anyway? Not good.   Truffle Tator tots- This was a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So three stars because I came here twice and had two very different experiences- a one star and a five star experience because of two very different waitresses. Our waitress for breakfast got our order wrong and charged us for items that I never ordered. My hungover ass assumed that the item was apart of my meal and didn't question it. My friend who paid for the bill thought I had actually ordered it. Nope, nope, nope. She was also just really rude and goodness, there's no other word for it than \"bitchy.\" However, then at lunchtime when we were getting food to go, the waitress was an absolute star. She packaged all of our meals with heavy saran wrap, gave us plasticware, put the sauces in a plastic bag because we told her we were going through airport security and taped the box shut. Absolute gem she was! Wish I got her name.  So I'd say this place's experience definitely varies based off the service. Service aside, the food is good but can take awhile to get it."}

{"text":"This place is part of the Radisson Hotel Phoenix Airport. The service was decent and the food was good. I had a healthy breakfast wrap that featured quinoa, egg whites, feta cheese, and spinach. It came with a side of fruit. Yum! I would eat at this place again."}
{"text":"One star only for the pleasant service. Ordered the \"special\" (chicken penne pasta w/ mixed vegetables). The good: the vegetables were very tasty.  The bad: the pasta was over cooked and mushy. The chicken was over cooked, burnt, and inedible. Half the butterflied chicken breast was hard and could not be cut (also made a plastic sounding thump when tapped with the knife), while the other was half simply over cooked where the meat was pulling apart in long grainy hard strings. The black burnt chicken from the bite I managed to swallow left a sour charred taste lingering in my mouth. I was very hungry as it was my first meal of the day at around 7pm and even considering this I still could not force myself to eat the protein. They did give $5.00 off, LOL, which I paid only because the service was good and I managed to eat the mushy pasta and veggies. Most respectable establishments would have taken care of the check since the main ingredient protein was so inedible. BTW- I would and have paid twice the price of a similar meal which I will gladly pay for edible quality. I stay in the attached Radisson hotel too often and I definitely won't return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered from our hotel room, food got delivered in 30 minutes. Ribs were dry and the BBQ sauce was over powering. Tempura Shrimp and Calamari was okay, the batter was too salty and too thick. We paid about $45 for two items including tips."}
{"text":"It is NOT a place to get a gourmet meal but a functional place where the staff are efficient and friendly.  It is basic fast American fare such as Burger, Sandwich, Tacos for the road warrior who just wanted to have a fast and fulfilling basic meal.  The service was friendly and efficient.  I am glad that they hire someone who is older because chances are they know how to provide a service with a smile which is so lacking in today's service industry.  We will be back when we have a chance to swing by."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a pleasant surprise.  I am staying at the Doubletree across the street from RBG Grill which is located in the Radisson hotel.  I arrived just as they were setting up for lunch.  I ordered the Big Hippie salad with chicken breast and tater tots. Both were very good.  The chicken was grilled, flavorful, and moist.  The salad consisted of sunflower seeds, red quinoa, mixed green, feta cheese and a lemony vinaigrette dressing.  The atmosphere was very nice as well.  I would definitely came back here again."}
