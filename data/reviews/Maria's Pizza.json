{"text":"You're not going to pay more here than you will at Pizza Hut, but you will get a better pizza.  Very unique and delicious taste!"}
{"text":"The best pizza place in Oregon. The smell of pizza when you open the door is awesome, reminds me of my child hood going to the local ma & pa pizza parlors. Limited choices on beer (Miller Lite & Bud Light) but the pitchers are cheap. The service is great."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong. We've been eating here for years and it's always been great. The atmosphere is such a typical pizza place from yrs gone by.  Friendly and clean with the same people working there now for years. Says a lot about how the owner treats people."}
{"text":"You can't beat the friendly staff and genuine Sicilian pizza here. The dining area is a little small and fills up quickly (especially on Friday nights) so get there before 5:30 if you're in a hurry. I also enjoy the spinach & cheese tortellini, which comes with a salad and bread."}
{"text":"Maria's Pizza is the real thing.  Tasty, great crust...lots of cheese...well-made!  I have gravitated back to mostly standard cheese and sausage...at one time I preferred whatever they call their \"deluxe\"...with all the vegetables on it.  Only criticism...the green peppers are lame...seem like their canned.

But, they also deliver...into the rural countryside...so, how can you possibly go wrong?  Okay, eating in is good too...especially with a pitcher of cold beer...have one today!!"}
{"text":"Watch out.  They discriminated against us because we did not follow lent and refused to serve us meat during lent on our pizza.  Will not return"}
{"text":"The BEST pizza I have ever had. Seriously, the taste is perfect, sauce is excellent. Small place, hit or miss on wait times, but definitely worth the wait for pizza. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this pizza.  Great crust, generous cheese and the perfect sauce.  The sausage is outstanding, but my go-to order is cheese pizza with extra sauce on top.  Y-U-M.

The restaurant is a little dated, but it's charming.  Helps you know the recipes are tried and true to perfection.

On Fridays and Saturdays, it is hard to get a table for dine-in, but delivery is always top-notch.  This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Maria's Pizza is a Oregon fixture. It has great pizza and good pasta dishes. The pasta is good, not something you would travel across the state to get, just a good dish of pasta. But the pizza is great. Maria's is small and crowded, but worth the wait. If you are in a hurry, you can get the take out. This is not a chain. You get pizza that is made for you, not pre-made chain stuff. The decor is old school pizzeria with the map of Italy and such. But the pizza is what you go for in a pizza restaurant. It has a great sauce, plenty of cheese and a nice crust, not too thin or too thick, just right for me."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with their pizzas or pastas!  Never a disappointment .  They are definitely busier on Friday and Saturday nights, but worth the wait"}
{"text":"I have never order anything besides Pizza but it is quite good.  Much better then the alternatives in town, Pizza Hut or Pitt.  Give it a try.  You will be pleased."}
{"text":"You gatta love this venerable,  hole in the wall,  authentic Italian restaurant. 

They don't try to be anything they are not,  the salad is just your run- of- the- mill iceberg lettuce, tomatoes,  and cheddar cheese.

But you don't come here for the decore or presumptions.  You come here for freshly made,  hand tossed, pizza pies with made from scratch sausage and marinara sauce! 

Their lasagna is incredible! Lasagna noodles stuck together with gooey,  melty cheese,  and topped off with dropping,  homemade sauce.  

This place is an institution,  all the locals grew up with it and still continue to bring their families here.  You'll find tables if groups and sports teams after a tournament."}
{"text":"Growing up in a small town and now living in Madison I've been looking for a mom and pop pizza joint with pizza like this.  This pizza reminds me of home, it couldn't be better. 

If you haven't tried it, I recommend it.  I know not everyone likes this type of pizza but I'd prefer to skip the grease and over publicized chain pizza places."}
{"text":"I speak for a delivery experience alone and fully, excitedly intend to order from Maria's again. A couple of couples ordered a very large pizza on a Saturday night. On great recommendations, pretty great reviews, accommodating late night hours, and delivering ability - wow, do you need more? - we ordered despite the warnings of long waits.

The 1/2 deluxe (or supreme?) 1/2 veggie pizza arrived promptly in one hour, a very reasonable timeline for a Saturday. The driver was professional, delivery fee was minimal. Unfortunately the total came to mid 20's, not sure why, though perhaps MenuPix is very outdated. Then with tip the pizza was quite expensive. Requested fresh mushrooms, received canned. Crust edges were great, middle was soggy. Green peppers were floppy in a difficult-to-describe way, unless you're familiar with jarred nopales. Next time I'm interested in a smaller pizza to avoid sog, dining in, and exploring other menu items. It's great to have a non-bar-food late night option in Oregon."}
{"text":"Maria's pizza is amazing. The first time I had it I said, \"grandma's pizza!\" because it reminded me so much of the homemade pizza she made when I was growing up. The crust is perfect and the sauce has great flavor. Their other food is good too but the 5 stars is based on the pizza, which is as good as any you can find in Madison (I think better). The style of the restaurant itself is no frills...the kind of little mom and pop place that's been around forever and is always busy. Good sign! We recently tried another pizza nearby... I won't say names... But my children really wanted to try it. I am perplexed how that other pizza place stays in business when Maria's definitely beats them in taste and quality AND price. 
Oh, we order this for delivery all the time too. And the garlic cheese bread! Yummy add on for only $3.99!

P.S. I noticed a lot of reviews were people complained about canned veggies. Now, believe it or not, some people like canned mushrooms on their pizza (yuck) so Maria's does carry them. However, you can ask for fresh. We always specify fresh mushrooms. I don't believe we have ever had any canned veggies on our pizza there. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I still don't think much of their other dishes but I have grown to love their pizza   Don't even attempt to have it delivered on a Friday or Saturday.  It will take hours."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place is receiving such high marks, especially with real pizza right down the road at LaRocca.  This place is heavy on the cheese and light on the customer service.  Not to mention all the little ADHD monsters running around making it more like a Romper Room on Ritalin.  By the way, if you want chicken with anything, forget it, they have none.  Bottom line, the pizza, service, and entire experience is quite bland, and you'll probably get stuck in the middle of a bunch of jerk-wad kids.  Do yourself a huge favor and head down to a much better place for good pizza - LaRocca."}
{"text":"If you want to get food at a place that gives 0 's about their clients. Please by all means...  this place used to be so lively and service was amazing. Food is good but, good pizza isn't hard to come by. I'd say skip this place and find a pizzeria across town with good service and better pizzas."}
{"text":"Looks good, smells great, but taste disappoints. Very bland and boring though. Not a lot of good pizzarias in the Madison area and this one tries hard, but just doesn't compare to the authentic pizza that you can get along the coast of Lake Michigan from Chicago north to Milwaukee, places like Wells Bros. in Racine, Marty's in Milwaukee, etc.
Good lasagna though."}
{"text":"Maria's Pizza is probably the BEST Pizza you can get anywhere!  I have traveled everywhere around the world and have not found a Pizza I am more fond of than Maria's.   Even when I lived away from Wisconsin and would return Maria's Pizza was always the first meal after my flight arrived.  I just wish they were open for lunch.

I highly recommend and suggest Maria's for anyone who loves Pizza."}
{"text":"We just moved to Oregon and have ordered take-out a couple of times.  We sat down and ate one night, the service was fairly decent, nothing stellar, but the pizza is great - hasn't disappointed yet. Nice hand tossed crust and a great selection of toppings."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery pizza the other night and honestly I'm not sure I understand what all the fuss is about. 

Pros:
- pizza arrived at the expected time 
- service was friendly

Cons:
- dough lacks any flavor and was in desperate need of salt
- I asked for mushrooms and was posed the following question: canned or fresh? Ehhhh I'll take fresh obviously but why is that even an option?!
- Sauce was lackluster. 

Overall:
Pizza was unremarkable and slightly on the expensive side for the quality of it."}
{"text":"Best pizza in dane county. The meals are a little simple, but the pizza is fantastic."}
{"text":"We stopped here for pizza one night, on several recommendations.  Friendly servers, kids are able to get 1/2 portions.  The pizza was good, but not the best I've ever had.  Wish the sauce would have had more flavor, but the crust was good.  They asked if we wanted canned or fresh mushrooms!  Good sausage.  We'd go back."}
{"text":"What a treasure in Oregon.  A family run true Italian pizza place that is amazing to the palate. The crust is simple but so tasty and the red sauce on the pies is light but seasoned to perfection.  The toppings are traditional which makes it easy to order sick."}
{"text":"Very overrated based upon the reviews here. I find most italian places far better and inventive. The pizza is definitely the highlight whereas most everything else is not great. I got the salad here a few times also - a strange greasy specimen. I prefer most other italian places like La Roccas in Oregon or others in Madison - heck even Olive Garden sadly..."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! I would go here after most our high school wrestling tournaments with the team and we loved it! True Italian style pizza (I was there for 3 weeks and know real Italian pizza!) with a variety of options and toppings. Smaller establishment but it feels more homey because of it. Been told the meatball sub is also very good. Spaghetti is just like grandma used to make, huge meatballs with plenty of garlic and chunky meat sauce! Prices are perfect as well!"}
{"text":"To this day, I have no clue why Maria's gets anything less than 4 Stars. Granted, I've never had any meat pizzas here (just veggies and cheese). I have been eating here since I was a teenager. It is absolutely without a doubt my favorite pizza place. Even now, when I live in Milwaukee, I will drive the 90 miles back to Oregon to get this pizza. And that's not an overstatement because I literally just did that. There's just something about their pizza; I can't explain it, but it's far better than any other pizza I've had and just on a completely different level. When I was younger, Maria's would be our go-to dinner plan if nothing else was in order or if we had a guest. Delivery wait time is average, but when the pizza comes, you forget the wait. Anyone who is complaining about the lack of salad pizzazz just doesn't understand... good pizza doesn't need salad... it needs more pizza. If you want salad you can go elsewhere. But Maria's is the place to go if you want fresh, good pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is mediocre. Veggies on pizza is canned, not fresh. Very disappointing. Staff is generous and nice though. But I won't be returning."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star I would we called for a pizza pick up the guy was so rude he laughed and said\"you want pick up ? It's gonna be at least an hour\" in a completely unnecessary tone that suggested that I was stupid, he could have simply said that they are busy and orders are backed up. So Maria maybe you need help that actually wants to give customers service ."}
{"text":"OMG!! Worst pizza almost ever!!!!  We try so hard to like Maria's Pizza because Oregon is our home and so many people seem to like it.  We ordered the \"special pizza\" and it was a big, gushy mess of cheese, green pepper, mushroom and onion with hardly any sauce.  The crust has always been questionable to us and this last order made sure we will not be ordering from Maria's again.  What kind of pizza has no sauce!?!  Just yuck is all we can say.  Leftovers are in the garbage . . ."}
{"text":"Horrible food... we ordered a Hawaiian pizza and it had way too many green peppers and onions and NO chicken!!! The bottom of the pizza was burnt and could not eat it without getting a burnt taste. NEVER AGAIN will we eat there. The service was horrible and it was way over priced."}
{"text":"We order delivery pizza very regularly from Maria's.  Excellent pepperoni and Italian sausage.  They also have the best meatballs I have ever had."}
{"text":"Locals love this place.  Locals often don't leave town.
Maria's has a little better than average pizza but nothing to really rave about.  Still it is nice to have a place like this in a small town like this.  Just wish they could really wow me with some good pizza.  We went here a number of times to try to understand what other people were talking about and always just ended up scratching our heads.  Huh?
Went back recently, Jan 2013, and got two nice pizzas but again I would give them about a 7 or an 8 for the food.  The crust was better than most but still not fantastic and the flavor was disappointing.  I like a pizza that I can't stop eating.  These didn't do that for me.  They need to explore making their crust better and their toppings more flavorful.
Service was good, they were pretty busy.
For example, Roadhouse Pizza in Ripon makes a better crust and much better toppings.  I'd give Roadhouse a 9 to 10 for me.  Park Plaza Pizza in Beaver Dam rates a 9 to 10 for me.  I enjoyed Picasso's pizza more than Maria's."}
{"text":"Saw Maria's last Fall and finally had dinner there.

Garlic Cheese Bread...delicious!
Garlic Bread...delicious!
Side Salad...basic...wish it would of had a tomato or two
Pizza...delicious crust and cooked perfectly!
Lasagna....very tasty but I think a little Alfredo sauce would have made it perfect
Spaghetti and Meatballs...pasta cooked perfectly, sauce delicious, meatballs a little small, I should have ordered 4 or 6 but they were very good!
Service...Laura was very nice and attentive.

All in all, I would go back anytime and eat.  It was what I was hoping for.  Private owned with a homemade feel about the place!"}
{"text":"Nice family atmosphere. Glad we got there early to avoid the rush. Pizza sauce was excellent. Spaghetti was bountiful."}
{"text":"Good food. Pizza is nice just would prefer forest veggies not canned on my pizza"}
{"text":"Have loved this pizza since I was a kid! I live in Chicago now and Chicago pizza is not as good as Maria's - crispy thin crust with loads of tasty toppings. Has a wonderful flavor that can't be replicated!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic, reliable hometown restaurant! The pizza has a thin, crispy crust, with a slightly sweet sauce. This is my favorite kind, and Maria's is now my favorite pizza in the Madison area. Besides excellent pizza, they also have a fantastic calzone (the Joe Calzone, buried in the menu amongst the specialty pizzas) and wonderful pastas. The spaghetti sauce is similar to the pizza sauce, slightly sweet and a bit loose, but delicious. The meatballs have a perfect flavor and texture. We had been craving a good pizza and after weeks of not finding it in Madison, headed down to Oregon. We found the perfect pizza (and calzone and spaghetti) at Maria's!"}
{"text":"Maria's is a very enjoyable and welcoming local Italian restaurant.  The food is good.  It's not fancy, but it's good.  I enjoy the pastas as much as I do the pizza.  I would say they are the best I have, but they are better than average.  The prices are very reasonable.  The staff is very friendly as well.  I only gave 4 stars because I don't consider them the best that I have had, though I do recommend you trying it out.  Maybe your taste buds will love it like so many others in the area do.  Either way, you will be satisfied and full.  Go check it out"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for pizza and I can't believe I haven't reviewed here before. Their sauce is really good and I love the spices they use. We always get an xlarge sausage, green peppers, onions, and half mushrooms. I wish they didn't cut the xlarge pizzas into squares instead of triangles but I can look past because of the flavor. We always order for pick up and are normally really busy on Friday and Saturday nights so expect to wait about an hour and a half for pizza if you get pick up but it's worth it! They do not deliver out to us which is sad but probably a good thing otherwise we would order all the time!! This is just a great family owned restaurant and we love supporting them with our business!"}
