{"text":"I just had the $15 prime rib dinner. I asked for rare, but got well done (not a hint of pink meat at all). The meat was tough with lots of globs of fat, the yorkshire pudding was overdone, and the mashed potatoes were lukewarm. My friend's burger was dry with an old bun that crumbled apart as he was eating it. They didn't accept a buy one entree get one free coupon that we had from the Entertainment Book, claiming that the prime rib didn't count."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!  Nachos - delicious, hard not to mess up, I know, but I absolutely devoured them.  You can get poutine with pretty much whatever you want on it. I got the pulled pork and I was in grease heaven.  Steak sandwich was good and cooked perfectly.   Vegetarian pizza (forget the name) was delicious, but I should have asked for extra goat cheese.  Drinks - good!  Service - meh. Had one awesome server one night, and one forgetful the next day."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous dinner here after a long day of travel from Ottawa.  They had some local brews on tap. There was one (which the name escapes me) that was as black as night and amazingly good.  I had the Salmon entree. Best salmon I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly and had a very nice seasoning to it.   The bar was moderately busy on a Monday at 7pm but also had a very comfortable feel to it. I might just have to go back tomorrow night!  Update: I went back tonight. And I ordered the same salmon as last night. And it was awesome. The beer is also Wild Rose Alberta Crude.  Update^2: Went here for lunch and dinner today. Seafood salad was good; tuna was a bit overcooked. Chili was excellent. For dinner, I asked for a sample of the brisket before ordering, and then I ended up ordering it. Great meal. The wireless from the hotel works great here too.  Note - no happy hour that I can note, but they have nightly specials. Tuesday's are $5/pound wings."}
{"text":"The good and the bad, many really great items have been removed from the menu. The beef dip is still good, although the quality of the beef has gone down. there was a little more fat than I would have liked. My wife's 2 favorite items the \"pig candy\" thick cut maple bacon and their pub platter are missing, They also replaced their really tasty house salad with a generic pre bagged house salad. I would guess that the cost of quality ingredients was too much for the pub setting.   It was nice that our 3 year old daughter who was with us for lunch, received her kid's meal for free.   If you at the attached Hotel, try them out for lunch or a casual dinner. But I would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Blech. This was a horrible experience, service, atmosphere and food wise. Our table was dirty when we were seated and the only set of utensils on the table were wrapped in a ketchup soiled cloth napkin.  Our waitress walked off in the middle of a sentence about the specials, we had to request two clean sets of utensils. My husband said his BLTC salad was \"not appetizing at all\". The poutine with lacking gravy and the chicken pieces were burnt. The appetizer cup of roasted tomato soup was nice.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"Not recommended.  Pros: nice pub with decent amount of seating & tv's Cons: poor service, food is C-  I was really hoping for something better from this pub as it's located in the Delta Hotel complex on Southland.   The pub was only about 1/3 full during our visit, yet we had to wait 10 minutes to order drinks, another 20 before I had to get up and walk over to the waitress to ask her to take our order.   We ordered salt & pepper wings (8/10) and our mains were a salmon steak salad (6/10) and a 'Boomtown Burger' (1/10).   The waiter that was bringing us our wings dropped one on the way to our table, turned around and took the rest back to the kitchen --- when they finally were brought back out we had 8 wings that were cold and one hot one. If they all had been hot, I think they would be a good choice to order.  I didn't taste the salmon salad, but my wife rated it as that because she said it was okay but not great.   I have to comment on their signature burger: it supposedly has a cheese filing and triple cooked in peanut oil hand cut fries. Well, when I bit into the burger the boiling hot filing came out all over my lips and the plate. It was an oily & salty mixture that really burned my lip. Ouch! I waited a bit for my lip to cool down but the burger was still gross (and still over-salty) and the fries were cold and covered in the burger cheese oil. Just a terrible choice for a meal.    When we asked for our bill, (which took another 10 minutes to appear at our table) it was incorrect and needed to be adjusted.  My suggestion for the pub is to:  - encourage more checking in on your tables  - to reconsider offering that burger on your menu - just offer regular fries as the ones you have are not very good"}
{"text":"We walked out after 15 or 20 minutes.    The patio was empty and the restaurant was half full.   We managed to get a menu and place drink orders which never came despite the fact that we were seated 15 feet from the door.    I won't speculate on why the service was poor, but it was.   Heads up."}
{"text":"GREAT food, much better than expected!   I live near this pub and have driven by hundreds of times. For some reason I never stopped in for food, until today. Man, was I missing out. The food here is EXCELLENT. I have the rueben with fries, and it was outstanding. The fries were freshly cut and the rueben was filled with about a half pound of meat. It was a bit greasy, but it's a rueben after all. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Solid pub food. If you like what you see in the photos you'll like the food. I got a Boomtown burger with a salad and a beer sampler. It was good."}
{"text":"Meetups are great gatherings and they find creative places to meet.  Started attending the \"Calgary Startups & Entrepreneurs\" meetup - and their location of choice is Boomtown.  Meetup starts at 6pm, and I began going early to enjoy some quiet time before the crowd arrives.  I now make a point of it each month.  Large place and at 4pm it's quiet.  Staff is great - whether you want to eat, or just enjoy a coffee, they are attentive and friendly.  Menu is good.  Love Tomato Soup.  On a cold day in winter, that seemed like a great option.  It was delish.  Now it seems that I can never resist it.  Meetup is monthly on a Tuesday - special that day is Wings.  My favorite are the Salt & Pepper.  I'm a gadget person - lots of toys that constantly need power.  There are a number of tables that have easy access to power outlets - sweet.    Don't know about Wifi - have to find that out on my next visit.  I just picked up the Blackberry Playbook, so will be searching for Wifi at the May meetup. :)  Located on South Macleod Trail at Southland Drive.  There is lots of parking which is a treat in itself.  Really enjoy my monthly visit to Boomtown."}
{"text":"Just really not a good experience here. The place was not too busy and everything was just so slow.  The staff was overworked I guess. The food when I came out 1 hour later, was not very good.  Don't order the mushroom stroganoff.  It was inedible. The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms to tough to chew. We had a group of 12 of us in the patio and it was really not fun."}
{"text":"Right off the jet plane and prior to checking in to our hotel, our crew of 3 were in need of some food therapy after our flight from Toronto to Calgary.  Boomtown, based on my yelp mobile app seemed to be the best choice for the time being.   When we got there, the place was, for-the-most-part empty, as it was late lunch.  It was so quiet that we ended up seating ourselves.....bad indication!! The place was clean, and our server was polite.  We skipped out on our beers for water, and went straight for our meals!~  I ended up ordering their Seoul Burger with YAM fries! though the service was ALRIGHT, my meal was quite a quencher for me.  The burger was cooked the way a burger should be prepared; juicy, tender and full of flavor with the light slaw and non-flacky bread to unify all the flavors! it was a delight!  The presentation of this dish was at par! and I wasn't expecting a fancy-schmancy gourmet meal, however I was a bit impressed with my meal, more so over the service.  Would I come back here? well probably not as there are plenty of other food options available in the area. oooh and as I mentioned before though are server was polite, the service wasn't up to standards."}
{"text":"Had some food and drinks on the patio last year and haven't had a chance to write a review. This place didn't even have beer prices on the menu, just a list of what's available. Is that designed to make people uncomfortable asking prices and just order? Such bs. Food was decent."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way: Boomtown asked us to fill out a customer service form, which came at the end of our meal with the cheque.  It was tallied out of 5 and was as follows:  CUSTOMER SERVICE -   You were greeted in a timely manner ..... 5 You were greeted with enthusiasm and gusto ..... 5 The service throughout your meal was consistent ..... 5 Your server showed concern about the quality of your meal ...... 5 You were told immediately of any changes or problems with your order ..... 5  FOOD QUALITY -   Your meal was prepared as ordered ...... 5 Your meal was displayed in a professional manner ..... 5 Your meal was tasty and met your needs ..... 5 You were able to return or tell your server of any problems ..... not applicable  ATMOSPHERE -   The area of your meal was up to standards ..... 5 The music was appropriate for your dining ..... 5 You enjoyed your time on our patio ..... not applicable You felt the ambiance met your standards of a pub environment ..... 5   So, as you can see, all areas (that were applicable) received a 5 out of 5 from me and my party.  I wasn't able to enjoy the patio since it was too late in the year, but it was huge and looked wonderful!  I will definitely go back to Boomtown!  It was an enjoyable experience for me and my Mom... yes, my Mom had a nice meal at a pub.  What does that tell you?"}
{"text":"Was attending a conference and was really looking forward to a spicy Thai peanut salad. Instead I was greeted with a limp, mr.noodles, anemic looking salad. Very salty and no flavour. The service was sub par. It was quite disappointing. Perhaps next time I'll just sneak a real Mr. Noodles cup into the conference."}
