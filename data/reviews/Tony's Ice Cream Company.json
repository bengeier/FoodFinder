{"text":"Doesn't get better than this   Place is mobbed all for the right reasons. Excellent ice cream, price is crazy cheap and service fast. Trifecta!!!"}
{"text":"Second time coming.First visit tried waffle cone and left..Today added burger fry meal with cone.burger was ok.not one that differentiates itself from other burgers in the area.fries were hot.fast and polite service gets this place 3.5 but different ice cream choices and amount given gets an extra bump up to a 4.worth checking out but mainly for ice cream."}
{"text":"Breakfast...Not so much. Cold bacon egg and cheese, never heard of it. But it exists at Tony's. On soggy white bread, meh really for the price and family feel I thought the experience would be better. The ice cream of course is awesome but I say pass on the breakfast."}
{"text":"Marginal at best, and I'm being generous with a  3 star review.  After being suggested by multiple people to get the black cherry ice cream, I was so happy when I saw it. I was slightly frightened of the size. It's not often that you get offered half a pint of ice cream. Although for $5, it seems like the only way to justify the cost. The ice cream had almost no flavor. It tasted like milk with a slight cherry flavor to it. I took 2 bites before seriously considering trashing it. I ate about 1/3 of it before I actually did.  This place seems to be more for nostalgia and quantity than for flavor. I will choose another option next time, but it seems to be popular with other people than myself, so maybe they had a different experience than myself."}
{"text":"The best ice cream place in gastonia. They have so many flavors to choose from. Grape is my favorite"}
{"text":"This won't be the first time I eat ice cream for breakfast. Awesome prices and even better ice cream!!!! I had the Almond Joy ice cream and my friend had the peanut butter ripple and both were absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream and good cheap food! Chocolate milkshake with a scoop of black cherry is to die for."}
{"text":"Disappointed to find out they use artificial flavoring in their ice cream.  Thats not what homemade from old recipes means to me.  Fake chemical flavors are NOT good."}
{"text":"If you want some really good locally made ice cream, try this place out. Any ice cream product they have really hits the spot. Great flavors and priced right. Young and old alike love to stop by this place and get an ice cream treat. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"This is great food, the chili is amazing and I do mean amazing the time is very quick and I think everyone enjoys Tonys"}
{"text":"I love everything about Tony's Ice Cream! The food, the desserts, the atmosphere, etc. I see reviews about the food, and honestly they do have really good food... you just have to know which things to get. I'm not fond of the burgers but the turkey club, the BLT, the liver-mush, and the hot dogs are good!  I also see a lot about the flavor of the ice cream, and I can see how people think it doesn't have a lot of flavor because the milkshakes don't, but I personally like them like that.   Also I've heard that the employees are taken good care of. Even part time employees get insurance and benefits, which is great. I love Tony's!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area all of my life and I have to say, Tony's ice cream is my ALL TIME favorite! This place will never let you down. The customer service is great, the atmosphere is friendly, and their ice cream is on the top of the line! Also, the wait is usually not long at all, even during the summer."}
{"text":"Sounds crazy - but this is the go to place I take my kids for after we hike Crowders Mountain on our way back to Charlotte. Yes, it neutralizes all the calories burned - but it makes them look forward to hiking at a young age so the ends justify the means.   Best milkshake I've had - and I don't use the word \"Best\" lightly.  Plus - you have to love one of a kind dives with throw back prices !"}
{"text":"This place is a prime example of why I like to travel around the USA and find local places instead of chains.  I had already eaten dinner and was full, but after reading reviews of Tony's from various sites there was no way I was going to not stop in.   So, I didn't get a chance to try the food, but just took two scoops of ice cream with me to my hotel in Charlotte, poking at it while I was driving.  The decor..  hey, it's a local place. If you want Cold Stone Corporate, go there.  It looked clean, and the staff was friendly.   I got a scoop of banana and a scoop of some sort of walnut.  The walnut was good, the banana was outstanding.  You have to get yourself off of I-85 and stop here."}
{"text":"I love this place! One of the best in town and you really do get more than what you paid for! :)"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite to eat in the downtown Gastonia area.  The burgers are perfectly messy, and the fries perfectly simple and crispy.  Not to mention dozens of ice cream flavors including grape, banana pudding, etc. I only give it 4 stars due to the staff not being very friendly. But other than that I recommend Tony's to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend is from Northampton in Massachusetts, where the original world famous Herrell's Ice Cream shop is located (their ice cream was the inspiration for Ben and Jerry's).  My girlfriend says that Tony's is better."}
{"text":"I would have given it a 2.5, as it was better than \"Meh - I've expereinced better\" and less than \"A-OK\". Don't get me wrong, the desserts are out of this world. However, I see why it's called \"Tony's Ice Cream\". I wouldn't recommend going for burgers, as they seem to have the equivalent of \"trucker food\". Not very tasty, greasy, and unappealing. The desserts are insane, nonetheless. Definitely my stop for milkshakes, cakes, and ice cream pints...but that's it."}
{"text":"Stopped by mid-morning between grand daughter's soccer games. My daughter loved her - hard to find now - livermush sandwich. Two milkshakes were big hits with grandkids. They loved the ice cream scoop on top. Son in law and I ordered the fries, mainly because of sign saying they were voted best in Gastonia 2016. They are a lot like McDonald fries, just not crisp, really kind of soggy. Maybe it was the time of day, IDK. I had two scrambled eggs, three strips of bacon and coffee for breakfast. A real bargain, what coffee costs these days at chain restaurants. Great ice cream, average very clean diner, we will be back."}
{"text":"Exceptional Locally Made Ice Cream Parlour! Fabulous milkshake and don't have it with a lid as the slap an extra scoop of ice cream on top! A must! We drove 30 min from Charlotte just to try it! Plus the service is friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend eating elsewhere and coming here for what they do best - sweet treats.   The food was passable. The burger was of the frozen and cooked in a steam table variety.  Think your school cafeteria - the kind of patties with little bits of gray sludge on the patty. The hot dog was actually pretty good, despite I'm guessing it's kept in a steam table/water also, as the bun was very soggy after a minute or two. Fries were awful. Choose bagged chips.   I passed on ice cream but my kids loved it!  They raved. My older son had a chocolate shake, which was huge. I tried a small bite and it was pretty okay. Mild chocolate flavor, which I prefer. My younger son had a cup of mint chocolate chip. I didn't care for the flavor at all. Personally, my big hang up with the ice cream was the texture. It's just different. That doesn't make it bad, just for me, it was off putting. Clearly, this is a lower fat product vs a premium ice cream. More of an ice milk if you recall that type. Just not my thing, but that's just me.   The best part of the trip, and the reason I would take my kids back (just for ice cream) was the experience. Really nice, down to earth people - staff and customers alike. It was fun just to sit in the old booths and watch everyone's ice cream creations go by. It's hard to look grouchy with a huge ice cream cone in your hand. The fudge cake and banana splits were especially crowd pleasing. Worth a stop for sure."}
{"text":"Seriously bad, read these great reviews and thought this would be fun and delicious. Sadly I was mistaken. The vanilla shake was bland, like no sugary taste??  Plus they obviously use ice milk. It baffles me that they sell that stuff commercially, it's that bad. I had a hot dog all the way which is chili and mustard. Ewww.  Chili was definitely out of a can or possibly a bag, no taste. Reminded me of something from a cafeteria. Do yourself a favor and shoot down Franklin to the Cook Out. Better food and just as cheap. Wouldn't come back and do that to my insides again. Urp."}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream but the place itself was a little worn down. Not only do they sell ice cream, but sandwiches, fries, hotdogs, and more. I had mint chocolate chip, my Mom had butter pecan and strawberry, my Grandma had lemon, and lastly my Grandfather had grape and cherry vanilla. My mint chocolate chip ice cream was so refreshing and tasty but I wished it was a bit more creamy and soft. My mom absolutely loves her butter pecan and strawberry. My grandma thought hers was perfectly balanced with sweetnesses tartness. And last but not least, my Grandfather ADORED the grape and cherry vanilla, he almost took home a pint of the grape! I would come back for the ice cream even though the place was kinda ugly."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place has been around for so long!!!!  No offense Ben 'n Jerry's but I'm not a big fan of chocolate, so when I go to an ice cream place and they have like two non-chocolate options, I'm not a happy camper. This happens at a lot of ice cream places I visit.  But Tony's has tons of quirky flavors you wouldn't find elsewhere....like grape for example!  The neon clock in the middle of the kitchen reminds me of a by-gone era. It's super retro yet super clean inside. Last time I went, I grabbed an ice cream cone and walked around the area. Downtown Gastonia doesn't have much to it, but Tony's is always busy and delicious."}
{"text":"Homemade old school Ice cream shop in the middle of town.  It is a town's favorite.  Everything is vintage.  The menu is vintage with the throw back lettering.  The decor is 1950's from the counters to the tables.  Their ice cream is very good. They sell their own by the gallons.  The butter pecan is good.  I really liked the chocolate as well.  Prices are fair.  If you happen to be visiting the southern north carolina, charlotte area...swing by this place to get you a scoop.   Grade: B"}
{"text":"Absolute best ice cream ever. Specifically, their milkshakes.   It doesn't matter what time you go to Tony's, it seems it is always packed. The parking lot is always full, the tables are all taken, and there's a sizable line. But that's how you know it's so good.   I've never had the actual food from here, it didn't look that great, so this review is for the ice cream only. Their milkshakes are the absolute best. They basically make a milkshake with the ice cream and then add extra ice cream to the made milkshake. It's basically half ice cream, half milkshake in a cup and I'm not sure why but this is awesome.  It may sound weird, but get the grape milkshake. I was skeptical at first too, but I haven't looked back since I first tried it. It's the best.   If you're in the area, definitely stop in for some Tony's ice cream. It's awesome."}
{"text":"I asked what ice cream flavor was the most requested and it was chocolate. So that's what I had. Delicious!!! Next time I'm in town I'll definitely stop for mor ice cream."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the icecream but I love this place all the same. Wonderful staff, great food, and the ambiance of atmosphere is always retro. Love it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for nutritional food, STAY AWAY.  However, if you're looking for a classic 1960's southern diner/grill-type food (e.g., hot dogs, french fries, breakfast, etc.), this is a Gastonia classic.  Now, if you visit Gastonia and don't go get a Tony's milkshake, something must be wrong with you.  They're not healthy but, they are huge and sweet and so totally worth a splurge.  Don't expect a five-star interior/exterior."}
{"text":"Best of everything!!!  Grape ice cream is a must try. They are more than generous with their scoops."}
{"text":"What a great slice of Americana. The town of Gastonia looks like time just left it behind but, in the case of Tony's that is just fine. I stopped in just for ice cream, but judging by the menu should have saved room for a little more.  Oh well. The cookie dough ice cream was fantastic. Ordering a cup I was disappointed at the tiny styrofoam container she picked up, but shocked at how much she fit in it.  I'll be back, but next time there will be hot dogs and chili on my plate!"}
{"text":"Throwback ice cream shop. Make the ice cream on site and a better value for money than even chains like Dairy Queen, say nothing of Cold Stone style places.  Got the cookie dough shake and it was good. Want to try more flavors next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in to celebrate our great marriage and have dessert after dinner. Wow!! Ice cream deluxe!! Amazing! Delicious! Huge portions! To bad we live 700 miles away."}
{"text":"Cute little place off the freeway We stopped by on a road trip from D.C to Georgia kids got the single scoop which was pretty big and a few of us shared some Banana splits which were very large, ice cream was very fresh tasting as well as the toppings. I recommend stopping in if you are passing by that way."}
{"text":"Love Tony's Ice Cream! Their milkshakes are fantastic, and for the amount you get, the price is very reasonable. This place has been around for a long time, and my 91 year old grandpa remembers Tony's from way back, and he still enjoys it! I haven't had any of their food yet, but as far as ice cream/ milkshakes go, we recommend the Lemon, Cookie Dough, Peanut Butter Ripple, and the Banana Split! :)"}
{"text":"Cute shop, old-timey, with many flavors to offer. Banana pudding shake was good and plentiful."}
{"text":"Tony's ice cream is delicious! However, bought a double cheeseburger from there today for lunch and it was terrible. It tasted like it had been warmed up from the day before. Threw half of it away. McDonald's has better burgers and fries. Very disappointing experience..."}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy here, but the milk shakes are substantial. Great French fries, blt's and burgers. Fast service and they garnered a 100 on their Health Dept. review.  Passing through Gastonia? Go here!"}
{"text":"I Love Tony's. The best ice cream I've ever had. Great flavors and choices and the prices are good as well. Classic, old school ice cream shop."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing! Chocolate milkshake tasted more like frozen whole milk, absolutely no chocolate flavor. Burgers are all pre made and soaking in water till ordered. This place is overrated."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived in the area for so many years and just found out about Tony's!  I was there on a Saturday midafternoon and the place was hopping! I was very hesitant to stay because I thought it'd take forever to get something to eat. I was so wrong! The folks who work there are so efficient and capable that I ordered, got my food and was eating in a very short time. The burgers were excellent....juicy and thick. I savored every bite. But the milkshakes were absolutely amazing...thick and rich with ice cream. I don't plan to let much time pass before I return to Tonys. Next time I'm skipping the burger and shake and gorging on a banana split!!!  ."}
{"text":"I am so spoiled and demanding. I refuse to go anywhere else for a Chocolate Milkshake. Its the best ice cream in town. My wonderful, sweet and loving woman buys me one any time i want it. It doesnt matter if its late at night I have woke her up and got her out of bed before when she and I lived in Dallas together. Now we live in Bessemer City and she still drives to Tonys for me every single time. I love my lady and I love Tony's Ice Cream!"}
{"text":"Oh my god.  Apparently this place has been open in one form or another since 1915.  We got two cups and two cones of some of the best ice cream I've ever put in my mouth and it cost us the princely sum of $10.  Chocolate peanut butter ripple was unreal - honest to god ripples of fresh peanut butter that melted in your mouth, big fat chocolate chips, and delicious chocolate ice cream.  The mint chocolate chip was the mintiest ice cream I've ever tried, and the Almond Joy flavor?  Wow.  Seriously, this place justifies the existence of the entire city of Gastonia.  I just wish there was some way I could ensure that a half-gallon would survive the trip back to Atlanta.    Clearly, next time I come up here, I'm bringing a cooler full of dry ice."}
{"text":"Their ice cream may be 99.9% of the reason I go hiking at Crowders Mountain. This place is a MUST GO for a quick, tasty reward for being awesome."}
{"text":"I have grown up coming to this place. The ice cream is the best. They have amazing shakes and banana splits... sadly the last few times we have come some of the employees haven't been the best. The last time we stopped in, the girl who helped us was extremely rude.... and she made my butter pecan shake with a scoop of chocolate on top.  Then two other employees talked about how rude it was that a customer told them to keep the change because it was only 20 cents. Maybe hiring better people would help, but I know a lot of younger people just work there during the summer time. They were super busy, but it's still not acceptable to be so hateful."}
{"text":"Good ice cream and a lot of it! Theres probably a reason this place is crowded, no matter when you go. Not overpriced at all. I actually found it while looking on Yelp the night before an interview at the Hospital. If you're passing through town, get a milkshake, ice cream or something. you definitely won't regret it! Only downside is it is on the smaller side, and not a whole lot of parking (but what can you do). Easy to find on the main drag of gastonia"}
{"text":"Good service of our very large group. Large servings at a low price.  Mint chocolate chip was mildly minty and could have used some more chips but generally good. Very neat vintage ice cream parlor feel inside and I understand the ice cream is made right across the street."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place in town! The best ice cream and food you could ever imagine. The staff is always so friendly and the place is always so clean. Living out of NC at the moment but when we go home to visit we always make sure to stop in!"}
{"text":"Really good hotdogs with mustard, chili and coleslaw.   Atmosphere is vintage and kitschy."}
{"text":"Best milkshake I've ever had!!! If you have to stand in line, it's worth the wait. The staff is fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Ice cream tastes very bland. I've never had bad ice cream until I went here. It was not very creamy or sweet. Almost as if they are using a light cream 1/2 the sugar.  Ask for samples before you try! Other than that, service was great and friendly and selection was nice (even though quality was subpar). Very dated atmosphere that mirrored the old small town"}
{"text":"What a great, humble restaurant.  The portions of ice cream are huge!! The milkshakes have a big chunk of ice cream at the top and it is a big size. We enjoyed the cheese fries. They have such a great taste, not like the kind where they just drizzle cheese over it.  This restaurant if you can call it that is really more like a walk up café and you sit down out in front of it. There are a bunch of teenagers working there and they seem to be polite and attentive.  We will definitely be back. The ice cream is what sells this place. There are multiple unique flavors."}
{"text":"Why yes... I do not need a lid! (Code for... Please put an extra scoop of ice cream on TOP of my milkshake!!) Thank you for asking! Need I say more... Really?! No."}
{"text":"I have been coming here ever since I moved to North Carolina back in 1998.  I remember the first time I came in and smelled the good breakfast aroma.  Not only do they make their own Ice-Cream right next door that's sold all over the place, they make Cherry-Lemon Sundrop drinks and slushes in house.  I always get the Livermush, Egg and Cheese on a bun.  It never misses with me everything is hot and fresh every-time.  They have tried to update the decor but it's the same year after year.  You come here for great service, value and ice cream.  I know that it brings back so many memories for me and if you are ever in the area be sure to stop by and check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"This place has been around for DECADES, and yet, it's popularity has never waned. This place always has a line, and the parking lot is always full. When I visited, there were absolutely no booths available for seating. The interior decor takes things back old school. Ice Cream and Milkshakes are the most popular items, but burgers, fries, and more are sold here as well. I had the Cookies & Cream Milkshake for $4.25, while my boyfriend had the Cookie Dough Ice Cream on a Waffle Cone for $3.50. I was thrilled (but not surprised, because I had read plenty of reviews ahead of time) to receive a giant scoop of ice cream on top of my tall shake! The milkshake part was a bit watery, as if there was more ice than cream. The ice cream scoop, on the other hand, was absolutely delightful! However, I think my boyfriend chose the better flavor of the 2. His flavor came with mini chocolate chips, in addition to the cookie dough, and this made the flavor even better! His ice cream was incredibly creamy with the perfect amount of sweetness, and his scoop of ice cream was so humongous, it looked absurd! I know what I'm getting next time!"}
{"text":"The best ice cream around! I have been going to Tony's since I was a little girl and this place will carry some awesome memories with me and my family forever."}
{"text":"Best milkshakes in Gastonia! They need a drive-thru. Great place to people watch and spend some quality time with family. Love the butter pecan shake!"}
{"text":"If you want to get a sense of what Gastonia is all about and want to be taken back to a simpler time, then you should go to Tony's. Tony's is just part of the thread that makes up Gastonia, NC. When you walk in the door, you quickly realize that it is a popular place amongst the locals. There are people from all walks of life here. Just glancing from booth to booth you'll see suits and ties, mechanics uniforms, overalls, and boots. This place is in the blood of the people of Gastonia, which is probably due to the fact that their ancestors grew up with this place as well. It has been there for decades.   The place has an atmosphere from yesteryear, with neon clocks, old fashioned homemade ice cream, vinyl booths, and an old pepsi sign hanging out front. I'm a sucker for this nostalgia, so I quite enjoy this place. No one seems to be in a hurry and it is a great place to relax and just enjoy some of the food that makes America great: hot dogs, french fries, hamburgers, and ice cream.  I sampled two hot dogs \"All the way\" (onions, mustard and chili) and then added slaw as well. I love that they slopped it on. They did not hold back on the toppings. The hot dogs themselves had a good flavor to them and a good snap. The slaw was nice and moist with a sweet flavor. The chili was about average, and could have used some more spice. I've also had the turkey club here and it is very good. Tastes like something your grandma would cook up for you when you were out playing in the yard as a kid. The fries here were the downfall for me. They tasted very similar to standard McDonald's fries and were a bit soggy. They have Cheerwine on tap and Sun drop in cans, which is definitely a plus. The sweet tea is also southern approved.   I've only tried the ice cream in milkshake form, but that is definitely a high point. I got the Peach Milkshake, which seemed to have real chunks of peach in it. It was thick and creamy. So refreshing on a hot July day.   The price here is also tough to beat. My girlfriend and I got 4 hot dogs, fries, two drinks, and a milkshake for under $15.   I also decided to go hiking at Crowder's Mountain after this meal (maybe from feeling guilty about gorging). I would recommend stopping by here if you're passing through Gastonia to go to Crowder's or for any other reason. Tony's has good old fashioned food, with a friendly staff, and unique nostalgic atmosphere. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I'll be heading into town to do some Christmas shopping next weekend and I hope there's time to stop at Tony's. I've never had any food from here, but the ice cream is delicious. Large portions of it and it's rather inexpensive. I personally prefer the milkshakes, especially lemon and cotton candy. Grape is really good as well. The ice cream is always fresh and very, very tasty. The flavors aren't as overpowering as some ice cream- they're actually a bit subtle- but they're still delicious.   The yellow brick building reminds me of a dairy that my parents would take me to up in Michigan when I was very small. Whenever mom and dad are in town, we have to stop and visit Tony's!"}
{"text":"An old school 50s type burgers and ice cream joint. I only had the ice cream but it was amazing! Thick and creamy, you could tell you were eating the real deal. After I ordered my ice cream I noticed people getting the milkshakes which looked even better! This is a great mom and pop!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Gastonia and I always bring girls to Tony's for the delicious ice cream.   I moved to Los Angeles and I brought my wife to Tony's, the quality and quantity of the ice cream is same as it was years ago.  It is still delicious.  I recommend every Gastonia residents and guest go there.   I am deaf and was surprised that the worker know sign language to communicate with my wife and me which is A PLUS!"}
{"text":"The place was almost empty, that should of been my first clue!!  But I had heard how great this dive was so I tried it anyway!  YUCK!!!  I wasted my money again!!  Nasty little frozen burger and gross fries (grease was soooo old) the soda wasn't even mixed correctly.....  the people act like they are doing you a favor to take your order!!!  I do not recommend wasting your money or time!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place  Great food Great ice cream Great tea This place is home. Try the country ham biscuit for breakfast and the hotdog for lunch or reverse it. The menu is for the whole day. My new favorite in the sweet tea slushy ."}
{"text":"Love this place great food and great icecream!!! but seems always pack but thats cause it sooo dang good ... wish they had a little more seating tho!"}
{"text":"Small town feel... Great southern food, and the perfect place to get a homemade milkshake or hot fudge cake.   The building is old and small, and you may even have to wait in line, but every once in a while, it's a wonderful thing to experience something that hasn't been touched by the high maintenance of this world."}
{"text":"Although the prices seem a little high to me all the ice cream and food is spot on! I've never had a complaint at all about this place. It does get quite busy and when it does there is a bit of a wait time and not enough seating but if you have the time it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are the best around! If I could I would rate them a 10! Hamburgers and fries are great too. If anyone hasn't tried a grape ice cream or milkshake, you don't know what you are missing!"}
{"text":"Tony's has always been a favorite place of mine. Having grown up in the Gas House I've been to Tony's countless time. Their ice cream is wonderful! Made in house, creamy and delicious!!! I also LOVE their fried bologna sandwiches with mustard. Something about this old place keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Comfort food, simple and tasty. Been here a few times, it has the classics, BLT, cheeseburgers, the BEST fries and decent milkshakes (ask for a lid if you're getting togo because otherwise there is a huge scoop of ice cream on top)"}
{"text":"Went to Tony's a couple weeks back.  Tried to hot dog and it was GROSS!  Do not go there to eat a meal.  What you really want is the ice cream.  I am here to tell you that I Loved the Hot Fudge Cake.  Shoney's use to have one that me and my mom would share.  Tony's is far better than Shoney's.  It was huge and to be honest three people could have shared.  They put so much hot fudge on it. I am telling you I was in my own little heaven.  If you get a chance try it. You will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast and lunch thanks to an oversized breakfast sandwich and large milkshake combination.  You can't go wrong with this long time staple in g-town.  If you are in Gastonia it's a must stop kind of place."}
{"text":"Passing through Gastonia and need a cold, refreshing dessert? Stop into Tony's Ice Cream! Located right on the corner of E Franklin Blvd and Avon St, Tony's is suited for a much needed ice cream stop or a quick diner style meal. Interior is simple and homey, and parking can be found on the side of the building as well as behind it.   There are about two dozen flavors of ice cream and I chose Rocky Road, always my fave. It was just what I needed on this 100 degree day, chocolate covered almonds and marshmallows hiding in a ball of cold, chocolatey goodness. Ice cream was not super creamy, which I loved. I'll def need to make more excuses to pass through the area so I can make a pit stop at this place."}
{"text":"Tony's Ice Cream and Sandwiches is definitely a main staple in Gastonia for a number of reasons. The main reason is that you can get everything from burgers and fries, hot dogs, a variety of sandwiches (local favs like liver mush and egg), to ice cream milkshakes and sundaes under one roof!!! But, what drew me here was the pursuit of delicious ice cream! Im a sucker for its creamy goodness! I definitely was not disappointed. The ice cream choices ranged from vanilla, chocolate, butter pecan, etc to Cheerwine...yes folks, Cheerwine!!!(smile) I got the Black Cherry and it was scrumptious from start to finish. It even had large chucks of dark cherries in each bite! I'm definitely returning for another experience."}
{"text":"Ignore my earlier review - people don't come here for the hot dogs. People come here to eat ice cream cones, sundaes, banana splits, and milkshakes. Tony's Ice Cream excels at those wonderful creations.  I dropped by for a chocolate milkshake on my way home from having dinner in the Queen City on a warm Springtime Saturday evening.   The parking lot was a zoo.  The restaurant must have had seventy-five people inside, with about forty of those people standing in four or five order lines. Imagine the crowds at the Varsity in Atlanta and you'll have the general ideal.   Patience and good manners are required, but it's worth it.   My chocolate milkshake was properly thick, but not as chocolaty as the shakes that I remember from my youth. I remember those milkshakes well from the 70's - they cost 45 cents and they were about a third larger. Milkshakes today cost $4.  The employees here are superb. VERY, very, patient and courteous and Christian. The crowds here are never ending, but they seemed to take it all in stride. While the lines didn't move quickly, they DID move.   OBSERVATIONS  I noticed that the kiddies all seem to prefer the grape ice cream flavor.  I also noticed that their banana splits look KILLER. That's what I'll be ordering on my next visit. Now that Spring is here, I'm sure that visit won't be too long in coming."}
{"text":"I feel like I just walked back into the 70's! Fried boloney sandwich with mustard, onions & tomato was amazing & my chocolate ripple milkshake was way beyond expectations. The massive scoop of ice cream on top of the milkshake made my day. The ice cream is home made on the premises with 28 awesome flavored. Do not drive past Gastonia without stopping here!"}
{"text":"What a cute little ice cream shop!  There's nothing fancy about this place.  You're literally going in there for ice cream, and boy do they have a whole lot of flavors!  You can basically get any ice cream as a scoop or a milkshake.  I personally got a milkshake, but I just couldn't decide between my two favorites...cookies & cream and chocolate chip cookie dough.  After going back and fourth, the girl behind the counter said one phrase that just changed my world...\"You can get both.\"  Genius...and I did...and it was pretty darn good.  It was like a mix of flavors where I didn't know what I was going to bite into next.  The milkshake was super thick, so don't expect to drop in and drive home drinking it out of a straw.  In fact, I don't even know why they gave me a straw.  The ice cream on top was a ice touch.  Definitely recommend taking a detour off the highway to stop here for a treat!"}
{"text":"Hey Tony!  Hey Michael!  Hey Tony, can I get some ICE CREAM?  If you know anything about Gastonia, you've probably heard of Tony's. It is an institution in Gastonia. It has survived floods, plagues, recessions and earthquakes, because when you make a solid, great tasting product, people will buy it no matter what. Okay, maybe I've exaggerated a little bit, but not about their ice cream. People travel miles for this stuff and fill coolers/ice chests to take home. Now that's product loyalty.  The building is right off the main drag, old 74 with plenty of parking. Inside, the shop is pretty bare bones. There's always a steady flow of customers, but plenty of staff to help them. You may have to wait for a seat though.  My only gripe and it's a small one, is that I wish I could order a Root Beer Float or a Coke Float, Unfortunately, they do not carry Root Beer and they only have Pepsi products. Pepsi floats just aren't the same. Cheerwine Floats are popular but I'm a purist and less adventurous when it comes to ice cream. The milkshakes are my favorite product - enormous and delicious!  The portions are very generous and the staff are young, but friendly, patient and helpful. There's also a grill that does short order cooking. Dogs, Burgers, Fries, etc."}
{"text":"long lines but great ice cream in Gastonia"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such great ratings or that so many people talk about this place. I find nothing spectacular about it.  Flavors are eh, ok.  Went to get the bubble gum flavor, and oh my gosh...........YUCK!  My son got vanilla which he said, was ok, but he had much better elsewhere. My husband got a shake, and he said he had much better at a different place too. Prices are ok........but like I said, we found nothing special about this place.   I guess if you haven't experienced real good ice cream, and only went to Tony's then that would explain all the great reviews.  I wish there was a Friendly's closer to Gastonia.  Now THAT is a great ice cream shop!"}
{"text":"I got the mint chocolate chip milkshake here the other night after I got stung by a Charlotte hornet.  It helped ease the sting some, but I wish it was a thicker milkshake and that all the bits of chocolate chip didn't just fall to the bottom of the cup.  If I were to come back here again, I'd probably try a scoop of the grape ice cream instead -- this time around I really wanted a milkshake and couldn't envision a grape-milkshake tasting that great.  It also feels good to support a local institution."}
{"text":"Love this little place! Very home-town like. I came specifically for ice cream and ordered the banana pudding in a small cup. A small is still plenty and the ice cream in mounded on top. Also, if you order a milkshake, be sure to tell them not to add a lid and they'll pile that on too! They had a ton of favors, may unique... like grape soda! Sounds weird, but it actually tasted pretty good.. and how you'd expect grape soda ice cream to taste.. not fake at all.   If grabbing dinner in the area, definitely pass on dessert and go here instead!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a small child. If you want a classic Carolina style burger or hotdog, this is as good as it gets. My son and also my mom always get grape flavored ice cream. I usually get a chocolate shake but sometimes get the hot fudge cake. It's huge!  There are not enough tables for the huge hords of people inside so a lot of times you have to take it to go and eat in your car."}
{"text":"Vanilla milkshake with a scoop of banana pudding ice cream or cherry-vanilla nut sundae. You can't go wrong with any ice cream choice, those have been my go-to's since I learned to read the menu myself."}
{"text":"Twenty four flavors of ice cream can be had, in addition to burgers and Southern specialities at Tony's Ice Cream in Gastonia, NC, about 20 miles from Charlotte off interstate 85. A local favorite and in business since since 1947, Tony's Ice Cream makes the frozen treats on the premises in the factory next door to the ice cream parlor.   Given that the ice cream is homemade, I was disappointed to read that many of the ingredients that make up the ice cream were not more natural. Cutting corners by using high fructose corn syrup instead of natural, unprocessed sugar and other chemically named additives, took some of the appeal away as did the simpleness of the flavors.  The most exotic flavor appeared to be peanut butter ribbon in vanilla ice cream and Lord knows what kind of peanut butter is used in that recipe.  The simple brick facade on the corner of 604 E. Franklin in downtown  Gastonia can easily be missed, but just look for the parking lot full of trucks with hungry ice cream diners."}
{"text":"Burger is ok, I didn't try their specialty one. Ice cream is worth coming for! There's 20 or more kinds, really good quality. We had the peanut butter and the black cherry. Both excellent, loaded with flavor. The interior of the place is clean and recently painted, sort of retro, looks like it's been here a long time. (I don't know if it has. ) ill definitely come again when I'm in the area and craving ice cream."}
{"text":"nice \"old school\" ice cream parlor... got a vanilla shake that was topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream.. the ice cream was fantastic.. the shake needed some vanilla extract in it, but other than that, it was a good shake.. not sure if that's their recipe or the lady who made my shake didn't know how to make it properly"}
{"text":"This is me and my families favorite place to go get ice cream when ever we want a good dessert we rely on this place to suffice. This place goes above and beyond to have great service and even as a line looks long and the place is packed it gets you through the line so fast. Although the tables are a bit sticky we have great times and memories here. I would definitely suggest this place to any of my friends and you guys!"}
{"text":"I drove all the way from charlotte for Tony's amazing chocolate milk shake . I love that he chocolate isn't too sweet and is huge size. my mom got the banana spilt and it was enough for two people. worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love going here.. nothing beats the milk shakes.. the bubble gum flavor is my favorite!!! Food is good too.. but I mostly go for the milkshakes"}
{"text":"A little bird with pink hair told me and showed me Tony's in Gastonia and I am a fan.  We came here for dessert... hey sometimes desserts involve hot dogs, depending on who you ask.  But one side is burgers, fries, and dogs... the other is the ice cream side.  We got a scoop of their grape ice cream, which sounds gnarly when you think about it, but when you taste it, it's pretty amazing.  They captured the best part about grape soda and turned it into ice cream.  I'm a convert.  We also had a banana shake and a chocolate shake.  These shakes are pretty robust, so bring your stretchy pants.  Lots of parking on the outside of the store... I felt transported when you walk in.  you can tell they've been there a while.  The sparkly red vinyl booths and menu signs where you put up the individual letters... this place definitely hits \"vintage\" right on the head.  But don't let the old decor fool you, they obviously have been around because they have a winning formula for their ice cream and various sandwich-fare."}
{"text":"Yes sir, this place is an absolute treat. Tony's has been a staple on Franklin in Gastonia for some time now & it's easy to see why it has stayed in business for all of these years.  When you see the name, you automatically think you should only head here for a frozen treat, but they have so much else to offer as well. They serve both breakfast & lunch, so you can grab a bite to eat all throughout the day, no matter what your taste buds are craving. I love the burgers here, but everything is absolutely great.  But on to the real reason people clamor to get into this place, the ice cream. Wow, talk about goodness. This is out of this world ice cream & that's coming from a person who doesn't even crave sweets. I really can't say enough about it, from the freshness, to the abundance of flavors, you'll be blown away with how good it is.  The ratings on Tony's, while sparse, speak for themselves. It is definitely worth a trip from the Charlotte area to grab a little piece of locally made ice cream, that's guaranteed better than any store bought stuff you've ever had. Head over to Gastonia & taste why Tony's has been around for so many years, & still draws crowd after crowd."}
{"text":"Blew my mind that this place was this good. I normally post long reviews but I don't even think that I need to. Good food, it came out super fast, and the ice cream was on point.  Classic hole in the wall burger joint that has great value.   I am going to have to up my workout regiment to fit in more ice cream."}
{"text":"Holy good lord almighty!!!! This was the best ice cream I have ever had in my life. I grew up with Hershey ice cream but this kills it. Love how you can mix and match what flow it's you want."}
{"text":"I go here very often. It was always a bit pricey but now they've raised the prices again. The service is ok and you do get a huge serving of ice cream."}
{"text":"Gotta love the history and local 1950's feel of this gem of Gastonia. Don't  be fooled by the name. Although the ice cream is top notch, the diner style food is second to heaven. They serve the traditional diner wares like hot dogs and hamburgers and lots of breakfast items. ALOT of people come here for liver mush sandwiches (all the way) but I can't convince myself to go there...yet. Back to the ice cream. Your first time going to Tony's, you will find several people walking out with large white cups with a spoon sticking out of what looks like a mountain of ice cream. This is a Tony's milkshake and it is the bomb! I had to ask someone what it was. They have soooo many flavors to choose from and the waffle cones and banana splits are to die for. Tip: when you are parking, you may have to circle the lot a few times because people are always coming and going. Sundays are my favorite time to go...its nostalgic."}
{"text":"Everyone from this area knows about Tony's Ice Cream. It's so yummy. The shakes and sundaes are delicious. They also make a pretty good hamburger and hot dogs.  Tony's has been a staple in Gastonia for years now. Not sure how long they've been in business but it's over 50 years. Stop by and enjoy a cup or cone on these hot summer evenings. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Loved the ice cream and it's not expensive. I haven't had the food, so I can't speak on that. You can tell the ice cream is fresh.   Yum! Will visit again ... and often!"}
{"text":"No ice cream in the world is as good as the banana pudding ice cream from Tony's. Simple as that.   Tony's is famous in Gaston County & the West Side of Charlotte, and it's obvious by the crowd. There is always a line, the dining room (which has a lot of wasted space and could use some more seats) is always full.   The ice cream is epic, but the burgers & hot dogs are quite good too. Graham had a hot dog, covered in slaw & chili, while I got a burger. I hate slaw, so I didn't taste his. My purger was really good though. Nothing fancy, not overly greasy. And lunch for two (including two drinks and two ice creams) is around $15. It doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"A local ice cream maker. People come from far and wide just for this ice cream . This is super casual an old time. So don't think upscale. Old decor but proud. ( don't fix if it isn't broken) Order shakes ,sundaes, cones like the olden days Ice cream is super rich and flavorful  They have quarts and half gallons you can take home"}
{"text":"Cannot get enough of Tony's Ice Cream! Even though they're always packed, the line is never too long. The staff really move fast!  Hoping to continue enjoying this little ice cream Saturday night treat for many years to come."}
{"text":"Ahhh the memories of being rewarded for helping my grandfather do yard work. A trip to Tony's Ice cream. Such an iconic place in Gastonia. Best banana splits with no scrimping or substitions! Comfort food as well; cooked up just right. One of the the most inspiring stories I have to share is when our social sorority Beta Sigma Phi was doing birthdays once a month at an orphanage they donated the ice cream the whole year. Wow. Amazing to see those unfortunate, abused kids eating that superb ice cream. Thanks for that wonderful gesture of kindness. See you soon for my banana  split or milkshake fix!"}
{"text":"as good as it gets!  the best ice cream in town.  affordable too with lunch options"}
{"text":"Amazing and has been my whole life!! Milk shake with no lid is the way to go!! Livermush in the am sandwich always good!!"}
{"text":"You eat right next to the factory where it is made!! Great shakes. When you order they ask if you want the top on or off. Choose off and the ice cream in the shake rises higher that the rim of the cup."}
{"text":"YOU WILL NOT FIND BETTER ICE CREAM SO STOP LOOKING..... also if you order a shake don't get a lid or you're cheating yourself out of ice cream."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong here!!! I've been going to Tonys since I was a kid and it's still the same! If you've never been you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream. Incredibly long line but it moved fairly quickly. The food smelled great, but we didn't get any. All in all, this place provides good ice cream and plenty of choices. Their menu isn't very detailed as to what all they have to offer, but thats OK, just ask."}
{"text":"Best ice cream and milkshakes in the state! Still has the small town southern feel to a restraunt, even though they are extremely successful. If you come on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared for a wait on a booth, but it is extremely worth it!"}
{"text":"They have the best shakes in all of Charlotte, however they need to improve customer experience and upgrade interior environment.  They great selection of dairy products as well snack and sandwiches. My favorite is pineapple."}
{"text":"My favorite!!!!!! It is milk based ice cream...therefore it is light and yummy! Don't forget the hot dogs and fries are some of my favs too! Folks are friendly but down to business when it's crowded!  Always my favorite treat after a doctors visit, birthdays or end of a long week! Keep doing it right guys and gals! Xoxo"}
{"text":"So good . Long lines , old booths, but it adds to the charm ! Black cherry is still my favorite. Even a small is so BIG . Good value . Ice cream is very rich and creamy"}
{"text":"The best ice cream around. Grape, although sounds weird, is great. We go here quite often in the summer months. Almond Joy is my absolute favorite. Not a lot of places to sit in this nostalgic building but that doesn't matter much cause the ice cream is just too good. This place is a must if in the Gastonia area."}
{"text":"It is a rare thing to be able to find ice cream anywhere near Charlotte that is not from a chain restaurant. Tony's is definitely an original, one-of-a-kind place for ice cream and Southern comfort food. It is not often that I get to go here, in fact it has been nearly five years since the last time I visited Tony's! Still, Tony's has not changed a bit as far as I can tell. The place seems frozen in time - and I like that. This place is very family friendly and is all about the food - especially the ice cream.  Since I only had ice cream this time around, I will write about that... Ice cream is made next door from what I understand and comes in tons of flavors. If you are unsure about anything, just ask for a sample. I had a half scoop of black cherry and a half scoop of black walnut. It was so good and I could not believe the portion. Also, the price was very reasonable too since it was just six dollars for two waffle cones (one for me and one for my wife). If you compare that to Stone Cold Creamery, Ben and Jerry's, etc. you will find $3.00 a cone to be a great deal!  In my experience, the service is great here and the staff is amazingly polite which is a major plus for me. Please, thank you, yes sir and yes mam are a standard part of the lexicon here. There is a very strong sense of honest Southern hospitality here. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Best old fashioned ice cream that there is. Love this place. It's a landmark in Gastonia. Not sure what I'd do without a banana milkshake from Tony's."}
{"text":"This place has been around since the late '40's, and is a  total throw back to that time, including vinyl covered booths and a pink and green neon clock. You order food on one side and ice cream on the other. They make their own ice cream here, and have done so for years.  The food, hot dog, hamburger, and fries are just ok - the chili on the dog has little flavor. They do offer Livermush & Egg, Balogna, and  Hot & Spicy Sausage sandwiches which are worth a shot. But the milkshakes and the ice cream here are very, very good - good enough that if you get anywhere close, you need to stop here.  The 4 stars is for the ice cream only - the food would be at about 2 1/2."}
{"text":"Good, wholesome ice cream and such. The Almond Joy ice cream in her banana split was a favorite for my daughter. Milk shakes are unique and good. Try the iced tea slushy for something different. Service staff friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Gastonia, we make a point to visit Tonys. I love the old time feel and southern hospitality. Most of all, I love the taste of homemade ice cream. My favorite treat by far is a strawberry cheesecake milkshake. Their milkshakes are make by blending ice cream with milk, and then topping pff the shake with an extra scoop of their delish ice cream. Ive never had their food before but have seen lines out the door for it if thats any indication"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the ice-cream shop as I have not tried the food there. A piece of history...daily-made farm fresh ice-cream...This is as good as it gets! Despite having lived in the Charlotte area for 16 years, I ventured out to Tony's recently for the first time per my brother's recommendation. It was a great experience. The ice-cream there is fantastic! The place has been around for almost a 100 years now. It's not hard to believe by the look of the retro decor and somewhat dilapidated state of the building which only adds to the character. Since the shop is right next to the factory that produces Tony's ice-cream, you're guaranteed fresh ice-cream every day. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wow! It doesn't get much better than this ice cream! If you go to Gastonia and don't go to Tonys then you need to turn around! It is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Shakes are amazing.  A must stop when nearby.  If you are on the highway blowing up at 100 mph stop and go there.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"4.5 actually.  This is a cute little ice cream shop and grill. We were there strictly for the ice cream but someday will try their burgers and dogs. The ice cream was very tasty and they have a good selection of flavors. The prices are incredibly reasonable and the place has a retro feel to it. Simple and cute inside, a nice place to end up at the end of an evening out.   I feel like somehow I should write more about this nice little place, because I really do like it a lot. I will sum it up in a quite appropriate, simple, and monosyllabic word... YUM! Tony's, you've got a fan in me."}
{"text":"I did not visit Tony's to eat ice cream.  My husband did.  I came along for the nostalgia.  Growing up in the area, I can't remember a time before Tony's.  Established in 1915, it has been dishing out ice cream to beat the band.  I remember eating their black cherry ice cream, stuffed with sweet, juicy orbs tucked in cold creaminess and exploding with flavor.  Once, Tony's was part of my 10th birthday as a surprise, along with a picnic at Rankin Lake and a visit to the zoo.  That was before parents invested in bounce houses and magical clowns. I appreciate that Tony's still operates in their original building.  The interior still has the red booths and yellow tile on the walls.  Such a pleasant quality when the current trend is to tear it all down and make it shiny and new.   My husband ordered a cup of chocolate ripple ice cream in a cup, despite my hinting about black cherry in a cone.  He shared a few bites with me, and it conjured up memories of a special treat.  So, why didn't I order a cone of black cherry?  The portion size is humongous, and I wasn't hungry.  Besides, sadly (or gladly), I have lost my taste for ice cream.  But, I still have those sweet memories.  Thank you, Tony's for retaining your authenticity."}
{"text":"I'd be OK with getting diabetes if I could do it while eating ce cream from here every day."}
{"text":"Best chocolate milkshake in the world! Have taken ice cream home from Gastonia to Upstate SC and it stayed nice and frozen until we got home.  Sampled the grape ice cream based on someone's recommendation and it was so different but really tasty. Just don't know if I can ever NOT get a chocolate shake!  Have eaten there also. Good old school hamburgers, hot dogs and french fries.   Just wish they would do something about the panhandlers in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Stopped after finding this little gem on Google.  Throwback to when diners and local ice cream shops abounded. Lots of ice cream choices all made in house.  Peanut butter ripple hit the spot as a milk shake!"}
{"text":"great family owned. love the milkshakes. lemon with a scoop of grape. livermush is also fire!  a quick sit down."}
{"text":"I like to support local businesses, especially one that has been around for a long time. I think they have been serving Gastonia since 1916! And amazingly the inside looks almost like a time capsule. They serve food, but I didn't eat here regrettably, so I cannot comment. But from the menu it is your typical southern local fast food type joint: burgers, dogs, but also has breakfast. $2 biscuit and gravy?? I wish they are closer!  The ice cream was quite sizable for $3. Good ole fashion vanilla.  Stop by if you ever in the area, great spot for before or after a Crowder's Mountain hike :)"}
{"text":"Grape ice cream milk shakes and cheeseburgers all the way are what keep me coming back.  It's a unique Gaston County experience."}
{"text":"Great milkshakes! Can't wait to go back and try their livermush and other ice cream flavors! I had a chocolate milkshake and my husband had a cone with chocolate ripple. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. WOW! Best ice cream I've ever had, EVER!!! I had rocky road, my husband and kids had black cherry and vanilla. Epically amazing. We will go here every time we travel to Gastonia!"}
{"text":"Guys--don't bother.   When I moved to Gastonia, everyone ranted and raved about Tony's Icecream. And I love icecream, so I knew I'd have to try it. And I did. Repeatedly. But it's not good. It would be a lot cheaper and better to just go buy a gallon from the grocery store. The icecream I've had at Tony's is consistently freezer-burned, and it lacks any flavor--very dull. You can taste the cream, but the chocolate/mint/cherry/what have you flavor is muted. It's like they forgot to mix it right. Also, the cashiers are beyond rude--they look like they're rather jump over the counter and kill you than serve you.   I suppose if you've grown up in Gastonia you've already been brainwashed and conditioned to like this place, everyone else: they're unwelcoming and the product is bad. There it is."}
{"text":"Long-timers in Gastonia revere this place, they have family memories of it, etc. If you're in the area, check it out - but it's not a \"come drive from Charlotte the ice cream is awesome\" kind of draw.  Personally I think the fruit-flavored ice cream has an artificial, sherbert-y taste to it. The nut ice cream doesn't have many nuts - you can do better at a chain like Ben & Jerry's or Cold Stone, etc. But I do like the peanut butter and cookie dough ice creams. The price per scoop is good.The cones come wrapped in thin paper that doesn't do much to keep ice cream off your fingers.  Ambiance is \"interesting\". The decore is certainly retro, almost quaint. There are too many flies are in the establishment in the summer for me, so I take my cone outside and eat it there."}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best homemade ice cream products in the area.  Has been a part of the Gastonia history for many years, only in operated by the same family group since inception.  They offer cups cones and milkshakes. MountHolly wishes they would have a have a smaller shake. However, just take a good 20 ounce cup with you in a bad one shake into two shakes.  They also have a grill which has excellent food including hotdogs,hamburgers, fries, and other local favorites. Including liver mush and balogna (baloney) sandwiches that can be ordered plane or they can be ordered all the way which includes mustard, chili, slaw, and/or onions.   Local favorite and priced point where it's affordable but not every day........it's also fattening....... or fat free??? Yeah Right?!?!"}
{"text":"Forget Ben & Jerry's, It's Tony's & Tony's! Have been coming here since I was knee high to a pup.  They have every flavor you can imagine and scoops so big they will freeze your brain before you can finish them!  Black Cherry is always a good choice.  Try the fried bologna sandwich or livermush and egg, just like your mama used to make.  Another reason why independently owned and operated will always be the best!"}
