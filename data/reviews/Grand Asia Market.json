{"text":"I am so thrilled to find this store! Super G Mart was alright and international supermarket filled in the gaps but this place really reminds me of the grocery stores I grew up with! Of course I am Hong Kongish so maybe I'm a little biased. :)

The prices are a little bit higher than what I am used to ($14.99 for 6 oz of small conpoy? Ouch!) but they really do carry things that I haven't seen elsewhere, like lotus paste. The 6.49/lb meat and fish ball bulk assortment was tasty and helpful since I was cooking supper for a mix of omnivores and pescatarians! The produce section looked a bit better kept than the other stores too.

Unfortunately I went too early in the morning to really want to peruse the hot bar and bakery, and the BBQ case wasn't stocked yet, which was a huge bummer because I wanted to wreck some roast pork, I can never get the crackly skin right at home.

Overall since Grand Asia is about equidistant from where I stay in Charlotte with Super G I think it may become my regular jam since it means I don't have to drive on independence."}
{"text":"A wonderful source of fresh exotic produce, seafood, and other selections from the East. Their selection changes constantly, so you'll always find something new to tantalize your tastebuds at a price that beats out big-name grocery stores, should they happen to carry it. For example, bok choy is usually only $0.99/lb compared to over $3/lb at Harris Teeter.

From the restaurant part of the store, you can order a variety of desserts, steamed buns, and a variety of tasty dishes, which are cooked on the spot. You can even request a custom dish using ingredients of your choice.

My only eh feeling is that when you order a \"box meal,\" the amount of food you get varies wildly depending on which lady scoops your food. One lady in particular gives about one third of what the most generous lady does. Their selection of box meal items also changes frequently, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences. If you visit on Sundays, they offer a free soup with your box meal.

Overall, incredible selection, great prices, and friendly atmosphere. It may take a few visits to get used to, but it's worth the trip every time."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? This place blew my doors off and I must admit, my egroll got a little chubby as I floated through the ethereal as if in some sort of David lynch-Stanley Kubrick-Wang Kar Wai dream sequence. As always my disturbingly hot Girlfriend was with me and we marveled at the sheer size of this place, not to mention its organization and cleanliness. We used to cruise many an Asian market in Florida,dont you know. None kicked as much ass as this place. For the love of Ned Stark, they had Bruce Lee posters on the wall. I felt like I was ten again....awesome!!

The amount of stuff was absurd. All I could think of was going home and digging up some seriously bad-ass Asian recipes just so I could utilize half of this stuff. I'm not even going to start with the live fish market, cause I'll go all Tolstoy on your ass, and aint nobody got time for that.  If you don't go here, you are dumb. Really dumb....like Johnny Depp levels of dumb. Don't be a Johnny.

P.S Individually wrapped and salted boiled duck eggs....I had to buy them. I tried one when I got home...I came close to vomiting, but then I realized it was awesome. Go there buy something totally weird, eat it and let me know Homey,"}
{"text":"I knew it was a good sign that this place was filled with Chinese people and we were the only caucasians who weren't with an Asian friend.  We went for lunch and had the box meal (rice + 3 buffet items).  There were no labels on the bins, but the server behind the counter patiently explained the items I pointed to.  There is also a complete menu you can order from, and we got lo mein for the kids.

They have scallion pancake!  Why is this so hard to find in Chinese restaurants in Charlotte?  I should have ordered two.

My only complaint is that there could have been half as much grease in the food, but I thought it was tasty and a great value.

The grocery store is a cultural experience, and I highly recommend browsing, especially if you've never been to an Asian grocery before."}
{"text":"Everything in Grand Asia is good, but not great.  It may be the best in Charlotte in several categories, but it wouldn't be top 10 in the USA in any category.

The food court has good food for great prices.  The box meal is a great deal.  Rice and 3 choices for a good price.  The duck is good along with some of the soup.  Some of the buns, cakes, and desserts are very good, but some are just ok.  It's definitely the best place in town for those.

The grocery store had most of what an Asian would want, but as a Filipino there are a few things I wish they had.  It is the best Asian grocery store in the city.

Getting a fresh live tilapia or lobster is a very good price.  You can last extra and have the restaurant cool it for you.  That is a great deal to have the lobster and fish cooked.  It tastes great and good for gatherings at home or eat at the restaurant with a group of 6 people."}
{"text":"I am lucky to be very close to this store and shop here waaaay too much.  Their meat department is excellent with a great choice in hard to find meats.  Prices are really competitive if not cheaper than local grocery stores.  Produce is well stocked.  Love their selections of pantry items that makes following recipes easy.  The bakery in the front is also excellent.  Especially their hot food case all the way at the end, curry beef, bbq beef or even their scallion buns, all delish.   They also make the best smoothies, taro being my favorite.  

I haven't tried their restaurant yet but have tasted their roasted duck samples (delish) and hot buns are also delicious."}
{"text":"FOOD COURT: Bakery -  Boba drinks are so good. The actual boba needed to be cooked a smidge longer but compared to the other places I've tried this place is the yummiest. Today we had the milk tea and Strawberry smoothie. Both yums. We also ordered a slice of the Chocolate Mousse cake. A tad too sweet but great if you're a mousse fan.  Restaurant - Today we ordered the Beef Noodle Soup and a Plate from the bar. Beef Noodle Soup was plentiful with beef and was perfect a chilly day. Hubs said it was too herby/mediciney for him but I thought it was great. We will pass on the bar next time and order a different entree. Great options to work with and bright and spacious food area seating.

GROCERY STORE: Clean! Bright! Well organized products. Lots of seafood options and they can cook your fish to order. We didn't buy anything this time but great first impression. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The best Asian market in Charlotte!
This is my addiction - I look for a reason to drive 25 minutes to go eat and shop here. Everyone is amazing and the food.....authentic Chinese the best!
The assortment of groceries appeals to so many nationalities and countries, a great place to find so much variety. A great place for lunch, dinner, dessert, and coffee. 
I have eaten the foods already prepared and had many of the special order items. 
If you want a truly unique and amazing experience in Chinese/Asian culture go!
Great place for groups and to go to learn and enjoy. The bakery is soooo delicious, not uber sweet - just right - get a bubble tea to go with your tasty dessert!
I love this place and go at least 1x a week......I'm addicted to the place, the people, the food!"}
{"text":"Pickle bun. BBQ pork bun. Taro root cream bun. Hot dog chive bun. Beef curry bun. Red bean paste bun. Beef curry pastry. Sesame ball. 

I ate them all today and may have gained 2 pounds, but I don't care!

The bakery inside Grand Asia Market rivals any Asian bakery in the big cities. Super fresh, packaged in clear cellophane bags, lots of variety.  (Here they don't use MSG, which is great and all, but frankly I grew up in a household where Momma had a big jar of MSG in the cabinet, so I don't mind it, and frankly think it works!)

The produce section, meats and grocery aisles are nice and clean, and while nice, aren't anything out of the ordinary for a good Asian market. Like other reviews, the seafood section really is something to marvel at.  The live fish tanks are packed, but not fishy smelling, and the other sea creatures packed in ice have nice clear eyes. 

While yes, being in Stallings it's a hike, about 30 minutes for me.  But honestly, first thing in the morning, a nice cup of tea and an egg tart or a shredded pork roll can't be beat.  

Unless Super G (which I've been to in other cities) here in Charlotte beats the selection, I'll gladly make the drive whenever I miss my favorite Asian baked goods!"}
{"text":"Went there over the weekend and was disappointed...smaller than I expected...yes, its somewhat cleaner or more organized, but less of a variety of items...and it caters more to the Chinese and Vietnamese niche...price-wise I found items similar or a little above what I could pay at one of their competitors...nothing to write home about, this place is no secret, it's just ok..."}
{"text":"I am so glad a place this amazing is so close to my house! The selection is great and they carry a wide variety of everything."}
{"text":"This review only pertains to the deli area of the market. I went there for a quick bite to eat tonight with my family. Not that I was expecting a gourmet meal, but I thought it would be decent. NOT. I had the combo platter which I ordered as one of the selection, the beef (?) tendon and meat dish. I took a bite of the tendon and it was rock hard, then I took a bite of the meat and it turned out to be spoiled! I lost my appetite after that. They replaced the dish for us and promptly got rid of the rest out of the line. Good point here. Then I ordered the stewed pigs ear. I took one bite of it and it was under cooked , tough and no flavor. So I went up to the counter just to let them know. The response I got was what deserved the one star rating. The lady told me that the stewed dish was meant to be finished by cooking it at home. She added rudely that then the dish would be tasty. I thought it was a ready made dish. Well I will not be eating at this establishment again. It is gross and their attitude really suck!"}
{"text":"For you Charlotteans looking for a Asian market that doesn't scare the beegeezies out of you try the Grand Asian Market. Yes it's on the outskirts of town but it's well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Notably the CLEANEST Asian Market I have ever been to in North Carolina. Their prices are not as low as Super G Mart, so they lose one star for that but otherwise an extremely pleasant place to acquire Asian ingredients, fresh baked goods, dim sum and even a delicious lunch served buffet style."}
{"text":"So today I discovered that if you cruise on down Independence past my usual international shopping stop, super g mart, you discover this shiny new market. As the name suggests, the spot's focus is more Asia-centric, so I can't grab Goya products along with my dumplings. But within Asian grocery alone this place had a few items I couldn't find at g mart- tofu noodles, \"Japanese\" egg tofu and a wide pocky selection for example. They have an attached cafeteria and bakery of which I can't yet speak, as we were still full from breakfast when we made our visit. It's a good market and worth a visit but since g-mart is closer anyway I'll probably stick with them for the most part."}
{"text":"I like the box meal, pick three items...cheap price.  fresh lobster from market........cook fresh by pound.  not expensive at all!"}
{"text":"Everything you could ever possibly need in an Asian market.  Wow, I mean everything.  Huge fresh vegetable, meat, and dairy selections as well as aisles and aisles of great canned, dried, and bottled ingredients.   Really love this place for all my Thai, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese needs."}
{"text":"This is a great place to find diverse foods and see different things. If you are any type of Asian this is the store for you.  They have everything you could imagine. I only give this 4 out of 5 because the staff can't speak English and it's annoying but they also have a food court and the food is great if you like Hong Kong style food. If you like normal American Chinese food then you won't like this :)"}
{"text":"Grand Asia market has a multitude of goodies! We tried the hot dumplings and they were large and yummy. I had two and probably should have shared them (pork and something else that I could not identify but it was delicious). They are the large 3 inch diameter size and have a variety of fillings.  These are not the tiny soup dumplings.  The dough has a sweet taste and the meat was savory.  They also have a hot menu that changes daily, but we were focused on dumplings.   We also sampled the bakery--a sweet cream bun that was so sweet I could not finish it.
It is an actual supermarket of Asian goods so try something new--I tried Japanese Yams, very sweet and delicious.  Also, they have lots of seafood, which we did not buy but looked very fresh.  I'd like to come back and try more dumplings!!"}
{"text":"One day, I decided to drop in just to see what they had. I was surprised to find fresh fish, good produce and hard to find meats. Example rabbit.  I've been several times!"}
{"text":"This may be the only place in the Charlotte area where you can buy fresh live fish out of fish tanks. It's absolutely amazing. I had bass cleaned up and steamed with ginger in the kitchen for about $15. It's really worth it. The cafeteria section up front has more less authentic Chinese food selection for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have no idea how I went so long without discovering this place, but I finally made it.  Bottom line, its priced a little higher than Super G mart, but its much cleaner and has a more pleasant aroma.

I don't really know how to rate a grocery store, because normally its you who's cooking the final product.  The produce was fresh, but yet still affordable.  They have a huge freezer section.  I keep bags of dumplings at my house all the time, they are the same ones a lot of restaurants use ;).  The bakery was good, but I'm a sucker for the buns, even though these weren't anything special.  Their pre-made \"Chinese\" buffet isn't great, but the price is right.

Keeping this one short and sweet.  If you live close by, GO here NOW.  If Super G mart is closer to you and you don't mind the smells, this place ain't worth the extra effort."}
{"text":"What a gem this place is. When I moved to Charlotte in 2005 the only decent Asian grocery was over near Tryon and Sugar Creek. A hike for me, and the selection and service were poor. And have you seen that pothole ridden parking lot? Grand Asia is super clean and the staff are pleasant and helpful. And what's not to like about a grocery store with Bruce Lee posters on the walls? They inspire me to eat like a champ!
If you're like me (adventurous but can't read anything but English) just ask someone at the store what a label reads and they will help you decide if it's something worth trying! The one time I asked for help from an employee who didn't speak English, he gestured for me to wait there and he summoned someone else who could understand me.
I've had the food at the hot counter and everything I had was delicious. If you don't want to go for the two-choice deals, the cook will make you something to order off their menu. Again, if you aren't sure about something just ask. The bakery is terrific. Creme filled rolls are awesome. And the chiffon cake is fantastic. They recently added some Filipino bakery items that get delivered on Fridays but on the day I was there they only had ensaymada. I was hoping to get some pan de sal. They always have samples, or an offer of free iced coffee, or some other generous gesture.
The produce is terrific, and there is an extensive refrigerated and frozen section."}
{"text":"A GEM  (albeit out in the boonies).  Had been spoiled by the original Grand Asia in Raleigh/Cary, and was so excited when they came to the Charlotte area.  

Restaurant, bakery, and selection/price of grocery items is FABULOUS.  Clean and well laid-out, well worth the drive from South Charlotte.  Wonderful selection of Bao, Bubble Tea, sweet and savory baked goods.  

If you enjoy ethnic foods at all, this is a MUST GO."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the fresh produce! Prices are so reasonable and the assortment overwhelming. It's such a wonderful experience to shop in a store where there are Asian items that'd be \"specialty\" or \"ethnic\" in regular grocery stores at inflated prices. I've picked up a few items from the food counter to eat and found them to be fresh and tasty. The store is clean and neat, easy to navigate."}
{"text":"Awesome Asian grocery selection, the times I have shopped the produce is very fresh and for the items you find in a typical store, the prices are often lower too.

Yesterday I tried food from \"Joy Luck Club\" lunch counter.  I'll definitely be coming back here.  The chef made my fried rice while I waited, and I think it may be the best I've ever had.  There had to be at least 10 shrimp in there, too.  Also tried the egg drop soup which was downright awesome.

I marked down a star because the entire store has a perpetual smell of dead fish.  There has to be a way to improve that a little."}
{"text":"Tucked and hidden, a little secret well known only in the Asian community, Grand Asia offers everything a secret gem could radiate. At its core, Grand Asia is a grocery store that offers a variety of produce, and an even bigger variety of spices, sauces and seasonings from several Asian cultures. The produce are fresh while the spices plenty, resulting in this being a constant stop on my grocery route, despite it being in a land far, far away (Stallings, NC - 25 minutes from of Uptown Charlotte).

Aside from the plethora of ingredients, spices and seasonings, Grand Asia hosts one of the most authentic Chinese kitchens in the area. They offer everything from BBQ Duck to Steamed Buns to Scallion Pancakes to Tripe to Beef Noodle and so much more! I usually get the Beef Noodle, Beef Chow Fun (Beef Stir Fried in Rice Noodles.. yum!) or the Box Lunch. The Box lunch is only $6.50 and comes with rice plus 3 items on their hot bar. I love the Sweet and Sour Pork! It also comes with a side of Egg Drop or Hot and Sour soup during the weekdays.

On the other side of the kitchen, my favorite, is the bakery. Rows and rows of pastries, both savory and sweet, span the side of the bakery. I always have to get the egg tart, but there are so many other yummy treats. If you buy 10, you get one for free! They also have a wide variety of cakes to purchase or specialty order for birthdays, baby showers, etc. I would recommend the Mango Mousse cake, but make sure to order a head of time! Last, this is one of very few places that offer... Boba tea! Try a smoothie or try a tea, but always.. ALWAYS.. add boba! They're basically squishy balls of tapioca and pure happiness.

If you have the time, do venture out to Grand Asia. Buy some ingredients for a new recipe you want to try. Enjoy a delicious lunch made by authentic chefs and filled with flavor. Don't forget to grab some pastries and especially, a boba tea! This is the adventure I usually make out of the trip :) Good luck!"}
{"text":"Is there some sort of Asian society out in Stallings that we don't know about? Why does Stallings get this beautiful, clean, humongous store?  Grand Asia is right!  What I liked most about it, fresh tilapia, really fresh, swimming to be exact.  Can you get any fresher than that?

A large selection of sake, could be the largest selection I've seen in one place in Charlotte.  A whole aisle of candy.  I don't think I would make a special trip, but certainly if I were in the neighborhood, I would go again.

I also liked the bakery goods and the restaurant section.  So if you need a little snack before shopping, there's plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"I got the recommendation for this place from a Thai Restaurant who knew we were new and town (and obviously Asian) and had a recommendation to check this place out.  I am so freaking happy to find an Asian supermarket to get some of our staples (rice, soy sauce, chili sauce, etc) and the selection is awesome here.  They also have a built in bakery, bubble tea and take-out food area so it's like a mini Flushing Mall!

The prices are decent.  I was actually expecting it to be a little cheaper since I'm used to cheaper prices in NYC, but I guess it's still fair considering they don't have much competition close by.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Omg! This place is awesome! If you've never been here you have to visit just for the experience. The variety of Asian food is outstanding. Check out the fish department. I bought some fish, live out of the tank and they clean for free. There is also a restaurant inside that serves great food and huge portions."}
{"text":"As a child, I remember frequenting the Winn-Dixie that once stood where Grand Asia Market in Stallings stands today.  Unoccupied for many years, Grand Asia Market utilized the vacated space to launch an Asian grocery store as well as a restaurant one-third the size of the facility.

Their inventory runs deeps and their prices are surprisingly affordable.  Their fish market offers an assortment of live and frozen fish including lobster and some obscure species.  Remarkably, the prices of their frozen fish were very low, some as low at $2.50/lb.  I do wonder if the quality of their fish is relative to the price.

The store and restaurant are clean and decorated.  I can really appreciate the culture at Grand Asia Market; it's almost as though I've stepped over a continental border.

Follow-up: I ate at their in-store restaurant today.  It was quite good, just a bit on the salty side.  My order of sesame chicken came to about $7.  I plan to return very soon.

Grand Asia Market is closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Found this market on my way to the YMCA when I first moved here and I'm glad I decided to go inside. I love the pastries, they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Best place to buy, eat, drink Asian (mostly Chinese, vs Korean) goodies! There's a good selection of grocery items, fresh fish, and household goods. There's a Chinese style bakery that has prepacked sweets, and made to order cakes and drinks like bubble tea. They also make pork buns. There is a cafeteria that makes fast and fairly authentic meals. It's best to know some Chinese in this area since a lot of the signs are in Chinese. But most of the employees can speak a little English and there are pictures.

I make it a point to stop here to eat dinner and stock up on pastries on my way back to Wilmington, bc there is NO good Chinese food in Wilmington NC. Period."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!!! 

In the area, you can't beat the prices on their fresh produce and meat selection.

We had a lobster dinner, 3 lobsters, $45. I just couldn't believe I was feeding the family an affordable lobster dinner!!!

Some of the cuts of meat are different from what I'm used to...but it is fun to try new things.

In front they have a restaurant and bakery. Try a duck...they are delicious, try the pastries...they are so tasty! I love all the different flavors and combinations."}
{"text":"i bought the steamed buns, and they were terrific!  i also liked their selection.  i haven't eaten at the restaurant part yet, but i've got a feeling that i won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Come here if you like to waste money. Everything they sell here has higher prices."}
{"text":"This place is like Super G International Market except not international.  Their food options are pretty solid and I think their buns are actually better than Super G's.  Their produce section, though not as big, is quite good.  Unlike Super G, the produce I get from here never goes mysteriously bad a day later.  All told, it's well worth the hike and a place I'll likely go again."}
{"text":"The bakery here is excellent! Delicious fresh baked breads,cake and pastries! Boba tea is alright. 
However This place is a little unorganized and it does has that fishy smell you would expect from asian markets."}
{"text":"This is a review of the prepared food in the food court.  
All the food is very greasy and kinda makes one a little sick.  
If you think Chinese food is healthy, then eat here and you will change your mind quickly."}
{"text":"STORE: VERY ORGANIZED, CLEAN, WELL LIT. I REALLY ENJOYED THE CHINESE FANS AND CUTE LITTLE TOYS FOR THE KIDS. I EVEN SPENT $9.99 ON BAMBOO HAT (SIMILAR TO RAIDEN ON MORTAL KOMBAT! HAHAHAH)

BAKERY: The pastries looked amazing and fresh. 

FOOD COURT: The food was delicious. I particularly enjoyed #9 (Seafood crispy pan fried noodle)  I have been looking far and wide for this specific chowmein!  This dish came out to $14 but the portions were humungous! They also had chinese sausage with sauteed veges! On the glass display case where they hang the cooked duck, there was a sign that said ,\"BBQ CHEF IS ON VACATION!\" HAHAHAHAHAHA

FOOD COURT STAFF: They need to get it together. The lines are long and it takes forever for them to get through with someone's order. There needs to be a system where people don't cut in line. Customer Service skills are lacking in this department. But I can honestly vouch for the chinese cooks in the back. They are legit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Overall, I'm coming back here for the asian feel and products/food you can't find anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Best place for authentic Chinese food in Charlotte. The little take out in front of this asian supermarket serves your usual Chinese American take out and some real Chinese take out food. The supermarket is great and prices are better then the other asian markets."}
{"text":"Bought a case of Thai coconuts, we were rung up and rushed out and the register clerk failed to give us a receipt. The coconuts are all moldy and we called to tell them to ask for an exchange and the \"manager Alice\" claimed they must not be from their store and that we must bring the receipt-the one we were never given -as we were rushed out, but I did pay by credit card and have the charge on my bank statement. The \"manager\" claimed she was not allowed to do register returns-what kind of bizarre place is this where the manager can't take returns? She accused us, over the phone, of not buying the coconuts from them-no where near us except Grand Asia Market sells cases of Thai coconuts. She was very argumentative and nasty and hung up on us when we asked for an exchange. Very unethical managers running this place. Go elsewhere if you can, no one needs this kind of aggravation when they are giving business to them. I wish i could give them no stars. One last, but important note, we felt they were also prejudice and had racially discriminated against our race since when we were  in line and the person behind us was of the same nationality as the clerks and they were being very kind to her, while trying to rush us out by sticking their hands over the credit card machine and trying to punch the keys instead of allowing me to do it. This is a continual problem with them, whenever we come in we are given strange looks as if we are beneath them."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic selection of packaged and fresh Asian goods. All the pastries are fresh and you can watch them make them daily. The veggies are abundant, a million kinds of mushrooms, bok Choi and even conventional fruits and veggies very well priced. Get ready to see some cute little turtles and friends begging not to be dinner, or pick your fish and let them smash its head, hey; it's fresh!"}
{"text":"Clean and Nice Smelling for a Large Asian Market!

Restaurant inside with All Asian Diners and Ducks Roasting!  My Wife says we could come back to eat here...  Sounds good to me!

Lookalota this place is on a Saturday night, ooooooooooooooh!

Very Unknowledgeable Staff which did not matter to us, we found everything we wanted!

Very Clean Restroom!"}
{"text":"Good place to shop if you want something different. They have a bakery that has all kinds of breads and desserts. Yummy! However, as much as I like the place, I don't know if anyone have noticed their cashiers' customer service is just okay compared to other grocery stores. Some young cashiers (I guess they are college students) are nice and helpful. However, when I checked out with some older ladies, Cashier number 2 I believe (petite, short hair), the customer service was not so good. I mean her English is okay, and I did not expect her to speak good English, because I can see their little screen and all I need to do is to swipe my credit card. But lady, please at least have a good attitude. One day I even saw she was yelling at a bagging assistant, in Chinese. It just sounded horrible and mean, and the poor girl just stood there and listened. Mean, mean, mean... Please don't treat people like that!! I really wish the store manager can see this and give her more training! Other ladies are wonderful. This is still a good place to go though."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Charlotte I want to stop here.  
Good grocery choices and baked goods.  Very helpful staff.  Next time, I would like to try the cafe."}
{"text":"I've been transported back to downtown Flushing, NY!  Images of whole ducks hanging in windows. The aroma of marinated meats simmering and frying and the bustling fish market.... All in one place! I can get all of Asian fixings in one place!  This is the largest Asian grocery store I've seen in NC!  And they have a traditional Chinese cafeteria!! Mmmmm Roast duck and pork and the dipping juice!  Just know that if you are not familiar with this scene, you won't understand it and may even be a little grossed out, like my husband was but this is a part of my childhood!  Having grown up in the most diverse part of Queens, NY, I LIVE for places like these.  This market also has lots of live seafood and a great place to go in a pinch when you want to have a crab boil.  They have all the literal strange fruits and veggies that you may have seen on an episode of Anthony Bourdains No Reservations as well as all the basics.  Lots of frozen dumplings repping all parts of Asian and all your favorite Asian beers like Chinese tsing tsao, Japanese Sapporo and and Korean Hite!  This place has it all.  The prices are a little bit higher than you may find in a place that has an abundance of places like these but they know they are sitting on a gold mine and going to get paid for it! I'm thrilled to have found this place that makes me feel a little at home."}
{"text":"I just moved to North Carolina from San Diego, California, and the the difference between the food is huge. it is so hard to find a decent meal here, or at least in Monroe and it's surrounding areas when it comes to things that aren't barbecued and fried. The food here was as goo as back home, which has been really hard to come by. It is a little pricey, but I would rather pay the extra cash for food that isn't bland."}
{"text":"They have the best lo mein and fried rice in CLT (meat is perfectly cooked).  Both house lo mein and fried rice are consistently good.  Some items from the take out buffet are very good (spicy squid with bell pepper and jalapeño, fish cakes and an unnamed dish made of greens with edamame, red chilli pepper and ground meet).  After they closed Dynasty, this is our go to place for chinese food. 

Bakery items are great too.  A lot of tasty choices.  Service is an area they can improve"}
{"text":"When this store opened, the people were lively and friendly, the Bakery and Food area were sweet and cheerful! That's what we as Customer value the most. Now, it's been died down and just plain like any other Asian stores. I usually shop here since it's the closest area, recently today I stopped by to get some quick groceries, after I had paid my groceries, I went to the Bakery section and order a Bubble Tea for my sister, simple right? The main problem is, that people do not know where the line is, it's all over the place and crowded that you don't know if the person next to you is in line or just looking at the baked goods. But, when I was in line (so I thought I was), there were these two ladies just skipped in front of me like I wasn't visible; so I had let that go. Then this third lady came in front of me with her plate full of bakery without a word to me, again. So I tapped her shoulder and said \"excuse ma'am, but the line is this way\", she turned around and talked to me like I was child saying, \"No, it's okay, I'm just leaving it there, I'm gonna go get something else too\".   I was getting annoyed and ordered my sister's drink, the guy that took my order didn't greet me, he just asked what he can get for me, I thought it was awfully rude. These workers behind the counter didn't even TRY to resolve the issue that I was having between this lady. Nor did they apologize that there was a confusion going on. Both of them just froze like we spoke another language. I was so fed up that  after my sister's drink was ready, I left without saying a thank you. 

Again, this store is usually a miss or hit and sadly it's a miss. These workers look like they're not having fun- they're not smiling nor greeting you, they look like they don't want to be there, no experience in Customer Service, no knowledge of how to handle a situation where a Manager of the store should step in. I dislike how this store is being operated, it's not professional and just rundown. 

The store is not great, but it's okay. I won't return to the store sometime soon."}
{"text":"Came here from California so we could make some vietnamese home cooking for family,

Grand Asia offered everything we needed. Produce, fish and meat was all good quality. However we were a bit dismayed the butcher would not break down the pork belly from the giant slab available behind the counter.

Prices were great as with the asian markets in Cali. Staff was an interesting mix and mostly helpful and friendly. They had some korean, filipino, vietnamese, and chinese snacks and ingredients.  

We were able to purchase the brand names we prefer: pearl river oyster sauce, three crabs fish sauce and coco rico soda, along with thick style soy sauce, quail eggs, baby bok choy, wood ear mushrooms and peeled garlic cloves. 

Great option for cooking asian dishes in Charlotte, NC. We also tried they bao at the deli section which had a good selection of chinese pastries and cakes. Filling was not good but the bread was warm and fresh."}
{"text":"This is a combination of a supermarket, a restaurant, and a bakery. When you enter, a restaurant is to your left. They serve Amercanized Chinese food, along with some more ethic dishes such as Taiwanese beef noodle soup, roasted pork, barbecue pork, and sometimes roasted duck. 

I tried the barbecue pork and the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and both were nice. The slices of beef were thick and hearty while at the same time being incredibly tender. The noodles and the broth were flavorful. The barbecue pork was tasty without being overpoweringly sweet as sometimes happens. The pork itself was juicy and well cooked. 

I have not tried anything out of the bakery but the consistent lines suggest I should make room for a sample next time I'm here. 

The supermarket has all the basic Asian staples and seems to cater more to Taiwanese tastes. There's a fresh seafood section, along with lots of fresh produce and some frozen staples. The prices are competitive with other Asian markets in Charlotte. 

Overall, this is decent ethnic supermarket with some nice amenities. Its a bit out of the way for me, but I'll still make a point to come back and try some of the other food next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Grand Asia Market is a gem! They carry the best products, fresh, frozen and packaged, the store is SUPER clean and the Chinese restaurant (that is within the market) is AMAZING! Worth the hour it takes me to get there. Love it."}
{"text":"I am a Taiwanese who lived in San Francisco bay area for 6 years and just moved to Charlotte recently. This is by far the best Chinese grocrey store I found in the area. 
The grocrey area itself is ok, can't compared to Ranch 99 in SFO of course, but you could find all the basic stuff you need for Taiwanese cooking. Vegetables and fruits are not that great, a lot of them looked not that fresh, meat and seafood are a little better. The thing bother me about this place is that the items are kinda all over the place, and the shelves are pretty messy.  But I love that they play a lot of old songs from Taiwan, the hand made dumplings are the best I have in U.S., and fresh baked pastries are pretty darn good. For all these resons, I am willing to drive 25 Mins every once a while to get a taste of home."}
{"text":"This place is great the food wow! I was in new York again! Great place !!!I I love it here! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Yes, as good as it gets in North Cackalacky (the one in Cary might be a tad bit better)! A nice, clean, well stocked Chinese market, finally near Charlotte. Why Stallings? Probably cheap rent, or maybe there's some large Asian community out there that I don't know about. If it's the latter reason, call me up, my language skills are quickly deteriorating. 

Store has tons of space, aisles of essential produce and ingredients for the random times I decide to cook, lots of awesome candy and snacks (which is usually what I get here), and tanks of fish and lobster. Also included in the market is a little eatery and bakery. 

One of the food things I've missed the most after moving out here has been Taiwanese bread. It's a small bakery with fresh baked bread, cakes, and boba tea drinks, but it's just what I need to satisfy those cravings. Pineapple bread (which has always reminded me of Mexican pan dulce, not actually pineapple flavored), red bean filled bread, custard filled bread, coconut bread, coffee bread, hot dog bread, shredded pork sung bread, and so much more. I went a little nuts the first time I visited and bought way too much bread, I ended up eating two of them on the drive back home. 

The little eatery was also a nice reminder of the many, middle of the road fast food Chinese places all around so cal. But everything was cooked with less oil (and thus tasted lighter) and fresh ingredients. You can get the combo, 3 items and a pile of rice, or a couple different entrees. Of note is the beef noodle soup that's a typical Taiwanese street food dish. Oh, and they have roast duck and BBQ pork hanging up, just like sam woo. Woohoo. 

Service has always been good for me, but it could just be because they're excited to see another Chinese person, we're like four leaf clovers in a clover field, or something. I never expect good service at Asian places, it's not normal, so my expectations could just be low. 

Location is slightly outside of Charlotte, but now I don't have to drive to Cary or Atlanta to get my fix, so I win. I WIN."}
{"text":"I had heard the tales of this place; a grocery store, restaurant, and bakery.  I just got one word;  dammnn.  I should have come sooner.   This place just rocks!!!  And biasly i feel at home here,  lol.  I will come back again and again.   Enjoy the pics.  All is good."}
{"text":"If you planning on buying fresh breads don't go there later during the day. There weren't a lot of options. 
They have food court there. They have made per order and stuff that they already made. The box meal was 6.50. Steam rice or fried rice with 3 sides and small free cup of soup. MASSIVE amount !!! Great price. Taste....? It was alright. Nothing spectacular. 
My friends order seafood crunchy noodles. Again.. MASSIVE amount !! Probably for two people or even three !! They will cook any type of fresh fish you want to order as well. 
They have fresh steam buns and cakes. 
On the market side there were a lot of fresh vegetable and fruits. They also sell fruit trees. Fresh seafood. They seems to make their own meatballs (for pho type ) and few other home made stuff. 
Few things are disorganize like tea were all over the place doesn't have a destination place which is hard to find. 
Good selections of sake in fridge sections."}
{"text":"Really like a lot Had a great selection The fish and meat market was really nice and stocked same with the other places in the store. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"WOW, first, don't go on weekends if you can help it! Check out the seafood & the veggies. Lines for their cafe were too long to try but the soups looked like they were to die for! Two doors down is Enzo's Italian. Interesting prepared foods for those on the go."}
{"text":"Plus:  They've expanded their hot foods offering with more authentic Chinese food!  My two favorites are now available when ordering a \"lunch box,\" or combo plate for under $7:  book tripe (stomach), and pig intestines.  So yummy!

Minus:  When the place gets busy at the hot foods counter, the gals working there get confused and service becomes horrible!  You'd think that since this place is nearing its one year anniversary that the gals would know how to handle more than two customers.  Create a queue system, fill orders one at a time, and ring up customers one at a time.  Simple enough, right?!

I'm unsure if this place is going to survive very long...it's located too far away.  The Raleigh/Carey store has it right."}
{"text":"Friendly staffs at the bakery and grocery! Love their bakery and lunch meal. 3 choices with rice. Ordered a fruit base cake !! They made it in 30 mins!"}
{"text":"I like the deli, and our family don't usually eat Chinese food while in Charlotte - the food were just too bland and generic for our taste.  We would always wait until we visit our families in either Atlanta, NYC, SF, or Boston.

If you prefer ambiance over food, then this is not the place for you.  But if you don't mind to trade in those dining elements for some good authentic food, then this is a good place to check out.  For us, Grand Asia have good food - it's simple, but very tasty.  We live in uptown, and I don't mind the drive because it's either you spent the time (20-25 minutes) on the road, or you wait in line to get in to the restaurant, which it was never an option for us.  

This is very kid- friendly, affordable place, the kids always look forward to get the fresh mango or Lychee bubble tea for dessert.  I'm glad we are finally getting some real Chinese food here.  We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"DISCLOSURE : I did not check out the grocery store. I only went to the bakery. 

I like how you can see them baking the goodies, that's always a plus. All of the baked goods were fresh, even at 5 in the afternoon. The area was clean, so, that's a plus. a little bit pricier than what i'm used to, but given the area/circumstances, it's understandable. 

I'm definitely going back. I'm excited to check out the store, try their bubble tea, and possibly get something to eat from the eatery. Look out for an updated review soon."}
{"text":"Very clean market area. Most items usually stocked from what I can see. 

Only to nitpick the sauce area where nothing seems to be organized. 

However- their prepared food area / restaurant area DESPERATELY NEEDS a customer service facelift. 
The lady who was taking our order (two lychee boba teas and 2 Pork steam buns) was excessively rude. 

She messed up some order before us, and then began yelling at the ladies behind her. And she LEFT US mid service. From there our complete order got screwed up. There is no process."}
{"text":"I will definitely come back!  So much to choose from. Fresh produce & fish (some are still alive! Can't get fresher than that!). 
My daughter was grossed out - but she's a teenager. I was excited to see all the selections here. I found everything here that I need to make beef Pho soup. I'll definitely be back when I'm ready to start making my own sushi at home. 
The only thing that bothered me was the odor in the place. Don't know what it was. But it's strong. 

Everyone was very friendly. Staff & customers to help with questions we had. So glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it saddens me that I would have to bump my rating down a notch. This place used to be a great stroll with the family, but that was when the first opened and into the first couple of years when they were new. Over time it has steadily gone down hill. I just paid them another visit yesterday and I have notice some very notorious price scamming behavior that I have seen at other Asian grocery. The sign for purple sweet potato says 89 cent but they come up as 99 cent. Asian pears I bought 3 to try and they said it would be 99 cent on the sign, those came up as 3 for $6?! What is more ridiculous is the persimmons, they are definitely 99 cent a pound, I was charged $1.29, thankfully the persimmons are right next to the cashier, so I just pointed at them, which gave them no excuse but to change it. The cashier didn't even bother to go check on the sweet potato and Asian pears, she just asked her pears on the next isle, that is very unprofessional to go by the word of mouth. You have to be very careful here and check your receipt.

They started selling yesterday's bread here, their bread usually run around $1.20 or so each, they are selling their yesterday's bread in a lot of 5 at once for $4.99. OK, that is still $1 per bread and those bread did not look fresh at all, and the options are very unhealthy. 

The most economical option here remains the rice boxes $7.99 with 3 entree options, but what sucks is you have to get steamed rice, though it comes with a soup, nothing fancy just egg drop or hot and sour. 

The grocery option here has gone down over time, the prices are not as competitive as the Korean counterpart G mart on E independence Blvd."}
{"text":"We are new to Charlotte and have been seeking out the Asian supermarkets to see if we can find our favorite Asian food products. Grand Asia is a medium sized supermarket that also has a restaurant and bakery. 

We were told that the bakery's pastry chef was a former pastry chef from the Four Seasons Hong Kong. So we bought a dan that (egg tart), bolow bao (pineapple bun), tau fu fa (sweet or savory tofu dish), milk tea boba and strawberry smoothie boba to try. Both of the bobas were pretty good, the boba was dense and chewy as they should be and the drinks themselves were very good. The strawberry smoothie was made from real strawberries as opposed to a powder mix. I was pleasantly surprised to see they had the tau fu fa as you usually cannot find it outside of dim sum restaurants or a Chinatown. We opted to have the tau fu fa as a sweet dessert. We were given a few squirts of the sugar syrup but had to ask for more and also the ginger syrup as it was not offered to us. It was served warm and was pretty good. We saw someone eat it with scallions and I think soy sauce (I've never had it as a savory item). The two items that fell short of our expectations was the dan that and bolow bao. The dan that was eggy and bland instead of sweet and custardy as it should be. The bolow bao was the worst. I might as well have been eating paper. It was so dry and tasteless. It's supposed to taste sweet and light with a nice chew you might find in a brioche bun. 

We also ordered beef chow fun from the restaurant. It wasn't bad but the wait for the food was interminable. We were there at 5pm on a Saturday so before the usual dinner time but there is only one cook so we waited 20 minutes for the noodles. 

The selection of groceries were so-so. I found it somewhat lacking but I'm used to gigantic Asian supermarkets in NYC and Boston where I can shop to my heart's desire. We were able to find some of things we would normally buy at an Hmart but found the selection of brands to be small. Where I'm used to finding 10 brands of gochujang here there were only 3 to choose from. My kids were hoping to find a variety of Calpico (their favorite yogurt drink) but only found a small sized bottle of the strawberry flavor. They did have a decent selection of ramune (Japanese soda which is my kids' other favorite Asian drink). 

All in all, a decent supermarket. Depending on what you're looking for you may or may not find what you want. I was only able to get half the items I was looking for."}
{"text":"Spoiled by HMart and the Super 88, I was disappointed in this market. It was disorganized, untidy, and didn't have what I was looking for. 

I will say, though, that the bakery and food stall at the entry had good steamed pork buns and black bean donuts. I wouldn't make a special trip here, but, if I lived in the area, I might swing by occasionally."}
{"text":"Having a lunch box special. Fried rice, spare ribs and tofu, Love it! I come here offten with my family."}
{"text":"I spent nearly seven years in China, so moving back here made me wonder if I had to give up my love of authentic Asian cuisine. Grand Asia Market is close by, affordable, and carries pretty much everything I would need to cook real Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, etc. food. I highly recommend this store to anybody with experience living in Asia, or anyone who is looking to expand their palate to new delicacies. The smells might not be what you expect from an American supermarket, but if you want the authentic ingredients, you will learn to deal with it. Check them out; I guarantee you'll find something new and exotic. They also have a pretty good Chinese restaurant inside the supermarket, in case you're looking for a quick meal, and it's always busy, so that's a good sign. Finally, you will notice that fresh herbs, things like lemongrass (which can range from $2.50-$5 at other grocery stores), and everyday vegetables like Chinese cabbage (Napa cabbage) are far cheaper here. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A foodies paradise!!  What more can I say that hasn't already been said!?  This place is truly amazing!  A produce selection that can't be found anywhere else in the area, the variety of Asian and Indian ingredients is astonishing, their bakery is like no other, and they have a fish monger!!  My teenage son is a foodie-in-training and he can't get enough of this place!  We spend hours (literally) perusing the aisles every time we go in there and we always leave with a cart full of food for less than $50.00!   We're big fans of their fresh noodles...and most varieties are less than $2.50 per pound!  I have whipped up some amazingly delicious meals thanks to the unique items that I have found at Grand Asia Market."}
{"text":"If you have decided that you can no longer handle the Atlantic Farmers Market or Super G for one reason or another - generally the fact that they tend to have some sort of funky odor about them - you might want to take a drive out to Stallings.  Stallings?  Unfortunately, yes.

Like why is it in Stallings?  I am not likely to be keyed on on a large (or even a small) Asian community, but it is also possible, so I would have to agree with Annie and say that rent is cheap, certainly more so than a location on Independence, although perhaps not than a smaller spot on Eastway.

Regardless, the building itself is impressive in its cleanliness and organization.  Rather than a somewhat haphazard collection of stuff seemingly arranged in any which way, you have a nice restaurant right up front (rather than in a rear corner), a very impressive seafood section (with several tanks of live fish, ready to be prepared however you request for a small additional charge) and row upon row of just about anything you could want.

One area they are perhaps not the best is the produce section.  Super G, for instance, has a much larger selection.  Not sure why, really, but the produce seems like an odd stepchild here in comparison.  There were some interesting areas, like tofu, that had some nice looking fresh selections, in addition to the prepackaged varieties, which I don't recall seeing elsewhere.  But the produce was rather disappointing.  Maybe it just didn't move and so they do not dedicate the space to it.  Efficient and all, but it would be nice to see more."}
{"text":"If you ask any Asian person where they go to get their familiar spices and groceries, I'll bet 99.9% of them know about this place.  However, this isn't only for Asians, anyone can stop in and find what they're looking for as the aisles are labeled based on the culture (Filipino, Korean, etc.).  If that doesn't help, you can still explore the endless array of 'water animals', fresh baked goods, even a bubble tea counter.  They also have a small dining area which serves some traditional (it looks to be) Chinese fare.

It's quite a bit of a drive, but if we're ever in the Matthews/ Stallings area, this is a must stop for your Asian cuisine needs."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my mom and I was excited to see it for myself. We are at the little food venue first - I ordered Taiwanese beef noodle soup and my mom ordered the pork and duck rice combo. The soup was amazing! It's a very flavorful rich beef broth with veggies and pickled mustard greens. The beef was super tender and the pickled mustard greens gave the acidic bite needed - similar to adding lime in pho broth. My mom's meal was delicious as well - the BBQ pork was a tad dry but the oils from the Peking duck over the rice made it a perfect meal. 
The reason for three stars is because the store itself is lacking to me. I'm Cambodian and there's not much here that I'd buy and what I would buy was too expensive. I get better deals on the same products at Super G Mart or even Asian Corner. 
This was the furthest store from my home so not going to venture out this far again."}
{"text":"Went there recently with a friend of mine to shop for a specific dish.  Found almost every thing I needed.  Super happy. My friend found a soy sauce from southeast Asia.  It was a clean store and the pork steam buns at the restaurant in the front on the store were AMAZING!! Will definitely be back but need to go to Super G to find some things.  :("}
{"text":"The best Asian market in Charlotte. A nice Chinese food stand inside. Clean environment and nice service"}
{"text":"Meh.

Not the best and not the worst.  Vegetables are always fresh and selections are excellent.  Seafood is great too.

The bad, Bakery items are overpriced....  bbq meats...  stay away, dry and rubbery.  

Parking is easy, but too many pot holes."}
{"text":"This review is for the reataurant inside the Grand Asia Grocery Store called the Joy Luck Club. There's a mix of authentic and Americanized chinese dishes served here. I typically get the combo where you pick 3 differebt meats/veggies and rice, for about $7. (Now $8) Pretty good deal. They also have chinese roast duck, chicken, pork hanging. You can buy it by the lb or as a combo. They also offer a bunch of traditional chinese noodle soup dishes as well. If you purchase seafood from the grocery store, you can have the reataurant cook it for you for a small fee. Food is pretty good. If a certain dish looks like it's been sitting at the steam table for too long, I wouldn't order it. For the price, it's a great value and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Huge store with many Asian delicacies. They have live water tanks in the back of the store that house fresh fish. Also many specialty baked goods are on display-we visited during the moon festival time of the year and he variety of moon cakes was astounding. I bought the traditional al red envelopes for money tokens given to family members. 

All sorts of kitchen gadgets, decorations and books are piled haphazardly like in an outdoor market.  Also many trinkets, crockery, and utensils. 

The produce section is huge and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Being the only Asian supermarket in the area, I had high hopes. My parents go there all the time and I wanted to go check the place out. Grand Asia consists of a general grocery store (with fresh and packaged produce) as well as a bakery and dine in area. Let me break it down for you.

When you enter the supermarket, the dine in area is to the left. Being the curious eater I am, I had to scope it out. It has a roasted meat area and a hot food area. All the food looked dried up like it has been there for awhile. 

Moving on to the fresh produce. Maybe because of the lack of competition, the price for vegetables/fruits were high and the quality was very low. This may seem unfair since I come from New York where Asian supermarkets are being built back to back and there is competitive pricing and amazing quality. Frankly, I was kind of grossed out how they could sell bruised fruits at such high prices. You loop around the store and you find the canned foods (alongside with snacks), fridge section (fish balls and ice cream yummm) and fresh fish and meats. Pretty standard stuff. Before you exit you will be able to feast upon the bakery section. Now their baked goods are not bad but definitely can't compare to New York baked goods. 

All in all, being the only Asian supermarket in the area, I would have to come back if the craving hits. Do I want to? No I don't. The service is awful, the place is always a mess and the quality is subpar."}
{"text":"Usually I am a fan of the drinks and desserts they have here but today I was not as lucky as before.

I ordered a milk tea and I'm not sure what it was because it tasted normal but it made me nauseous and really upset my stomach. We also got buns and some buns that are supposed to have a filling were lacking the filling. I'm hoping my experience will be better next time."}
{"text":"As a chef I often need a few sprigs of thyme, mint or maybe just one eggplant. This is a great place it is small in size but has enough of the things I need to go when I am in a pinch. They have a huge bakery and restaurant, not a big fan of chinese bakery and the food is so-so. I'm happy I can always get NC farm raised fish, the occasional thyme and a small selection of Indian spices and all the coconut milk I can ever use"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the build up, the long drive, whatever - but I expected more. 

Bakery is either sweets or meat during the week - not including a tasty scallion bun I scarfed in record time - but the couple of cool-sounding vegetarian stuffs were unavailable. K.

Buffet-wise, there was a really, really unappetizing looking egg dish - scrambled with tomato. Rest was beef/chicken/seafood. K.

There was an entire half-fridge section of interesting things done with soy - crepe, marinated, fried, baked, gluten products as well. A tad more comprehensive than other, closer stores. Pretty rad sake selection. 

Still. If the bakery/restaurant was more veg friendly, it'd be worth it, the 20 minute drive. As it stands, not so much. A clean floor does not a worthy adventure make."}
{"text":"Every time my Mom has visited us here, she has been searching for a good Asian market to buy food from and I think we finally found one! It is a 50 minute drive from Lake Norman but we were able to stock up on lots of frozen goods as well as satisfy our tapioca milk tea craving in the process. There is also a bakery there with egg tarts , sweet breads, and sesame balls. The market is clean as well and is in a relatively clean plaza area. There is also a butcher and restaurant area where they can make you fresh pork buns and turnip cake.

We are trying to figure out a way to make a trip at least once a month. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Lunch portion is so big only $6.95 and a soup for free (on certain weekdays I think) If you want to try something different from your local Chinese restaurant come here. They also have bubble teas and Chinese style pantries."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a cafe, bakery, restaurant, and grocery all in 1 place. 
I can't read any of the labels but who cares! :) 
Great prices on produce, you'll see things you'd never find anywhere else in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is cool.  I just went for the first time but I'll definitely go back.  

I mostly went to get lunch, but also to check out the grocery offerings.  I thought the food was very good and it certainly has a following among the Asian community.  The noodle soup and the Peking duck that we had were tasty.  

The grocery store had some unusual offerings that you might expect to find in an Asian grocery store.  However, unlike some other Asian fish markets it didn't feel unclean.  

I'd give Grand Asia another try for sure."}
{"text":"This Market has a fantastic restaurant built on the inside of it that you simply must try. The servings are so huge and one serving is easily enough for two people. Really great Asian food at a wonderful price not to mention the supermarket is really cool also."}
{"text":"My folks come here pretty often for someone who live about 40 minutes away... crazy right?!  Well, welcome to my family, we will climb mountains and cross rivers to get food (and the love of food is the only indication that I belong to the family... sorry Mom & Dad, I am really your child!)

This is by far the cleanest asian (or ethnic) store I've been in in this area. It is bright.  The aisles are wide (no squeezing by one another or afraid I would knock something over).  And it doesn't stink!   As much as I don't care if a place smell a little funky, it's nice to not have to subconsciously hold my breath.

I visited here last week for lunch.  My parents have packed enough leftover for me from their hot food section that it's time to try it in person.  Not bad... you can get your typical chinese to-go type food.  But mostly it's what we consider Taiwanese style... you have choices of 2 meats and rice and I think it's about $7 (think tripes, beef stew, etc).  Or you can do the dinner for 2, $18 get you steamed fresh tilapia (and it's actually better than some restaurants in town) and stir-fry chinese greens.  $25 get you half chicken as 3rd dish.  They also have the buy your fish/lobster at the grocery store and they'll cook for you option.  Cooking fee is per pound.  

Then there's the bakery section, which is awesome.  It reminds me of the Japanese bakery place in the basement of all major department stores when I was little.  They had a buy 10 get 1 free special, so Mom, Dad & I went to town.  Egg tart (the crust was fabulous, the custard part was a little hard), scallion & hot dog bun, the 3-treasure bun... unfortunately they didn't have our favorite cocktail bun :(  Next time.  And oh, with $5 purchase during weekday you can get a free coffee.  

Needless to say I didn't really do any shopping but mostly eating here.  I heard that they don't have as good of a produce area here but you get the basics.  But this is a pretty decent joint for ready to eat food.  Too bad it's so darn far away for me."}
{"text":"Great store for unusual items and hard to find cuts of meats. Yummy bakery and nice selection of Chinese takeout. Worth a visit for the experience alone."}
{"text":"Great place for Taiwanese in the area to shop and eat! Lots of Taiwanese snacks and cooking materials! Bakery and restaurant is amazing too! I'm not very impressed with the meat selection or thd fish section! But still give the store a five star rating! Every weekend they have fresh soy milk and do-hua and scallion pancake and turnip cake! I love this place:-)"}
{"text":"It's more geared tirades Chinese food and ingredients. I was able to find what I was looking for. The Bao's were pretty good, particularly their breading. I tried their bbq pork bun and it was good. I didn't want to try their hot foods by the item since they look like Chinese buffet food. I want to try their roast duck next time. Hope it's good. 

The girl who helped me at the Bao counter was very nice and helpful. The store was clean compared to many other Asian grocers, plus the parking lot pavement isn't a big mess. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Really cool place to shop. They have all kinds of interesting Asian food along with a great little place to eat. They have bubble tea!"}
{"text":"New owner cleaned the floor!!!! Now they need to clean the shelves and refrigerators!"}
