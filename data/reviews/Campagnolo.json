{"text":"We started with the fresh burrata cheese with roasted grapes & toasted bread. Although it didn't look stunning, the combination of the fresh cheese and roasted grapes along with the crunchiness of the toasted bread was delicious.

For the main course, my date had the pappardelle with rabbit bolognese, rapini, and grana padano. I had the house-made spaghetti all'amatriciana. Both pastas were delicious, and the all'amatriciana is probably the best I've had in Toronto to date. Perfectly al dente, fresh flavours, well presented, I couldn't have asked for more. 

To finish, we shared the pistachio frangipane tart with poached plums and sabayon ice cream. It was a pleasant surprise to find that the tart base seemed to be freshly baked (still warm), yet the ice cream on top of the tart remained cold and intact. I love fresh plums, but the poached plum was a bit too prune-like for my taste. Regardless, I would definitely recommend it.

The service was excellent, the server was attentive and polite without any pretention. She recommended a wine to go with our entrees, replaced our cutlery after the appetizer, and also replaced our tea light when it burned out.

Though we visited late on a Monday night, the place was bustling and the majority of tables were occupied, which is always a good sign. The restaurant was dimly lit and very cozy without the need to shout over neighboring conversations. The atmosphere definitely sets the mood for a romantic date or intimate dinner with friends. The only downside was that there seemed to be a slight draft coming from an unknown source but as we were seated by the window, we assumed it might just be the proximity to the exterior.

{"text":"Went there with friends on Friday evening after work. The place is really small but cozy after all. Servers are really nice and helpful. 
We four girls ordered three starters. House made bread, lamb sausage and beef carpaccio. Beef is really tender. The bread is amazing as almost very table has it! For main dish, we had the house spaghetti, chicken liver pasta, beef short rib and meatballs, and chicken with eggplant. All is awesome. We had two desserts. My favorite is the crispy butter tart! Fabulous ending!"}
{"text":"I hate to burst this place's bubble but it didn't live up to my expectations. The interior was nice, and there's a good vibe, but I was left wanting on the food. No complaints about service, our waiter was spot on. The appetizers were tasty enough. The burrata on garlic bread was delicious. We ordered a bunch to share but the small portions made it difficult. It was all good till the mains arrived. I ordered what was basically a pork medley on soft polenta and was completely let down. It had no flavor, just pork and polenta. my friends who ordered the fish were also equally underwhelmed. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my friend who ordered the lamb. It was the most expensive thing on the menu and all he got were two tiny pieces of meat. This is basically what bugged me most about this place. Its a complete rip off. There is no reason my dish, which was so completely devoid of any taste should have cost $26 dollars. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I won't be coming back to clarify my mistake."}
{"text":"Campagnolo had high expectations to live up to after reading all the Yelp reviews the few days before, therefore...here is my review:

Service - very friendly and knowledgable about the food and drinks. The wait time for our mains was a bit lengthy however, we were there on a busy Friday night though so while I may be lacsidasical my dining companion was quite hungry!

Cocktails - Best Dark & Stormy in town!!

Appy: Prosciutto & Burrata - the prosciutto was your standard cured meat, however they do give a healthy portion (Yay!!). Paired with the Burrata a match made in heaven! The grapes served with the Burrata have an interesting texture and temperature and didn't quite do it for me. But the cheese and toast that it's served on made up for it!

Mains: I had the Pappardelle with Rabbit and mushrooms. Normally not a huge pasta eater, I ordered this cause mushrooms and pasta make me drool. The pasta was pretty basic and I ate the mushrooms up, however I found the rabbit to be quite bland and not really adding anything to the dish. Whether this is a characteristic of the meat or a lack of seasoning, I'm not sure. 

Dining companion: The Cassoulet - what didn't this dish have! Duck Confit, Sausage and a variety of veg. He enjoyed it quite a bit! Caution: this dish is more than enough for one even two people!

Overall, food was good and ambience was cozy and intimate. Would go back but not before I knock off a few other places on my list....happy dining!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time after hearing such great things about it and it was really great.

We were two couples dining and we ordered a bunch of dishes to share.  The burrata cheese dish is a MUST...delicious.  The house made bread is so soft and served warm, which makes it really hard to resist.  Three of us had the steak for our main and one had the salmon.  All dishes were very tasty and made with fine ingredients.  Dessert was a salted caramel mousse dish, which was a perfect size to share.

The service was great.  We were initially supposed to sit near the window but asked for a table change because of a draft and the staff was more than happy to accomodate.

Considering they were short-staffed that night, the service was perfect!

Congratulations to the owners on a wonderful restaurant.  Keep up the good work and keep making fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Amazing appetizers: steak tartare and bone marrow
Great ambience & decor
Poor: Entree pastas

Having dined at all top rated Italian restaurants in Toronto,  this is now at the bottom of my list for pasta. Had an odd texture and tasted like the microwaved one from Pizza Pizza. Thought it was just my order but the featured spaghetti was just as poorly executed.

There are way better joints in town such as Buca snd Terroni's."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what all the hype was about.  How can the ex-coffee time place be?
It was excellent....gotta try the bone marrow!"}
{"text":"You know,  if there was an option of 4.5, I would give 1/2 points off for the dessert options as this is not one of Campangnolo's forte. 

However, if you fill yourself with the exceptional hearty Italian food options, there is no need otherwise to go anywhere else for authentic, original, seasonal dishes that are reasonably priced, in a non pretentious atmosphere. 

We started coming here since they were open in 2010, and they never cease to amaze our palate with original and new dishes every month - used to be daily. 
I am surprised about the reviews re: bad service, we were at the chefs table tonight, met Craig Harding, Julian and his crew. The most non-pretentious folks there. We had the most refreshing, \"Farinata Tonnata\" seared Tuna, scallions and pickled green tomatoes (slightly spicy - like WOW!), the duck and signature spagehtti all ameatriciana cooked al dente and too perfection (had a craving for it tonight)...just to name a few. We were also given a free dish by the chef/owner himself.   

We also had the experience of being serviced by many of the waiters there, some new, but most from the beginning when they first started, all seem to enjoy the work they do. This is a gem, just around Little Italy. You really cannot find a more original Italian restaurant with innovative taste/menu using seasonal dishes, that is reasonably priced with a hip and trendy atmosphere! Our Absolute Favorite!"}
{"text":"Great service, tasty cocktails and fantastic appetizers. The bone marrow and beef tartar are a must. Mains were average at best."}
{"text":"We found it just ok. Great decor, and staff was friendly enough. We had the porkchop (just fine) and seafood pasta (pretty good, cooked well). Id suggest to order the bread no matter what. Would return and try sharing appetizers with the table instead. Burrata was great, and the marrow looked awesome at other tables. Was one of the few places that I've left without a 'Goodbye' from someone... anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant! Great food, very friendly service!! We went there for friend's birthday and order the family tasting menu $60 per person, it's truly worth the money...we try most the dishes we want and all tastes! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This review is several months late so please excuse any in properly named dishes.
Overall this is a great place for a relaxed evening of fun. I found the dishes themselves very hit and miss, so hopefully this helps guide you to the winners. I wouldn't come here expecting fabulous culinary delight. However if you're in a big group of people having cocktails, wanting to try different things at a reasonable price for a fancy night out, it's just right. In general you may find in this review I wasn't a fan of the pasta dishes and they do a better job with the meats.

The atmosphere is a great combination \"homey\" and fine-dining with a very friendly staff.

Cocktails were fantastic! If you're a Caesar fan I highly recommend you try their Caesar, it's very interesting. Clear with cilantro & hot pepper makes it refreshing and different. Their table wine (I think was a Pinot Grigio) was better than most table wines in the city.

The losers:
Muscle on toast with a kind of coleslaw, was a bit of a miss, too much mayo for my taste.
Crispy bacon risotto, was a big miss for me. I found it under-seasoned, maybe was a little under cooked, would not recommend, too greasy.
Spaghetti all'Amatriciana, again not so hot.  It had a nice spiciness to it, but overall tasted like under-seasoned canned tomatoes.
Ragu was great, flavourful, mixed textures with the tripe, really liked it.  Polenta that it came with however was bitter and actually bad tasting, mixed with the Ragu makes it passable.

The winners:
The warm fresh bread with prosciutto is a must have. The warm olives were great as well.
Local burrata cheese with roasted grapes and toasted bread: I see a lot of reviewers like this and they are not wrong. Roasted grapes were really good, perfect level of garlic, cold cheese on top was an interesting juxtaposition. I really enjoyed this dish.
Pork Belly Scallops were lovely and sweet.
Lamb was very tasty, cooked perfectly and well seasoned.
Brussels sprouts, I loved! Buttery, just enough bacon, the way Brussels sprouts should be."}
{"text":"We in Toronto are blessed to live in a city with fabulous restaurants.  Save your time and money and skip this place.  Menu is limited,  each of the four dishes we had were over loaded with salt,  the service was horrible and the manager didn't seem to care when we shared our concerns. A horrible experience."}
{"text":"Over near the corner of Palmerston and Dundas West stands a restaurant that En Route Magazine listed as one of the top ten new restaurants in Canada this past year: Campagnolo.

We arrived fairly early for a Saturday night dinner, and the restaurant was about 3/4 full. It's an open space, with a small bar that people can sit at and eat, and an open kitchen.

Our coats were taken, we were seated, and given three menus.

Immediate triage reaction: what has to be decided first? We chose the cocktail menu, and each had a different cocktail. Very flavourful, all very different. There was a Hendrick's gin-based cocktail. One that seemed margarita-like. One with a peaty smoky scotch as the base. And we then sat back to figure out what to have for appetizers.

Our first appetizer up was bread: gougeres and herbed butter.

It was quickly followed by warm spiced olives, which we immediately fell in love with and devoured. What a difference in taste from cold or room-temperature olives! Of course, we've had hot olives as an ingredient in other dishes (like pasta puttanesca) but this was the first time having them on their own, enjoying the heated flavours, the herbs (rosemary, thyme, chili peppers, preserved/salty orange peel)... yum.

Then came (I think it was next) a gorgeous steak tartare. Sorry, no picture. We fell on it and devoured it. What can I say? We were hungry. Creamy, smooth, proper level of herbing and spicing. It came with a truffle aioli. That's really sinful. It's really awesome. It's better than chocolate, and I can think of naughty ways to serve it. Yes, I'll eat my red meat raw like this. I'll even do it every week, if you'll pay for it!

It was followed by a hot appetizer: sweetbreads and braised artichokes. Darling little artichoke hearts and stems on, and crispy fried pieces of sweetbreads. Paired. Sitting on little dollops of a regular aioli. Gorgeous. The flavours -- warm creamy slightly liver-like flavour of sweetbreads, inside a crunchy fried casing, and then paired with the almost not quite bitter and mild artichokes. Wonderful pairing, beautiful presentation.

Based on the order of my photos, I think this is when our bottle of wine arrived, a Primitivo Manduria from southern Italy. Sandy made a delicious selection.

Presentation for the next appetizer was superb, as well: a lengthwise slice of a marrow beef bone dressed with a plum and oxtail marmelade. Served with some crostinis for us to scoop the bubbling marrow onto.  The marrow was perfect -- still quivery, had that totally unctuous texture. The jam contributed sweet and meat to the dish, giving it a contrast that enabled us to fully appreciate the beautifully braised oxtail contrasting with the light-tasting and rich marrow, and the plum providing some acid and sweetness to cut through the other flavours. Can it get any better than this?

Oh yes, for now we're on to our mains.

I never order lasagne in a good restaurant. Just... I just don't. But I decided I would. They called it \"Nonna's lasagne.\" And I've eaten so much pasta with wonderful meats in the last two months... what would they do with lasagne?

Many thin layers of homemade pasta. I counted at least ten. It was light, it had a meat and tomato sauce, a little cheese -- this wasn't your standard North American overstuffed heavy lasagne. No bechamel sauce! It was wonderful. It tasted of real tomatoes and meat and pasta. I loved it.

Sandy chose the pappardelle with rabbit and chanterelle mushrooms (of course we all tasted each other's dishes)! Perfectly braised (by this point, I've come to expect that they know how to slow cook meat, country style).

Betty got the lamb shank, which came with perfectly caramelized cubes of potato and pork belly. Oh yes, this was a meat-eater's dish. And it was perfect. The deep rich flavours of the lamb shank paired with the lighter pork belly (I never thought I'd refer to pork belly as a lighter flavour) and the potato cubes. Awesomeness incarnate.

In case you want to accuse us of not eating our greens, we did order a dish of brussels sprouts with peccorino cheese and pine nuts. Absolutely delicious -- a bit of a cream sauce in the dish to give additional moisture. We totally emptied the dish.

Our absolutely delightful server asked us if we'd be staying for dessert. Alas, we were all fed up. He was adorable. I hope you get to sit at one of his tables. I should have written his name down. Sometimes I #fail. 

Serious line-up at the front when we exited: this place is somewhere people come back to. It's been open a year and a couple of weeks, and is full."}
{"text":"It seems that every couple of weeks another Italian restaurant crops up doing that whole \"nonna\" cookin' schtick. These restaurants are like a wave washing upon a shore. A shore littered with the remains of those restaurants' Italian brethren where their grandmothers may, or may not have, been in the kitchen. Normally, I'd say that Toronto doesn't need more Italian fare served up. I really would. If only the fare wasn't so damn good.

And so we have Campagolo, a new joint in the Dundas West area. The space is eclectic, with half the restaurant having an almost Victorian bent, and the other half done in exposed wood and neon-light accents. With a short menu, we were one dish shy of ordering the entire card between four people.

Fresh Burrata and Roasted Grapes 
Of all the appetizers, the fresh burrata and roasted grapes would be my favourite. Salty, creamy, sweet, crunchy - all these things combining into some tasty bites. The rest of the table did not achieve my level of enjoyment - which meant more for me.

Cannelini Beans with Smoked Hock
The cannelini beans with smoked hock, kale, and pasta ends, made for a nice soupy dish. Certainly warming and tasty. Vaguely reminded me of a Chinese soup my mother makes.

Wild Boar and Polenta
Wild boar and polenta was also quite tasty, though I didn't like the polenta as much. Rich and substantial, the boar and meatballs were quite filling.

House-made Spaghetti all'Amartriciana
House-made spaghetti all'amatriciana was really, really, good. We pined a little for bucatini instead of spaghetti, but it was only a minor gripe. Had this again recently and it was still so tasty.

Pappardelle w/Braised Oxtail
I love my pappardelle and this pappardelle with braised oxtail and rosemary was a solid dish.

Salted-Caramel Budino
And then, my favourite of the night: salted caramel budino. With crunchy chocolate meringue and salted caramel sauce, this is the best dessert I've had in recent memory. Just a lovely melding of texture and sweet and salty and chocolate. Good enough that I had wanted to stop by after visiting The Black Hoof the next day. Except that Campagnolo is closed on Mondays. Had this again recently too, and the taste was the same, though the pudding texture wasn't as good as the last time.

It's hard to pin-point what is so good about Campagnolo. With high points for food (more dishes in the gallery below), interesting notes for decor, and an all-around comforting vibe that the space exudes, I'm not sure it really matters.

(x-posted from the blog)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, atmosphere, and service. For most budgets Capagnolo is a special occasion kind of place, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here and would definitely recommended this place to friends.  Service was pleasant and the food was amazing.

Make a reso, because I've been turned away at the door with out one twice."}
{"text":"Campagnolo delivers on their promise: good honest home cooked food.  And if what you're looking for is a chill vibe and great service too, you'll be happy you visited.

My dining-mates and I were in the mood to celebrate so we started off with a bottle of bubbly and some tapas-style appetizers.  The paper-thin La Quercia Rosa Prosciutto was luscious, delicious, and complimented the Fresh Burrata Cheese with Roasted Grapes.  The Burrata was the definite stand out dish for me.  The Roasted Grapes it was served with were a welcome substitute to the obvious fresh or roasted tomato pairing.  I could have ordered 3 of these and been happy.  The House-made Baguette and Gougeres was lacking.  If the breads were complimentary, I wouldn't have noticed, but half-stale bread is unacceptable for $4.  They served as a decent-enough vehicle to spread the smooth, rich Duck & Rabbit Rillette on, which was quite good.

The main I ordered was stellar, as were the multiple bottles of wine that accompanied it.  If you visit Campagnolo, the Duck Confit is a must-try.  It was beautifully spiced, perfectly cooked, and served on a bed of braised red cabbage.  A big dab of grainy mustard was a unique touch, adding a nice amount of acidity for balance.

The dessert was a definite miss, so I'll attribute it to an off night given how many positive reviews it's received preceding mine.  The Salted Caramel Budino was simply not good.  I tried really hard to enjoy it, but it was a sickeningly sweet mess topped sloppily with a handful of saw-dusty meringue.

Overall, Campagnolo was really good, with a few small areas for improvement.  The ambiance is warm and easy-going.  The food was tasty and the drinks were plenty.  It looks like they have space for a patio in the summer, which is a definite draw.

Oh, and the chef in the open kitchen was pretty cute too."}
{"text":"We were there last night (fri).  Called last minute to see if table for 2 is available but was told we probably can only sit at the bar, we were fine with that.

{"text":"I've been meaning to come to Campagnolo for some time now. Last time, I wanted to come on a Tuesday, only to find out they're only open Wednesdays to Sundays for dinner only. Located on Dundas, between Bathurst and Ossington, the restaurant has a nice rustic, yet modern feel to it. The restaurant was spacious and I liked that the tables weren't cramped together.

The menus here change frequently - I'm assuming daily since the menu we were handed were dated. The menu isn't very extensive as today there were only five entrees to choose from. Not necessarily a bad thing as sometimes it's better to just focus on doing a few things well. You only have to look down the street to the success of Porchetta & Co. down the street.

Anyways, the dishes we tried this evening were:

- Niagara's Pingue Prosciutto ($11): A generous plate full of delicious prosciutto. However, I was surprised this dish didn't come with a side of bread, since prosciutto on its own is quite salty.

- House-made Baguette and Gougère ($4): We ordered this only because of the lonely prosciutto... turned out to be a good thing though. They were in little bite-sized pull-apart morsels. I had no idea what gougere's were, but they were like little cream puffs (quite hollow in the middle)

- 60 Day Aged Beef Tartare with truffle sauce ($15): Two words - Simply Amazing. This blew us all away. Beautifully seasoned beef.

- Bone Marrow with oxtail and peach marmalade ($14): Another big hit. Tender oxtail which paired perfectly with the fatty bone marrow.

- Sweet Pea Agnolotti with Atlantic lobster and a fennel puree ($26): consisted of a good portion of perfectly-cooked lobster. The fresh peas were delicious, which really surprised me. Guess I'm too used to eating them out of the freezer. Unfortunately I didn't love the pea filling inside the pasta, but the pasta itself was delish.

- Fresh Chorizo Sausage with Portuguese octopus, peperonata and semolina polenta cake ($26): I usually get a migraine eating octopus from chewing it so much, but this was incredibly tender. The chorizo had a nice kick to it and was delicious.

Simply amazing and definitely worth the hype!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu (including the price) was absolutely delectable. We ordered several small things and shared and it was just perfection! The wine was great, the staff was knowledgeable, and the decor and ambiance were modern yet felt like you were in your grandmother's Umbrian kitchen! DEEEEELISH!"}
{"text":"Lovely lovely spot w proud, knowledgeable staff who love their product. Friendly batman, delicious selection of wines and the food is top notch. Good buzz with happy customers"}
{"text":"The coziest of neighborhood restaurants, food is consistently delicious and the service is always friendly.  Craig the chef is a super nice guy too."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant several times. Unfortunately on this visit, the quality of the food was overshadowed by the lacklustre service.  With a seating at 6pm, we were not advised that the table would need to be vacated by a certain time.  While having a cocktail to start, the server interrupted us at least 3 times to ask if we were ready to order. After the 3rd time, we were aggressively informed we needed to vacate the table within 90 minutes and we better order ASAP as some of the food took time to prepare. 

We hastily ordered, our food promptly arrived and we quickly ate our food to meet the appointed timeline. As you might expect, this ruined the dining experience that we had looked forward to.  

It was curious that the restaurant was only approx 1/3 full at the time we left, (around 8pm).  We could only imagine that a rush of diners was expected and this required our server to focus on his next set of customers coming to the restaurant rather giving excellent service to the ones who were actually sitting in his section."}
{"text":"Great service, good food and nice atmosphere. Had the Baguetes and Burrata for stater - very nice, the roasted grapes were lovely. For main course, we had beet agnolotti & rabbit - also very tasty. But the best was the dessert, the olive oil cake was superb, we had to ask for the recipe - and they very nicely gave it. A very pleasant evening, the staff was super helpful and polite. The music was very eclectic thought, ranging from Johnny Cash to reggae and ending in Coolio's Gangsta Paradise."}
{"text":"Really enjoyable meal. The atmosphere, the decor, the food and wine were all lovely. I had the burrata with roasted grapes, which I loved. Then the boeuf bourguignon, which I also loved. Then the desert was the shot glass-size, caramel thingy at the top of the dessert list which, predictably, I loved as well. 

Not a cheap meal but certainly above the level of quality that I could make at home. Whenever we have a mediocre meal at a luxury price, my husband says that he doesn't go to restaurants just so he doesn't have to do dishes:-) this was clearly not the case."}
{"text":"Meh. We had a decent meal but I wasn't over the moon about our mains. For our appetizer, we tried the buratta cheese with warm grapes. It was a really special and delicious dish. I'd love to know what kind of olive oil they used because it was amazing. But the chicken cacciatore was just ok (the peppers weren't skinned so they were a bit unappetizing) and the spaghetti was just...fine. Overall a decent meal but for the price, Toronto has much better offerings."}
{"text":"The food was incredible. We ordered a pasta dish each and an appetizer and both left full, but not stuffed. We didn't have dessert here, since we were meeting up with friends elsewhere, but there were some delicious looking desserts coming out all around. The staff were very friendly, and found us a spot at the bar even though they were full and we didn't have a reservation. We weren't rushed, but when we were ready to leave they were prompt in getting us our bill. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food. Have been twice with my boyfriend and have a wonderful experience both times. Will be back - try the spaghetti with meat, it's too good."}
{"text":"4/5! Very authentic and fresh Italian food! Recommend the sausage fettuccini and most of the apps are great! Cute atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!  I went with a group of six, and the meal couldn't have been more perfect.  The atmosphere is modern, but comfortable and the service is friendly, but the real claim to fame is the food!  We ordered a few different appetizers and each one was more delicious than the last.  Everyone loved their main dishes... meats were cooked to perfection, all of the ingredients were so fresh, and the flavors were combined in unique harmony like we had never experienced before!  I highly, highly recommend you go here and try as many dishes as possible!"}
{"text":"Rather impersonal ambiance to this well-known restaurant.  Made the reservation via Open table for 615 pm.  Reunion of old friend and daughter and went into the evening with a very good vibe.  Our pony-tailed waiter dashed all hopes of a removable evening when he rushed us and after the third ask for our order in the first 30 minutes, he told us that the table was booked again in two hours.  What a way to put a damper on the evening  We asked him why we were not notified  when we made the reservation using Open Table and he said it was a separate company.  He was aloof and seemed that he really didn't care about making our dinner special.  Food was ok, expensive, and won't go back.  Too many other good restaurants where the staff appreciate our patronage."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants!  I've had a few birthday meals here but recently realized that it's been a while since I last visited.  So that was quickly rectified on a sunny week night.  With the patio opened for the summer, the restaurant almost doubles its capacity, so there was no trouble getting a table at last minute.

Some of my faves here are the Burrata with Roasted grapes, and the bone marrow.  Anyone who knows me would be shocked to find out that I decided to skip the marrow this time - it's such a rich (and delicious) dish, and it was a hot day, so I wasn't in the mood!  Instead we ordered their baguettes and gougeres, and the burrata to start.  For mains, I was happy that the pasta was the Spaghetti a la matraciana;  it's my favourite but I have also had their carbonara which is also fantastic.  The pasta is well-made and has a \"toothiness\" in texture that confirms it is not store-bought pasta.  We also had the pork belly and scallop main course.   Servings are generous, and we were unfortunately too full for dessert.  I love their budino, and should have skipped the breads to fit in dessert.   Oh well, there's always next time!

Service was OK, but less attentive than I recall from past visits.  Perhaps because we were seated outside?  We had to ask for water refills, and had to flag our server's attention for another beer.  Likewise, when we were ready for our bill, we had a long wait before we could catch our server's eye.  Not a big deal, but a little out of norm vs. previous visits."}
{"text":"The Dundas West (DuWest) strip has come a long way from the seedy shops and Portuguese churraschurrias.  Now Dundas West is known in the foodie world as the 'carnivore's' terrain with restaurants like the Hoof Cafe, Black Hoof and Porchetta and Co on it.  Add newbie Campagnolo to this mix with it's meat heavy offerings blended with homestyle Italian cooking and it's all complete.

Campagnolo meaning 'countryman' in Italian was formerly a Coffee Time donuts chain and definitely has had a face lift.  
We have a table for 12 people so in order to accommodate us, we were only able to confirm a reservation for 9:30pm.  One of the drawbacks of eating there so late was that some of the dishes (house made parpadele) on the limited menu had sold out for the night which just means that I will have to go back and try those dishes again. 
Standouts included: 
The thinly shaved prosciutto plate which came in heaping amounts and the burrata cheese dish with roasted grapes.  The burrata was soft and buttery while the roasted grapes were juicy, and sweet which made for a sweet and creamy blend of gooey oodness.
For mains, the 'House-made Spaghetti a L'Amatriciana', swirly spaghetti in a tomato sauce which was very rich and savoury with bits of pork interspersed within."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  We were a large group, so we ordered what felt like everything on the menu, times 3!  

Everything was delicious, but the burrata cheese with roasted grapes was definitely my favourite.

I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed our dinner here - fantastic table service, chilled ambience, nice cocktails and the dinner was exceptional. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This might have been a good restaurant if it was out of business. The tables are cool with good sturdy surfaces, thats the good ends. A few tables over was a couple meeting the parents, I felt bad because soon he would be vomit across the table, or back at his place. The truth is the food is sickening and disgusting. The pasta had a salty flavor, maybe this is the new hip thing but was not for me. I had the fried steak but it didn't taste as advertised. It didn't taste like steak at all. The service was slow and the waiters seemed to form a cult. The whole place screamed little pretentious hip restaurant. I am not ready to sacrifice good food and service for a hip crowd."}
{"text":"While the pasta is fine here I find the prices too high particularly given the small pasta portions. I am a huge fan of pastas and risottos and make both several times a week and recently spent 2 weeks ion northern Italy. The wine list is fine with a few high end wines (Barolo - my favorite wine - but again pretty elevated prices) available by the glass. Given the combo of small portions and high prices I can only rate this place a 3."}
{"text":"a fantastic dining experience!! 
its not five star because i personally don't like crowded places - its a small dinign area and the seats were so uncomfortable - i was seated along the bench by the window and there is no cushion - just a wooden bench. The food was so fantastic that the bench comfort level did not cross my mind during the meal but in my mind comfortable seating counts for rating as well.

the food: what an act! loved every bite!

Appetizers:
1. The buratta with roasted grapes 
- the cheese was so fresh and so delicious with the fresh bread and the roasted grapes - i fell in love with grapes all over again!

2. Bone Marrow with ox tail
- this was my first time having either of those. Not really very adventurous with my food i gave this a shot - great bet! I can't comment how well it was made because i personally do not have anything to compare it to but it was delicious!

Entrees:
- the gnocchi just simply melted in your mouth. The simple but ever so flavourful ingredients made for a great meal

- Spaghetti - the veggie version
again a simple dish and so flavourful! 

i tried the signature dessert and wasn't too crazy about the pudding. But then again, i dont have much of a sweet tooth so maybe have poorly judged it?1?

it was voted #7 in Canada by Enroute Magazine and i can see why! A great date night!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with friends couple weeks ago and I had a happy time here. The foods were really nice. I love that place and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great parlour room/modern restaurant and bar feel. Pretty dark inside but candlelight and soft lighting make it cozy. I went on a stormy night and the ambiance was perfect.   
If you try this place you must try the cocktail named, '8 1/2'  divine, delicious, I could have has 3 more except they would have had to peel me off the floor.  Has got a definite kick with Campari and anise, gin and a few other ingredients I can't remember.  
The food such as their most popular fresh buratta and roasted grape appetizer was divine!! Tartare wasvery good as well, but doesn't compare to the buratta dish.   I had the homemade pasta and frutti di mare and my dinner companion had the steak.  Both were perfectly seasoned and fresh.  
I like this place because the owner, Craig, sticks to local Ontario produce and suppliers as much as he can.  He's of the adage, grow local, buy local and yam it up local. 
The wine we chose was a red 2007 and wasn't bad but slightly off.  Couldn't pin my finger on what it was. Almost tastes too young.
I will be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Please note that this is a Valentine's Day review so perhaps not indicative of what a typical night is like at this place. Nonetheless, I will not be returning. 

Seating: we were the first couple to arrive in an empty restaurant at 6pm sharp and yet they decided to give us the worst table section in the joint.  We were seated right next to  next to a post that had a curtain hanging over our table. Hardly a nice way to look at your significant other  across the table. 

Food: First off, there was a set menu for Valentine's Day so off the bat we knew not to expect much. But little did we know how low the bar really was. Much like the look and feel of this place, the food presentation was nice BUT at the end of the day the food failed on taste. Duck was overcooked on the outside and hard to chew on the inside. It honestly tasted like I was eating spoiled meat.The spaghetti  that came with their SIGNATURE amatriciana was undercooked!!! And the lamb and trout were both mediocre at best.  One notable exception was the shot of their salted chocolate  pudding. Overall it was definitely not worth the money or the time.  I was better off cooking a nice Valentine's Day meal for my boyfriend and I."}
{"text":"Campagnolo is another great spot that opened up recently around the corner from my place. I bought into the right neighbourhood. 

I usually start my reviews with the food but, I gotta say, Campagnolo has some really nice service. The servers know what they're serving and like to tell you about it. Everyone is super friendly and they genuinely seem to want you to have a good time. 

We sat at the bar first as we waited for a table to open. There is a great cocktail list that's packed with lotsa good stuff. The Lady had something from the list, I ordered a bottle of red.

I keep reading that this is a tapas-style joint but I don't see it as a small plate place. We started with burrata with grapes & toast. Simply delicious!

For mains we had boar, tripe and rib ragu on polenta. This was a perfect cold weather dish, filled with tender meats. I'm not big on the tripe but I'll eat it if it's in front of me. The Lady got a Creuset filled with cannelinni, hock and kale, a really classic flavour combination of pork and beans.

Salted caramel & chocolate for me and a lemon tart for her and we called a wheelbarrow to carry us home.

The only thing I didn't like was the decor, but I seem to be the only one complaining. Every review I've read about Campagnolo raves about it, so what do I care?"}
{"text":"Fabulous staff who are attentive and fully aware of the menu, offered great recommendations. Small menu, but everything is executed to perfection. Tartar  was so full of flavour, loved the bread crisps that came with it. The spaghetti may have been one of the better pastas I have ever eatan, the noodles were cooked perfectly. Enjoyed the peccorino cheese. Roasted hen was perfectly plated and paird well with brussels sprouts. Loved the open concept cooking. Cannot wait to come back"}
{"text":"The tasting menu is unbelievable. Lot of foods. Pace yourself as the waiter suggested. Good advice. The price is reasonable. Great ambiance. What could you ask for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I visit Campagnolo regularly and we are happy to say that it is our favourite restaurant.  We've only had Chef's tasting menu and there has never been any disappointment with any of their dishes.  From the bread to the dessert, every step of the way has been small bits of happiness adding to one big one.  My wife's favourite is the burrata cheese with warm grapes and my favourite is the perfectly prepared al dente spaghetti.  $60/person is a great value for the quality of the meal and pleasant evening you'll have at Campagnolo's."}
{"text":"I took my family here for mothers day and surprised my mum. The friendly staff was so excited to help with the rouse and took care of the mountain of stuff I brough with me from landing earlier that day. 

The food was delicious. Every dish was lovely including their famous spaghetti with simple tomato sauce. The burrata at the beginning is delicious as well.

Definitely check the place out. The Bar looks really fun I'm sure it's lively at night!"}
{"text":"We had dinner on a Saturday evening. The ambiance was good. Music was not too loud and a good sized crowd. We sat indoors, even though the patio was open. We shared some appetizers. The best one was the house made baguette with gougeres. I ordered the fettuccine. The flavour was good, but it was salty. I ended up drinking lots of water after my meal. I shared the salted caramel dessert. I could only eat a couple of spoonfuls because it was bitter. I think the caramel was burnt. The service was excellent. The food came out in a timely fashion and my cup was always filled with water. I tried the eggplant parmigiana, and it was delicious. I should have ordered that instead."}
{"text":"GOOD LORD I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food is awesome and no I don't work there, nor am I affiliated with them in any way except that I did have the fortune of dining here recently and it was really, REALLY good.

First off, I kind of like that the location isn't among the hustle and bustle of other downtown areas, such that parking was NOT at all a problem. Secondly, the interior: nothing pretentious there--it's simple in its own way but very lovely nonetheless. The crowd that night was an assortment: professional, young-ish ilk, some families with older children (my guess; I always like to construct my own characters).

The service is GREAT from the moment you walk in--which, if you don't get there at opening (6pm) or soon thereafter, I'd suggest you make a reservation. I think they have two seating times. The host greeted then seated us--standard. The waitress however, was something else. She brought us our drinks along with glasses of water and a pitcher, but kept coming back to fill our glasses with water when we were low! I thought that was totally over-the-top but in a good way. Personally though, I feel bad that someone should go out of their way to do this when the pitcher is available for us to pour ourselves. FAB service. Now the food...

Their menu does vary on certain items depending on the night that you go (maybe also to do with what is available at the market that day?) but certain things (ie, burrata, warm olives, spaghetti, chorizo) seem to be staples, and rightfully so~ 

We were a party of two and started with the burrata and bone marrow. Judging from some of the pics that fellow YELPers have posted of their dishes, it seems even the presentation of their food varies from night to night. For example, the burrata we got was this jumbo lump on top of really thin (think Melba Toast-thin) toasted slivers of bread. The whole thing was drizzled in super-yum olive oil and I'm guessing a sprinkle of salt because after a while I did detect that feeling I get when I eat something on the salty side. EVERYONE was ordering the burrata, and it's no real mystery why. We also got to enjoy the bone marrow which also came with some crispbread-like crunchiness. The bone was oozing with a generous amount of marrow and had such a distinct, pure beefy flavour to it that I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven! (If you've ever had homemade kom-tang with just the right amount of seasoning, you'll know what I'm talking about and if you even know what kom-tang is, chances are you have had the homemade stuff and know damn well what what I'm talking about!) There was so little bread to work with that we didn't mind slathering on the marrow. There was even a decent amount of meat on the bone that stewed so long that it practically fell off with a slight tap and landed in our mouths. 

I walked in there starving as I was looking so forward to this meal and to be quite honest, the starters alone would have tied me over for some time. But alas, who stops there?? We then got our mains: the spaghetti, which were so fresh and perfectly cooked--the pasta itself was not the round kind you buy dry in the supermarket but square and had the perfect texture. The sauce was deelish but the dish was not presented with all the fanfare as it appears in some of the pics that have been posted, but it's all good. At $18, it was probably the least expensive main. We also got the sweet pea agnolotti with chunks of lobster strewn about. When I saw it was a handful of pieces of pasta, I wanted to cry because I knew it would be good, but it was surprisingly filling (though we did share everything so I'm sure the spaghetti and salty-ish burrata helped)!!! 

We could have done without dessert but shared a budino (Italian pudding) anyway and certainly without regret! The smooth texture of the pudding had just the right amount of flavour and sweetness, and also contained big pieces of salty sponge toffee that went so well with the rest of the dessert! If this is on the menu when you go, TRY IT!

I walked out of there very happy that night, and their service is definitely something that will set them apart from some of the nonsense you see at some of these new restaurants. The rustic, Italian-inspired dishes we had were ALL very good and highly recommended. Everything was super-fresh and tasty! Don't be fooled by the not-huge portions and give a few different things a try--you will not be disappointed. There was nothing about this place that was a let-down, and I sincerely hope that their success continues. As we were leaving at about 8:30pm, there were hordes of people lined up by the entrance, salivating and waiting for their turn to grab a table. The next time I go, I am definitely going to be one of them!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but the service really knocked it down.

Lets start with the atmoshpere. Its a fairly small restaurant but certainly not cramped. 
The bar is gorgeous, and the open kitchen is a nice visual though I believe it is only used for final touchs, still quite nice. Tables were beautiful and I appreciate having nice napkins and cutlery.

Food was just amazing. I had the bone marrow with oxtail and I dream about that dish now. It was just so well balanced and easy to put on the delicious bread that came with it. Really solid.

I also tried the Burrata, which was stunning. The grapes (warm) compliment the cheese fantastically.

Main courses:

I had the pork which tasted great and came with a delicious sauce and braised kale. My father had the bolognese with liver which was delicious but the portions were quite small, especially for the price.

Last but not least I had the caramel pudding which was an excellent palate cleaner. Beer selection was good, and the cocktail I had was to die for. 

The service though, needs work. Although friendly, I had to actually put my empty glass on the corner of the table, and flag someone down because it sat there for 15 minutes. It seemed like some of the staff were more interested in socializing with friends who were dining there and less on the actual guests. Though they did pick it up a bit in the end, it would have bumped the star rating up for sure."}
{"text":"Very limited menu, indifferent wait staff there are so many better Italian restaurants...weird place"}
{"text":"Went to this great restau for the first time last night and the food was great!

I was sat with a friend at the bar and enjoyed the energy running through the whole restau.
I had several glasses of wine and ordered to apps and 2 mains.

I highly recommend ordering the following:
-burrata with sautéed grapes!  Fantastic!
-prosciutto
-gnocchi
-octopus (sans chorizo - was way salty)

All in all service was great and accomodating!  Will absolutely become a regular there!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there on a Sunday night. Great ambiance and layout. Doesn't have that rushed/factory feel of most Italian restaurants in the city. We ordered the fettuccine and the gnocchi and both were delicious. Wait staff was very nice and helpful. We asked about the wine afterwards as it was really good, the maître d talked to us about the types of grapes as he chooses the wines and gave us reco's for other winces at the lcbo. Great experience, will go back for sure especially to try out the patio"}
{"text":"I booked a few weeks before I arrived in Toronto, and I'm glad I did. This place was well worth waiting for. The waitstaff were universally kind and helpful, and the sous chef brought out each dish and explained it to me.  I had the bread and gougeres (asiago choux pastry puffs) with prosciutto, and then the short ribs \"bitterballen\" which involved shredded shortrib, put back together into yummy fried deliciousness. Apparently, the dish is traditional in Holland.  Next was the sea bream, served with a winter salad that contained cabbage, and blood orange, and the sweetness at the end was a salted caramel pudding with pieces of that foamed toffee broken into it. SO amazing. This place is one I'll return to for certain. The cocktails list was decadent, but I stuck with the Bedford Falls. The bartender certainly knew his craft."}
{"text":"I had an incredible experience at Campagnolo. I went for a casual date night and didn't have time to view their website or reviews before dining here, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Our server was attentive and did an excellent job describing the menu and dishes we might like. He explained that the menu is altered depending on what is in season. I really appreciate a restaurant that keeps their menu up-to-date, I think it's fun to know the next time I go back there will be a new items to try. 

The food was incredible. We had two apps and two mains which regretfully couldn't be finished. The dish that stood out for me was the \"Fresh Burrata Cheese with Roasted Grapes and Toasted Bread.\" It was so simple but I couldn't get enough. Top that off with some pre-meal cocktails (the \"Limone\" was a refreshing start) and a bottle of red that went down too easily, and you have a perfect meal. 

It's located on the NE corner of Dundas & Euchlid. I don't know if anyone is as direction-ally challenged as I am, but with no signage -that I saw- it look me a minute to figure it out."}
{"text":"Yumm!

Had the Bone Marrow and the veal when I went.

The bone marrow was insanely good and the veal was good.

I'd like to go back and try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food, service and environment was pretty good! Fun date night spot or dinner with friends. We shared the Crispy Pork Belly (extremely tasty) as an appetizer and for my main dish i had Tagliatelle (pasta w/ butter and white truffles). 

Our server was helpful and even provided a free mini dessert at the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Small portions and mediocre food. Left feeling extremely hungry even though we ordered apps, pasta and two mains. The beef tartare tasted very fishy. It was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"What a charming spot. We sat at the chef's bar (highly recommended) and indulged in the following: Burratta, Steak Tartare, Bone Marrow and the Gnocchi. For dessert, we got the Budino to go and it didn't last long enough for a photo. Everything was delicious. 

Jessie, our server, was the sweetest ever with top notch suggestions for food and drink. Campagnolo for the win, folks!"}
{"text":"One of the most delicious meals I've ever eaten.
 We started with drinks, I had the Ichabod Crane which was amazing, with rum, vanilla, and I believe sage.

We had the burrata with roasted grapes which was delicious. I ordered the beef short rib which was fall off the bone tender and juicy. It was hearty and delicious. The turnips and radishes cooked perfectly and the celeriac puree added a smoothness to the dish.

My friend ordered the schnitzel with sauerkraut and it was amazing; crisp and crunchy sauerkraut that went perfectly with the friend breaded veal, and a cucumber salad that finished it perfectly.

We ended up ordering both of the desserts, which were a caramel pudding with chocolate meringue and chocolate and amaretto flavoured canolli with candied orange.

Overall amazing, flawless service, amazing drinks, lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Campagnolo restaurant on Dundas St., West was such a pleasure and a refreshing change from the Torontol scene. It's definitely a destination place and not so much a neighborhood haunt.  They make fresh bread pipping hot and crusty and fresh cultured butter that is served piping hot fresh from the oven. I had the hamachi Crudo (yellowfin tuna flank)  and the red snapper which was crispy on the outside and melting with tenderness and moisture in the inside along with a side of sautéed kale.
The Buratta was served with sautéed grapes and drizzled with this succulent buttery olive oil from Portugal.  The lamb was perfectly cooked medium rare and right in front of us at the chefs table which is probably the best seat in the house if you want dinner theater and a romantic table at the same time.  The wines were very good with long finishes and well balanced. Including the Prosecco, the Pinot Gris from Willamette  and the super Tuscan.  And saucy person that I am I asked for a tasting of each one of their desserts... I don't have a sweet tooth but I definitely ate my share and didn't complain!   Dinner was $285 tip and tax included for two people.  I gave a 25% tip because the waiter was second to none & I Loved how he didn't constantly come by fetching for compliments. Shows he has a lot of confidence in the food. My Visa card was standing to attention.... ;-)"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for a good night out. 
We ordered some apps as it was our first time here 

We got the 
bone Marrow: which was topped with Ox tail and it was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this for people who like bone marrow. It was a generous portion. 

Squid appetizer: which was very fancy. I loved how the octopus was thinly sliced

House bread: small little baguettes and bread balls. Really good with house butter 

Cheese and grapes: really good! The grapes were roasted which made them extra sweet and the Buratta  cheese is salty, so the combination was delicious. 

Definitely will come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite restaurant in Toronto.  Was able to make reservations 30 mins before arriving. Table for 2 by the window was nice; street-car and people watching. Extensive wine-list and great cocktails. 

Food: Fresh burrata cheese with roasted grapes and toasted bread $17 5/5
-This was delicious. The combination of the buttery cheese, warm grapes, and the olive oil/butter sauce was the perfect way to start the meal. Next time I will try the bone-marrow! 

Spaghetti all Amatricana $19 4/5
-This dish looked and tasted great but it was missing something. I love spicy food so I wanted \"kick\". Was disappointed that they had no chilli oil, but the waitress brought over some chilli flakes instead. This dish took about 30-40 minutes to arrive because they make the pasta in batches. All the other diners received their spaghetti at the same time! 

Dessert: salted caramel spudino $10 5/5
-This was creamy, slightly sweet, rich, salty. Perfect. I recommend sharing it with someone because it can be overly-rich to eat alone at the end of a meal like I did. 

Service could have been a bit better. 4/5. I will visit again and recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner experience! It was super easy to settle into the warm atmosphere and cool vibe. Perfect amount of lighting, noise and vibrancy. Kicked off the night with an amazing Limone cocktail (lemon infused vodka, basil syrup, lemon). 

Agnolotti doesn't excite me but the sunchoke (best root ever) filling was so unreal it had me falling out of my seat after one bite. Accompany that with parsley root purée and hazelnut, I immediately wrote home.

The jus of the braised lamb alongside the mint pesto was delicious, but this dish was all about the strozzapreti for me. I melted into every bite of this perfectly cooked, fresh made pasta."}
{"text":"I had a romantic dinner at Campagnolo for my birthday, and it was amazing!  Campagnolo is an unsuspecting restaurant on Dundas Street just west of Bathurst.  I have walked by the place numerous times, not realizing the awesomeness of food that is served at this location.

My SO made reservations for dinner and we were promptly greeted to our seats when we arrived.  You will need a reservation for this place; most folks who were being seated had reservations.

We ordered the ever-popular Burrata, which was locally made cheese (fresh mozzarella with heavy cream) paired with roasted grapes and toasted bread.  All I have to say is heaven!  The fresh cheese with tartness of the grapes made a wonderful combination.  We also ordered the house-made baguette and gougeres (cheese choux pastry puffs) to finish off the leftover goodness from our previous cheese plate.

For entrees, I had a halibut dish they had on their menu and my SO ordered the housemade spaghetti.  My fish dish was cooked to perfection and nicely seasoned.  The pasta was wonderful and sauced well.  We were both happy campers after our meals.

Service was excellent, our server gave us our space during our date night and checked-in periodically to see if everything was ok with our meals.

Campagnolo's menu changes often, which means I will definitely have to be back.

If you are looking for great date night or just awesome italian eats - Campagnolo is your place!"}
{"text":"Campagnolo serves up a rustic family style Italian dinner that would make a nonna proud.

It's easy to miss this restaurant hidden amongst non-descript buildings on Dundas West.  Through the windows we could see the warm glow of candlelight.  The venue was packed with happy patrons.

Walking in without a reservation on a Friday, we didn't think that the place would be so crazy busy.  The hostess said recent reviews had caused an influx of new customers.  We were told that there was an hour wait to be seated.  We were able to sit at the front and have drinks since the bar was reserved for dining as well.  

The drink menu was a pleasant surprise.  An extensive list with a lot of classic cocktails with a twist.  I had a Manhattan with orange which was fantastic.

We actually didn't have to wait to long for a table.  The waitstaff was attentive and moved our drinks over and provided us with menus right away.  The menu is small and changes daily.  If you are a vegetarian, this is probably not the best place for you to eat.  The meats are supplied by the Healthy Butcher and everything was prepared perfectly.

We ordered a few items that were all fantastic!
* Calamari - Lightly seared and fresh.
* Duck breast with apple slaw
* Halibut with pesto sauce
* Steak - Juicy, tender, lightly seasoned

The highlight of the evening was the dessert.  
Everyone was ordering the salted-Caramel budino with good reason.
OMFG.  Salted caramel pudding with crunchy chocolate meringue.
I haven't been this wowed by a dessert in a long time.

Campagnolo is a great addition to the growing number of standout Dundas West eateries."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday evening, wasn't crowded and just walked in.  Menu is very limited.  Order of bread contains a few tiny pieces, barely enough for my family of 4 so we ordered another.  Hollow ones weren't very good.  Buratta with roasted grapes were pretty good but not as great as advertised.  Spaghetti was cooked perfect but salty. 60 day aged sirloin was good but small and has too much fat.  The sausage dish was pretty dry.  Can't believe this place gets good reviews and hyped up on tourists' books. Then again, we weren't impressed at all about the overall food quality in Toronto so maybe the standards are lower.  Pretty pricey and very small portions.  Don't go with hungry kids."}
{"text":"Our dinner was fabulous. When I made the reservation on Tuesday for Friday there were only 6 pm and 9 pm times available. This place is popular and reservations a must.

The buratta appetizer was delicious, fresh and simple. We shared it and there was enough for two... although I think either of us would have gladly had the whole portion.

I had the risotto, which is prepared in the Venetian style, a little more liquid than I normally prefer. However its savoury taste and the perfection of the preparation quickly vanished any misgivings... it was among the best I have had.

She had the spaghetti and declared it perfection in its tomatoey goodness.

The service was great in spite of the fact the place was packed. Our server was personable, authoritative and knowledgeable about both the menu and the terrific wine list. 

We were dawdling a bit, and they very politely asked if they could move us to the bar to free up the table for the next sitting. We were wrapping up anyways, so we thanked them for a wonderful dinner and made our way into the soft evening."}
{"text":"Excellent food, outstanding service. The atmosphere here is great, very relaxed, and the food is amazing! Some very different takes on traditional Italian food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed

I went on Saturday night with a group of four. This restaurant had been rated highly both on a Toronro and canada forum so we were all excited to try it. We only could get a 9pm reservation but that was fine. 

Upon arrival the ambiance was great and the place was busy. That was pretty much the highlight. We waited for over a half an hour for our reservation. Happily the hostess got us a glass of champagne for our wait. 

Upon being seated, the server was very pleasant and took our drink order and appy order immediately. It took a while for any food to come out and amazingly even longer for drinks to come out. So long so that we had to remind them we even ordered drinks. We were hungry and unimpressed. To add to that, one drink had a fly in it. (It happens, but this was just another bad point in an underwhelming experience.) 

The appies were quite tasty once they arrived (burrata, marrow, sausage). Once our mains finally arrived after a very long wait, they were again underwhelming. The agnolotti was great but salty. The osso bucco and spaghetti were average at best and VERY salty. 

We all left hungry and thirsty very late in the evening. I will not hurry back"}
{"text":"I read about this restaurant at Blog_TO and decided to give it a shot. I must say, I am very impressed from this place.

I loved the ambiance. Its a very cozy and beautiful setup. So please dress up a little before you walk in!

Service is amazing. Despite of a busy evening, the servers here are very attentive and helpful. Also you can see the cooks in action! That's appealing.

Food is the best part. I ordered Spaghetti All' amatriciana for main course and Opera Cake for dessert and I loved each bite of my food. 
As they say...as good as it gets!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey, but so worth the splurge!

Great cocktail menu.

Friendly, unpretentious staff.  Our waiter not only knew the menu extremely well, he also knew how everything was prepared.  For example, the testina we ordered took 3 days to prepare.  I also learned what testina was and that it is delicious (perhaps only when prepared properly).

I had the eggplant parmagiana for my main course and our waiter told me he wanted some!  The chef wanted to serve this dish the night before, but the waiter had suggested the chef wait another day to really let the flavour soak in.  I'm glad the chef listened to him.  Not only did that mean I snagged the last eggplant parmagiana (sorry to the waiter who wanted some), but also that it was extremely good.  I know a lot of people who aren't fans of eggplant, but it's on my list of favourite foods.

The amount of cheese baked on top was just enough.  Not too cheesy that it took away from the dish, but definitely enough to add the texture and flavour.  Not overcooked either, it was just melted enough, but not hardened.

Beautiful washrooms, although quite bright in comparison to the dim lighting in the restaurant.

Love the lantern-like light fixtures and the warmth of the pine ceiling.

I heard they were going to open it up to the outdoors, but haven't had a chance to return to see if this has happened yet."}
{"text":"I personally don't find this restaurant all it's cracked up to be. My 3 friends and I went on a Friday night and shared a number of starters as well as mains but truthfully speaking nothing was new, innovative or particularly delicious as one would expect from this tiny Italian resto.

Let's start with the dishes we had;

Roasted Bone Marrow
Burrata Cheese
Water buffalo carpaccio
Crispy pork belly

All were okay, the bone marrow and burrata cheese were very simple.  Water buffalo carpaccio was good and had many elements to keep the pallet interested but I found that all the truffle shavings were quite tasteless. Pork belly was good.

Mains; 

House-Made Spaghetti All'Amatriciana
Chicken Liver Angolotti
Seared steak and veggies (forgot the name on the menu)

Steak and veggies; you're typical dish as you may be familiar with anywhere else.
Chicken liver angolotti; calky, salty lacking interest. again had a ton of truffle shavings but added zero truffle flavour.
Spaghetti, nothing new, just a hump of pasta.

Let me also add that their red wine by the glass comes chilled (totally 100% ruins the flavour).

Overall: would recommend just for apps but not the high end gastro adventure you would imagine from other reviews."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto. Also, I used to work in the restaurant industry so my expectations are pretty high. I haven't been in recently so I can't recommend any specific dishes (they are very seasonal). However, I can say that every time I have gone in it feels like I am in a dream the whole time, with plates of pasta and delicious wine dancing all around me. 

With regards to food - I feel like everything I have had has been great so order away. When it comes to wine - ask your server. They know what's up when it comes to Italian wines. Or if you don't trust your server (maybe you are picky??) ask for JP, their sommelier/manager (??). That guy is the greatest thing since sliced bread."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 11 for a company dinner on a Wednesday night. At Campagnolo, they require you to order the family style sharing / tasting menu ($65 per person) if you are a group greater than six people. Though the food wasn't particularly fancy, the dishes were well executed for the most part. The service was also excellent - we had two dietary restrictions (one was vegetarian and the other didn't eat beef), and they made sure to accommodate both. None of the dishes had beef, and the vegetarian got separate dishes for all those that had meat.

We started off with appetizers. First came small plates of a diverse variety of warm olives. These were extremely tasty; they were salty and tangy but not too oily and hit the spot. Some very interesting \"bread\" came out with some garlic whipped butter. The \"bread\" was actually more a gougere - it was light and airy. Eaten along with the whipped butter, it highly resembled a makeshift cream puff! 

A little while after, more hearty and substantial appetizers came out. The castelfranco salad arrived - bearing strong resemblance to a creamy Caesar salad, this salad had some bitter frisee coated in a great sauce. There was the saltiness and umami of the anchovies, mixed with the creaminess of the egg. I loved this salad and went back for thirds! Almost simultaneously, the restaurant's signature appetizer of fresh burrata with roasted grapes and toasted bread. The grapes were nice and warm, the burrata was melty, and the bread had a nice honey sweetness on top.

The mains (primi), two plates of pasta, arrived next. First came the potato gnocchi with braided rabbit. To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of this dish. The gnocchi was slightly disappointing - it was a little dense and not very pillowy or fluffy. The rabbit was delicious though, it was so tender. Then came housemade spaghetti all'amatriciana. I much preferred this over the gnocchi. The spaghetti was slightly thicker than usual, but really al dente, and the smokiness of the pork cheek really cut through. I loved the slight kick of spice that came at the end! 

Then came the secondi (the vegetarian received a plate of mushroom ragu in lieu of what we got). There was short rib ragu with veal meatballs, spareribs and tripe, served on polenta. The meatballs were juicy and tender, but I found some parts of the spare ribs (the portion on the short rib) a bit too fatty. I literally bit into it and the entire mouthful I got was fat. I did like the tripe and spareribs though - it was nice and meaty and flavourful. The next dish was seared Norwegian trout, served on a bed of fried brussel sprouts and potatoes. I wasn't expecting the potatoes at first, and was pleasantly surprised when I bit into something mushy. This dish was my favourite - I love fish, and I can say that I had fifths and sixths of this plate! Definitely cleared one of the four plates on our table by myself... I really appreciated the dill and cream sauce, which really highlighted the trout and accentuated the flavour.

Finally, the dolci / dessert came. We were all served a small glass of their salted caramel budino. Unfortunately, the dessert wasn't well received, and it was the only dish of the night that wasn't liked. We all found it overwhelmingly sweet. In addition to the budino, I also got a pleasant surprise. The waitress had heard me saying to a colleague beforehand that I really craved gelato, and brought back two flavours for me - their buttermilk (which was again on the sweet side, but worked really well with the budino), and a vegan chocolate. The vegan chocolate resembled a dark chocolate and was so delicious!

In terms of drinks, we all ordered cocktails and bottles of red wine. I got the settanta cinque - a nice light drink with some lemon citrus notes. 

In conclusion, this was a great Italian place with amazing customer service. Would definitely recommend, despite the fact that its dishes didn't really blow me away - but it was quite consistent in high quality overall."}
{"text":"Bad service and poor customer experience will lead you to a one star review...

It started out ok. I walked in around 8:25 pm for my 8:30 pm reservation. No hostess around. Server lady comes up to me and I politely let her know I was here for dinner and made a reservation. She wasn't very welcoming and fumbled around the front desk area just to turn back around to grab the menus on the table. 

My friend Al arrives and we order a glass of wine and hot water. 

We placed our order of burrata, spaghetti, and potato gnocchi. Burrata comes out at a reasonable time. After we finish the burrata, we patiently waited and waited and waited for our entree. The table to our right got their food before us when we sat and ordered way before they did. 

We pretty much waited over 60+ minutes for our meal. Our water glasses were constantly empty. I had to ask someone for more lemon, never got it until the second ask. Ugh. The restaurant was t very busy on a Sunday. Absolutely no excuse for such delay. We both would've been less upset if they had just told us sorry for taking so long, but they were just so oblivious. There were 4 people in the kitchen, a bartender and two servers who at one point were just standing around. 

Food was just ok btw. I had better expectations for a highly rated Italian place. $$$"}
{"text":"Love this place. My wife has been a few times but this was the first time we went together. 

Firstly, huge plus for even taking reservations. I hate that so many Toronto restaurants are so hard to reserve a table at. Their staff are super friendly with no hints of pretention, again, like many Toronto restaurants. 

Their burata and amatriciana were both on point. Fairly priced wine list and dishes. Would absolutely bring the family here for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Not nearly good enough for the price. I wanted to try this place for so long as I heard it was amazing. Maybe I should have gone with lower expectations. Went with 6 people and we were forced into ordering the prix fix because of our party size even though we wanted to order off the menu. Fair enough. The appetizer, a blistered grape and burrata plate was INCREDIBLE, but the service was all over the place. Huge wait time between appetizers and mains, pre-dinner cocktails arrived with appetizers, and we were, in general, made to feel like we were lucky to get service at all. Not the way you want to feel at $60 a head. Also, our orange beef risotto prix fix main was strange, and not in a good way. Mushy texture, off putting orange colour, and what was, in my opinion, a strange flavour combo. Over all the whole experience was kind of a bust."}
{"text":"So I'm a little up in the air about this place... so I'll break it down. I gave it 4 stars cause the things I did like I really liked. And my husband and I still had a nice time together. 
Noise- on a Saturday night it is very loud. I can't speak to other nights or how the noise level on the patio was but from the looks of it the patio seemed quieter and seats more spread out.  Based on other reviews I went with the expectation for a romantic night out. It was romantic but it was loud as the tables inside are close to each other and we were unfortunately seated next to an obnoxious group of four.
Ambiance - Dimly lit, seems to be a nice patio. Romantic. But close to neighbours, hard to have a personal conversation.
Food - Delicious. Well, the appetizers I really enjoyed. We got the buratta and the bone marrow. Both were delicious. I never had buratta before nor thought to roast grapes but it was creamy and mild and perfect. I thought the garlic bread with it was a bit odd combo but it's garlic bread... who doesn't love garlic bread! We also got the spaghetti and the fettuccini. Both were good but the fettuccini was Asian flavours. It was good but it wasn't what we were expecting. 
Service - staff was really nice and helpful. No complaints.

So this is my dilemma with the star ratings. If I can copy the buratta dish at home, I probably won't go back but chances are I can't... so I'd go back just for that and to try a few other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing anniversary dinner! I'm vegetarian and had  the impossibly light and flavorful fried zucchini flowers to start, then potato agnolotti with ramps and asparagus - fresh and seasonal flavors, perfectly presented. My husband had beef tartare and then sweetbreads and loved both. We had the olive oil cake and strawberry and rhubarb tart for dessert, both excellent. 

Service was timely and unobtrusive, the best kind. 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, nothing special, I found it a tad pricey for the quality and quantity you pay for.  The bone marrow was alright, the cheesy bread didn't have much taste nor cheese in it.  The spaghetti and rabbit pappardelle were both with fresh pasta and tasted decent, however it was nothing special.  At the end, we felt that for the price we paid could have gone a long way somewhere else.  Decor was low lighting, comforting, not too loud, could be a great date spot."}
{"text":"Had dinner here. The flavours were all very interesting, food was prepared beautifully. My only dissatisfaction was the pasta, which the pasta was a little too hard for my personal taste. Overall great environment and food."}
{"text":"I really liked this spot. Loved the atmosphere and vibe, just a cool casual crowd. 

I ended up loving my dish and cocktail (I ordered the agnolotti with oyster mushrooms, very rustic, comforting and hearty). For the table, my friend and I shared the roasted grapes and burrata andthe warmed olives. I really expected the burrata to be a bit creamier but it was still delicious.

The only reason I'm denying a star is the service. Our waiter was just grumpy and not engaging at all. I completely understand that everyone has a bad night once in a while, but dang! My friend was a little bit picky with her wine selection, but I didn't think she was being overly diva or annoying about it...it's the servers job to help choose a wine or bring something else if the diner isn't a fan, but this guy seemed so annoyed by it! 

Overall, good experience here, and I will definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"Start to finish, my experience at Campagnolo was both consistent and enjoyable.  They seem to focus on putting forth a smaller but carefully selected menu.  Kind of reminds me of Woodlot to be honest, but IMO Campagnolo executes better. The apps were tasty - house made Baguette & Gougères and Bone Marrow.  The main courses of braised rabbit pappardelle and Lamb shank followed up nicely.  And the Salted Caramel Budino will leave you licking the you spoon.  As a beer snob, I appreciated having a couple of craft/imported options.  The atmosphere was modern and hip but not trying too hard, and the service was great.  

I recommend this place and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Great spot and love how they change the menu up daily. I had the spaghetti and meat sauce when I went and it was absoultly amazing. The restaurant had a charming vibe to it. Cant wait to go there again and try something new."}
{"text":"It's good.  But, top 10 in Canada and stuff?  Not sure about that.  I enjoy the pasta more closely to my house as well, including Bricco, Nodo, and Campo.

For those with young children: please be prepared.  I asked for a high chair/booster, they had neither.  Good thing we're a prepared family with our portable booster in tow.  In general, I don't think they're used to having babies/toddlers, and there was a bit of a joke from the server about having one here.

Volume - I feel this should be a filter on review/reservation sites now.  This can really help to choose a restaurant.  Campagnolo does a great job of having some lively music playing in the background, but not blasting it like some places.  This allows for ambience, attracting potential customers, and some dinner conversation among diners.  Other restaurants who blast their music: please take note; if you want to make your place seem cool, music playing softly/low, and having the awesomeness of your customers' chatter about your food and the place rock it.  :)

Service - Our server was very attentive and cordial.
Free wifi - Yay, good for the bigger kids.

1. Marrow - ok.  Was expecting something more flavourful, to be honest.
2. Beef carpaccio - Goodness.  Mmmm.

3. Spaghetti - Rather spicy; don't get me wrong, I love spicy foods, but for Italian, I think they went further than I'd prefer.
4. Pansotti - A nice, sweet pasta.  It's pumpkin, after all.
5. Pappardelle - The winner of the group! Wow! First, I love the noodles.  Soft and fresh, just delicious.  Thickness was perfect.  Throw in the chanterelles and creamy sauce, this was clearly the winner for me & my wife.

No time for dessert, youngster was beginning to get rowdy, meaning bedtime."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely tasty, and the service was great.  I recommend the ink orechiette, which was light, acidic, and flavorful.  The pork belly and scallops were also good and aesthetically pleasing with fresh peas and greens.  The lamb was a little over done but well seasoned.  The sea salt budino and panna cotta with rhubarb sauce were delicious, but the panna cotta was my favorite.  We had a salmon crudo in addition to the burrata as our appetizers, and the salmon crudo exceeded our expectations over the burrata, which I found to be a little chewy.  Prices were reasonable, and the decor is beautiful, with the option to sit outside or inside, but during the summer, they open the windows so you get a breeze inside.  Did I mention the great wine selection?  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"If I want pasta I go to Campagnolo. 

You must...MUST have the burrata cheese. 
Of course their pasta is why you're there, so have anything in the menu and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Although still often hard to get a reservation, the quality of the food and service continue to slide from an easy 4+ stars to now a 2 to 3-star rating.

The food used to be well prepared and now it is either over or undercooked with low consistency. We used to come here and try to imitate some of their dishes, like the burrata, but we make it better at home now as their grapes are often not toasted, although we still reminisce about our first time having it there. Same with their pastas, almost always soggy and overcooked, never a la denete, even after you send it back. 

Service is pretty casual and sloppy now too, but at least they take items off the bill when they've served you something horribly made (although it still spoils your dining experience). And once they've tainted your dining experience, your server basically ignores you because they think they're no longer getting a tip, further tarnishing your dining experience. In fact, we had to flag down other servers for service.

I highly doubt we will eat here again and recommend diners go somewhere else as this place is highly overrated. Enoteca Sociale is a superior choice for this type of fare and not much farther west on Dundas."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for dinner on a Friday night. The service was very good and the ambiance is also nice. However, the food was OK at best. Don't waste a dime on the blood orange salad. It's literally a few slices of orange doused in olive oil with some garnish - very disappointing.

My main was beef short rib with meatball ragu and polenta - it was good but not amazing (especially when comparing the same dish at one of the city's amazing Italian restaurants, like Buca).

Overall, this is a nice place for a date night or possibly a small group, but the food is nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"We went last night with another couple.  I would categorize this meal as okay.

I went in with a somewhat negative impression of the restaurant.  I had made a reservation weeks ago.  The day before, they leave me a voicemail to confirm, but ask that I call back to officially confirm.  Why not just ask us to get in touch to cancel?  Kind of annoying.

On the voicemail, they mentioned that we'd be allotted a two-hour dining window.  I've heard of restaurants doing this, and I think it sets an inhospitable tone.  I know that restaurants have more than one seating, and I certainly am not one to hang out for an hour after we've finished our food.  Two hours is not really a lot of time, especially when the kitchen gets busy and we can't control when the food comes out or when our order is taken.  We ended up leaving 2.5 hours after our reservation, through no fault of our own.  

Nevertheless...  When we got there, we found that the service was very good.  We were greeted warmly by the bartender, while the hostess was seating another party.  Our server was knowledgeable, yet not stuffy at all.  Our water glasses were constantly being refilled.  The music was a pretty random mix, and played at a volume that gave atmosphere but didn't make us need to yell.  

The food was good, but somewhat over-priced for what it was.  We were encouraged to order for the table and share everything, but for four people, it ended up being a couple of bites of each dish.  The burrata and grape crostini, for example, was a single slice of bread topped with burrata and served with roasted grapes.  If the restaurant really wants to encourage diners to share, it might be nice for them to present the plates in a way that would make it easy to do so.  And really, a single crostini is not enough to share for four people.  The appetizers were all priced in the mid-teens, which, for their size, seemed like poor value, e.g. the baguette and gougeres ($4), which was four puffs and the equivalent of four slices of bread, the 1/3 cup of olives ($6), the charcuterie plates ($16) that consisted of 16 slices of meat... It just felt cheap.  

The mains were somewhat better value.  We really enjoyed both of the pastas we ordered, and the portions were appropriately sized.  The meat and fish we ordered were both delicious, but again, it wasn't great value or designed for sharing.  We had the rack of lamb, which was served as two big rib chops.  Maybe 4 ounces of meat in all, for $29.  The pickerel skewered by a twig of rosemary was great, but the accompanying black rice was drenched in butter.  

The salt caramel budino/pudding was really delicious. 

Overall, I don't think I'd go back here.  There are too many great Italian places in this city to bother with over-priced, poorly planned dishes, even if they are quite tasty."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, awesome and on point service. I really enjoyed the two hours I spent dinning here. I'm usually very picky about my food, especially my steak, so I was cautious when I ordered the flat iron steak on the menu. However, it was cooked perfectly and I had no complaints. My girlfriend also enjoyed her pasta. 

My only feedback was to include a bit more variety in your menu and add a few more choices for main. I was definitely looking forward to a rack of lamb but didn't have it in the menu. 

Overall an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant atmosphere. Phone ahead for a reservation (there are some nice seats by the window which are special request btw...cool place to sit and watch the streetcars go by). Burrata cheese is a great way to start. Also had the oxtail and bone marrow which was really cool (having an actual bone brought to the table was awesome). Prices are not unreasonable and for two people (two appetizers two pastas no wine) we clocked sub-$80 after-tax. Menu changes often I hear. In summary a great place only a 15 minute cab from downtown."}
{"text":"Very courteous staff, knowledgeable, excellent advice on the menu.
 Highlights are pasta, burrata, smoked mackerel. Cosy and elegant ambience.
Josie"}
{"text":"I'm typically easy to please w/food and I'm the type that will eat absolutely anything.  Based on the reviews I was expecting to have a great meal.  The restaurant itself and the staff were great.  The food though, was extremely disappointing. Even more so when you consider the cost scale of the menu.
My party & I ordered the peach arugula salad and the roasted bone marrow to start.  The peach arugula salad was not great.  The peaches were meant to be grilled, they definitely had the grill marks but I don't think they were actually grilled or ripe. I  personally didn't get a taste of the pesto supposedly in the salad either.  No one complained about the bone marrow but it was nothing special.
We then had four of their main dishes. The only one that passed taste wise was the sweet corn agnolotti although a little under seasoned.  My dish was very under seasoned and bland.  The other two were just okay.  I agree with some reviewers about portion sizes.  My dish's portion size was good for me, but some of the people I was with left unsatisfied.

Not sure if this was an off night for the chef or what happened there but it's very surprising seeing all the excellent reviews."}
{"text":"Burrata and roasted grapes.  What an amazing combination.  

Sitting at the counter where the food is being prepared, is a really fun treat.  You get to see how everything is put together and well, you realize how many calories you're actually consuming.  This can be a good or bad thing.  :)

The pasta dishes look small but trust me, it's enough.  

Never had a bad meal here.  This is the other place I recommend to friends who are looking for Italian."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for 6:15 on a Friday.  We showed up a little late and were seated with no issues.  The restaurant surprisingly remained about 2/3 full throughout the evening.  The atmosphere is great and has a modern but rustic feel to it - chalkboard drink menu and antique looking chandeliers. Servers were extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and joked with us as we watched someone repeatedly try to parallel park their car across the street.  

I've been hearing great things about the cocktails and had the blueberry old fashioned.  It was spot on with a nice mild citrusy-sweetness.  We started our meal off with an order of olives, which were an assorted selection and warm.  My date had the bone marrow and I had the brioche and barolo cheese.  We may have been a bit  ambitious as the barolo cheese + bone marrow was a very rich combination but delicious.  You get a massive piece of cheese and it smothers the brioche underneath, which is great.  My date had the black fettuccine, cooked perfectly, but a warning if you are wary about seafood: the cuttlefish will be overpowering.  I had the veal tenderloin; IMO the best meal on the table.  The veal was a good sized portion and melted in my mouth.  Also highly recommended was our dessert.  I don't recall the name but we ordered a chocolate cake - it was not too sweet and decadent if you're a chocolate lover.  We made quick work of it.

I'd definitely return here, maybe for party.  They had set together 3-4 tables for what looked like a 16 person party later in the evening which seemed like a great idea.  Also, they have a nice patio area."}
{"text":"Tiny portions, quality decent but not for the price. Had unfriendly service from a red headed waitress which was disappointing for our group. Better Italian options elsewhere in the city"}
{"text":"The first time we visited Campagnolo was last October (2013) with another couple and absolutely loved it.  In fact, we raved about it to everyone we knew who asked about a new resto to try.  My brother finally went a few weeks ago and thought \"meh\".  We thought he was crazy.  I realized he was right after my experience on Friday night.

My expectations for good restaurants are not that elaborate, nor difficult to execute given a friendly staff and professional, creative chef: good customer service and good tasting food I can't make myself at home.

My recent visit to Campagnolo lacked both, immensely.

Customer Service:  
My husband took me to Campagnolo for my birthday.  He made reservations a week earlier for the Chef's Table specifically, and even took the time to call and confirm the reservation the day before.  We were looking forward to this ALL WEEK.  We arrived RIGHT on time for our 8:30 reservation.  The host, that we later found out was the MANAGER, sat us at a tiny table in the corner of the room beside the bathroom.  I gave my husband a look and he immediately asked about our reservations at the Chef's Table. The manager's response verbatim, \"Oh, there's already people sitting there, but if they leave we can move you there.\" No apology, no double-checking reservation, no customer service. Period.  In retrospect, we should've walked out at that point, but decided to stick it out since the food would be worth it - it wasn't, but more on that later.  We both had such an unsettling feeling that we couldn't shake.  Our night was off to a horrible start.  The tiny saving grace, and why I gave the restaurant 2 stars instead of 1, was our server.  I'm now upset we forgot her name, but I think she was only female server working that night.  She acknowledged that we wanted to sit at the Chef's Table, apologized and explained that she couldn't think of what happened.  She also went above and beyond to accommodate our every request and felt genuinely horrible that our night did not turn out as expected.  She even got a couple of items (the cheapest ones) on our bill comped. As for The Manager, not once did he come over to our table to acknowledge their mistake or offer an apology.  Inexcusable.

Food:
Maybe the lack of farm-to-table ingredients this time of year made all the difference in the dishes, but our selections were subpar.  We ordered some bread thing (no comparison to the nodini at Buca) and the bone marrow as starters.  Nothing spectacular.  Actually I make better roasted bone marrow at home.  We both ordered pasta dishes for our main.  I ordered the celeriac agnolotti with oyster mushrooms. Or should I say, one slice of an oyster mushroom.  It was was my preference of the 2 pastas, but I think the chef went a little overboard on the celery theme.  I think it needed a contrasting flavour to make it a great dish.  My husband ordered the lamb ragu pappardelle.  Or, what I like to call it, plain pasta with some lamb on top.  When I think and make ragu, I think saucy (tomato or some other reduction) and meaty that gives pasta the flavour it lacks.  Did not get this at all from this dish.  Very disappointing.  They comped our dessert so I ordered the sea salt caramel dish.  It was very tasty.  Too bad I couldn't eat it all because it had rum in it (ordering a mocktail didn't give enough of a clue).  But it was the highlight of the meal.

I really hope the owner sees this and does something about The Manager.  I could not find an email anywhere on their website to send this directly to them.  Acutally, their website gave my Moxilla some kind of pop up ad.

All in all, we will not be returning to Campagnolo, unfortunately, nor will we be recommending it to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"The food is what keeps me coming back - I've been here over 6 times now and every time, I pray the service is better. It never is. Sometimes I have had a reservation and other times not. Never seems to matter because they always want to kick you out after an hour and a half. Which is strange seeing that every time I have been there, there have been ample seating space. The hostess is so rude, it's almost comical. She isn't very smart, she's put off by the simplest questions. The waiters are just as bad. The service is lethargic and the pretentious but the food is great. You'd think whoever owns / manages this place would clue into to getting top of the line service. I could care less what the service's attire is as long as they are friendly and don't roll their eyes when you ask a simple question -- for example -- an extra friend was joinging us and we had a reservation for 4 - easy to put a chair at the end of our table. Hostess rolled her eyes. I couldn't believe it. You spend $250 on the bill -- you spend that kind of money not to be treated so horribly."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends on a Saturday night. We were rushed to leave from the moment we walked in due to a function/Christmas party occurring later on in the evening. 

To start they asked us if we wanted sparkling or flat. We asked for both and wanted to know the brand, they had mentioned it was a in house filtered 'Q' water. Which is something you can buy at the Bay or the shopping network, nothing  extravagant, other than the price you pay for in house filtered water. 

Now onto the service and meal, they have a nicely sized wine cellar with some very nice names. Nothing on the reasonable side, which would make you feel that this is a high end restaurant. We ordered a ripasso, very good! Because we knew we didn't have much time to eat before we had to leave, and were hungry, we decided to skip appetizers and order our main courses. This was a big mistake, the food took extremely long to come, which left us just sitting, drinking wine and water for about 30 minutes. I found this very surprising because the restaurant was only half full. It got to the point that we were so hungry and saw other eating some bread baskets that we asked if we could have one as well. (You have to pay for bread, $4 very uncommon)  Finally after a few minutes after ordering some bread our meal came. I do have to admit although small portion it was delicious, I had the casarecche bolognese, the taste and flavours were amazing. My other two friends had the spaghetti amatriciana and short ribs. They both said it was very flavourful. Our bread that we ordered came halfway ther ought our mains but we also very good. 

For desert we ordered the salted caramel bodino (yum) and walnut and chocolate torte (very rich). 

All in all I think this place has potential they just need to work on a few things, better service, enlarge the portions if they are going to be so pricey. But the food is well made and flavourful which is the most important thing."}
{"text":"Love this place. To die for, portions are small but the flavours are wonderful. You don't leave feeling uncomfortably stuffed but as if your floating on a cloud with just the right amount of everything. My fave is the mozzarella with grapes seared in garlic butter. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Very nice space, beautiful chandeliers. Loved the wall paper actually. Impeccable service by our waiter Marcus. He suggested some great dishes. We started with cocktails as we had they were great. I had the limone and my bf a cocktail with bourbon. They were both delicious...the strong taste of the bourbon was diffused by the sugar, loved the little glass my limone came in!

I was surprised that there weren't as many \"Italian\" things on the menu..well the prosciutto and the home made pasta, but other than that it was generally a tapas menu. We went with the baguette, olives, burrata, pork belly and beef tartar appetizers. They were all incredible, especially the burratta. The warm oily grapes complemented it so well. The beef Tartar--please give us more! I know it's an appetizer, but such a small portion! The baguette was more like mini-profiteroles that just melted in your mouth. So small and delicious. For mains, we decided to split the spaghetti al ammetriciana, and the octopus/chorrizo with polenta. I liked the spaghetti, spicy but fresh. For dessert, we decided to try the caramel creation of the day, and it was wayyy too salty for my taste. I could see why people would like it though."}
{"text":"Food was okay....nothing special but a bit untraditional. EXTREMELY expensive for the portions, and the service was okay. A very small bowl of spaghetti with sauce was $19, very small baguette, $ 4.....NEVER again...:("}
{"text":"3 stars for the wait - took extremely long for our food, 5 stars for the service and quality of food - worth the wait, good ambience, nice decor, all around 4 stars"}
{"text":"A good Italian restaurant that offers fresh daily menus.  The food is well prepared but not outstandingly inventive or eventful.  Room is loud with music and conversations.  I would go back, but wouldn't be the one suggesting the place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for quite a while, so it must be doing something right!

Olives and Bagette, lemony and crisp, were charged  ($10).

We started with Burrata, a great combination of warm grapes and soft cheese, quite salty. This was immediately followed by the verdura fritta which was delightful, light crisp and flavourful.
We then had the spaghetti, hot, lots of garlic in fact slight overpowering burnt garlic taste which took away any other taste.
The Halibut main was excellent with the great surround of crisp brussels sprouts and salad type things with a strong lemon flavour.

The wine list, as to be expected, is predominantly Italian but with some unusual selections in it.

There is no sound absorbing material in the decor of the restaurant so the ambient noise is powerfully loud.

The service is polite, restrained, well-informed and suitable for the high-class sort of establishment that it is."}
{"text":"3/4 
I've passed by this place a million times and never really knew that this was THE Campagnolo- it's so low key- I love it.
There's not much I can say that others have not said.
They have good food- I just don't it's amazing.  I have to admit I prefer Terroni's pasta to this.  
I always order the basic spaghetti and use it as a benchmark.  Their spaghetti was oversalted in my opinion and the pasta was good- not overcooked but not PERFECTLY al dente the way you can find other fresh noodle places.

The wine list is solid but the really tasty wines will be around 14/glass.  My wine bill cost more than my food at the end of the night.

The Burrata starter is tops.  Get that.  it's a 5/5 mostly due to the olive oil.
But in Toronto there are quite a few nice Italian places and this is just another one that doesn't quite standout amongst the crowd in Toronto.

Good, but no need to gush over food or service.  So I'll leave it at a 3/5"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian places in the city. Be sure to get a reservation. Bartender was fun and had some unique and rotating concoctions. Menu changes regularily, bone marrow seems to be always there, a must visit for any bone marrow lovers.

Had both pastas and they were both amazing. Nice venue, great for a date ;)"}
{"text":"Went to Campagnolo for a birthday dinner after reading many positive reviews from yelp and I have to say that going here was a good recommendation.

First of all the service was top notch. The staff were helpful but at the same time not pushy, the sommelier came by and assisted with the wine pairing/selection when it looked like we didn't have a clue on what we wanted to order. The waitress was friendly, helpfully and funny contributing to the great vibe and feel of the restaurant.

Food was amazing, had the beef tartar which was marinated perfectly and served on perfectly toasted crostini and the main entree items were just as good. Overall great dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in town in a LONG time. One of my guests loved it so much she even propositioned the head chef with marriage. Everything was great from start to finish. A great birthday experience!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was great, but food was mediocre for the price. 

Apps:

Burrata cheese - great flavour combo with the toasted grapes. This was my favourite app of the ones we ordered.

Frisee - pretty ordinary salad, maybe a tad overseasoned.

Baguettes and gougeres - baguettes were nice and warm, but the gougeres weren't.

Mains:

Spaghetti - this was my favourite of the mains. Chewy texture and sauce had hint of spicyness to it.

Agnolotti - flavours were varied and interesting. Sweetness from the beets was a good touch.

Gnocchi - wasn't a huge fan of the consistency of the gnocchi. It was also way too salty with all the cheese and proscuitto.

Dessert:

Torta with rosemary and poached clementines - this was probably my favourite part of the meal. Dense-ish cake with hints of rosemary, in a biteful with fluffy yogourt, pecan, and clementine. 

Overall, while I really enjoyed the ambiance, I found the food pricey for what it was, the portions were small, and the service sub-par."}
{"text":"What to say about this place.. I hate that stupid neon art thing wall for starters.  At first glance I thought it said sauna, but then realized it said jaune, cuz you know that makes way more sense in an Italian restaurant. =/

Anyways the starters were amazing, from the baguette and gougères, the quercia, the buratta on toasted bread and lastly my favourite the escarole salad with poached hen's egg piave and truffle salt.  Well executed, delicious and fun to eat.  It was a struggle to stay dignified and not lick the salad dressing off the plate, it was an amazing combination of creamy saltiness (no, not that kind) mixed with leftover bits of piave.. yeah it was good.

The pastas were varied in happiness, as the house made spaghetti was awesome, smoky, salty and spaghetti cooked perfectly.  The duck confit, onion soubise ravioli was okay - good flavour, a little undercooked, sauce was a little runny.  And lastly the boar, rib and meatball polenta was watered down, limp and sad.

My problem with this place was the service was god awful.  Our dude seemed lost at all times, there were huge long lulls between asking for something and him showing his face again.  It took him 20 minutes to get us a spoon while we watched him just milling around, talking to other staff.  There were times we'd see no one working the tables and the staff just chilling by the bar or with each other.  After asking for a refill of water, he'd come and fill that person's glass and leave without topping anyone else off.  Dude just wasn't smart, and I think if we were served by someone more competent our experience would've been way more pleasant. 

It took so long to get through our meal, that by the time we finished our mains, we were too tired for dessert.  All that waiting around just killed the fun I suppose.

Don't let me discourage you, the food for the most part was pretty great, just make sure you don't sit in the section near the glowing diner art."}
{"text":"The word Campagnolo means countryman/peasant.  However, there is nothing lowly about it.  Be it the décor or food, Campagnolo has class.

We were the first customers for the evening as we promptly arrived at 6PM.  Within minutes of being seated, our server came to take down our drink orders.  I order a Limone.  Unfortunately I cannot recall what was in it but it the basil leaf in it made the drink refreshing.  It was not sugary like most cocktails or mixed drinks I've had which was different. 

We ordered the Burrata Cheese with Roasted Grapes and Toast to start followed by the Portuguese Squid with Sepia Arancini and Arugula Sauce and the Charcoal Grilled Chorizo with Portuguese Octopus, Marinated Peppers and Preserved Lemons.

Burrata is an Italian cheese made form mozzarella and cream.  If served alone, it would be rather bland and unsatisfying.  However, from a textural perspective it was quite creamy and resembled a poached egg.  The subtle hints of tartness and sweetness from the grapes, coupled with the richness of the olive oil and salted bread came together wonderfully with the Burrata.   I loved that the simplicity of the ingredients surprised resulted in such a surprise of flavours.


Next up was the squid.  The presentation was beautiful.  The scoring of the squid allowed the browning to add a visually appealing scalloped look to it.  It was served atop a deep-fried squid-ink risotto ball.  While the shell of the rice ball was rather bland, the squid-ink risotto was packed with flavour.  The earthiness of the arugula sauce did a good job of balancing out the saltiness of the risotto and squid. 

Last, but certainly not least came the octopus.  Now that I think back on our meal, I wonder why we decided to order two seemingly similar items instead of venturing out and trying other things.  Oh well... its water under the bridge.  The octopus was not quite as delicate as the squid because of the texture of the suction cups found in its tentacles.  The octopus was served with roasted red peppers, polenta and a spicy chorizo sausage.  It was seared perfectly - not rubbery or tough.  The subtle twang from the roasted red peppers did a good job of foiling the salty octopus.  The extra heat added from the chorizo sausage was also mellowed out by the peppers.  I quite enjoyed the polenta cake as it was crisp on the outside like a hash brown and added to the dimensions of the dish by incorporating a hearty carb of sorts to give you the feeling of gratification.

Verdict:

I would recommend coming to Campagnolo with company in order to sample their menu items.  Their menu is printed daily and although the menu is not extensive, all the items on the menu are carefully picked and tasty.  The space itself is quite airy, with lots of natural lighting coming in through the windows and a great view of the kitchen and bar no matter where you are seated in the restaurant.  The food is fairly priced and the servers are all very friendly.  For a Wednesday night, the restaurant was at about 90% capacity, which only goes to prove the reputation it has acquired for their good food and trendy ambiance."}
{"text":"If someone were to ask me what my top 5 picks in the city were for a good night out Campagnolo would certainly be on it for some crazy good drinks, delicious food, great setting and friendly staff. You can dress up or settle for something less fancy and still be able to fit in with the ambiance here. If only they made it easy on us to make reservations and have better hours this would be a 5 star review. 
To be fair, I've had some food items miss the mark on my expectations but I think that's more on me for having too high expectations off of them.

For me their drinks are what sets is above most other restaurants of this standard as they feature interesting ingredients that blend superbly to make some strong but delicious drinks. Meals here are best experienced if you are willing to splurge a bit especially sampling a few of their starter options, but if you want to keep it below $40 it's still easy to do so and fit in a good meal. I came in here for the first time as part of a CMYE where us Yelpers split a lot of their menu items giving us the chance to try a bit of everything. It was here that I learned that roast wild boar tasted a lot like roast beef, but still delicious. 

They pride themselves on having home cooked fare and I say they should very well be tooting their own horn when it comes to their menu which has frequent enough changes while holding on to some items which I'm always glad remain on there. 

I would highly suggest making reservations as they are closed on Monday and Tuesday so if you want Wednesday dinner, calling on Monday or Tuesday (or during their off hours) will not yield results until the last minute, but I see now they have incorporated an online reservation system, so hopefully that process is more streamlined.

It's off the beaten path a bit compared to the usual strips that boast good times, but it's well worth the visit here and you will not be disappointed.

(For the sake of the October review challenge: 1/15)"}
{"text":"AIR CANADA - why so many customers complain about their service, I'm not really sure.  OK, so the older flight attendants might not be the most effervescent in their customer service skills, I can't say I don't support good ol' AC with their longer leg room, services, and En Route magazine!

And that's where I learned about Campagnolo.  Still new to the Toronto food scene, this was a great recommendation and after some research, found that it is a new hot spot.

I came here with 5 other friends, 3 of which are from out of town.  After the friendly recommendation from the server, we went ahead with the Chef's menu.

Served first with a plateful of prosciutto with baguette bread, which I gorged down quickly, it was followed with a fresh salad (sorry, I can't remember what was on it..should have written this review right after!).  At that moment, my stomach and mouth were amused and very ready for the entrees...

...but perhaps the gorging wasn't such a great idea.  The bone marrow followed, one I truly enjoyed.  The sweetness of the Plum marmalade added a great contrast.

At this point, I was 95% at full capacity.  The final dish was boar, tripe, and meatball in polenta.  Normally, I think I would have enjoyed this dish immensely, but it added too much richness to what we had already.  

I was surprised that my friends actually said they would give this a 3/5, but I still enjoyed our feast, the server was great, we weren't superbly pleased with our wine that never really opened (again, sorry, I don't remember which one we chose), and the music was much too loud, but with a decent chef's menu, I would still recommend anyone to at least give Campagnolo a try.  

Maybe with a smaller group, I'd still come back here.  It's cute."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. 

Though I've eaten there many times, I always seem to order the same thing. Their roasted grapes and burrata is without a doubt the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. Also, their spaghetti is crazy good. The noodles are homemade and thick. The sauce has a great little kick as well. I do suggest their stuffed pastas when they're on the menu - incredibly delicious.  

Drinks are great, service is wonderful. It's a great spot of a romantic dinner as the space has a nice dim, sexy ambience. 

Always look forward to my next evening there."}
{"text":"A lot of hype around this trendy restaurant. But I wasn't extremely amazed by the food, and it's quite pricey. 

Love the atmosphere, small, and cozy, suitable for a date or with parents. Impeccable service.

The food, however, I've had better at this price. 

We started with some appetizers. The bone marrow, I expected a long, thick bone, but instead the marrow was narrow. It was also topped with braised lamb and roasted plum - which really took away from the taste of the actual bone marrow. I was a little disappointed for $14. We also got the burrata cheese, very smooth and tasty and a decent sharing plate for $15. The best deal was the bread at $4. 

For entrees, it took a really long time to get to us. Hubby got the rabbit, which he seemed to enjoy very much, and my mom got her fish which she seemed to like. The item my dad wanted that was on the website, seemed to have disappeared off the menu. He opted for the squid pasta, but he didn't want the squid ink pasta - he asked if he can have regular pasta instead , to which they agreed. 

I got the regular squid ink pasta. I don't know why this costs $22. There was 3 pieces of squid, a few pieces of chilli and pasta that was coated in squid ink. My dad's version, was also the same price, minus the squid ink pasta. 

The worst part, was that my dad's pasta was undercooked. It wasn't al dente , it was actually hard and crunchy. I sent it back to which they apologized and gave us a new one. It was better, but the texture was nothing smooth like the version that I had. I am shocked that this could happen in the restaurant of this calibre. 

Meal over all with wine was about $50-60 per person, with one dessert included, which isn't terrible - but I feel like there are better quality restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Visited for my first time last week on a Thursday night, and I am a fan!

We ordered the house-made baguette and fresh burrata cheese to start. The baguettes are like little bread knots, light and fluffy on the inside. The burrata cheese comes with roasted grapes (I love) and is decadent and rich. I do regret skipping the bone marrow - a handful of other tables ordered this and it looked delicious.

For mains, we ordered the Cappaletti which comes with a light mushroom sauce and a butternut squash filling, and the gnocchi which is in a rabbit based ragu. Both were delicious. I was debating between the cappaletti and the spaghetti initially and when I saw other tables with the spaghetti, I experienced buyer's remorse for a second time.

Finished off with the chocolate torte and a cappuccino (as always). Excellent end to our visit.

Overall, the food is good, atmosphere is cozy and intimate, service is great. We will be returning - and next time I will be ordering the marrow and spaghetti"}
{"text":"The opening of Campagnolo is gentrification in its truest form. Previous life, a Coffee Time, this new Rustic Italian inspired restaurant has made a stamp on the ever growing homey style eateries along the Dundas West strip. 

I have read rave reviews about Craig, his menu and his restaurant. After a colleague spent 20 minutes describing his meal there I knew I had to see, taste and awe for myself. We made a reservation and headed over for a late seating Wednesday. 

Decor/Ambiance: The decor is rustic contemporary. They did a great job converting the space from a former coffee shop, but I felt it too be a bit cold (not temperature). I couldn't particularly put my finger on it. The space is wide with windows all around. Maybe some window treatments would do the trick. It didn't bother me too much because I was there for the food, not the flooring.

The story:
Ushered to our table we took no time to see what the nights highlights were and ordered some drinks. The waiter was over within a matter of minutes and being the indecisive patron I tend to be, I shooed him away a few times. Once we were ready, it was a game to get this attention. I guess it serves me right. I was disappointed to learn they ran out of the only item I could eat on the menu, but the waiter offered some other suggestions off menu and I kindly asked if the chef could make a hybrid of two dishes. To my surprise he did more than that, he created a dish from scratch based off of the ingredients he had in the kitchen. I was smitten instantly.

TO DRINK:
Rosemary Cesar:  wowza! not too spicy, fragrant and addictive. 

TO START:
Home Made Baguette and Gougères with whipped garlic butter: I wasn't wowed by the baguette but I wanted to smear the butter on anything edible. 

Fresh Burrata and Roasted Grapes: 
If I could sing an operatic arrangement I would do it for this Burrata. The Burrata was creamy like a bufalo mozz with a crescendo of salt. Accompanied by the sweetness of roasted grapes. I felt like a Grecian god. 

Rapini with Roasted Pine Nuts and Blue Cheese: The bitterness of the rapini was challenged by the pungent taste of blue cheese. Instead of battling it out, they married and created an affair to remember!!

TO MAIN:
Grandma's Wild Boar on Polenta: He loved it. Ate every bite.
Ricotta Gnocci with Yellow and Red Beets, Wilted Spinach, Rosemary and Lemon: The gnocci was melt in your mouth delicious. I liked the earthy combination of the ingredients and the acidic zing from the lemon.

TO FINISH:
Salted Caramel Burrata: If I could, I would fill up one of those backpack tetra packs and indulge in this everyday. No joke. It's a heavenly salty. But I must remain a civilized being and will be back to eat with a spoon.

Take your taste buds on an adventure and head to Campagnolo quick. It's sure to leave you in a comatose state of happiness. All the way from your lips to your hips!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Toronto.  The burrata with roasted grapes and the steak tartare were amazing highlights in an overall exceptional meal.  Great cocktails and wine list. Including alcohol, the bill worked out around $260 + tip for 3 ppl.  Will definitely return sometime soon."}
{"text":"- 4.5 -

Food and ambiance is perfection. Great for date night. 

The menu changes quite frequently and their website is pretty up to date so check it out if you'd like an idea of what they're currently serving. Things will come and go but it seems that the Burrata Cheese, the Roasted Bone Marrow and the House-Made Spaghetti are signature items that will always be available for your indulgence. Thankfully.

Burrata Cheese ($16) - Outstanding. I really didn't know what to expect but this dish went above and beyond anything I had imagined. The cheese was so fresh and creamy perfectly combined with the roasted grapes and toasted bread. Makes me drool just thinking about it. 5/5 

Roasted Bone Marrow ($14) - Delicious and well-portioned. More meaty and substantial than many restaurants I've been to. The oxtail was tender and the bone marrow was nice and fatty. 5/5

House-Made Spaghetti All'Amatriciana ($19) - Perfectly al dente. One of the best spaghetti I've ever had. Super fresh and so much flavour but I wish the portion was a little bigger. Well worth the $19 nonetheless. 5/5

Tagliatelle with Duck Ragu ($23) - The least memorable one for me but that's probably because I'm not a huge fan of anything ragu. My boyfriend who is less bias said the duck lacked a bit of flavor and the dish overall was slightly on the saltier side but it wasn't that bad. Tagliatelle was still nice and firm.  3/5

Seared Red Snapper ($28) - They did a great job with the snapper. Nice and crisp on the exterior but the inside is soft and juicy. Mussels were a nice addition along with the saffron potatoes and roasted pepper fondue. Solid dish. 4/5 

Salted Caramel Budino ($9) - Loved that this was not overly sweet or salty. The pudding was light and creamy and the chocolate meringue is in small chunks so it adds a nice texture. 4/5

Hazelnut Torta ($10) - A bit too sweet for me but I believe the gelato is dark chocolate which really helps lessens it.  Definitely recommend getting some tea or coffee with this one. 3/5

Service fell short.  For a restaurant at this level, I was rather disappointed. It was so standard as our server essentially gave us menus, took our orders and gave us our food. Perhaps it was just our particular server because I noticed other tables were waited by much more attentive, enthusiastic and engaged staff. So I'll give Campagnolo the benefit of a doubt and award it the full 5 stars here because I really do feel the food deserves it. But as for my own particular experience, it was only 4.5."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and atmosphere. Food is great but not mind blowing. Limited menu and service is very nice."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it's been outstanding both times. The first time I sat at the bar with a friend and I worked my way through the outstanding cocktail list. A little pricey but the bartender/creator of these concoctions really knows what he's doing. And he's nice. So no complaints there. The second time I had a table by the window and the experience was equally great. Our main waitress and the other staff were very friendly and seemed genuinely happy to take orders and chat about the food and which drinks would pair best.

The food was fantastic. Not a bad bite in either meal I've had. The portions seems small but you leave very satisfied. 

Again, the staff are fantastic, the vibe is chill and the tunes were great. 

And the last time I was in there a smoking hot Kim Cattrall sat next my girlfriend and I. Damn...she looked amazing."}
{"text":"This could be such a good restaurant if it wasn't for the bad service. The servers are very friendly but the timing of our meal this time was all wrong. We started with 2 fabulous cocktails. As they were delivered, the server asked what we wanted to order, not \"if\" we had a chance to look at the menu. Big difference. I had heard of their pushy manner so I informed them at time of reserving the table that this was a birthday celebration and we'd like to take our time. . I said we were going to enjoy our drinks and then take a look at the menu. We finished our drinks and we ordered 2 apps and 2 mains. I asked the server to come right back so I could order wine. He did not return.  I flagged down another server and ordered a bottle of red. 3 of our 4 dishes came at once and still no wine. We finished 2 dishes as the 3rd got cold and then the wine arrived. I flagged down our original server and asked him to hold off on the 4th dish so we could catch up. He did and the last dish was lovely. We still had half a bottle to drink so we stayed. We could have been out of their sooner if the timing was better. We didn't need to feel rushed. The service just needed to be better timed. Bad management and bad kitchen/front of house communication. Great food though - even eaten cold."}
{"text":"Cute place and great service HOWEVER we waited so long to come check this place out and were quite disappointed. First of all if you like to eat the portions are tiny, even the pasta dish left you wanting more...way more. We had the endive salad, the ricotta fritters, the HOUSE-MADE SPAGHETTI ALL'AMATRICIANA and the pork dish. Yes the pasta was delicious but the portion was tiny! All the other dishes I could do without. I was actually hungry when I left - didn't stay for dessert because we went out for a slice of pizza!"}
{"text":"One of my favourites in the city! Definitely have the spaghetti and bone marrow to start. Amazing cocktails here too!"}
{"text":"Can you believe this place used to be a ghetto Coffee Time donut shop? Well they cleaned this place up right nice and after months of passing by, I finally had the opportunity to stop in for a meal.

When we arrived our reserved table wasn't ready so we started off with a cocktail at the bar. I tried the Diablo, which was a tequila based beverage with a red color and a pretty good flavour overall. We were shortly moved into our table, and we got to begin the fun of choosing what to eat and drink. 

We found a nice bottle of riesling for $50, and then started with orders of the house made baguette, prosciutto, warmed olives, and 60 day aged beef tartare with truffle sauce. This was my first time delving into the world of beef tartare, and to be honest I wasn't a fan until I wrapped a piece of prosciutto around it. The rest of the apps were good though, and an enjoyable start to our meal although not necessarily memorable.

On to the mains... I went with the Braised Lamb Shank in Pork Belly Hash, which was just next level awesomeness. We're talking food orgasm territory (orgaslamb?). Perfectly cooked and the flavours just complimented itself so well, this is definitely one of the best plates I've eaten in years. 
My dining companion ordered the Campagnolo Cassoulet, which was composed of duck confit and a spicy garlic sausage on a bean medley type thing. I was able to sample a bit and the duck was also top notch, and while the sausage had a homemade and heavily seasoned vibe it wasn't as good but still decent.
Only a couple options for dessert and neither spoke to us given how much food we had eaten already.

The ambience was nice and the servers were friendly and knowledgable, but my date pointed out something which I didn't think too much of at first, but had some truth to it that I thought more about as the meal went on. The servers were all rather casually dressed. The kitchen staff, the bartender, and the hostess were all dressed well. The actual servers were wearing denim jeans and flannel or cowboy styled collared shirts. Perhaps it is to keep the approachable and down to earth feeling rather than pretentious and elitist, but there is definitely some merit to the thought that when dropping a couple hundred on dinner bill, perhaps the servers shouldn't be more under dressed than the customers.

All in all, probably closer to 4.5 than 4 stars, and the Lamb Shank Pork Belly Hash was one of the best meals I've ever eaten, but it was not an overwhelming win throughout the whole experience, thus earning the 4. 
Still, easy to understand why En Route Magazine listed this place as one of Canada's Top 10 New Restaurants in 2011, and definitely an easy place to recommend."}
{"text":"Yum! Campagnolo is a great place to break bread and share tapas-style Italian eats with friends and family. The service is friendly and attentive, and the food is delicious. I especially liked the braised boar on polenta (perfect stick-to-your-ribs food for a snowy evening!), the fresh burrata cheese with roasted grapes (!), and the fresh pappardelle with peas and lemon. The cocktail menu is also a stand-out. 

The decor is cozy and unpretentious. The candlelight makes for a romantic atmosphere. You could bring a date here, but it's so much fun to dine with a bunch of friends and order a boatload of dishes to share and sample. Go, eat! Mangia!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Excellent service, lovely room & a great menu. Thursday night business dinner with my wife & her client & spouse. All three had the spaghetti All'Amatriciana, which I tasted & loved. I had the cappelletti di zucca, which was rich & delicious. 

For apps, we shared the gougeres & bread + burrata, beef tartare, a salad & I had the bone marrow. I tasted a bit of them all & they were great, except the salad, which I found very acidic.

All in all a very nice restaurant."}
{"text":"We wanted to love this restaurant based on positive reviews. Alas, the four of had a very mediocre dining experience.  The olives and bread olives were served hot which was rather strange), and the bread round hard tasteless balls. The spaghetti honestly tasted like Catelli pasta and sauce you make at home.  Other dishes were similarly lacking in flavour. The servers were aggressively pushing the alcohol, repeatedly asking us if we wanted more wine and cocktails although we declined each time they asked. The salted caramel dessert was so sweet, one taste and we left it uneaten, which did not solicit any comment from the server as to the uneaten dessert.  It was crowded and noisy so I guess someone enjoyed their meal, just not us."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, Tapas come with a great assortment. Bar is lively too. Only quirk I would say to the restaurant was that it's a very small space."}
{"text":"Pork belly and pasta is delicious. Service is not great. Stay away from their pork shank. It came out cold on the inside and after being sent back, it still remained cold. The server didn't take the pork off the bill. For a place like this, I would expect excellent customer service."}
{"text":"It's a solid 4.5 still. Love the space and the menu has just enough hits to keep people coming back for more.

Great service from our waiter, he was engaging.

That burrata with roasted grapes can keep them coming back
Pastas always are solid, just al dente.

The atmosphere and food make this one of the better Italian spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've dined here several times in the past, I find the atmosphere relaxing at times when it's not too crowded.  This review is based mostly on my dinner this past Sunday.

The 60-day-aged steak tartare with truffle oil may possibly be the best steak tartare I've ever had (disclaimer: I don't have steak tartare more than a few times a year).  The texture was perfect, neither too chewy nor too mushy.  The truffle-oil was clearly detectable.  Overall, it tasted light and fresh.

The bone marrow with oxtail marmelade was also awesome.  A great balance of sweet and savory.  Also, a great balance of textures.  Warm, rich and satisfying.

Rabbit and rapini in a citrus sauce was good.  After my other two appetizers, the lean rabbit together with green vegetables in a citrus sauce seemed a little on the healthy side.  The rabbit may have been a little dry, or my senses may have been biased by the previous dishes.

Spaghetti all'amatriciana: springy al dente, good, nothing to write home about.

Butternut squash agnolotti with brussels sprouts and sage: better.  The butternut squash filling was perhaps a touch too sweet, but texture and everything else was great.

Cannoli: no complaints, served with candied orange (or a very dry orange jam?). 

I'm giving them five stars on account of their consistency: every time I've been here, there have been one or two dishes that have wowed  me (though I think my most recent visit was the most wow-ing), and nothing has ever disappointed.  Their prices are relatively reasonable too."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner at the chef's table. The guys n the kitchen kept us entertained and watching them make everything from scratch, was exciting.  The buratta, the steak tartar, the made to order bread and the pasta. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sweet little place with a positive  and energetic vibe. loved our server. (hi jess!) but quite honestly we didn't have a good dinner. our martini's were not very cold and served in a thick 'cut glass' glasses. the olive was stellar, so, yay. bread costs $4 and for that i want my gougeres to be fabulous and they were just ok. i felt they needed more cheese. i'd have added a bit more to the dough - like 15% or so. they were lacking and well, why would you do that to a perfect choux?  

the burrata was certainly beyond generous - huge, in fact, but if you know serious burrata it was lacking big time. just not creamy and tasted bland. good burrata makes your toes curl. and it's hard to source. buffalo mozzarella would've been highly preferable over this. on a positive note, the bone marrow delivered its promise. it was a high point and the reason for the 3rd star. can you say oxtail marmalade?

we ordered 2 pastas and both the spaghetti and the taglietelle were literally awful. not the dish - but the pasta. bad texture. i've been trying to figure out what it was - but it tasted almost mealy. i know good fresh pasta (no really, i know...) and this just wasn't it so change up your recipe, dudes! it was totally a damn crying shame because both sauces were solid - all'amatraciana and the chicken liver/almond thing. 

the salted caramel budino was nice. chunks of chocolate meringue in there. 

i'd say that if one had to judge from this dinner, they'd never last in nyc. i'm also basing this on one dinner which feels unfair but i think we got them at their best. 

just telling it like it is..."}
{"text":"Campagnolo is my favourite restaurant in the city without a doubt. The decor is stunning and the food is absolutely phenomenal, it blows me away every time. The menu is small and changes all the time so go often and try everything. I've never had anything there that I didn't absolutely love -not just like, love every bite. Don't even second guess yourself just go."}
{"text":"I'm so unsure of how to rate this restaurant. I heard really good things about it on the internet before getting to Toronto so even before arriving in the city, I made a reservation. I'm sad to say that I was disappointed. The spaghetti was perfectly cooked but it was SO SPICY, I wish I had been warned. I'm pretty sure Amatriciana sauce calls for some sort of black pepper or chili pepper but that was just crazy spicy. I could barely eat it. Everything we ordered was just sub par... Except for the wine ;) 
My best friend had the steak and it was delicious. I ended up eating some of her food because I couldn't eat mine due to the spiciness. Mind you, I put hot sauce on basically everything so you'd think I'd be used to the heat. I'm giving three stars because of the service. The server immediately noticed that I hadn't eaten much of my meal so she offered me something else but I said it was okay. She made up for the \"just okay\" food. Such a cute restaurant but I'm not sure that I'd go back if I were back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with a group of 7 people a few days ago and were unbelievably pleasantly surprised by the food and service quality. We started with picked vegetables (delicious) and moved on to salad and buratta shortly after. The cheese was phenomenal and served with warm grapes - it was rich smooth and decadent - there wasn't a drop left on any of our plates. Salad was good as well. Pastas were the real highlight for me and we had a vegetarian in the group who was equally impressed with her food. We had the soaghetti and the agnolotti. The stuffed pasta was super memorable as I'd never had a pasta made with dill before and it was really delicious. For the meat course we had meat balls pork ribs and short rib. The short rib literally melted on my tongue it was really delicious. The fish course was the only one that left something to be desired - it was over salted and a little too fishy which made us feel like it wasn't super fresh. The vegetable sides were delicious and well seasoned - who knew carrots could be so delicious! Overall a really great experience and definitely worth the money. Actually value for money is extremely good - it would be hard to have a meal that delicious and full for only $65/person anywhere in the city."}
{"text":"The ambience of Campagnolo is relaxing. I love the atmosphere and the decor here. However, the food was okay. 

Service:
The service was amazing. The servers were very friendly and explained the menu well. 

Food:
Bread and olives- The bread was nice but it wasn't amazing. I will probably not order this again. 

Beef tartare and sunchoke- I love tartare in general so I knew I had to order this. Everything in this tartare went well together. I would recommend this appetizer. 

Cappelletti di zucca- this was a seasonal pasta dish. It was really rich in flavor and it was delicious. However, I expected the pasta dish to be larger since it was listed as an entree. It looked more like a side dish. Other than the size being too small for the price, the pasta was really good. 

Short rib ragu with meatballs, spareribs, and tripe- this was another seasonal dish. This dish was interesting. It was a mix of meats on corn meal. I wasn't a big fan of the combination. The meats were rich in flavor and the corn meal is supposed to balance it. However, I didn't like the texture of the corn meal with the meats. 

In conclusion, I am not sure if I would come back here. The prices were steep and the food was mediocre. It is a nice place to grab drinks or go on a date given the ambience and service. I would not recommend eating here though."}
{"text":"i came here with my mom who was in town visiting me, encouraged by other reviews, and was not all that impressed by what i saw/ate. here's what we ordered - at the server's suggestion we ordered and shared multiple appetizers and got one main course to split:

rhubarb caipirinha cocktail - 5/10 - not rhubarby enough... kind of flavourless, somewhat bitter alcohol

house made baguette and gougeres - 5/10 - good enough i suppose, but an incredibly small portion, and the baguette was more of a bread twist? definitely not a baguette
warm olives - 8/10 - the olives were quite nicely marinated, and the portion lasted the whole meal!
la quercia rosa proscuitto - 9/10 - yum i am a huge fan of proscuitto, and la quercia rosa makes some delicous meat, but where's the bread?
burrata cheese, roasted grapes with toasted bread - 8/10 - great flavour combination, the warm mild cheese matches well with the sweet grapes and rich olive oil, but for 13 dollars it should have been double the size
grilled tuna - 5/10 - meh. no real identity to this dish, not surprising that it's not currently on the menu

culotte steak with pont-neuf potato - 9/10 - very well cooked, went very well with the potatoes and mushrooms in surrounding it, an enjoyable meaty dish

the food in general was very hit and miss i found, some dishes were very good, some were very forgettable (i'm pretty sure that we also ordered a vegetable dish, but i have no recollection of what it was). the unifying theme to the food though was small portions and high prices, enough to knock a star off of the review, from 4.5 to 3.5 stars.

i don't normally put too much wait in my reviews on the service, i prefer excellent food to excellent service (or ambiance, or cleanliness), but i chose to round down to 3 stars rather than up to 4 stars due to the incredibly snobby and rude service me and my mother received. i have honestly never been treated so poorly before and it was shocking. multiple times our waitress rolled her eyes when we aksed her about the menu, our water was never refilled, and when we asked if we could sit farther away from the door (it was a bit of a chilly night and the door was open for some reason), she laughed and said that the table we wanted was going reserved for people who had reservations an hour and half from when we arrived.

i don't doubt that other people have had great experiences here, but i won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and amount for price fix family style. I'd come back for this amazing meal. Highlight was the fish and pasta. Service was attentive. The only thing was that our server should have shown us the wine menu and prices. Seemed as though our second bottle was a lot pricier than expected when the bill came around."}
{"text":"I'd been here once before closer to when it opened but I didn't remember it being this good. I had the sweetcorn agnolotti and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. I couldn't fault it. My friend's dish was equally good. When I got home I asked some of my foodie friends if they'd been here and they confirmed that they agree it is one of the best restaurants in the city. They recommended the Burrata (which I haven't tried). I think it is safe to say everything at this place would be delicious.

The service was good but I was surprised how long a glass of wine and bread took to get to our table. My friend ordered her wine at the same time as her meal and the meal actually came out before the wine... we had to remind the server that the full glass of wine sitting on the bar was likely for her. The bread took about 10 minutes to arrive. I saw it sitting on the counter for quite a while and had to remind the server that I wanted the bread. However, the server was very nice."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my boyfriend for an early birthday dinner. I had heard fantastic things about Campagnolo so I was quite excited to try it; my bf made reservations about 1 or 2 weeks in advanced. Upon arriving, the space was less romantic than it looks from the outside, and smaller too.  Thank God it wasn't that packed, because I can't imagine sitting shoulder to shoulder next to my neighbours. 

Our server was great and very knowledgeable and personable. She told us the menu is constantly changing, with the exception of the 3 dishes they're most well known for: the burrata with roasted grapes (app), bone marrow with oxtail marmalade (app), and spaghetti al'amatriciana (main). Knowing this, we ordered all three, as well as the fried spelts as a third appetizer and the confit chicken linguini as our second main.

Let's start off with the appies. The first one to come out was the smelts; the dish contained two tempura battered small fishies on top of a thin \"pancake\" with a couple of green beans and artichokes. This dish was very light and \"spring\"-like in taste. I thought it was alright. 

The bone marrow was next. Bone marrow is always a delicious option and I was so excited for it, but unfortunately  the marmalade, for me, was just too sweet and almost ruined the dish. If it was less sweet, I can see the sweet and salty notes working together, though I think I'd still prefer without.

Last appetizer was the burrata. The roasted grapes were a fantastic touch and worked so well with the burrata and toast to soak up all the garlic oil. I think I would've liked one more piece of toast with this dish as there was much more burrata in it, and having a little bit more toast would be a good vehicle to consume and soak up the juices. 

With our two pasta mains, the spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente and the tomato sauce was nice with a nice spicy bite to it. Besides that, I'm not sure it was anything extraordinary, sadly... with the linguini, it was yet another dish that didn't blow me away. The chicken, sauce, and pasta were all just alright.

Our bill came out to about $100 (5 dishes, without alcohol). Cheaper than I thought, but given the portion sizes and the flavours not being my favourite, this may be my only visit."}
{"text":"Food here was great, nuf said. My only complaint is they try WAY too hard to turn and fill tables, so good luck getting a seat and make sure you eat fast if you do get one because it will be made painfully clear that your time is up!"}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night with a friend. A breakdown of what I had:

1. Glass of Dolcetto d'Alba red. 
2. Burrata cheese with roasted grapes and toasted bread.
3. Creste de Gallo.

Ambience is homey and intimate. Service is prompt. Food and drink is top-notch. This place is a must for people who appreciate Italian fine-dining with a contemporary twist."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, excellent food and great service. The decor is cozy and warm, nice place for a romantic date.

Started with the \"Warm Olives\" and \"Burrata Cheese with Roasted Grapes\".  The \"Burrata Cheese with Roasted Grapes\" was heaven.  For dinner I had the \"Spaghetti All'Amatriciana\", best pasta I had in a long time; love the garlic and fresh tomato sauce.

I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to try this new restaurant! Menu looked good, cocktail menu looked even better. 

The experience would have been better if the waiter was more attentive. He was friendly, but needed to be polished. There were 3 of us, he started to write on his pad, taking our order that had 7 things. He would take one order, review, go to the next guest's order, then go back to the first person's order, had us repeated our order for him, it was rather annoying. He didn't know all of 3 of the desserts that they offerred that night. He needed to check ... minor things...  

Food was good. Warm olives were nice, proscuitto, octopus & egglplant crostini, oxtail ravioli, were fine. The duck confit, blood orange salad with almonds, and wild boar ragu on polenta were more memorable. 

I was not impressed with their washroom door where I found myself spending what seemed like 5 minutes to work off my dinner by pulling and tugging the lock in fear of locking myself in the stall there. 

Hope I'll return to better service in future."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! 
Came here to celebrate my birthday with some friends and we all LOVED it! Great ambiance and vibe, lovely staff, nice decor and DELICIOUS food! All the dishes that we've ordered was incredible! My favourite of the night was the Fresh Burrata Cheese with Roasted Grapes and Toasted Bread and the fish (i think it was a trout). The bone marrow was also fantastic and let's not forget the dessert: the Salted Caramel Budino! YUM! out of this world! I guess the only thing I didn't like was my mixed drink, didn't finish it, but my friend was more than happy to help me with that. Next time, I will have their fresh made pasta. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this restaurant by accident, but I'd rather call it fate.  What a great dinner. Such a diverse menu considering it's an Italian restaurant.  The bone marrow appetizer was definitely something to come back for.  We ordered a variety of entrees as well, but I have to say I can't stop thinking about the spaghetti, it was executed perfectly, fresh, light, delicious. The service and ambiance was also great.  Nice crowd, dim lighting, and beautiful presentation. Definitely a special occasion spot."}
{"text":"An amazing Resto, from decor & ambiance (a mix of modern & classic), attentive and professional service to menu & extensive wine list. 
Menu isn't large but had something for everyone. Our table of four adults shared numerous appetizers: Castelfranco salad à la Romagna, Burrata with grilled grapes, house-made baguette & gougère (cheese puffs) and the pièce de resistance: beef marrow. Wasn't sure about the beef marrow but decided to go for it. Wow! What a taste explosion! Everything was amazing, actually. 

Three of four ordered the bavette steak with Gorgonzola butter, served with a very tasty, albeit unusual grilled radicchio salad. The fourth ordered the spaghetti all'amaticiana. All were fabulous!

The restaurant has a real neighbourhood feel to it and filled up very quickly. By 6:40 there wasn't an empty table, an excellent sign for a Sunday evening. 

There were families with young children as well as couple and groups of friends of all ages. Definitely a repeater!"}
{"text":"I've been foiled a few times in attempts to get to Campagnolo, but last night, lo and behold, my efforts were fulfilled.  And how!

My date and I were walking by and, rather than taking the extra 10 minutes to get to the Ossington strip (in the chill), I suggested we pop in, just to see what the table situation was like.  We were greeted warmly, and after checking their reservation list, we were treated to a seat by the large front window.  The hostess was quick with providing us some water while we looked over the menus, and it wasn't long until our server - who, may I say, almost made the evening! - came by to answer questions, give recommendations, and the like. 

The first standout feature of the evening was the food.  We shared the burreta cheese on toasted bread with grapes, though had I known how incredibly delicious it would be, I may not have agreed to share!  Both our dinners were pastas, which I couldn't even pretend to be able to spell, and both were exceptional.  Just filling and rich enough that neither I nor Date were overly stuffed, but satisfied.  We finished with a caramel ...thing for desert.  I say \"thing\" solely because I don't recall in the slightest how to spell it.  Our partnering wine was also lovely; I'm a red girl, so there was certainly no lack of options for me!

The second standout was the service.  It was a Sunday night, which has at times spelled disaster in the service department.  Not the case last night!  Our server was so enthusiastic and passionate about the food, like a case of the chicken pox, it was almost infectious!  His recommendations pretty much drove our dinner choices, from the wine to dessert, and they totally stood up.  Not only that, but between the two other servers and hostess, someone was always seeming to be around to check on us or clear a plate.  And that's even with a party of about 20 in house!

I don't think I could have created a better evening; Date may have Campagnolo to thank for my agreeing to go out a second time ;)"}
{"text":"I've bookmarked this restaurant for quite a while after reading about it on Yelp last year. But did not get the chance to trek into Little Italy until recently. I made reservations and upon arrival, was greeted by a friendly and warm host. 

The restaurant was dimmed and intimate. Very romantic and perfect for date night. After reading about the roasted grapes, I knew I had to try it. And it did not disappoint. The middle of the cheese was warm and soft and we got extra bread so we can dip it up. The olive oil they used was also yum. 

For our mains, we got the lasagna and the cavatelli. Both were pretty decent but did not wow. My cavatelli was not fully cooked through and I got lots of undercooked bite to it. The flavour was great though. 

And those who know me know that the look of a venue's restaurant is huge in my books so I am very pleased to tell you, this restaurant has the cleanest and nicely decorated bathroom in any restaurant I've been to downtown. The fruits and passion cucina handsoap is a very nice touch. Love it! 

If this place wasn't such a trek I think I'd visit more but since it's out of the way, it may be awhile before I revisit. However, they do change up their menu frequently so I heard... sooooo if I end up reading about another dish that wowed, I'm going to have to make another trek downtown :)"}
{"text":"We sat at the kitchen bar which was a treat in itself. I think the food is very good and the wine selection is good - no cheap and cheerful stuff here, but you are getting quality so it's worth it. Ambiance is nice too. Get ready though for being in trendyville so make resos well in advance if you're keen on an exact date and time!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. Two ppl, showed up around 7:30pm on a Weds. Resto was busy, good sign. Waited for a table instead of eating at bar since it was our first time here. Comfy waiting area where we ordered wine and olives. Bread was delicious, ordered the swordfish carpaccio, another app and two pasta. Flavour a were amazing. We asked a bunch of questions about where the seafood was from and staff was very friendly to answer questions and the chef even came out and answered. We were too full for desert but will def be back."}
{"text":"Order the bone-marrow. It was bloody fantastic! Maybe in the top 10-20 things i've ever eaten. 'nuff said."}
{"text":"The food exquisite, the service top notch and the atmosphere inviting. I called a week ahead with some heavy restrictions. Our meal had to be gluten free and had to take 45 minutes from the time we arrived to the time we left. It was for my wife and I's ten year anniversary and we had limitations on when we could arrive and had booked a special performance shortly after.

I am happy to say, they knocked it out of the park. I spoke with the chef the day before and he recommended from the menu (which changes daily) what could work. We arrived, were seated at a very nice table, and treated like royalty.

The only thing to mention is the price - this is not everyday fare and will cost you accordingly if you do the whole nine yards. Our meal was the buratta and roasted grapes, cabbage wrapped halibut served with crispy brussel sprouts and a celery purée, and enough wines to make the show that followed extra special. All was yum.

If you want to have a special night with your special someone, this is your place."}
{"text":"I came on a Friday night in a party of 4. I almost gave up on this place... Almost a week in advance, I phoned to make a reservation. No one answered, so I left a message. 2 days pass, no call. So I decide to try calling them again. I call at strategic times to try and catch them before they get too busy. No dice. At one point, the call answer thing tells me their voice mailbox if full. Bad sign... Finally though, they did get back to me. FYI - I think on Friday/weekends they only do 2 sittings, 6pm and 8:30pm. 

Showed up and the people at our table were still not done... It wasn't that bad, but we did have to wait 10 mins. which is sort of annoying when we already had a reservation. 

But I still give Campagnolo 4 stars because the food was SO good. I had high expectations and I was worried it might not live up to them, but thankfully I wasn't disappointed! 

I had:
- Cocktail that was basically a gin & tonic with fresh mint and cucumbers. Simple perfection. Nice and refreshing. 

- Brussel sprouts with pancetta and pine nuts -- love at first bite! The creamy sauce was divine. Luckily we got the house made baguette, so I could dip the bread in it. Good portion size. 
- Had a bite of the burrata and grapes. So fresh and tasty. I am definitely going to order this next time. 
- One person got the prosciutto which was nice but it didn't come with any bread or anything. The prosciutto looked a bit lonesome on that long plate... Another ordered the fish chowder. Looked hearty and he said it was really, really good (so good he wouldn't share!). 

- Spaghetti all' Amatriciana - I was so excited to try this because it is a quintessential Roman dish that I discovered recently while traveling in Rome. Campangolo's version was just as good as the ones I tried in Italy. Perfect al dente noodles and the sauce was spicy but not exaggerated. 
- We didn't really share entrees, but the person who ordered the boar was raving about it. And another friend got over his psychological barriers to eating rabbit (bunny!) -- and enjoyed the pappardelle dish. 

- Peppercorn panna cotta - interesting idea and mix of flavours, although after a few bites I found it way too pepper-y. 
- Salted caramel budino - I'll echo what everyone else has said, one of the highlights of the meal. 

Despite my frustrations in booking a table here (why have a phone if you don't pick it up?!?), Campagnolo has won me over. Really authentic Italian food done right -- simple dishes that let fresh ingredients speak for themselves and a small but always changing menu (luckily favourites like the burrata and the caramel budino are almost always on offer though). Knowledgeable and friendly staff plus a warm, inviting space are the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Had a great evening at Campagnolo! Food was great and service was good as well. We had the rabbit and the lamb shank and it was great. For dessert we had the strudel, which was good as well. Will go back for sure. Would have gotten 5 stars if they had a corkage fee!"}
{"text":"Long overdue review of Campagnolo. Had dinner reservations on a Thursday evening. At first I thought it was pretty quiet around 6pm, but slowly closer to dinner time the restaurant filled up. Hostess greeted and seated us right away. Our server came by with water and provided us with recommendations. We chose a bottle of wine from their menu that was a bit on the pricey side but since we wanted to indulge I don't regret the selection. We chose a Cappezana Cab and it was an amazing wine. 

First we started with their bread which came in little bread dough balls. It was tasty for just bread or I was hungry (haha). We also had the roasted squash which was heaven! It was so good. Our server says they change the menu time to time so I hope they keep this dish! Second dish I had their famous Spaghetti which was delicious! My friend had their short rib ragu which was also tasty. I understand these are supposed to be tapa sizes. With the appetizers and mains, I was full. We lastly had their salted caramel budino which was recommended by our server and it was delightful!

Overall I really enjoyed my evening at Campagnolo. It was tasty food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I had a fabulous dinner here over Christmas.  My boyfriend and I took my mom here and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  

The decor is really nice-homey but still trendy in an area with lots of street parking too which is a bonus in TO.  A little dressy but you wouldn't be out of place in jeans either. 

We split the burrata with roasted grapes and the housemade baguette to start.  The burrata was rich and creamy and the baguette was nice and crispy.  Both wins.  My mom had the short rib as her main, boyfriend the spaghetti All'Amatriciana and I had the agnolottie with gorgonzola cream.  Out of the three dishes we all agreed mine was the winner but all were terrific.  I will definitely go back. 

Minus one star for our waitress.  She was not friendly.  It was a cold day out and I ordered a chai latte to which she rudely said we don't do that.  They also don't have skim milk so a skinny latte was also out.  Later the table next to us was having tea which smelled great-they hand bag their teas here (which a different waiter told me and he took my order).  Minor blip in the evening.  

All in all-two apps, three mains and two local brews for $136.  Fantastic for the quality and atmosphere"}
{"text":"One of the hardest tables to book in Toronto and for a good reason. The menu is very limited but it's all about quality here. The rustic space is very welcoming and the service adds the cherry on top. I had a cocktail with Green Chartreuse and olive oil which was very unique and interesting at the same time. For appetizers, we shared the seared squid (with tarragon salsa verde) and the famous burrata dish which was creamy in texture. I did not really care for the roasted grapes and they did not enhance the overall experience whatsoever. For mains, we had the celeriac agnolotti which was amazing. They lost a star due to dessert (salted caramel budino with chocolate meringue) which was mediocre. Will definitely come back to try out their summer menu when it's out."}
{"text":"These guys do a great job. 6 foodies at the table and stellar reviews across the board. I typically don't eat pasta at restaurants but I must say they bring it the next level. Can't go wrong with the tasting menu."}
{"text":"crazy small portions with no gluten free pasta option?,really?- who doesn't?.Overpriced wine, anyone who drinks wine would know your mark up makes Scaramouche look like value!

The evening was saved by competent staff, a nice room and a great salad- not worth the price"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here in June and then in August.  The food is fresh and quite tasty.  The buratta starter is very tasty but it's a large portion.  The warm olives and the bread (which you pay for - reminded me of Portugal) were very good.  The spaghetti was very good as was the fish.  Dessert was also large portion.  Good value for the qualify of the food.  Very good service."}
{"text":"Excelent food with unique flavours!! Each plate is full of flavour! The service is great too! My husband and I had an amazing dinner enjoying the homemade bread and focaccia, a beef tartare, agnolotto verde and gnocchetti al fruto di mari. Prices are more than $20 the plate but totally worth it!! We will go back again.  Do not hesitate and go!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a place that was so welcoming. The customer service alone was the best service I have ever received in my life. In all my travels, to any country, city and restaurant I was completely floored. Then there was the food. Absolutely authentic and outstanding. This place is what every restaurant should aspire to be."}
{"text":"It can be tough to find impressive Italian fare in this city when you've been raised eating it at home, but Campagnolo goes down as one of my favorites. The menu is straightforward and simple in a way that doesn't feel limited. Starters included the warm olives, radicchio salad, and burrata with warm grapes. Guess which one stood out? This has become one of my most memorable mozzarella experiences of my life. My main was the papardelle with rabbit sugo, and my co-eater had a fantastic time with the spaghetti Amatriciana. Probably in the top three bowls of pasta I've ever eaten outside of Nonna's house, and trust me, that's the compliment of a lifetime. This place has become a staple for me."}
{"text":"VIBE 
A note that I was last here in the summer, so it's been a while. But I've been here on a few occasions and I can say that they fully deserve their #7 spot on En Route's Top Restaurants in Canada list. I've gotten to know some of the guys that work here and they are so lovely. They treat you like friends and get to know you. Bye, bye scrummy ol' Coffee Time and hello Italian Rustica. Dim lights and mood appropriate playlists are part of the charm.  As for clientele? The food obsessed (including  their chef friends), many pretty girls and even the likes of celebs. Apparently, Jessica Biel was turned down because the restaurant was packed! 

WE ATE 
Just a note that this a great place to just have a drink as well as have a full blown meal. The bar is a great spot to hang and the bartenders here are top notch.  Chanel is no longer and now it's Josh. Test him on his trivia. He's a quiz master at another bar in the city. Very charming, friendly and knows his stuff!  I have had many a winter sour here and I hope they bring it back this winter.  You can't go wrong with any of the cocktails on the board and I highly recommend them. 
The burrata is the stand-out here. It's roasted and the grapes add a nice sour punch.  The prosciutto is made in-house and served with olives, it tides you over before the main courses. Plus, those items are all-time faves so it kind of brought me back to my trip in Europe.  The fig salad adorned with blue cheese was a nice starter.  We had pappardalle with braised rabbit. Give. Me. More. It's so good!  They even made a vegetarian version for our friend (in a party of 12!) on request.  Given it was a busy Saturday night, that was really nice for them to do. 
This is going to be a birthday contender if only to try their chef's table. Next on the list:  rapini, wild boar, gnocchi and budino.  

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
They cook like your nonna but they don't look like your nonna. Campagnolo is showing that they're not just another trendy restaurant. They really do pour a lot of love and passion into their food and it shows.  I'm hoping it's going to CAMP out for many years to come. Craig's show \"In the Weeds\" also got the green light for production and I'm excited to see him get the recognition he deserves. I'm hoping this will up the resto's reputation in a good way."}
{"text":"This past weekend I had the pleasure of dining at campagnolo, and let me tell you, what a treat it was. 

I was nervous because I tried to get dinner reservations via open table for the restaurant all weekend with no luck. Since we were in the area day drinking, I figured I would stop on by and see if I could get a seat at the bar. Was greeted by a lovely host who immediately sat us outside- and since it was a bit chilly, he offered a blanket! The nicest touch! 

We started out the evening with the Burrata cheese appetizer, which I guess stays on their menu all the time (the restaurant switches most menu items but the Burrata has stood the test of time!)- I can see why. It was the most delicious and creamy cheese I've ever had, and it was accompanied by roasted grapes which were divine! 

For my entree, I had the eggplant Parmesan. Not usually a dish I would get because it's heavy, but decided to share the entree with my significant other. For a guy who never likes eggplant- he loved it! And so did i! The eggplant was lightly breaded, the ricotta cheese wasn't caked on, and the sauce was delicious! 

Besides the food, the ambiance and staff were spectacular and they have quite a nice wine selection! I'll definitely be back on my next trek to TDot!"}
{"text":"The restaurant isn't too small nor too big, with a nice atmosphere, which makes it perfect. We were seated by the window and we had a nice view of the bar and kitchen. Our favourite item was the Campelletti Di Zuca, the bread, and the burrata was soo good we ordered a second one. Surprisingly, the special item - house made spaghetti was a bit of a disappointment... we found it too tough and undercooked. Otherwise, great place, nice atmosphere, a simple not so complicated menu!"}
{"text":"Campagnolo used to be THE restaruant to go to and reservations are hard to come by, but things are more normal now that a few years have gone by. 

The food presentation is always good and the dishes taste ok as well. Having that said, I find the appetizers a bit pricey, and the drinks can add up quickly. None of the dishes are mind-blowing, but they are solid nonetheless.

I feel Campagnolo is now one of those restaurants that you visit once or twice a year. The experience and food is ok, but there is never a reason to make you want to come back again and again."}
{"text":"So, first order of business: a disclaimer, I am one of those people who are easy to please. It doesn't take much for me to have a favourable opinion of you, provided of course you have good manners. Seriously!

So how can you - and by you, I mean me - rate a restaurant that not just exceeds good service, but also provides amazing food AND creates a fabulous ambiance? You lobby for 6 stars on yelp, of course!

Here's what we ordered:
Appetizers:-
* House-made Baguette and Gougères (light, airy and buttery goodness! - we ordered it twice after inhaling the first plate). 
* Baby Kale Salad with Pecorino and Fried Shallots
* Hamachi Crudo with Romesco, Fennel, Dill and Orange 
* Fresh Burrata Cheese with Roasted Grapes and Toasted Bread ...
* Rainbow Swiss Chard with toasted pine nuts and honey 
 
Entrees:-
* Pappardelle with Rabbit and BC Chanterelles
* Butternut squash gnocchi with light tomato sauce
* Norwegian Ocean Trout with Grilled Treviso
* Lambshanks (can't find the description but it should be include \"divine\") 

My personal favourites were the baguettes, the hamachi and the swiss chard from the appetizers, and the lambshanks and butternut squash gnocchi from the entrees, although the other dishes were quite delicious in their own right as well. 

It was a feast, my friends - and like all feasts, it was accompanied by vino  (sangiovese, pinot noir) and dessert - cannelloni and a caramel pudding - and since I can't find the mouth-watering descriptions, you'll just have to take my word for it - they were mouth-watering to eat as well. 

As for the ambiance : I liked the simplicity of the decor: lacquered tables, nicely spaced, warm, inviting colours.   What was also appreciated was the fun, playful and easy going vibe the place has going for it. It wasn't too loud that you couldn't hear the person across from you, but it wasn't too quiet that you had to catch snippets of other tables' conversation. 

Very attentive and friendly service. If you haven't been to check it out  - I suggest you do so TODAY."}
{"text":"I'm going to go shout it from the rooftops; I love Campagnolo! 

I went here for a celebratory dinner with a friend on a Wednesday evening. While it was hard to get reservations (the fact that they're closed Monday and Tuesday make it a bit tricky), it was worth going a little earlier than I wanted to enjoy this place. 

I love the ambiance. The wallpaper is so cool, I love the wood ceiling, the mismatched chairs, and even that the servers were dressed casually. I like the whole vibe in general - it was a mixed crowd, mostly \"young professionals\" but also a few older groups - making it noisy and lively even at 6:30 PM. 

I love the cocktails - I really appreciate a good cocktail list and Campagnolo delivers. I tried two of their concoctions, and loved both (but of course I can't remember what they're called now). The prices are a bit high at $9 - $12 a drink, but they are WORTH IT! 

I love the food! I love the sharing plates, which are reasonably priced and delicious - The Buratta was so good (thanks for the tip fellow yelpers) and the others were excellent too! We also tried both of their pasta dishes that evening, the butternut squash agnolotti and a rabbit pasta - the rabbit blew my mind, it was so tender and delicious!  The also have a great selection of desserts, we chose the pastry with poached pairs and shaved parm. YUM!! 

Campagnolo is not the kind of place you go for a cheap meal, or if you want to be reserved in your spending. It is the kind of place that is expensive, yes, but not over-priced - everything you eat was worth the money you spent!

Well done Campagnolo - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is simply ridiculous. Every bite left me giggling from joy. Maybe it was all the whiskey, or our lovely waitress Jessi but the fact of the matter is you are guaranteed a fantastic meal if you dine here. 

Highlights: Chefs Table, Gorgeous Patio, Delicious Cocktails
Carpaccio, Burrata, Bone Marrow"}
{"text":"By far my favourite restaurant in Toronto! Their buratta with roasted grapes is the most delicious in the city; I would also highly recommend their tartare, bone marrow (it may be too salty/fatty for some), and all of their pastas are simple, perfectly prepared and delicious! 

The atmosphere is not as hip as their sister restaurant, la palma, but has a really unique traditional, romantic hole-in-the-wall vibe."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday! Was probably the best spaghetti I have ever had. The sauce was perfect! I could of eaten it everyday for the rest of my life!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Amazing seafood pasta, bone marrow and burrata. It's not too fancy and the food is really great"}
{"text":"The overall feeling is that they are trying to extract as much money from you as possible. No glass of wine under $12. Food tastes good, but portions are way too small. We left hungry and had to get a bite to eat somewhere else. Service seemed intentionally slow in the hopes that you'll consume as many $20 cocktails as possible. Avoid this place, it is a rip-off."}
{"text":"First time there was a good experience. We ordered:

FRESH BURRATA CHEESE with roasted grapes & toasted bread- Bread was crisp yet soft, drenched in olive oil (YUM) The roasted grapes were sweet and worked so well with the burrata cheese. It was a heavenly combo, really enjoyed this way more than I thought I would. I would get this again for sure!

ROASTED BONE MARROW- bone marrow is usually always good, this one was lovely because it had the oxtail marmalade which gave it a lot of flavour. Our size of bone marrow was perfect for two people. The crostini's were a little harder than I wanted it to be but other than that no real complaints.  

SPAGHETTI ALL'AMATRICIANA- this was the dish I was waiting to try all night, the pasta was cooked perfectly, the portion was just right (since we shared everything). It has a kick of spice that lingers but too much and doesn't over power the dish at all. It had bits of something in the suace, I couldn't really identify. It was just a lot of flavour in the dish and the cheese on top of it was delicious! Worth getting again.

ROASTED B.C. HALIBUT- this was my least favourite dish, the halibut wasn't really moist so it wasn't cooked to perfection. TBH it was a little dry. It was lacking in sauce, but the sauce that was at the bottom of the plate had a strong yet tasty seafood flavour. I assume that was from the pieces of squid in the dish. If we weren't so full we probably would've asked for more sauce to drench the fish in. Didn't finish this nor would we get it again.

Service was good, atmosphere on patio was nice on a summer night and the place was packed, recommend you make reservations! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Had dinner and caught up with some undergrad friends here. Beautiful dining space with rustic wooden tables lit by simple chandeliers. Service/staff were efficient and attentive, and very helpful in describing and recommending menu items. I selected the bone marrow and the spaghetti all'amatriciana, as well as the negroni sbagliato. Everything arrived elegantly plated. The marrow was rich and savoury with nice zest/herb aromatics, perfect atop of the toasted slices of bread they came with; I only wish it came with more. For the amatriciana: the spaghetti noodles had a substantial and pleasant bite to it, and the sauce was a lovely balance of the tartness of the tomato against the guanciale---personally I would've liked a little more heat from the chili but it was very enjoyable nonetheless. Overall, my group enjoyed the entire experience. I hope to see their wild boar bolognese dish return to their menu the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Service was personal and waiters pay attention to details. It's all about the details when it comes to a dining experience!

First I had was a cocktail, I asked for a sweeter taste and a fruity flavour, what the waiter recommended what exactly what I wanted.

The salad wasn't too heavy in terms of taste or serving. All the plates were served all about the right time. I really loved their bone marrow! A must order!

They change their menus every month to keep the dishes and materials in season so some dishes you see on Yelp reviews sometimes wouldn't be on the menu when you visit. 

The overall experience was wonderful so would love to recommend!"}
{"text":"Not over impressed with this place that I've had on my bookmark list for years. It really didn't seem like anything special. Had the famous burrata and roasted grapes on garlic toast and it was delicious, but got boring pretty quick. The spaghetti that they claim 'pays their rent' was just okay. Noodles were slightly starchy. Wouldn't order it again. Atmosphere was meh. Too dark and tables too close that it felt like you were either eavesdropping on the people beside you or intruding on their conversation by trying to have your own. No need to return."}
{"text":"This is my second time at campagnolo, and it's been several years since the last time. I remember being very impressed with all the food. This time my girl friend and I ordered olives, the beef tartare and the bone marrow as apps and the lamb gnocchi, all to share. 
 
Everything was great and the waiter was very friendly, but after our apps were finished, there was a 35 min wait for our gnocchi. It was fairly busy but the waiter never once stopped by to explain the long wait, nor did he apologize when he finally did bring our gnocchi.  

The food was still great but that did leave a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Despite the attention and the awards, my experiences have been disappointing.

I hate to be \"that guy\" who gives Campagnolo its first [gasp] 2-star rating, but I was disappointed. I also don't think I've ever read so many negative reviews for a place and still see 3-stars and above being dished out left, right and centre. For me, it's not that Campagnolo is bad by any means, but it's just that it falls into the \"meh, I've experienced better\" category.

Between my dining mates and myself, we've felt that the dishes were generally bland and underwhelming. I wish I could be more descriptive, but it's been about a year since I last attended and can only remember the impressions formed by me and my dining mates.  

The serving sizes also tended to be small and unfilling, even when paired with appetizers. Our server was appropriate but service was slooow. And finally, the decor seemed rather inconsistent (i.e., the bar and kitchen area seem really well done, but old traces of the Coffee Time still permeated with their linoleum flooring). 

Perhaps our experiences weren't the norm, but recent anecdotal experiences from friends haven't been particularly glowing either (for the same reasons), and so it may be a while before I return."}
{"text":"Update- Apparently, app's look small when your at a table with 7 of your bro's! with one babe the app's were huge, prosciutto again which was awesome, king crab leg app was amazing, as was the squid. Tried the octopus main which rivals the octopus at Enoteca, save for the chorizo which just wasnt that awesome (compared to the amazing octopus). Overall there wasnt one bad thing on the menu and i cant wait to return"}
{"text":"Came here for our 11 year anniversary on Friday June 26th. Delicious food. Notable items: 

Appetizers: smoked trout, burrata cheese (truly amazing!) 

Mains: spaghetti. Incredible.  Our leg of lamb was okay -- not excellent. 

Cocktail: Kaiser Soze was delicious!  Smokey yet light. 

Service was amazing.  Our server was gracious, friendly & warm.  

Atmosphere. It was a cool, windy evening & because all the windows were open, we were COLD! My hubs ordered a tea to keep warm.  Otherwise, it's such a lovely room.  In the winter, it's cozy & romantic. It was my first visit in summer. The room was light & airy -- glowing with the sun setting. 

Also, there are some hot hottie guys serving & keeping bar... Eye candy!  

Would love to sit at the bar next time to watch the kitchen team work. Food presentation is lovely without  getting too precious."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Saturday April 28th. My husband and I along with our friends, another couple, were greeted and seated at a six-top. Knowing that modern restaurants sometimes do the communal seating thing, I took a second look at the table and wondered if we would be getting two strangers sitting down later (which we didn't want). The hostess disdainfully asked if something was wrong; I asked if we were going to be joined by a two-person party later. She rolled her eyes and said no, and walked away. Kind of rude, but our waiter was fine and I was there for the food anyway.

The food we ordered was overall amazing, especially the much-discussed burrata with grapes and the salted caramel pudding. The latter was served, upon request, in four small cups so we could split the portion. Spaghetti all'Amatriciana was also really memorable; it had a nicely rounded yet garlicky bite and was one of the best pasta dishes I've had recently. We had a bottle of wine, four appetizers, two mains, and two desserts, which was plenty for four people. Came to around $250, which seemed reasonable.

The food was great, but there was one happening of note, and my review wouldn't be complete without it... 

At the next table over, two women were seated some time after we began our seating. One of the women placed her jacket on her chair and went to the restroom. A moment later, we smelled something burning. When my female friend and I looked around, we quickly saw the source - it was the woman's jacket, which she had accidentally placed on her tableside candle! The flames had consumed most of the sleeve, and the fire was growing quite rapidly. Somehow her companion failed to notice it, and my friend and I immediately grabbed our own water glasses and doused the flames. In such a small restaurant, everyone -- patrons, waitstaff, bartenders -- noticed the commotion. 

Amazingly, the women didn't thank my friend and I (or even acknowledge it, like, hey, thanks for putting out that fire I started!), but what actually kind of peeved me was that our waiter gave us a casual \"thanks\" and then rushed two complimentary flutes of champagne to the women. I believe the manager also apologized to them as well. But we weren't sent over any shots, drinks, desserts, apps, or anything at all from the restaurant. In fact, we then had to wait about five minutes for the waiter to refill our water glasses. I understand giving the women the champagne to brighten their evening and soothe their annoyance, but I was surprised that we weren't sent anything by the manager or even properly thanked."}
{"text":"Came here for a date on a friday evening with a reservation. We arrived 15 min early, unaware the restaurant didn't officially open till our reservation time at 6pm. Nevertheless, the host greeted us, politely explained the situation and gave us seats off to the side until our table was set up. And what a romantic scene it was, with candle lighting strewn across the rustic wooden tabletops. All the service staff were very pleasant---attentive without being disruptive/intrusively persistent, and very warm mannered. They checked on us on occasion, wordlessly and efficiently keeping our dining surface clean, utensils exchanged, and cups filled with water.

But the food--- man was I impressed. We ordered roasted bone marrow and the highly recommended spaghetti all'Amatriciana. Both were extremely delicious, but the roasted bone marrow with oxtail marmalade was deeply memorable. Sidebar: I had recently visited BlueBlood looking for their highly-raved-about bone marrow only to be secretly devastated that in their menu revisions, they decided to remove that actual marrow from the dish and only serve tartare in the otherwise empty hull of a marrow---an upset and travesty. Campagnolo's bone marrow offering filled my my stomach, heart, and soul and is a must-order. Each bite a moment's blissful of unctious, savoury, and crunchy. Deeply and decadently satisfying.

The spaghetti certainly lived up to its preceding reputation. Slightly spicy and very pleasant mouthfeel: slight chewy, perfectly al dente, and full of tomato flavour punctate with bits of lovely pork. Deceptively filling. 

Overall 5/5, I would 100% recommend this place to anyone. All the attention to detail made the entire evening very memorable."}
{"text":"Cocktails! Came here with a fine group of yelpers for some family style Italian cooking, but who knew that they had such an enchanting cocktail list? There were some real classics on their list too: a pair of his and her manhattans, a sazerac, and a killer option called the bulleit maple sour. Get this. Bourbon and whisky afficionados will adore this cocktail collection. I'm drooling just thinking about it.

Anyway, let me put my drink down and get on with it.

Campagnolo is a gently-lit enclave (at Dundas West and Euclid) with a sparse yet rustic look. Mostly tables for four and a few long tables for groups, there is a congenial and warm atmosphere about the place.

The menu changes frequently. On my first visit I shared a shit-tonne of deliciousness with my partners in Yelp including a pretty solid sea breem, a great wild boar on polenta and a passable papardelle. And a lot of us in the group were pleased with the Burrata Cheese and Roasted Grapes appetizer. A simple idea pleasantly executed.

My second visit was also pretty strong. Two of us shared crispy and flavourful testina in a tart vinagrette and a buttery duck rillette piled high on crostini. Both fabulous. For dinner she got the Eggplant Parmesan and I grabbed the steak and potatoes. I didn't try the eggplant[1] and my meal was fine. I wasn't wowed by the steak (and it was so thin that in places it was overcooked) but the potatoes were splendid. Four potatoey prisms the thickness of Vegas dice. I enjoyed them a lot.

Good on you, Campagnolo. See you again soon.

Obligatory Title Pun: Campag-YO-lo.

Menu Readability: Well laid out but Times Roman?

Need to mention: Rumour has it that they might be installing a patio and garage door this summer, but you didn't hear it from me.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm a cock of all 'tails.

[1] Fun Fact: I'm allergic to eggplant."}
{"text":"I have only been to Campagnolo twice in the last few years but both experiences have been seriously dreamy. Birthday celebrations both, I feel confident recommending this place for special occasions in particular. The food and service have been consistently high level without pretension, and basically just: yum. 

Most recently I visited with a group of nine. Booking in for the Chef's Table experience was a treat and made the whole night super seamless. Recommended for groups over six, they check in on dietary restrictions once everyone's seated, and have no issue modifying many of the dished to be vegetarian. Can't speak to vegan but I think at least a few things could be modified in that direction as well. 

Everything came out delicious and I'm having a hard time saying which was best. Was it the burrata with roasted grapes? Was it the radicchio salad with creamy garlic dressing?  Was it the corn cappelletti with chanterelles and hazelnut? Was it the perennial classic spaghetti all-Amatricana? I think the winner might be the vegetarian-modified Pork Copa. While half our party included the pork in theirs, half of us marvelled at how \"meaty\" the dish tasted sans meat. Slow roasted parsnip melon and chestnut, when consumed together, somehow accomplish all the rich, juicy, earthy, umami goodness I could need or want. Would go back just for this any day. 

Top the night off with great people, many bottles of great wine, and the perfect little bite-size dessert with a candle for the birthday babe, and you've got a night for the books."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this spot but was quite disappointed. Servers seemed nervous or out of it, food was mediocre at best, and the music choice was very odd."}
{"text":"Loved the burrata - would come back for just that! Other dishes were good but the show-stopper was definitely the burrata! 

Didn't love the dessert (salted caramel budino)

Service was great - we were a large group and they accommodated various dietary restrictions and sped up the meal for us as we needed to catch a show afterwards."}
{"text":"I went to Campagnolo for the first time on my birthday. We were greeted at the door and were immediately sat at our table. Fantastic customer service from the host and waitstaff. 

Our food came to us family style which I absolutely loved, not to mention that every single dish was amazing. I could continue and explain each dish, and how it was the best mix of flavours and ingredients but it's just not necessary. You just need to trust the Chef, and know anything that comes out from that kitchen will be absolutely delicious. 

Their small intimate restaurant is a perfect place for a romantic dinner, or for a group of friends. I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto with my folks, I came across this restaurant on Yelp and scored big. Campognolo is a great space with excellent service. The food was great! We shared the baked fontina cheese with red wine braised leeks. For our entrees we ordered the celery root agnolotti, the Ontario capon and the roasted Ontario lamb leg. They were all delicious. I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"The worst Italian restaurant ever. Not because of the service, but because of the food. I had better, and I think I can cook better than that. 

The question is.... How are they surviving in the Little Italy with that kind of food?

So bad, never gonna recommend to anyone. 

I had better. Really."}
{"text":"I think I pass by Campagnoloa few times before I knew what restaurant it was since they don't have a distinct signage, but it's always pack come dinner time (^_^)

 Limone $11
~ Lemon Infused Vodka, Basil Syrup, Lemon
Heard their cocktails are really good and I just couldn't resist to order one and this was so delicious. Look simple but it was packed with flavor, love it's not too sweet with intense basil and lemon. 
So Good !!!

Housemade Baguette & Gougeres $4
This was served warm, very pillowy soft and flavorful but wish it was complimentary for very table (no bread basket here)

Fresh Burrata Cheese w/ Roasted Grapes & Toasted Bread $14
The Burrata is very refreshing and light and the Roasted Grapes are just devine together pair with this lighter flavor cheese

Roasted Bone Marrow w/ Oxtail & Plum Marmalade $13
I think this is a good intro to bone marrow if you have never had it before, instead of just the intense fatty goodness, it's brighten up with the soft and tender oxtail whereas the plus sauce freshen it up and cutting the fattiness. This was bone licking good.

Pappardeli w/ Rabbit & Charterelles $20
Nothing beats homemade pasta, the eggy goodness with the tender rabbit and flavorful earthy charterelles mushrooms is just perfect.

Housemade Spaghetti All'Amatriciana $18
This definitely showcase clean honest simple flavors, the pasta cooked al-dente and the sauce with a bit of a kick to it which I love.

 Salted Caramel Budino
The budino aka the pudding is way too sweet for me but I did love the crunchy toffee... should have skip dessert and maybe order another cocktail instead ;)

Verdict :
Great Simple Food, Perfectly crafted Cocktails & Easygoing Wine list
With a frequently changing menu, I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Campagnolo serves up rustic, unpretentious home-cooking in the corner of Dundas and Euclid Ave. Without any distinct signage, it's quite easy to walk right past the place.

From the menu that night, I ordered:

House-made baguette and gougères: I'm not very used to paying for bread, but these were pretty nice. The center was very light and airy. I personally liked the baguette more, and it was delicious with the accompanying chive butter.

Local burrata cheese with roasted grapes and toasted bread: I really enjoyed the toasted bread with the touch of extra virgin olive oil. The roasted grapes were delightful and provided a sweet counterbalance to the cheese and bread. However, the biggest problem that I had was that the creamy cheese was exceedingly rich and it was hard to eat too much of it on its own.

Summer squash arancini with Telaggio cheese, served with a tomato sauce: Again, there was too much cheese for me. Normally, I would never complain about too much cheese, but the combination of the risotto, squash and cheese made this deep fried concoction overly heavy, particularly after the previous burrata course. At this point, I really wished I had ordered a lighter salad of some sort. 

House-made Spaghetti with Bottarga: the spaghetti was cooked al dente and had a real bite to it, which suited my preferences quite perfectly. The sauce had bright, wonderful flavours. This was my favourite dish of the night.

I love Italian food, so I really wanted to like this place. I thought the spaghetti was really delicious. However, on the balance, I really can't say that I enjoyed the menu of the night. Perhaps my food choices weren't very well thought out, but I was disappointed that there was only one pasta dish that night."}
{"text":"For a nice weekday dinner, I decided to join some of my fellow yelpers who were heading over to Campagnolo.  Campagnolo is a small Italian restaurant that opened up quiet recently and the reviews have been pouring in of great food in a little cozy setting.  The decor right away when you walk in is warm and friendly, but at the same time elegant in its own way.

We had a table for 6 and ordered drinks once most of us has arrived.  I ended up going for a light beer/lager called Castello.  The waiter said it's a popular choice, so why not right?  The lager was alright, nothing special to be honest in my opinion.  But the menu looked incredibly tempting and we decided to order and share so we can all taste as many items as possible.  If you're heading over, this might be a very good idea as the menu is a little on the expensive side.  And the ingredients they use are a little different, so you would want to try as many dishes as possible.  

There are a fair number of dishes we ordered and a few of them stood out for me.  For the appetizers, I liked the Fresh Burrata Cheese and Roasted Grapes with Toasted Bread.  Sounds simply, but it tasted great.  Also, I'm starting to see more and more dishes where grapes are getting involved; can this be a little trend?  Nonetheless, it was a good choice.  For the mains, I liked the Monkfish which was deep fried.  I know I'm horrible, deep fried Brian? But the taste was good.  The Pappardelle with peas and lemon was for me a surprise but definitely welcomed.  It was a great little dish.  And last, I'm a little mixed... see I liked the Sea Bream as I think that was cooked well and all the ingredients worked.  But I too liked the Wild Boar.  The reason I'm mixed is... if you're that type of eater that wants to try something new and different, then I would say go for the Sea Bream.  If you're not of that variety, then the Wild Boar would be a familiar taste that you may expect more.  And who doesn't like something that's familiar right?

Overall, I would have to say I did like Campagnolo.  But for me, it's a little too expensive for my regular preference.  The food is cooked well but in terms of portions size, the dishes are small.  So my recommendation might be to go to Campagnolo for their cocktails as they have a great list.  And maybe order a dish or two to nibble on while enjoying the atmosphere.  It's nice and cozy and a good place to unwind with your date over drinks."}
{"text":"I went here just after Christmas so I didn't think I'd be able to stuff myself anymore with such rich foods - I was wrong. The only reservation we could get that night (this was a Thursday) was for 9pm. Because it was so late, a lot of their dishes had sold out for the night  (tip: reserve early!) but the foods we did end up ordering were simply amazing. I had ordered the 'Wild Boar, Spareribs, Tripe and Meatballs on soft Polenta'...didn't think I was a fan of tripe, but you can't even taste it in this meatball goodness. If there was a model for meatballs, I think they should use Campagnolo's as the model. It was thick. Juicy. Big. Melts in your mouth goodness (who knew I'd say that about a meatball!). My aunt ordered the 'House-made Spaghetti a L'Amatriciana', which if I could remember correctly (meatball brain!) had oysters and home-smoked bacon. This too was such a homey and rich dish. My cousin ordered the risotto, while it tasted pretty good I didn't think it was tooooo special (like the other two dishes). Portions were pretty big. They also have a a fully stocked bar, and lots of specialty cocktails available. Good selection of wine and beer as well. 

I don't even like Italian foods that much, but this place just gave me faith.
They change their menu every few weeks or so, so I think the only solution here is go. And go often."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here twice in the past, leaving with really great experiences. Food was done past our expectations, with enthusiastic servers making great recommendations. Of course, this led me to choosing Campagnolo for my girlfriends bachelorette this past Saturday. Trust me, if the server wasn't embarrassed - I definitely was for picking this restaurant. 

Looking at other servers, ours did not give a warm welcome, asked what we're celebrating (even though I made a reservation and clearly specified the purpose of the event) and did not give us much time to think about what to order. 

Feeling frustrated I told her we'd start off with two orders burrata cheese. She gave us the look and said \"oh?...\" and I immediately knew what she was thinking: \"Thats all you're ordering for 5 people?\" I had to explain we were ordering it to start while we decide further on what mains to order.

Once we were done with all of our food, she asked if we wanted dessert. As we had other plans after, we told her no thanks. She had this disappointed look and gave us the bill at the speed of lightning when we never asked for it yet. She then checked in two minutes later to see if we had all our cash ready to pay. 

I'm sorry - but this is not a fast food joint. It also wasn't the day for us to quickly eat and leave. Had it been like that we would've went elsewhere. Brought this up to the host and if they really wanted to fix it, they would've called me as my number was in their reservation system. From walking in through the front door, then leaving with a burst of happiness (sense my sarcasm), it was a total of 58 minutes."}
