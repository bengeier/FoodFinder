{"text":"5 of us met at Ausler's Grill last night for a business meeting and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We were warmly greeted at the door. Karen, was our server and she was wonderful - funny, pleasant and on the ball. The food was also great. I had the Citrus Salad with chicken added (karen's recommendation) and it was amazing with finely chopped apples, mandarin oranges, red onion, blue cheese crumbles and a poppyseed dressing. My companions had the salmon salad and quesadillas which they all raved about. We all really loved this place and having just found out it's locally owned makes me like it even more. I highly recommend this place."}
