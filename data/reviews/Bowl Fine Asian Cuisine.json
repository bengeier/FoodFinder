{"text":"The Food was tasty and fresh.

the Staff was very knowledgeable and could advise on what to avoid or what to choose for the group I was in that had a multitude of different diet restrictions, (no pork/no gluten/no dairy/no red meat) etc.

They replaced a friends drink that she ordered that she did not like w/out hesitation and was quick and clean.

(The menu is very mixed and some items are very good value while others a little pricey) but also considering this restaurant is not fast food and it's in the downtown core, it's to be somewhat expected.

I had a good time; but to each their own (per the other reviews I read here)"}
{"text":"I have a lot of problems with this restaurant so you can either take my word for it and just avoid this place at all costs or if want to get to the nitty gritty of it all then read on and let's get the show started.

First off: THE FOOD SUCKED! THE most bland (and nearly the most expensive takeout) food I've ever had in my life. I paid $15 for a \"Bun Tom Cha Gio Chao Tom\" whatever that is and all I got was a side of vermicelli noodles, ONE medium sized shrimp (or as they called it \"Char Grilled Jumbo Prawn\", and this tiny piece of plasticy substance that happened to be wrapped around a sugar cane (it was supposed to be shrimp). It came with a \"salad\" and a single 2 inch spring roll! Yeah it was THAT small (that's what she said). NOTHING was seasoned, no sauce, no nothing, absolute waste of $15, I wouldn't even pay $5 for what I received!

Now onto rant part #2: Reading their menu is like reading an Ikea instruction manual, takes forever to understand and finally provides you with no good information! It took me 10 minutes to just read through it once to see what they offered and I unfortunately wasted another 10 minutes trying to decide from this vastness of crap what I'd want for dinner! 

And onto rant part #3: I still understand what this place is called, on the menu it says \"Fine Asian Bowl\".. their website is www.bowlasian.com and on their website they call it \"Bowl Asian Fine\" MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

Don't waste your time and money on this place."}
{"text":"Located close to Yonge-Dundas Square. Was more of a fancier version of your usual Thai/Viet places. Little bit overpriced for the same food that I know I can get anywhere. Service was great, but it was bizarre how the waiter asked me at the end if we were coming back ever again."}
{"text":"Hmm, i guess i beg to differ.
i have been here countless times, and that says a lot because i'm picky about my food. really picky --

every time i've eaten here, i pick something new from the menu, and i've enjoyed it a LOT. :)

it's decently priced, for a \"pan- asian\" place in toronto where it's the home of \"mash up\" asian cuisine places that serve all the south asian cultures of food (i.e. thai, viet, malay, all in one)

selection is huge, menu is huge, so yes it does take time to decide what you want --

the place is cute and small enough to bring a date
~ $30 / person -- drink, app, and entree.

recommended --
- homestyle salmon in a pot
- grilled chicken bun
- anything stir fried with prawns (their cooks know how to capture the \"chi\" of the wok in this style of cooking)
- tom yum soup is pretty good
- coconut soup is pretty good too
- the AVAOCADO BANANA milkshake is AWESOME
-fried banana dessert is yum and not too huge
but their pho is tiny. 

and food is good for the price you pay for a nice clean simple atmosphere in the area. 
i digg it. :)"}
{"text":"I will add myself to the like side of these reviews. I have been to this place many times and have always had good food.

The menu is large ...true. However if you frequent Asian restaurants often you will have no problem. Every thing is categorized very well, so once you know what you want (IE Bun, Soup, Rice etc) you should have no problem.

I find the value very good for what you get.

If you are getting take out. It can be tricky with the larger bowls. The take out containers are not large enough for what you get. Best to have a larger bowl on hand at home to transfer soup to.

My Fav is the H01 Hu Tieu Ga Super Bowl ($7.25) ...a very large bowl of soup that has the tastiest broth. ...lots of liquid, so I don't recommend getting a drink with it.

I also always start with the KR05 Shredded Pork Krystal Rolls (2) $4.25 ...a very good roll that comes with Hoisin Sauce for dipping ...yum

The only bad thing that I could say about this place is that at times the service can be a little slow. Typically they only have one wait staff on. Not a problem most times, but the place can get busy fast. Even so well worth the wait."}
{"text":"STAY VERY FAR AWAY.  Horrible food.  Tried three different things on the menu hoping to find something authentic.  Wontons could have been made with tortillas.  Satay tasted dipped in peanut butter.  Ginger beef may not have been beef at all.

Definitely not worth the time or effort.  I walked two blocks in the snow because my frequently flier program said they gave miles for going there."}
