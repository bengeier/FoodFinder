{"text":"The food is consistently fresh and yummy. I always get the teriyaki chicken. We love it and are repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Visited a few times over the course of a year and the food quality has consistently gone way down.  Before, the chicken katsu had plump, juicy pieces of white meat chicken.  I remember the first time I said out loud 'Wow! I've never seen so much white meat in katsu before.\"  I loved it!  Their rice was always on the dry side but that chicken katsu made up for it.  The spicy poke was also a winner.  I went there a few days ago and you can tell they've cut corners on quality.  Chicken wasn't as moist and kind of on the dry side with hardly any white meat showing.  Poke is a big disappointment with smaller fish cubes and more filler (onions, sauce, etc.).  The only consistent thing about this place is that the rice (white or brown) is still super dry.  So annoying with the dry rice all the time.  I hope the quality comes back like it was before.  As of now, you're better off going to L&L down the street at Russell."}
{"text":"Makai is absolutely delicious their creamy sesame salad dressing is to die for tasty! I love their large portion sizes. I go there at least twice a week."}
{"text":"Ono food.. Best of all great prices...!! Poke is what keeps us coming back for more. Only draw back is that everyone loves their poke as much as we do so it goes fast...! One plus is they make the poke 2 a day and food is always fresh..!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Makai, u should rush right on over and hit them up.  The food is fantastic, and I don't say that lightly.  Lived in Hawaii for 11 years and Makai brings back memories of some of my favorite hole in the walls that serve up great Hawaii food, not the chain store Hawaiian food, you know who u r (L&L).  Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with L&L, but the food here is much better."}
{"text":"This is some Delicious Hawaiian Food , I recently tasted in Las Vegas .. I was amazed with the amounts of Foods, I was getting for the price I paid for. The Team at Makai were super friendly and helpful !!  Mahalo !! The Poke was perfect"}
{"text":"Was craving Chicken Katsu and really didn't want to cook. Ordered from Makai based on the reviews and am pretty happy with my order. I chose the Mochiko chicken wings as my 2nd meat - never had it before - and yum. Of course, that meant I didn't get as much katsu as I would have liked, but what I had was pretty good, crispy and still moist. Down side, they didn't pack any sauce and didn't mention it. So I don't know if you're supposed to grab a container or ask. 
The staff behind the counter were really friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be going back again...maybe a large order next time"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is extremely tasty and always consistent! I have tried their Teri chicken, mochiko chicken, Kalua pig and Hawaiian poke. All very yummy!  They don't offer much, but what they do offer is delicious! A definite must try for everyone! The workers and the Hawaiian music they play, definitely makes me feel like I'm at home in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to grab a quick bite in Vegas! Relaxing island atmosphere, great music, friendly staff and consistently good authentic Hawaiian food. Set up like Chipotle, you choose your size plate, meat and sides. I get the Onoer (small plate) white rice, Chicken Katsu and corn. The chicken is delicious, panko fried, always juicy and tasty. Don't forget the tangy spicy Katsu sauce for dipping.... delicious! Hubby goes with the teriyaki chicken, spicy poke, and rich Mac salad. You can't really go wrong with their menu! There is often a line, so don't be in a hurry, you'll want to enjoy your food on island time!!"}
{"text":"So me and my girl were craving something flame. And we stumbled upon this fine establishment, and I have to say the service was excellent, and the food was superb. I had a kanak attack right after. Must try the mochiko chicken straight fire!!!!"}
{"text":"Can you say YUMMY! I get this about 3 times a week. It's close to my office and I just can't get enough."}
{"text":"Bowls are pretty good and price is reasonable! However when you order certain things, they might do additional charges.."}
{"text":"Large plates are very filling. Katsu chicken, Mac salad etc. everything good. Hard to choose between here and Island flavor on Durango."}
{"text":"I ordered the Ono'er with the steak and mochiko chicken. The steak was $1 extra. You have a choice of white or brown rice and 2 sides. I chose brown rice, mac salad and garlic edamame. When I asked if I can add the poke as well, he said I would have to remove one of my other items. I don't understand why I couldn't get the Ono'est, which was a choice of 3 items, but whatever. I ended up buying a 1/2 lb of the poke instead and they ran out of the seared poke.

The chicken was tasty and so was the steak, but the temperature on the steak was just warm and it got cold fast. The rice was a little hard, so I didn't eat too much of it. The garlic edamame had a good flavor, but I think it needed to be cooked just a little longer. The poke was good, but I heard the seared poke was better. I just wish they made some. 

I really wanted to like this place because it's local. I may go back and give it another try. We'll see."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place. So we finally had the chance to go tonight. By my star rating you can see that we were extremely disappointed. We got there at 8pm, which is an hour prior to closing. I wanted to get a couple of plates with Ahi Poke, but the guy at the counter said they normally run out of poke before 8pm. So we had to scratch that. Then I tried to order a plate with the Pulehu Chicken and again we were shut down with \"I'm sorry we ran out of the Pulehu Chicken too.\"  But the cook behind him was grilling some chicken. So whatever. I figured I would give it a chance and taste the food cause I'm sure it would taste good. Again, I was wrong. I got the Ono'er with teriyaki steak and mochiko wings. The teriyaki steak tasted like beef jerky from being in the warmer and the chicken wings tasted like plain fried chicken. I've tasted way better mochiko chicken than that. Well as you can see I don't think we would eat here again."}
{"text":"I have been a regular since they have opened and loved this place until tonight. Came in no Poke then no teriyaki Steak. Really!  Come on... out of 2 items!! Then the guy ringing up my order doesn't wait for the entire order to be finished being put together and placed on a tray runs my card then has to run it again for the rest. I am so frustrated ! The prices have gone up and portions have gotten smaller. Need to weigh portions so you stay consistent with the protein. Not going to come back for a while. Tonight's crew seems to be in a rush to get out and not really care about customer service."}
{"text":"One of the best, fast, inexpensive lunches. I always get the small. Comes with a protein, rice and side. My favorites are the Katsu or teriyaki chicken thighs. With the garlic edemame. Yum. $5.40 including tax. They earn the 5th star on cleanliness. Keep it up! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is the best Hawaiian food I've had -- better than the Hawaiian food I've had in Hawaii!
I got the Ono'est (large) plate with three meats and two sides and tried the Mochiko Wings (amazing), Kalua Pork (excellent) and Teriyaki steak (delicious).
For sides, I tried the garlic edamame and Kimchi Slaw, and both were great.
I will be coming here often!"}
{"text":"This place use to be a great place to eat.
It was a bargain too. But unfortunately, it seems like they are falling into the same thing a lot of restaurants in this town fall into. A few months back, they raised the price on all of the items while giving smaller portions. They started to change the ingredients to save money and the food quality took a hit also. Two big red flags. Everything became overly salty. Even after this I decided to give them another shot thinking that maybe I just came at a bad time. But the food portion was even smaller and didn't taste as good as it tasted the previous time. My chicken was way over cooked and the steak was tough and hard to chew. And I don't know if it's just me, but their customer service took a serious hit recently, they use to have very good customer service, being somewhat of a regular, I stopped seeing familiar friendly servers, and seen them replaced with severs who don't seem to know what they are doing. Or even care about what they are doing for that matter. That's three big red flags. It sucks because I really enjoyed the food here and the atmosphere. I'm giving two starts because I'm hoping they can change back before it's too late. I may give them another shot sometime in the future. But if everything is the same as it is now, I'll have to take this place off of my go to list."}
{"text":"Makai is an average \"fast food\" restaurant. From the food to the service, it is just average. If you don't get the food right when it is hot off the press than you may be disappointed. They do give very generous portions of the chicken katsu which is always a positive. I don't like that their edamame is always cold. A few times that I have got their edamame it is also wayyyyyy under cooked and seemingly uneatable. I would give this place a try if you are looking for some island food in the southwest. There are definitely better options but if you live in the neighborhood it is convenient."}
{"text":"When this place opened I was excited as its right around the corner from my house. I have been there quite a bit since it is so close to me and was really good. 

Sadly, my visit today was horrible. I have noticed before that the employees don't wear gloves and didn't bother me until today when the girls hand touched a good amount of my food. Major health violation, considering sometimes the people who cashier also help pack the food. Perception is everything and even if she just washed her hands- I didn't see that so I am left to assume she hadn't. 

When I got home I looked at my poke as I ordered a pound. The color was off because of the oxidation but when I took one piece you could immediately tell it was not good.  To me it tasted a little old so I spit it out. I had my husband try and he said they changed the product and the quality.

I called because the other visits were so good with the exception of one visit where the rice was hard. I asked to speak with a manager or owner... I basically explained my disappointment and asked only for a refund on the poke (not my whole meal) stating that I could bring it back so they can see that we didn't eat it. He declined the refund after noting they did change products and were changing back next week but that this was still a nice product. I told him if they truly believed it was good then they wouldn't have a reason to change back to the original. I told him that was fine, if he didn't want to refund me since it's not good and the product I had several times before that he has lost a customer. As a business owner I would think you would want to keep you customers but since they are a fast food style place they can't grasp that concept. He said we can't start doing refunds on poke as if they plan to continue to serve a bad product. 
Generally, I like to give my business to small business / local owners because they are trying hard to succeed but maybe that's not the case and they feel they've already made the big time."}
{"text":"Great food.  Got it to go they didn't put the Mac salad in a separate container so it got warm by the time I got home, maybe you have to ask.  Had the pork.  It was good not exactly like I had in Oahu.  The macaroni salad was still good even though it wasn't cold.  Nice to have a Hawaiian sun again!"}
{"text":"Disappointed on the reviews. Portions are small and pricey, if you want steak it's an additional $1 for poke additional $1.25. It is practically a fast food place, everything is in a warmer. I had the mochiko chicken and teriyaki steak that was over cooked. Workers don't look energetic. Doubt I'll make the long drive to come here again."}
{"text":"First time we went there they had run out of poke so we left.. Went back the next day and poke was great.. After that we kept getting poke that tasted like it had been frozen and tasted starchy so we never went back. Also the staff don't wear gloves"}
{"text":"Aloha, the food was so so. I ordered the large plate with 3 choice with white rice that was hard. And it seems like it was from the bottom of the rice pot. The portions were real small for price. The steak and poke was  extra $ for each one which they should have added more. It was like a mini plate not worth paying extra  $.  But the Ahi Poke was ok."}
{"text":"Very happy with this quick Hawaiian spot !! They have poki !!!! Wich they make fresh everyday and is really yummy :) the staff is very friendly and welcoming ."}
{"text":"Love this place great food perfect customer service , the Ono plate is perfect for a quick bite! Not too much but not too little :) Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Awesome meal. Exceeded our expectations. The place was clean, spacious, and bright. The service was great. And we loved everything we got: 1) salad with poke, teriyaki steak, and kimchi slaw; 2) ono'est bowl with mochiko wings, kahlua pig, poke, mac salad, and rice. Can't wait to go back soon."}
{"text":"Makai is seriously so ono! I ordered the Ono'est, which contains 3 meats, 2 sides. My order had the chicken wings, katsu, and spicy poké. My favorite part of the dish was the spicy poké and rice! Staff is friendly and hawaiian reggae is bumpin'. Will definitely come back recommend others to try this place out!"}
{"text":"We ate here a week ago. I remember big portions for the price and the crispy chicken katsu. The sauce was great. The steak was a little on the extra chewy side. I wish we lived by this place or this would be our new \"Chipotle.\" 

Pros: price, big portions, chicken katsu, sauce
Cons: faraway from me"}
{"text":"When you're in Vegas definitely check out this place. Everything is really good. My faves are ahi poke, puleho beef, kimchi, and teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"One of the great things about being from Hawaii and living in Vegas are all the ono food options.  Usually we hit up L&L when we want plate lunch, but I'd seen the great reviews on Yelp for Makai and since it's close to home I wanted to try it.  We got the chance today on the way home from Wet n Wild.  I got the Teri chicken and the rest of my family got the kalua pig and poke.  The food was so ono (as evidenced by no pictures, we devoured it) and very reasonably priced.  Plus the staff were very nice and welcoming.  You can bet we will be back."}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas from Hawaii and I got to say the food so Ono (taste good) no need Mac Salad. (JK) They got Mac Salad and it's good. On a serious note...you can tell they're all about the quality and the flavor. I also like the fact that you can get poke as a choice. The sauces is self serve so they don't nickel and dime you on extra sauce. I personally like the Katsu, pulehu steak and poke. They did run out of the Hawaiian poke so I just got to come earlier next time. Too bad they ain't close to where I live."}
{"text":"First time I got the ono'er size which is two sides and two meats. I got chicken katsu and spicy poke with sweet corn and macaroni as the sides. Everything was yummy, especially the poke. 

The second time I got the smaller size (Ono) because I knew I would get full. I got the teriyaki chicken and the macaroni again. I wish they would've sliced the chicken (I'm sure they would've if I asked). Again, the food was great. The meat was tender and juicy. 

The prices are fair and the portions are great. Definitely a nice spot to eat before a long day of errands."}
{"text":"Visited this place yesterday because of the positive reviews I've read on Yelp. My boyfriend and I both had the Ono'er bowls that came with two scoops rice. (White or brown) 

His pick: Mochiko chicken wings, pulehu steak, garlic edamame & mac salad.

My pick: Kalua pig, pulehu steak, kimchee slaw, & mac salad. 

We both liked that the mac salad had potatoes in it & for the portions of the food plus two drinks it was just under $21. 

The only thing that had me bummed out was that they ran out of poke & we got there around 1pm. But overall, the food was flavorful & the service was good. We'll be back again soon to hopefully try their poke!"}
{"text":"First time and I liked the place due to its cleanliness. The price is really decent and you can choose medium or large size combo."}
{"text":"This place is near my work so I often pick up lunch here. Service could use a bit of work (sometimes the employees are frazzled and the line gets backed up), but I understand that they've only been open for a few months so in time they'll improve. I like that the food isn't too heavy or greasy which can sometimes be the case when it comes to Hawaiian food. Definitely recommend the teriyaki steak and poke!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I've lived literally 3 minutes away from this place and never knew about it until just recently! I've eaten here 3 times in the last 2 weeks. (OOPS!) But what's a diet when you feel right back home in Hawaii?? The food seriously has that Island flavor and makes me feel like I just had a BBQ down at the beach.
Also, the atmosphere is amazing and the staff is always friendly and happy to be there. 

The only thing stopping me from giving a 5-star rating is that the first time I had the bbq chicken, it was a bit under-cooked. But, I ordered it the next time I went in and it was cooked to perfection.

Overall, this place definitely meets a Hawaiian's expectations!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and enjoyed the hospitality introducing the menu and when I sat and started eating  it took me back to the island  the kalua pork had a nice smoke flavor to it and the spicy pokè was the bomb tasting all fresh, munching on my garlic flavored edamame on the side was like a little treat for my taste buds  don't miss the opportunity to enjoy the same experience (liked it so much, came back the next day and ordered pokè by the pound, oh yes they do, do it' like that)"}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian food! Love their spicy poke and the combo portions are huge! Couldn't finish our food and was able to save it for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian BBQ in town. This place is awesome. It has a nice bin inside with good music. The food is delicious and much better than any Hawaiian BBQ I have been to. The price is not terrible either, it is less that $10 per person. I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great food for great value!!!! The Mochiko chicken is a must try. Very good crunch on the outside and subtle sweet flavor. The steak (essentially kalbi) was good and the poke was very fresh. They don't seem to cook up big batches of food to lay out under heat lamps all day so props for that! Also, they keep the furikake up by the register so don't forget to ask ;)"}
{"text":"It's brand new so the look is clean. I like how they have it set up & menu is easy.  I had the medium size. I chose 2 meats, pulehu & kalua pig, 2 sides, kimchee slaw & sweet corn.  Everything was tasty! I did not enjoy their brown rice because it was sort of wet. Maybe it was the juice from the sweet corn? The sweet corn to me seemed just like any other corn.  As long as the meats were tasty, I'll come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! 

I ordered the seared poke with kimchee slaw and macaroni salad. The poke tasted fresh and had a good flavor. The kimchee slaw was on point and wasn't too spicy. And the macaroni salad was also good, which had potatoes in it which was different, but went perfect with each other. 

I finally found a place that serves poke bowls with a decent price. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I came for the poke BUT they were out?! :( My boyfriend and I still got some food to try it...AND...it was so good!!! Tip to everyone: Apparently, if you get there before 6pm, poke will still be there. Definitely coming earlier to get my poke fix. Highly recommend, great quality food!"}
{"text":"This place is the Chipotle of Hawaiian food! 

I love me some Hawaiian food but it's generally a time commitment.  This place, however, is fast and straightforward.  You pick your size (ono, ono'er or ono'est, i.e. small, medium or large), proteins, base (white or brown rice) and your sides and you're done. They also have salads and a bowl (2 protein and one base).

For the proteins, I've tried the teriyaki, katsu and pulehu steak and chicken. The teriyaki is pretty basic but the pulehu was moist and tender.  I've yet to try the poke but it looks delicious.  Side note: beef items are $1.00 more and poke is $1.75 more).  As for the sides, try the kimchee slaw, it's soo good.  The mac salad is fine so, if you don't want to waste the calories on \"fine,\" try the garlic edamame or corn as well. 

My impatient ass will be back!"}
{"text":"love the food.  service is good.  menu is simple but it is good.  they have plenty of business so there is a decent turnover of food."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Quick great tasting food! easy yummy and affordable! thumbs up!!! Get the Hawaiian Poke and the wings are a must try! everything is delicious."}
{"text":"I like the poke and teriyaki steak. The poke is really the only reason I go here. For the other Hawaiian things, I would probably go to a different restaurant (preferably ohana). Katsu is incredibly fatty, so I tend to avoid it. Typically, it's quick and the staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, I have certain expectations of Hawaiian Food. The first time I had the food here I nearly died and gone to heaven because of the legit Mac Salad and savory Kalua Pig.  My favorites.  The Mac isn't just macaroni swimming in mayo which I appreciate.

The overall ambiance of the restaurant is clean, staff is friendly and happy to be there.... I've been back SEVERAL times.  I enjoy their Teri Steak (+$1.00 per serving) with salad and Creamy Sesame Dressing as well - when I don't feel like eating so much rice, I'll get a Bowl which is normally 2 scoops rice and 2 choices of meats, and I'll substitute one scoop rice for a side(+$0.30), where I'll get the toss salad. (*For some reason I love the sesame dressing on my steak too lol).

For anyone commenting about the $1.00 extra for steak being unnecessary- I mean hello? It's steak. A lot of other places do an up charge for certain fish or steak..... & the $1.25 extra for Poke. It's Ahi I mean duh. Seems people are being overly critical and picky.

This restaurant has only been open for about 6-7 weeks and although they are still learning, this family-owned restaurant is a fun and delicious place to get local food from management/owners who truly care about the food and their customer experience. I look forward to seeing them grow, improve and succeed."}
{"text":"Hits the spot and portions are perfect.   I got the Ono'er twice on both visits with poke and the taste is consistent.  The Kimchi slaw has a nice zest, not spicy and not too salty.  Definitely my new go to spot to fill island cravings!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday and absolutely loved it. I tried the teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, and the kalua pig with white rice and macaroni salad on the side. It was all delicious."}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu and the Poke is to DIE FOR!!!!

Wish there were more amont of food for the price but the quality makes up for it.

I would def no back again... and again... and... AGAIN!"}
{"text":"A really good lunch today.  Generous portions, well seasoned, authentic, tasty, and friendly service."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:  Excellent spicy and sweet sauces you can get for the Kalua pig (I'm a sauce fan, and on that note, you cannot get a good sweet sauce at a competitor of theirs, L&L.  All you can get at L&L is a barely sweet teriyaki that is the consistency of water, so I really appreciate Makai having a good sweet sauce.)  The chicken teriyaki is excellent.   The chicken itself in the Katsu is good (but see \"The Bad\" below regarding the Katsu sauce).  The garlic edamame is delicious.  Macaroni salad is tasty.  

Customer service here is great.  They try hard to make you happy.

THE BAD:  The Katsu sauce is very very \"ketchupy,\" Needs more flavors in it than that one.  The ketchup aspect is much too strong.  If it were not for that, they'd get a 5 star rating.  

Only other downside, if it even is one, is I wish they were open as late as L&L (til 10:00 p.m.)."}
{"text":"This place is like a Chipotle style order. Love the atmosphere! The portions are good and having to be able to choose poke as a protein made it better!

The first time I ate there I had the Pulehu Steak with Teri Chicken. I had the bowl which gave you 2 scoops of rice and 2 proteins. I would've chosen the poke instead of the chicken, but at the time the chicken looked ono.


It makes you feel like back home playing the island-style music. The people who work there are friendly. Hopefully they last long because they are a good place to eat when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"Fast food style had me skeptical at first but I decided to give this place a try. I had the ono'er with pork, teriyaki chicken, macaroni salad and sweet corn. The food was authentically Hawaiian and very reasonably priced. I had to wait in line for a while but it was worth the wait. I would come back. The menu is simple and the food is really good. The girl at the register was very nice."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The poke is amazing and there's outside seating of you like fresh air."}
{"text":"I ordered the katsu and teriyaki chicken with brown rice and Mac. The mac was good but honestly any kind of elbow pasta covered in mayo tastes good to me! So that was great, however, both types of chicken had fat on it that made it chewy so I had to pick some of it off. I wasn't a fan of the barbecue sauce either. It was very acidic for me. For the price though, I'd give it another shot, I'd definitely get the pig. My friend had the pig and it was by far the best thing so if I go back I'll try it. Our order was to go so I can't comment on the service."}
{"text":"I wrote a review for this place before and gave it a 3 star rating.   The reason for my review the first time was that the food was great but the customer service was horrible.   I didn't even get a hi, where the aloha spirit was, i don't know.   I still continued to go and it was the same and so I decided not to tip.  BUT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, it was a different story.  There was a girl who had her hair in a bun thru her hat who served me and an asian boy who was at the register and they both were very friendly and seemed appreciative that I was a customer.   This deserves 5 stars all the way.   Plus as always, the food is great.   Which is why I obviously continue to return.  I hope the other unfriendly people who worked there quit.   :)   Thanks for the smiles and the hello goes a long way.   Mahalos  !"}
{"text":"Ok so I LOVE Makai, I come here often as well as the one now on Lake Mead. I have to say this time I'm SUPER disappointed. Came here for the Poke and NO poke. Came here for the wings and had to wait 15 minutes for them to make it. Another guy behind me and asked for teriyaki chicken and they told him 20 minutes. Then when they finally made the plates they were skimp with everything, the teriyaki chicken because they barley had any. The sides were so small. I don't think I'll be back to this location!!!!"}
{"text":"The best kalua pork I've ever had! The teryaki chicken is great too. The poke is very fresh and flavorful. Staff very friendly. I hear they use recipes from the owners grandmother in Hawaii. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was a great carboload dinner the night before a half marathon. Poke was fresh and flavorful. They cooked up fresh Katsu so I didn't have to eat one that had been sitting there. It was perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The employees are super friendly. They felt bad for making us wait an extra 10minutes (even though we didn't say anything, or mind), and gave us an extra cutlet on the house. The pulehu steak was a little chewy but was flavorful nonetheless. My husband loved their corn and salad dressing.  I just wished they had one in SoCal. I'd be there all the time.  Loved that they were blastin J Boog."}
{"text":"Awesome. Staying on the strip and were at a local HS for a tournament. Super affordable, excellent taste and portions. Highly recommend the teriyaki chicken and the Ahi tuna."}
{"text":"Drove from the NW to try this place based on the reviews, and it was worth it.  The only reason I took off a star is because....out of poke...this was at 6p on a Tuesday.  I was really looking forward to it, so I was disappointed.  

The food was good though, I was not disappointed with my choices, which you choose a la Chipotle-style.  I chose the medium:

Base: white rice
2 Meat choices: Mochiko wings & teriyaki steak ($1 upcharge for steak)
2 sides: mac salad & garlic edamame

Only 3 wings came with the 2 meat combo, which I thought was disappointing, but thats all I really needed to be eating anyway...great flavor with the teri steak, the mac salad had potatoes in it, which I love, and the garlic edamame was super garlicky!! Poke wouldve been $1.25 upcharge, but they were out.

I'll go back again, just hope they have poke next time....and napkins! (I read a review that mentioned the lack of napkins anywhere...she was right!! I had to go to the counter to ask.)"}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed in the service this evening. My husband placed an order at 7:45am for pick up at 8:30 pm. Upon arrival, they informed him that they ran out of poke. Why couldn't they have informed him when placing the call instead of when he picked it up?  Bad customer service!"}
{"text":"9pm walk in to go order, they gave me samples, the place was clean and smelled of good food.  Staff was friendly and fast.

Spicy Poke is great.

Kalua Pig is just pig, no cabbage, wish they would put just a little, because the texture and flavor would be great.  Some places often put to much cabbage.

The Teriyaki Steak is good if you ask for a freah order off the grill, other wise its tough from sitting on the line. (9min wait for freah grilled)

Teriyaki chicken was okay, a little to over cooked... but still flavorful.

Ask for seaweed seasoning for your rice...

Edamame was good

The macaroni salad was average"}
{"text":"The owner of this place helped out my uncle when he was broke down on a desolate part of the 95.  On the strength of that alone I drove across town to check it out.   I was not disappointed! Best island food I've had in Vegas. My ono'er plate and poke was delicious. I will definitely be coming here more often.  And thank you for helping out family!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Machiko chicken was on point! Must try. Perfect texture and flavor BBQ! Mac salad was really good too. First time in here and will definitely stop in again"}
{"text":"Ive probably tried everything on the menu. Everythings toooo good. Its quick service and just like 2 mins away from my house which is awesome. The poke, macaroni, and wings together are sooo good"}
{"text":"Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Food, absolutely great. From ordering to transacting the process is fool-proof. The heroes behind the counter know exactly what they need to know in order to go above and beyond to make sure your meal(s) are just the way you want it! Poke so good I don't wanna leave! Next time you're in the area, I say give them a shot!"}
{"text":"GRINDZ, BRAH! Amazing hawaiian food fix with perfect portions! Choose your portion set up, choose your base (white or brown rice), choose your business (CHICKEN - teriyaki, pulehu, katsu, mochiko wings; PORK - kalua pig; STEAK - teriyaki or pulehu; AHI TUNA - regular poke, spicy poke) and choose your sides (garlic edamame, macaroni salad, sweet corn, tossed salad, kimchee slaw). 

We both ordered the ONO'EST (we were starving!) -- which came with 3 servings of meat, 2 sides and a base... and also chose almost the same exact options:

FOR HER: 
- white rice
- chicken katsu
- regular poke 
- teriyaki steak
- double mac salad
FOR HIM:
- brown rice
- chicken katsu
- spicy poke
- pulehu steak
- double make salad

Everything was extremely satisfactory. We both agreed the teriyaki steak was better than the pulehu (a tad bland -- he ended up dipping it into the teriyaki sauce), and that the spicy mayo based poke was better than the regular. But again, left satisfied & full, and we will definitely be returning! 

COMPLAINT: Why did a drop a star from my rating? My only qualm was it was not exactly a pleasant dining experience customer service wise. I can't help but state that every single employee seemed not only extremely unhappy, but never cracked a single smile and even answered every question with annoyance! I asked the guy what steak he preferred between the teriyaki and the pulehu, and all he did was open both lids and look at me blankly, clearly annoyed. The girl who rang us up kept glaring at me and even ignored me at times when she was ringing me up. 

It's just such a waste... such delicious food with horrible customer service. :P"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is based on catering.

After calling around to several other similar food locations, I came across Makai and looked on their website (and Yelp) for catering prices. They had an Ohana size and Regular size. To be sure, I called and spoke to Tony, the assistant manager, who kindly explained the sizes to me. 

I chose the regular size for an order of chicken katsu and the total came to under $55 including tax, which was a LOT better than other food chains. I paid over the phone, which was no problem and set a time for pickup. Tony also informed me if there were any other questions/concerns and that when the order was ready he would give me a ring.

The day of, Tony called me confirming that the order was for that day and told me it would be an extra 5 minutes so they could prepare my order, which was no big deal to me! I'd rather wait a little longer for fresh, hot food :-) Since the order was paid, I just had to sign my receipt and wait for the food. 

Once it was ready, an employee brought out my order with two small tubs of their katsu sauce and we were good to go! 

Thank you Makai for the awesome and efficient service! Will definitely recommend to those looking to feed a crowd within a decent budget.

On the day o"}
{"text":"Redemption at its finest!!

I think eating at a restaurant 3 times a week requires 5 stars. 

Everything about Makai is delightful!  The poke (when not spicy) is super refreshing and I am eager to have it in the 100 plus degree heat!  The chicken has a complete \"homemade\" feel, which justifies eating it multiple times a week! The macaroni salad is DANGEROUSLY good! (Coming from a non-potato/macaroni salad girl.)

So happy and lucky to have them so close to home!"}
{"text":"Someone told me about this place, I'm always looking for good food like back home. This place didn't disappoint me, had the medium size choice kalua and poke(Hawaiian) was ono they offered a sample mochiko chicken was soo ono... definitely telling more people about this place!"}
{"text":"Makai has the BEST Hawaiian food in the Valley.  It's delicious!  Their food is always fresh, it's family owned, local... it doesn't get much better than that!  I could go on and on about this place, but you really just need to try it for yourself.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place after seeing someone post a picture on Instagram. I looked at the Yelp reviews and they had a high rating. This made me want to try it. I had a two meat combo with chicken katsu and poke. It was delicious! The katsu was probably the best I've had. I would definitely recommend and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Hot & New!! Great place to go after working out! Friendly staff!! Waiting for their second location hopefully closer to strip!!"}
{"text":"I am from Hawaii and Makai Grill is the closest to the authentic cuisine of the islands!  Kalika pig, Poki, and macaroni salad is great with servings designed to not leave you hungry.  Limited menu choices but all done right--our favorite locals place in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Hawaiian food! This was our first visit to a Makai restaurant and we all absolutely loved it.  The teriyaki chicken and Kalua pork were perfect. My wife and kids had the Katzu chicken and loved it. On top of the great food, the owner and staff were very friendly and the service was second to none. The restaurant was clean and comfortable. We are so glad to have found our new go to Hawaiian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch for the first time truly disappointed. I asked for a salad with poke. When I got to the register I was charged for substitution of rice for an \"extra side\" so extra for lettuce instead of rice twice $0.30 x2  each plus additional $1.25 for Poke! So basically they're salad constitutes lettuce and some shredded carrots and two little cups of poke which cost me $10.60! I was better off going to a poke Bowl place where I get  more abundant choices of veggies and no extra charge for poke! Definitely won't be returning here for Poke Salad Bowl"}
{"text":"The kimchi slaw was good. All the meat was under cooked. It wiggled. Lots of veins and fat. The meat was terrible. :/ that's y I don't really order meat anywhere. Better off cooking it yourself."}
{"text":"Well, I saw this placed posted on Facebook. I read the reviews and looks at all those yummy pictures on yelp. Drive close to 20miles to this Russell location to get their 1hr 10min before closeing. Once in they mentioned they where out of all the meats but chicken. Really? That's so unprofessional on their part and a big waste of time. The thai house next door was fucking awesome though and they have several locations."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian plate lunch! I sampled their Katsu Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken, and what's this Poke! I had to also get the Spicy Poke! It came with their Brown rice and Mac Salad - I also tried their Kimchi Salad which was yummy!! Check out the photo. They even had Hawaiian Sun drinks! Overall everything was very tasty and authentic! (I've traveled for work to Hawaii for the last 20 years)."}
{"text":"I got a flyer in my door that I didn't even notice till later in the day and saw it was for Makai pacific island grill. .I looked over the flyer which was a menu and noticed it was Hawaiian food so right away I was elated. Then I saw they had Poke and I was sold. And to top all that off it was cloae to home!! Even better!!! I was gonna go eat Steak at a well known establishment but instead decided to try this new spot out. I have to say I am very happy that I made the choice I did.. it was as they say in Hawaii sooo Ono!!! The staff, which happened to be the owners, which happened to be 3 brothers from Hawaii, where very pleasant. The portion size was just right with the right amount of food. The price is also good. I highly recommend Makai and will be back. I will be telling people I know they have to try this place if they want Ono Hawaiian food!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, I would recommend this place.  The Ono'est is best, because if you want to sample-you get to choose from 3 meats.  I chose the Palehu steak, chicken Katsura, and BBQ chicken, with Mac salad and one other side plus rice.  My foil pan which they put the food on, weighed a ton-and I wasn't disappointed with the generous proportions.  It was all good and delicious and as they say in Hawaii - \"broke da mouth.\""}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after hearing about it on yelp recently with a friend. We were excited to hear about a place near us that has fresh poke

Came here on 02/15/16 (President's Day) and they were open. Lay out kind of reminds me of chipotle, with an area on the side sectioned off for the line, with seating in the middle. 

Menu is as follows

Choose your Size - Ono (Small - $4.99 - Base, 1 meat, 1 side), Ono'er (Medium - $6.99 - Base, 2 meats, 2 side), Ono'est (Large - $8.49 - Base, 3 meats, 2 sides), Bowl ($5.99 - Base, 2 meats), Salad ($7.99 - Romaine lettuce with cucumber, radish, wonton and glazed almonds, 2 meats, and choice of sweet onion, creamy sesame or ginger vinaigrette dressing)

Base - White Rice or Brown Rice (Add $0.50)

Meat - Chicken (Teriyaki, Pulehu, Katsu, Mochiko Wings), Pork (Kalua Pig), Steak - ADD $1.00 per serving (Teriyaki, Pulehu), Ahi Tuna - ADD $1.25 per serving (2 styles, one traditional hawaiian with limu, other with a spicy mayo sauce) 

NOTE: Below notes a style called \"Pulehu\" which means \"broil over a fire\" but it is a style of cooking with seasoning mix (salt, garlic, sugar, black pepper) and maybe other variations

Sides - Garlic Edamame, Grilled Veggies, Sweet Corn, Macaroni Salad, Kimchee Slaw

Since this was the first meal of the day, lets say breakfast at a lunch time, i opt'ed for the ONO'EST (large) for the most food to last me thru the day and to try more stuff. White rice, Kalua Pig, Pulehu steak (didnt realize it was additional charge until i was paying.. oops) and traditional poke (i like limu...), sweet corn and macaroni salad

My friend ordered first and he had ordered the pulehu steak as well.. and ran out. I had to wait for them to cook some new ones (steak cooks fast and easy anyway... came out med rare too ! perfect XD ! my friend was jealous...) oops :3 

Rice was a little on the drier side. Pre-made earlier on the day. 

Pulehu steak was seasoned well. Cooked well. Medium Rare. No sauces needed. 

Kalua Pig was flavored nice. A bit dry. But then again, the only thing i can compare it to was the actual kalua pig in hawaii during a luau from the pig... But id expect moister meat and not so shredded? 

Traditional Poke was.... traditional poke, with soy sauce, sesame sauce, green onions, onions?, and limu. A little \"Stronger\" in saltiness than i'd prefer but fresh and tasted nice overall

Sweet corn is ... sweet corn Lol XD 

Macaroni salad was like a normal mac salad but with cubes of potato too. 

Overall not bad. Prefer over like aloha kitchen strictly cuz i dont have to get teriyaki everything and get diabetes later... I like the option about NOT getting teriyaki and the pulehu seasoning is pretty decent, especially on the freshly cooked MEDIUM RARE steak.. Lol. 

Price at the end was like 11.50, which is a little pricey... wouldnt be so bad with additional $1 for steak and $1.25 for ahi poke... additional cost for steak i think is a little unnecessary. Ahi poke, may be a little more justified but the serving size is to a small sample cup =/ 

Good and convenient place in the area since the closest hawaiian place iirc is durango and warm springs (Ohana) or rainbow/hacienda (Boba Hut)..."}
{"text":"Makai is without a doubt my favorite place to have lunch during the week; it's perfect for a 9-5 because it's quick, simple & delicious. Think Chipotle but Hawai'ian inspired food.

Hands down the best Mochiko Wings in town!"}
{"text":"The food is quick and really solid, the people are nice, the portion sizes are good, and the price is right.  Poke and chicken teriyaki this time, but I'll try more next time.  It all looked solid."}
{"text":"You've probably read tons of awesome reviews from here so here's another one to convince you to visit.

Think of Makai as a \"Hawaiian Food\" Chipotle. You choose SM, MD or LG. White or brown rice. Meats, sides & you're done! The pulehu steak is my favorite, although the taste and texture is not always consistent. I've had it tender and cut medium sized and I've also had it tough and cut so small it's almost considered \"chopped\" steak. Chicken katsu is always fried perfectly. I also love their sesame dressing on the tossed salad. Definitely try the spicy teriyaki sauce and let your meal swim in it; it is that good.

Watch out if you're here for dinner. Once they're out of poke, they're out, that's it! So come here earlier to make sure you get it."}
{"text":"Just my opinion but the salad, side of kim chi slaw (mixed in the salad not on the side), meats the 2 poke of course, dressing, sesame if you want, with slaw mixed in, doesn't need it. Broke Da Mouth!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Loved all of the options. Everything tasted great and the service was friendly!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm coming back. The food was delicious and the prices are reasonable. Highly recommend this place. I dare you to try this place once and decide for yourself. Much love!"}
{"text":"It's a Hawaiian Chipotle! Family owned. Ordered the ono'er. 2 choices of meat, with 2 sides and spicy Ahi. Food is on point. Clean and neat restaurant. Definitely coming here again :) Aloha!"}
{"text":"A really great place to grab a quick bite! Service is quick and the workers are friendly. The food is already prepared and you order in the same way you would at chipotle! They offer three different sizes such as small,medium, and large. The food is great and the pokè is a must try! The only problem I would say is that they only have three meats that are included with the size prices and if you wanted to change to a different meat not included it's about 1-2$ more. However, the prices are still reasonable."}
{"text":"Good price for good quality!

One of my favorite things about this place is that they offer Ahi Poke as part of the meals. 

I ordered a \"Bowl\" which includes 2 \"meats\" and a \"base\" (white rice or brown rice). I had the Mochiko Wings, Seared Spicy Ahi Poke with white rice and ordered a side of Kalua Pig and paid about $10!

Everything was flavorful and tasty and they definitely have appropriate portions! 

4 stars because I'm particular about how rice is made (it was a little too \"sticky\" for me)."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and this is one of the first places I tried when I got here! It is hands down one of the best restaurants in the area! Fresh food at a great value! My whole family are fans! My favorites are the ahi tuna, teriyaki steak, brown rice, macaroni salad and the tossed salad with the sweet onion dressing! But honestly it is all good! The staff is great and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times were bomb or in Hawaiian pidgin language, \"Ono! Broke da mout!\" Lol... Spicy tuna and steak are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. It's the go-to restaurant for work for lunch. Everyone wants Makai. Portions are big. Service is great. Bring back the pink dressing for the salad though!!! Love Makai and will continue to be a frequent patron."}
{"text":"I like it, but I don't love it. Makai's second location is near-ish to my work, so I've been able to pop in a few times. Their pricing and portions are fair, and the ono'est (3 proteins, 2 sides) easily makes 1.5 meals at $10. But I'm not the hugest fan of their cafeteria-style layout where some dishes are sitting out for a while. When I've been, off peak hours, the wings are on the dry side and the brown rice is slightly gummy. Other than that, service has good attention to detail: I like how they check the chicken katsu for doneness when cutting it up, and have tossed out a couple of pieces that look questionably pink. I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"So history, I'm from Hawaii, and this type of food appeals to me, because it's similar to what they have in Hawaii. 

To the review. Once you walk in, there is local Hawaiian music playing in the background softly. The menu has a decent selection, and the prices aren't bad. 

The food cooked just behind the counter. It's sort of buffet style, they serve the food right in front of you, then you pay at the end and take your plate. It tasted good and the poke was delicious! Tables were clean, soda fountain was coke. TV had the olympics on. AC ofcourse. Worth a try if u want a taste oh Hawaii in Vegas ."}
{"text":"Big boy plates if u know what I mean. Basic menu rice, chicken,steak, Kailua pig, mochiko chicken. Two different varieties of raw fish( spicy, Hawaiian style) and some sides. The bigger your plate the more protein you get to pick. I enjoy the food very satisfying and flavorful. I comes atleast once a month or more for sure."}
{"text":"LOVE eating here, only good Hawaiian restaurant that I know in Vegas! Good service as well."}
{"text":"I had the ono'est size. Great portion. Food is always fresh and delicious. The vibes you get are authentic if you've lived or been to the Island. Customer service is great as well. This is one of my favorite spots for local style Pulehu. I would recommend anyone to check it out."}
{"text":"Spotted the gem on yelp and slapped a bookmark down on it.  The day would come when I was sort of in the area and would pay a visit.  A truly fabulous meal consisting of teriyaki chicken, Kalua pork, rice, and awesome mac.  I knew I would be back.

Days and months would pass when me and my buddy who had partaken in the previous experience would speak of how we needed to return.

That day would be today (01/25/17), when we would take the mild journey across part of the valley to visit again.

Rolling in well after the lunch hour rush, I took a look at the menu over hanging the many trays of goodness.  This time around, I was processed carb and relatively sugar free.  No rice (PISS) and no mac (DOUBLE PISS) this time around.  Is there sugar in teriyaki?  I was gonna be in denial about that one.  So I ordered up the mighty \"Ono'est.\"  This heart warmer consists of 3 meats and 2 sides.  I went with teriyaki steak, teriyaki chicken, some spicy poke, no rice and a double order of kimchee slaw.  The nice lady compensated me for the lack of rice with extra salad.  Mahalo ma'am, Mahalo!  

Given that this is an order...and placed in a wonderful circular, tin tray as you order, my meal was ready to go at cash out.  Me with the meats and four pounds of kimchee slaw.

Everything was divine sans the cold teriyaki chicken.  I was not gonna make a stink, and so I shredded and added it to the good fun kimchee slaw.  I truly missed rice and mac...I really did.
Brok' da mout...again.  See you on my next cheat day Makai!  Aloha!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with the recommendation from my cousin Jason. Ended up getting my dad the onoest plate! I had small kind sample from my dad, and it was yummy! 
The poke was soo Ono! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Ono-licious eats on the south west side: plates are a large portion, flavors are good, food is fresh, and service is friendly. Menu has several add-on fees for options like brown rice (50 cents extra), choice of steak ($1/serving extra), and poke (two options, $1.25/serving extra), but base prices are pretty reasonable. 

PROS: Pulehu steak has good flavor, Kahlua pig is tender, both poke options were fresh. They have several sauces by the drink station, no extra charge if you want to get more than one salad dressing. The kimchee slaw and garlic edamame sides were better than expected.

CONS: Brown rice was crunchy, steak is fatty and doesn't need an extra charge, poke portions are tiny so buy by the pound instead, salad is served pre-tossed with tongs so majority of toppings fall to bottom and you receive mostly lettuce... Management should look into adding toppings by hand for those who order salad as an entree.

Some items need a little improvement but I liked what I got and would come again. BF isn't much of a Hawaiian food fan and he cleared his plate. Total for two orders (large plate, poke salad) was about $25 without drinks.

EDIT: Still keeping it four stars, but inconsistencies with the poke prevent me from ordering it here. Staff don't fill the tiny cups to a set amount, some customers get overflowing cups and some are barely filled to the top. Order by the pound or not at all."}
{"text":"This review is long over due, I do come here a lot and love their food. 

  Service- the aloha spirit is great the workers always greet me when I walk in! They are happy to explain the menu choices and tell what your options are.

  Food- I stick to the two choice option ( ono'er) if you are really hungry they have a three choice option (ono'est). I love all the food here but my go to is the  white rice -chicken katsu/ Teri chicken combo with double mac salad!!! Yes you can get double of anything even on the main choices like if want double chicken katsu. 

 On a side note if you get the Mochiko chicken you only get 3 pieces? This is the reason for only four stars not five! So I would get double Mochiko chicken. Yes it's really good just that I feel they could give more......... They also have poke just two choices, Hawaiian style and spicy tuna. You can choose this as a side or get a container like 1/4 pound or whatever you like. Other side choices are Kim Chee, edamame and garlic edamame, grilled veggies and corn.

  Next to the soda machine is all of the sauces, forks, knives and napkins and stuff. They have sauce cups to take sauce home with you if you doing take out.

   It seems like every time I go in here it's always busy but you usually don't have to wait long as they are fast in getting your order and getting you on your way!  Check this place out and give them a try, Happy eating!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Such a good bang for your book. I eat it multiple times a month and usually order off post mates also.
The teriyaki chicken is delicious. Cooked perfectly, most, and full of flavor. The chicken katsu is the same also. Flavorful and tender but still crispy. Sometimes I have katsu that is fried so hard it hurts the roof of my mouth.. not here, it's perfect! I always get a small plate and it's more than enough and always fills me up. The portions are good and surprisingly big for how low the cost is. 
Love the sides also. The garlic edamame is bomb and the flavor is perfect. Im pretty picky with my Mac salad but theirs is awesome! 
It's always a good meal. If I can't decide what I want to eat, I always come here!
My only complaint is that when I order on Postmates, the size of my meal is never consistent. I think I get more when I dine in. With Postmates my meal looks different every time and it is mostly rice and barely any protein!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!! nothing more to say!! Everytime we've gone there the food is on point! The hawaiian style poke is in my opinion the best I've had in the vegas Valley (& trust me I've been all over for Poké) the pulehu steak, Katsu, Mac salad, garlic soybeans etc..... are so ONO! & pour the Da Spicy Yaki sauce all over! Omg!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good new place around my work! Tried it for lunch, the location is kind of hidden but the inside looks great! Since it's new it wasn't too packed, not too long of a wait to get my food. The price is not too bad either!! I got the small chicken Katsu brown rice and macaroni salad plate. I wanted to get the small to make sure I liked it and once I tried it I wished I would have goodwill the bigger size the Chicken was nice and crispy and juice at the same time Mac salad was the best I have had in a long time. The employees were friendly and helpful they asked if we wanted to try anything before you ordered, they asked if we had enjoyed our food before leaving and wished us a great day too!! Great service I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I actually love makai, really good place to grub after a great exercise! Only thing is their poke isn't amazing, but otherwise they re pretty good."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while in town. Way off strip. Great local spot. 

First off, not many place have mochiko chicken. I've seen maybe 2-3 in my life. This place had mochiko wings. They were excellent.

The poke. Was also very excellent. It's refreshing that there's still places that serve actual \"Poke\" Hawaiian style. The poke craze lately has created so many basic pop ups places that just have raw fish that you add toppings or sauce. That's not poke brah. 

Overall this was a great spot! Would come here again for sure! 

Oh there kim chee slaw was tasty too."}
{"text":"Impressed with the portions & for the price it is. But of course if you add additional items it will add up. Asides from that the food is delicious & the spicy poke is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I probably ate here like 5 times in a month, which is a lot for me because I usually like to try different things but somehow I always seem to be in the mood for this place. It is always the perfect meal because if I am super hungry I can get the Ono'er, but if I'm not as hungry I can get the Ono. The meat and sides are always so good and fresh. I also love how you can choose options for a healthy meal as well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meal - very good price value and good quality.  Will be back and probably also have them cater work function"}
{"text":"Went to this place with my husband at 7:30 and they were out of white rice....the main staple of all Hawaiian meals and were not even making more. They had no teriyaki and no poke so we just left. If you want to eat there call ahead of time to check if they have food left in there restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Hawaiian food. We go to Maui every other year and it's hard to find \"local\" Hawaiian food that's authentic like it is in Hawaii. Makai is awesome. Mac salad, teriyaki chicken, and the ahi are all ONO! The price is great and friendly staff. They are more than willing to answer questions and let you try meats, etc. Highly recommend them, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ono'er serving for two poki, kaluha pig, macaroni, garlic edumami, over brown rice. Lunch island style! Servings met my standards as this was a Saturdate! Yogi and booBoo stole this pick nick basket in island style! To the next foodie adventure..."}
{"text":"Two of my local yelp associates (Katherine A. & Stefany V.) had this restaurant rated between 3 and 4 stars, and since I love Hawaiian style food, I had to cheat on Island Flavor give this place a try.  

I ordered the ono (small) plate, which comes with one choice of meat, one side and white rice.  I went with the teriyaki chicken and a side of macaroni salad.  The meal is value priced at $4.95.

Most food items have been pre-cooked and sit in bins (which includes chicken Katsu).  While this makes for fast grab-and-go service (where you walk the line and your meal is assembled very much like Chipotle), food isn't cooked to order.

Overall, my meal was satisfying.  The chicken was a little on the dry side, but the tasty macaroni salad balanced things out for me.  

If I was looking to grab some Hawaiian style food, fast, and at a value price, I'd certainly stop by Makai Pacific Island Grill again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Hawaiian spots I have tried in the southwest area. I love the simple menu of any a few options to pick. I love their mochiko wings! Their spicy poke is also amazing, for the sides I always get double garlic edamame. The garlic edamame is THE best I've tasted in Vegas, so many amazing flavors."}
{"text":"i feel like i come here every week. me and my coworkers have ordered online and have come in person too and everything here is always on point. sauces are bomb and food is bomb. seriously one of my fave spots to go to. they even have poke that is super yummy! we need more people checking out this spot. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I NEVER eat Hawaiian BBQ. My friend really encouraged me to give this place a chance. I'm blown away the food is so good here!!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service, and great food! Will return often as its next to my office! Definitley try the teriyaki and poke!"}
{"text":"I love the casual concept of order your food and pick what you want, watch it be assembled then pay. 

I highly suggest waiting for meat to come off the grill or looking to see if the containers are full with meat. I sampled chicken pelehu which looked amazing in Yelp pics but it was SO dry. :( teriyaki chicken was fresh off the grill and what a difference! It was moist and delicious. 

Unfortunately the amount of meat given was very small portion. I wanted more meat it was so good. I liked how it's not smothered in teriyaki sauce but if you compare the portion to what you get at Island Flavor and the price you get 1/3 -1/4 the amount of meat. 

I also tried a steak which was dry and another which wasn't. The one that wasn't was really good and not overlooked.

Loved the almonds on the salad yummm but would have been nice if the worker knew the answer to my question about the dressing being homemade. She did not know which she should. 

On to the poke...lovvvvvvedddd it! Both flavors were good. The portion is tiny and there is an up charge. The person assembling your food determines how much you get. Mine was above the top of the small cup and my husbands was below the top of the cup line. I don't like that inconsistency. We saw someone near us whose cup was overflowing with poke. Would be great if it's the same amount each time. For the price the portion is comparable I think and it is probably a normal portion size, just now what you expect when you think Hawaiian. 

My husband's mochiko chicken has a great flavor. 

We were not given napkins and I don't think others were either. I saw people having to go up and ask for napkins. No napkins on tables and no napkins near the soda machine. Put out some napkins, people need it. I kid you not I saw a man blow his nose in his shirt. It was gross. It's an easy fix so I hope management can do that. 

I think the flavors are good but with dry chicken and steak it is really not reliable to get a good meal. I wish they just grilled to order somehow."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at an even better price!! I got the small teriyaki chicken with Mac salad and I was happy full. Great place and will be back."}
{"text":"First of all, I think the idea of having Hawaiian food in sort of the Chipotle style concept was pretty cool. You pick your main items, as well as your sides. I've been here a few times now, and I can't say that I love it or hate it. Their price point isn't bad, but for about the same price you could go somewhere else where your food is made to order. Now I understand this is where the fast and convenience factor comes in to play. As far as the food, it's ok. The Kalua Pig was nice and tender, but the Chicken Katsu was a little dry. The steak was a bit tough, and not tender enough. As for the service, it's always fast and friendly. I really enjoy coming here for a quick bite or grabbing it to go, but there are better Hawaiian options in town"}
{"text":"This place is a good choice for some hawaiian food- cafe rio style. Service is friendly and fast. Their best items are the spicy poke and sweet teriyaki beef. Three stars because their other main dishes arent very good. The chicken katsu tastes strange and rubbery compared to other places probably because they have it laid out under the heat lamp and dont fry it fresh. The teriyaki chicken had good flavor, but tasted undercooked. The pork kalua is ok, but bland and you have to put lots of sauce on it for it to be good. Also they changed their menu so now teriyaki beef is about $1.50 more. The poke is extra but thats understandable. Prices and value are great because you can try different things unlike other places, but wish they had more on their menu. Recommend the macaroni salad and garlic edamame! The regular edamame is too salty."}
{"text":"4 stars for the poke, it tasted like poke from home (Hawaii), perfect seasoning and not too salty. 

Teriyaki chicken- not a big fan. Chicken was so hard, it felt like a rugby match between the chicken and my teeth. Sauce was too sweet, so a little goes a long way. 

Kimchi- skip it. Shredded cabbage with a bland spicy sauce. Couldn't taste that tang in an authentic kimchi, or the spice. 

Overall 3 stars, because the only thing I really liked on my plate was the poke. And also not too bad prices. Didn't need to empty my bank account for a meal."}
{"text":"I would like to make a legitimate review here. But I rarely ever leave reviews, so the last part is the real reason why I'm writing all this lol

Makai seems to be either a hit or miss when I go here. The first time I tried Makai, the food was just alright. I was a bit disappointed in their chicken katsu as it seemed to be a bit overcooked. However the poke was phenomenal! Which is partly why I came back. The other factor was that the staff was so nice. 

This time on the other hand was weird though because it was as if things had switched! Tonight I tried their mochiko wings, Hawaiian poke and chicken katsu. Great taste, nothing overcooked - I was so happy I stopped by here for dinner. I guess this makes up for their customer service. 

*****WHAT I REALLY LEFT THIS REVIEW FOR*****
I usually don't have a problem with \"poor\" customer service as I've worked in the food industry before. I get it. It can be pretty annoying working around food all day. HOWEVER, I have no idea what triggered this girl to make me feel like I shouldn't be here. I ordered and when she added rice to my plate, she stared me down in silence. Like... Alright. Did I do or say something? If this was my first time, I would have been completely confused as to what I needed to tell her next.

I was completely taken off guard but I just proceeded telling her the meats I wanted. Apparently she didn't hear the last thing I ordered in which she, once again, stared me down in silence. Her facial expression looked so irritated. Resting bitch face or not, it was the weirdest, most uncomfortable thing I experienced. \"Poke\" I said again. She then asked me which flavor I wanted in a really annoyed tone.

Whoever the chick with the nose stud is - It's really, really weird and uncomfortable to stare down customers until they speak. If you didn't hear something we say, if you need us to tell you what we want next, SPEAK UP. Not everyone knows what to do. If you were having a bad day, I apologize. But please don't take it out on customers who didn't do shit."}
{"text":"808 in 702! Yay! 

Makai finally came to my side of town and I couldn't be happier. Seriously good food, nice portions and affordable. They are definitely doing it right! 

My favorites are Mochiko Wings, Katsu and Teriyaki Chicken. But honestly everything is good here. Can't go wrong. 

This particular location is a bit tricky to get to because of the In-N-Out drive thru, so just keep that in mind when you go."}
{"text":"Aloha from the 9th island! Lol! One more reason why I love living in Vegas. We have some of the best Hawaiian food. And Makai is definitely at the top of my list. ; ) 


Located on the southwest side of town in a mini shopping center, is this hidden gem with the best katsu, teriyaki (steak & chicken), mochiko wings (my favorite), poke, mac salad, sweet corn, you get my drift. Everything on the menu is super delicious, haven't been disappointed once. Added bonus: my kids love it too!! 

Prices are more than fair. And you get so much food so it's a good idea to share. Sharing is caring, right? ; ) I recommend the \"Ono'est\" 3 servings of meat, 2 sides, and a base. Does a mixed plate get any better than that? I absolutely love this place. It's my \"go-to\" now whenever I'm on this side of town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always good fresh food. Nothing is left out too long. I go here all the time for lunch and is by far my favorite place to eat. Chicken Katsu with the dat spicy yaki and the spicy poke are a must have every time"}
{"text":"Food is not cooked to order, but still good if you're in a rush.  Staff is friendly.  Place is clean.   Kim chee slaw was pretty good.  I ordered the large so I could try a variety of what they served.  Turned out to be too much food for one sitting.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The service was good. The counter person seemed to be on automatic, I asked for mochiko chicken & she was trying to put teriyaki chicken on my bowl. I got the mochiko chicken, but was disappointed that there wasn't any mochiko on it. It was marinated with some soy sauce flavor, very odd. Not good at all. I also got kalua pig & it was a soppy mess. Yikes. At least the Mac salad was ok. 
The cashier was the only good thing about this place. She was pleasant & very nice. Had a great smile. 
I won't be coming back. I'm from Honolulu & this is a sad facimile of Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Came to try out this place since the reviews were 4.5. Not too sure what the hype is. Kimchi tasted spoiled and it didn't taste legit, mochiko chicken ahh that too. But there hawaiian poke with limu was on point and katsu was good as well. But this is my opinion & everyone has their own."}
{"text":"I am honestly surprised the reviews are so good for this place when there are SOOOOO many other, much better places for Hawaiian food in Vegas. I mean, we are the 9th island after all. I've eaten food from here twice and both times were pretty disappointing. I decided to give them another try this week. And they still failed to wow me. I had a bowl with Kalua Pig and Pulehu steak. The meats were both ok, not much flavor, nothing special, steak was a little tough. I also got a side of kimchee slaw and sweet corn. The corn tasted like it had been dumped straight out of a can. And the kimchee slaw, omg, it was awful. It tasted like it was old or some of the ingredients were old, like it had been sitting and was starting to go bad. I couldn't eat it. If they upped their food, like a lot, their portion to price is good. But that's about it."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out. Everything is so good. My favorite is the Poke and the Chicken wings. So good. Being from Hawaii it's hard to find a place where the food is just as good as back home. But this place, definitely satisfies my cravings. Not to mention, you get A LOT of food for the decent prices you pay. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"First time trying it out, I was craving poke. The staff was great and the food was amazing, I will definitely be back!! Thanks for the great service !"}
{"text":"We walked in and several tables and chairs were dirty and disheveled this evening. There were only 3 people inside when we walked in. Maybe they just had a rush? The 3 gentlemen behind the counter were friendly and advised they only had a pound of poke left. The POKE sells out fast! This was our first time here and the prices are very affordable with small/med/large plates available. I chose the mochiko chicken wings which were great but I expected a little more breading. I also chose the teriyaki chicken which was BOMB! So ono! The rice was very good and I chose Mac salad and kimChee slaw as my sides which did not disappoint in any way! I do t like the Mac salad from L&L or Babystacks but the Mac salad from Makai tasted like authentic Hawaiian Mac salad that grandma makes and Ty's family and friends in Hawaii. When you get your food they have an area to open come up napkins, forks and Katsu sauce or 'Da Yaki Sauce' which is Teriyaki sauce and they have spicy Da Yaki sauce  We all ordered Mochiko Wings so we had to wait about 20mins for them to make more. They have coke products, Hawaiian Sun juices and water.  They also have little cups of Hawaiian ice cream with exotic flavors like chocolate coconut. Overall impressed with the taste, quality and price of the food. Would've given 5 starts if the restaurant sitting area had been clean. Or at least cleaner."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome people! All the menu items are on point and the spicy teriyaki is unreal. A must have location if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often -- The food is consistently good and the staff is always super friendly.  Can't ask for more than that for a casual dining experience!"}
{"text":"This is my absolutely favorite spot to grab a quick lunch. This place is amazing and the best deal in town by far considering price, taste, and quality of food! I usually get brown rice, kimchi, and spicy tuna poke. Super healthy and yummy as well as very reasonably priced. My husband loves their kalua pork and macaroni salad. I have been there so many times ever since they opened and never been let down. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian food. Friendly helpful service. We're so happy we have an island restaurant close to our house in South Summerlin."}
{"text":"Really nice to have some clean good tasting Hawaiian food on this side of town. Pretty affordable and everything is made well. Sometimes they run out of stuff if it gets busy and you might have to wait a little bit. 

But overall, food is pretty good but would like to see more healthy options if possible. It's a quick service so understandable that staff is in a rush, but could be friendlier. Overall, nice job and good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Makai for the quick service and food. It's like Chipotle where you construct your own meal to your liking. I got the teriyaki chicken and pulehu steak. My boyfriend got the chicken katsu and pulehu steak. This review honestly would be 3 and a half stars but I rounded up.

I thoroughly enjoyed the teriyaki chicken. It was delightful, flavorful and grilled well. The pulehu steak, on the other hand, was pretty mediocre. It did not live up to its hype like the teriyaki chicken. I thought it tasted pretty bland. The chicken katsu was pretty standard as well. The rice was weird. Not sure how to explain it so that's all I'm going to say. The mac salad wasn't very cold like I'm used to with Hawaiian food (probably because they have it out on the counter, so no biggie). I loved \"Da Spicy Yaki\". It was a mysterious, delicious sauce that I made sure to bring to my table. The food overall is very filling. I normally get the medium (ono'er; two meats) and I generally can only eat half of it.

The ambiance is very clean and modern. I enjoyed the Hawaiian music they had playing in the background. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"I have to give this awesome Hawaiian grill a 5 stars! They have ultimately the BEST poke I've had in Vegas and the way they prepare the plate reminds me of Hawaii. If you're from Hawaii, you definitely wanna try this place out!
To also add their price point is ON POINT. 
You get the best bang for your buck and they give you SOO MUCH food. They have a whole sauce station to get all your desired sauces. They have some Hawaiian juices if you wanted some lilikoi drink or whatnot.
The atmosphere is super nice in there too, if you don't want to sit inside there's outdoor seats too! 
My favorite plate to order here HAS to be the kalua pork, so Ono, literally the BEST kalua and they offer you brown or white rice.
They also offer you salads if you're more of the vegetarian side. What's even more awesome is they offer kimchi slaw as a side too!!! Like whaaaaaaattttt  
You can also order the poke on the side, half lb or full lb to take home. 
If I could Id eat here every meal the pricing is so good, the service is good, the sauces are good, the cleanliness is good. 5 stars!!!! 
I'll definitely recommend (well I've already did lol) and I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"the prices are amazing, the portions are generous, wait is quick ...

BUT THE WINGS. get the wings. just the wings if you can! they are SO GOOD. sweet, crispy, perfectly cooked, omfg. they are so bomb. honestly, the other food is good but the wings are amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious Quick Serve Hawaiian Food

Makai is my go to place for quick service hawaiian food. Depending on your level of hunger, Makai offers up three plate lunch sizes (ono, ono'er, and ono'est). Food is fresh and tastes great. Chicken katsu was perfectly crispy and paired well with their homemade sauces. 

Prices are fair and I believe they match the quality & portion of food you receive. Order a size up for more variety and extra food for later. I highly recommend the canned hawaiian sun drinks as they pair perfectly with savory meals. 

Only downside: not open on sundays (which like chik fil a...i always seem to crave when it's closed)."}
{"text":"Big fan, the whole family loves it. I've brought a few friends (Hawaii natives) who loved it as well. The poke is fresh and perfectly seasoned, love that the mac salad has potato in it, and my kids are obsessed with the teriyaki chicken. Prices are great, too. Portions are quite large-we are still working on not over ordering after st least five visits ;)"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service & decent prices. All you can really ask for. \"On o'er\" (Medium) 2 meats & 2 sides for $6.99 is a great deal and they had a cool little set up. Try their steak & kalua pig."}
{"text":"This place is definitely my favorite Hawaiian bbq joint here in Vegas. 

Chicken is cooked just right. 4/5
Steak has great taste. 4/5
Mac /corn 5/5
Poke tuna 4/5
Service 5/5
Price 4/5

A very strong 4 star in my book, but I'll give it a 5/5

Definitely will come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So yummy! We went yesterday for the first time. It was recommended to us. Staff was helpful and really friendly. We got the large portion, three meats and two sides. Beware! It's a huge amount of food and enough for two to share. We brought home the leftovers and had another meal later in the day. The macaroni salad is really tasty and the tuna was delicious! We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"SO ONO! The customer service here makes me feel like I'm back home. Prices are fair. Facility is clean and parking is no hassle! My husband got a small plate with white rice, kalua pork and mac salad. The kalua pork didn't have much cabbage but he said he likes it that way, and you can definitely taste the liquid smoke. I got a medium plate with white rice, double mac salad, chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. And being the raw fish lovers we are we also got a quarter pound of the spicy ahi poke. The mac salad was good, not too salty or with overwhelming amounts of mayo. The katsu was crispy, and the chicken teri was so so tender. I wish the poke was cut a little smaller but the sauce was on point. For all of our food we paid 17 bucks which is cheap for all the food we got and the quality. This place kind of reminds me of a chipotle but with hawaiian food. I wish there was more selection but I will still be back here to try out everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is the best spot in town for islander food. The prices are great and the ahi is mad good. Not just the ahi the whole menu is great!"}
{"text":"Brahhhh.... my boy kahale told me I had to check dis place out and I must say I was impressed. Def be coming back and spreading da good word for dese folks. Not Far off da 215 and trop, easy to find, choke parking. Only down side dey closed Sundays but understandable lol other than that mon thru sat 10:30pm to 9pm is when dey open. Pokè was good, kalua light was Ono and the steak was on point. Choke choice of sauces for. Oh and the mac salad was fo broke da mouth. Check dese guys out. No can go wrong for the food and price."}
{"text":"Simple yet fantastic! This spot makes me feel like I'm back home in Hawaii, and not just because of the music, lol. I told my husband it's kind of like going to a bbq/potluck at a friend's house (in a good way). I love places like Giada's, Barrymore and Echo & Rig, but sometimes I just want a good meal, no rich sauces, simple, quick and at an affordable price. Makai hits the nail right on the head!

I had the Ono'er (2 meats, 2 sides, rice) - pulehu steak, kalua pig, garlic edamame, mac salad and rice for $8! A great deal in my opinion. Everything was really good and filling. The only bummer was they were out of poke, but we'll definitely be back so hopefully we can try it next time.

The decor is clean and contemporary. And another highlight is they're two doors down from a favorite dessert spot...Sweet Addiction! What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"I am hooked!!! This place is SO good! The wings are so flavorful, and their sides are yummy! Must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Tried it for the first time today and it was pretty tasty. The Kalua pig is really good, the flavors are just right... Kalua pig at other places can be too salty but this place is perfect. The poke was also really good... I recommend the spicy poke because it is more flavorful than the Hawaiian poke, it is more creamy and the little kick is very tasty. The garlic edamame was good too, the kimchi slaw had a weird flavor to it.. Not my favorite. The only con was the rice, there were a few pieces of really hard rice on my two scoops, not a big deal. 

The bowl/plate comes in different sizes, I recommend getting the medium which comes with a base (white rice or brown rice), two meats and two sides. Portion is not crazy big, decent portion for one person."}
{"text":"The BEST hawaiian food place i've ever food considering i tried a good amount here in Vegas. The food itself blew my expectations everything is fresh and delicious couldn't stop myself to keep eating. Portions are well worth the price as well. Very clean, organized, and friendly environment. This was my first time going to Makai after wanting to go for so many months and i'm quite happy with the result. Definitely coming back from now on."}
{"text":"Decent place if you're looking for a quick local lunch. Wouldn't say this is a true Hawaiian place as the only Hawaiian thing about it is the poke or Kalua pig. Pretty cheap. I usually get the medium (Ono'er) which allows you to get rice, two choices of meat, and two sides. That usually costs 7-9 bucks if you get the poke. The Katsu and Teri chicken is my favorite. Only thing I don't like about this place is that some of the staff can be stingy. I ordered chicken and Hawaiian style poke and when the server put chicken on my plate she literally took out a tiny piece of chicken and out it back in the pile. Same goes for the poke, sometimes they'll fill up the cup or sometimes they'll half ass it. Doesn't happen too much, but just watch out for that lol. Overall I do like this place."}
{"text":"I've heard so much hype about this place and it did not disappoint! Food is always super fresh, good portions and I love that you can have multiple items. For instance, my plate had rice, chicken katsu, kalua pork, poke and macaroni. So bomb. My son LOVES their katsu. I do too cause it's a nice thick juicy piece of chicken. Dont really like the location as it's in this business complex, and the area is always busy.... hopefully they open one in centennial soon. My only things is that I thought their kalua was too salty.... but could have just been that batch. Will be back"}
{"text":"Nice place. Simple idea. Great food. Huge servings. Reasonable price. Friendly staff.

I suggest trying their Poke and Garlic edamame."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Lots of good food and choices. Its def worth trip and the price. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Legit Hawaiian food at really good prices. Staff is friendly and the cook was from Hawaii which was cool. Felt like home. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Really Makai? You have to weigh your serving portions now? God forbid you accidentally grab a larger sized meat. How offensive. A true hawaiian restaurant is known for their indulgent oversized portions. 

Im ok with weighing the poke for market price but I had 3 orders and had to sit there and watch the server pick meat in and out the tray like 5 times to get the \"right\" portion for each order!! You dont  see panda express bustin out their scale
At their assembly line ! Lmao! Its not that serioussss, super stingyyyyyy  stop it makai stop it nowww. Feed the families that feed YOU!"}
{"text":"~Fat people's  and fat people at heart paradise~

This is the best Hawaiian place in Vegas,  one of the best places I've ate at and  one place I will keep coming back to as long as they're open!  Makai definitely never disappoints, every time  we have it (which sometimes is twice a week) we remember why it's so addicting. Every one is so friendly and always welcomes us back:) Don't hesitate coming here at all bc you won't be disappointed!  Oh and it's kinda healthy, Yelp says so when you type in \"healthy\". They have the best garlic edamame though foreal and of course everything else they have."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED Makai. I used to come all the time when I lived on this side of town and my last 2 visits here have been extremely disappointing. The second to last time I came it was around 8pm and they were completely out of poke and mochiko chicken. I figured it was gonna be closing soon which is why they were no longer refilling and it was understandable. What wasn't understandable was that when I asked for more furikake on my rice the guy told me he couldn't give me anymore. That's like telling someone they can't get more than one container of teriyaki sauce. But we couldn't get teriyaki sauce anyways because literally every single bottle was empty and no one was refilling them. Not only that but every table was dirty and we had to clean them ourselves. And again I figured it was close to closing time and to give them a pass and another try again. So today my boyfriend and I went around 5:30pm since we figured they were no where near closing and would definitely have food this time and we were wrong. They had no poke, no teri or pulehu steak. Lucky for me they actually had mochiko wings this time but they were pretty bland compared to the other times I've had them and my boyfriend's teri chicken was cold. I just hope they start prepping enough food for a whole business day if I ever decide to come back."}
{"text":"Food was actually pretty good and price is reasonable.  However, they are missing the Aloha in this place!  Nobody smiles ....I wonder if they get fined if they smile.  The cashier seems like she was forced to work there.  No personality at all!   I will still give a good rating as I am happy with the food.  Hopefully, the owner would hire people with the Aloha spirit in them.  Best business promotion is when satisfied customers tell other people how much they like a business, product or service.  Good food but needs a lot of work on their service!"}
{"text":"My rating is for the food and the food only. Staff is amazing the place itself is ectremely clean. But the food is not up to par."}
{"text":"I've only come here once but the food was very good. It's Chipotle-like style of ordering makes things easy to customize. The poke was fresh! And I have a thing for mac salads. I'm usually picky when it comes to mac salads. But I love it here.

Would definitely come back especially since it's close to where I live."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The chicken and steak are absolutely delicious. Whenever I get food from here and eat it at home I always want the recipe but whenever I go in I forget to ask. They probably won't give it to me though."}
{"text":"Just as good as their other place. I love the poke here And the katsu chicken is also good. The steak is tough because it's cooked well done but he offered to cook fresh on medium.  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Keeping it real here.   This is the only place I've ever had Hawaiian food.  Reason is...   this place is off the hook.   I always get the medium which is two choices of meats, two sides, and rice.   

Always get the same thing.   

Kalua pig- so damn tender and extra good with the teriyaki sauce on it.   

Katsu chicken- basically breaded chicken.  But it's always crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside.  And they have a special sauce that takes it up a few notches.   It heats up crazy good too in the toaster oven if you can finish it.   

Mac Salad- I'm not Mac Salad connoisseur but this stuff is ridiculous tasty.   

White rice- its white rice.  Standard, nothing you are gonna call you mom and tell her about.   But it works with everything.  


But in the end it costs like $8.25.   Fills my big appetite.   Leaves me happy and satisfied (that's what she said).  And it's like 5 minutes from my house.  Staff is nice.   Not a big fan of the paying process.   It asks if you wanna tip after you pay by credit and I always feel guilty not tipping.   But it literally takes them 87 seconds to put my meal together.  

They are closed on Sunday though (sad music plays in background)."}
{"text":"It was very affordable but the meat selection was quite small. The meat was average, probably won't be coming back because it wasn't as good as I thought. It was kinda bland. Overall, it was a great experience. I loved their sides."}
{"text":"Fast quick meal. Food was ok not great. Spicy tuna poke didn't have any flavor I had to drench it with sriracha to get some flavor in it. I like that they offer healthy options like brown rice & salad. My husband enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Can you ever get enough local \"808\" food in life??? Hell no! Thankfully now more then ever talk about options across the Vegas Valley. One of the latest additions is Makai Pacific Island Grill. Any business that makes the Hot New Business list on yelp and close to my house so in!!! 

My first stop really wanted to try some of the spicy poke. I went when they first open so told me 10-15miin wait. Ok. I figure get some on my second visit. I went with the Pulehu Steak and Kalua Pig choice of meat. Two sides went mac salad and Kimchee slaw. The kimchee slaw was awesome. I love all things Kimchee. I never had Kimchee slaw. It had nice kick nothing over the top heat but added so much more flavor then regular coleslaw. Mac Salad was solid. The meats the Kalua Pig and the Steak Pulehu both was solid. The Kalua Pig surprise not offer it with cabbage. Still the meat was nice moist and had nice flavor to it. The Steak Pulehu was cooked perfect medium rare. Second visit got me some Spicy Poke. Poke hands down was the WINNAH. Also have Hawaiian style poke but would highly recommend the Spicy Poke more. If you want they offer sample of the Poke can have one bite. Second go around my meats went with teri chicken and spicy poke. The teri chicken was cooked perfect! It had nice char on the outside, hot and moist inside, and not overpowering sauce at all. The spicy Poke was amazing. I read other reviews that hit or miss. They do make it fresh everyday so consistency might be problem. On this day got nothing but amazing amazing and right there was the best straight poke (all they sell POKE like Poke express) spots in town. It was that good decided take half pound action later for dinner. Yay!!! 

The concept at Makai Pacific Island Grill is one that think is really cool. Simple, straight forward, very very reasonable, get choke food, and legit local grinds. They offer three different size bowls. The medium size (Ono'er) get two meats and two sides. Just right.  If not fan of white rice they offer brown rice as other base option. They have few options comes to meats and sides. It like ordering half an half at other local restaurants. The POKE that really stands out. Not often see menu that has Poke as meat option. POKE be honest not the cheapest thing on the menu always at market price. No different here and the price per lb changes daily basis. Steal of deal plate lunch with all the sides and Poke. They have four different bottle sauces on the side condiments can add.

The interior is nothing that blow you away. Really simple. The music not sure if local station back home. All hawaiian music that grew up with come the C&K, Hawaiian Style Music, Braddah Iz, and just good island roots. 

No doubt Makai is my new quick go to spot comes for local grinds.. POKE the star of the show!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good! Modern interior, great service. Can't go wrong for the price - the portions are generous and you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"For some island flavor I would definitely recommend coming here. Line up and pick your favorites. Real easy and so good!! I went basic today but still really good the Chicken Katsu and Teriyaki Chicken w/ Double Mac Salad. Usually get the steak w poke but was wanting something else. If you're in the area definitely check this out if you want some island tings!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I decided to try out this new place since it was so close to us. The only downside is the difficulty in which it takes to place an order for delivery. We ended up getting it through Grub Hub.
The food was awesome though. We all had the medium size. I had the chicken teriyaki, Mochiko chicken wings, Mac salad, and garlic edamame; my coworkers all had chicken teriyaki and the salad. There were absolutely no complaints and we were completely satisfied, plus leftovers to take home!
It's not until I got home that I realized that I had been to the one on Ft. Apache. This time stood out more to me; the recipe for the Mac salad seemed different in a good way. And honestly the Mochiko chicken was just plain ol' finger lickin' good!

We will definitely have another lunch date from here."}
{"text":"Finally a Hawaiian spot on this side of town! The food is amazing and the staff makes you feel very welcomed. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went with the Large (three meat) combo. Our meat selections were the mochiko wings, teri chicken, and the pulehu steak.  We didn't know what pulehu steak was so we asked for a sample and found it to be quite tasty and very tender.   We should have suspected something was going to be off when the server had to scrape the last of the steak into our tin.  What we ended up with was the overcooked, medium well pieces at the bottom that were tough.  When we brought it to the cashier's attention, he didn't care.  \"I'll let the chef know.\" was his response.  

We liked everything else and the sides were good. But chances are not coming back here any time soon because of the shoddy service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! There's a decent selection of some hawaiian favorites. I had the bowl, it came with two generous portions of rice. I selected the kalua pig / spicy poke as my two meats. At checkout they topped my rice w furrikake seasoning. First bite was kalua, omg it was juicy. Tasted just like how I remembered it back home. Spicy poke was legit too! Staff was friendly. Definetly will return to try the rest of the menu. If this is your first time going here, try the kalua pig!"}
{"text":"Great new place..I was very warmly greeted by what seems to be 3 family members. I'm not so familiar with Pacific Island food so I was offered a visual and and a taste of what I now can't wait to eat again. I ordered the small.. 1 meat choice, one base choice,and a side. Very delicious and extremely perfect size for a quick bite to eat(not to mention very inexpensive) I ate the poke (meat option) white rice (base) and garlic edamame (side). I can't wait to come back and have the Kalua pig it was delicious."}
{"text":"Quick and convenient way to grab lunch/dinner togo when you don't feel like cooking. We got the large bowl (3 meats, 2 sides) more than enough food for 1 person. The food was flavorful & fresh. The store was clean, plenty of tables for dining in. The staff were sweet & friendly. Great environment. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Omg. So bomb. If I could eat here everyday I would. So addicting, so delicious. I love adding the almonds on my salad. Best combo ever!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is always good. They have 3 different sizes for your hunger needs. Me personally I always get the ono'er aka the medium. It comes with 2 sides, 2 meats, and your choice of white or brown rice. There are a few extra charges on some things. The brown rice, regular poke, spicy poke, and steak is extra charges. 
They give you a good portion on the sides and meats. Everything here is always so good. They never disappoint. One thing that I do want to mention is they make so much poke that you can order ahead of time by calling but you still have to come in to pick it up as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Came by here because of it's high rating. Left disappointed. Food was fresh... but a bit bland. Biggest disappointment was the mac salad. Again, bland. With all the Hawaiian spots in Vegas, there are better options. Wanted to like this place because of the good service and cleanliness but felt like my money could have been spent better elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great. Food was tasty. Spicy poke creeps up on you and the spice starts to kick in but it's flavorful. The wings were so good. My husband loved their teriyaki chicken. Everything we got was good. The Mac salad is a little on the peppery side for me but good. Give this place a try, I know we'll be back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"The lay out is very good, lots of room, I liked the cafeteria set up concept just like back home but the steam table is making everything go dry.  Granddaughter had the kalua but it was very dry and almost no taste -kinda blah, (maybe sitting to long or in need of some seasoning).  Wife's poke was pretty slimy and tasted kinda flat.  BBQ beef had very large pieces and was over cooked and zero taste, but sure had some jaw breaking moments trying to eat this thing.  If it had been thin sliced and marinated for several days might have been tastier.  Mochi chicken was alright but just 4 very tiny pieces, come-on.  Cold slaw kim chee was pretty good and the mac salad was a bit on the warm side, (maybe it was just made or sitting to long).  Hawaiian Sun drinks were warm and not in a working display cooler, bad.  But we were given a styrofoam cup for ice.  
Lots of take out at this location.  The service was good and the workers very friendly.  Need to review the way things are set up because the food is being served on the extremely dry side."}
{"text":"I've been seeing a lot of posts about this place so I had to try it. I live in the area too so I am
Always looking for good quick lunch spots. When we arrived on a Saturday afternoon it wasn't crazy busy at all maybe one family sitting down when we entered. 

So the place is very clean and with a good amount of tables for people to sit in. It's a pick and choose type of restaurant which I haven't seen before in a Hawaiian restaurant. They have different combos to choose from. I got the medium which was two meats and one base (rice), also including two sides. They have two versions of the steak which was typical teriyaki and the pulehu steak. I was curious what the pulehu was, the lady said it was garlic, salt, and pepper. So I got both steak options with garlic edamame and kimchee slaw. My BF got the kalua pork and pulehu steak. 

So the garlic edamame was the highlight of my meal. It had so much flavor and the only thing was I wished it was hot but it's not a big deal. The slaw was ok I probably wouldn't get it again. So for the steaks there were both a little dry for me and lacking flavor. And the rice they serve us, was hard and had a lot of crunchy pieces. I dipped the steaks in their steak sauce which just had A1 flavor and their spicy teriyaki which was good and needed it for sure. My BF said the kalua was good but hard to eat the meal because the rice was so hard. He said he absolutely loved the corn. 

I will say the price is cheap and you get a lot of food. 

I really want to give this place more stars but it just seemed like the items could have been better it was 12:00 when we  came in which I thought was prime time lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best. The most amazing poke' it's better than everywhere. It's your normal Gawain place they just do it better than everyone else I highly recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"I don't know what the negative reviews are about. We came to eat here on a Monday for lunch and the food came out super fast, hot and was bomb.com. Amongst the 7 of us, we pretty much tried everything. There were no complaints from anyone at the table and we had three kids under 7 years old with us. The mochiko chicken definitely stood out and was a favorite. The chicken teriyaki was nicely marinated and bbq'd. The kimchi wasn't super spicy, so that was good for me. People in our party also had the kalua pig and poke. The food is pretty affordable, clean and fast. You can also place orders for pickup. We'd definitely be back... Tomorrow"}
{"text":"If you're from Hawaii this place is the closest too real Hawaiian food as it gets the poke is legit. The Kalua pork is very tender, moist and fresh"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place, but it's a little out of the way for me. Being from Hawaii, we always get excited when new restaurants like this open. I finally went yesterday and I'm glad I did. 

The place is clean with plenty of parking. I loved that you could basically make your own plate. I chose the katsu with poke and Kim chee slaw. It was right on point. The portions were pretty big. I will definitely be back. Next time with my family!"}
{"text":"I just moved to this area, hoping to find some good Hawaiian food and I was not disappointed! This restaurant is almost like a chipotle where you are able to create your own meal. What I really like about this place is that they have different size meals which is really nice especially for those who can't eat as much. When you order, you can pick between what type of meat, which kind of rice, and what type of side. Choosing the type of side you want is really nice because sometimes your just tired of the regular Mac salad. Don't get me wrong, I love the Mac salad but it's very nice to have options! 

The ambiance of the restaurant is very clean and the staff is very nice and helpful! This place is defiantly on top of my list. So I suggest to check it out because you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Woo Hoo!! The new location is finally open!! 

That said, this location is on Rock Springs right behind the Arby's on Rock Springs and Lake Mead (I-95 and Lake Mead).

The food is nice and fresh, the Katsu is crispy, and the service (just like their other location) is friendly and on point. Whenever I've visited the other location, they've always been consistent with their food and their service. They have the same food offerings as their other location... Chicken Katsu, Poke, Teriyaki Chicken, Kalua Pig, and an assortment of other Hawaiian BBQ staples. Their food is yummy and reasonably priced for the portions you get.

I'm a big fan of their Kimchi slaw, and it's nice not having to drive so far to get it. 

If you haven't tried it before, it's delicious! I'm definitely coming back now that it's practically in my back yard!"}
{"text":"So I don't always check in when I go to places... I guess it's because I haven't run into anything notable and worth sharing with anyone until now. That being said, Makai Pacific Island Grill is AWESOME! 

I decided to let them choose what I should try for my first time here. I had pulehu steak, teriyaki chicken, and poke. For sides, I chose macaroni salad and kimchee slaw. Everything I got was better than expected. My girlfriend got mochiko wings and chicken katsu. She thought it was very good as well. She liked the mochiko wings the best. 

The establishment itself is very clean and the usual Hawaiian music always welcoming. The staff is friendly and helpful.

I've been in Vegas for over 20 years and good places come and go.  This place is really good and I hope they stick around for a long time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this spot! Finally there's a great Hawaiian spot on my side of town! The mac salad is to die for, best I've had in a while. Their spicy poke and teriyaki steak are my go-tos! The portions are perfect. Very Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place to eat since we moved from Hawaii. The menu is limited but they are still kind of new themselves. This place would be even more awesome if there were some beef stew and chicken long rice. The people are always friendly and the portions are great for the price. Wish they had a loyalty card for customers who visit there often though."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, the portions are pretty healthy in size enough to fill your Hawaiian craving.  I ordered the bowl which comes with rice ( brown or white) and 2 meats.  I ordered the katsu chicken and poke tuna (spice).  Katsu chicken is always a good go to choice, the poke tuna was a little salty but still really good.  Highly recommend to check out this spot."}
{"text":"So onolicious. If you like poke, teri chicken, rice, or chicken katsu - you're in luck. This place is broke-da-mouth good. I highly recommend if you miss Hawaii!"}
{"text":"A lot of great Hawaiian places in Vegas (the 9th island). This definitely one of them. Food has been great with ever visit."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pricing is great. The location is great. Every time I go, I always am delightfully surprised by how good the chicken katsu is. They use panko for the breading and it is just perfect. The chicken inside is flavorful and well cooked. The crust is the divine! It's always light and crispy. Very well done chicken katsu. 

They serve it on a bed of rice with your pick of sides. I always like getting the garlic edamame for one of them. It's the perfect kind of salty to pair with rice. I tried their wings once which were all right. I personally prefer the chicken katsu waaaay more. I promise you can't go wrong with it.

The service is decent, the lobby is always clean and well kept. They have a fair number of seats and tables of you prefer dining in. Their sauces are accessible and plenty.

Overall, this is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Makai's is where it's at! Awesome idea. I'm a picky eater so being able to choose exactly what I want is incredible and results in a very happy tummy! I got the onoest plate with white rice, double Teri chicken & double corn. The chicken is so damn good. Corn is hard to get wrong but the way it's made here brings back a lot of memories from growing up in Oahu & the rice was cooked just right!The staff was so friendly and I'll definitely be coming back & telling everyone about this place."}
{"text":"I work next door so I come here all the time. Quick service and tons of options. Try the spicy poke!"}
{"text":"Found this place on accident. WOW, Cheap & Ono!! My bday girl had poke, Mmmm. My youngest & I had kahlua pig & double teri chicken plate. Bought one plate for my oldest at home. Definitely coming back with da whole fam next time. Much Mahalos!!!!"}
{"text":"Dude! This restaurant has the best teriyaki chicken in Las Vegas! It is so smoky & tender. The Mochiko chicken is excellent. The katsu is very tender. Many restaurants that sell katsu, usually has a dry & brittle katsu. Not here! It's very juicy. We visited the new location at Hwy 95 & Lake Mead. Go there NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Aloha!! To Amazing food and service. I come to Vegas several times a year to get away and just have fun. We found this hidden gem near our timeshare. It was our first time trying Hawaiian style fast food and it was beyond my expectations.  Service was friendly and portions are HUGE!  well worth all money (best bang for your buck).  We probably could have shared one plate, but we are able to eat leftovers as a second meal. Highly recommended to eat here if you want to stay off the strip and away from the hustle bustle."}
{"text":"I love this place. Went to them since they've been open and now i'm hooked. I'd choose this place anytime over L&L anyday!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff who gave me and my homie directions to fun non strip options (meadows mall but more like ghetto mall LOL...try town square for a nice outdoors mall near the airport)

They made fresh steak for us, super nice! It was saltier than usual but still solid for the price. Poke was great but I'd rather get the cool stuff like Kim chi slaw instead of cold edamame. Pork was moist and on point. Would go again for Hawaiian off the strip! 

Place was empty though, way more tables than ppl and we were there on a rainy Monday...in n out nearby was way more packed so don't come for the ppl vibes unless you wanna chill with the cool staff here!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly workers and clean environment is what makai is all about! The chicken Katsu is great and the price point for each size that's offered is a deal for the amount of food given. Also the best poke you can get in this area. I'm not sure how anyone can rate this place lower than a 5, so don't let that one star review discourage you to go and try out this restaurant! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to give this spot a five star review, but my heart and my tastebuds were telling me otherwise. I came here for the first time with my family last weekend because we were all craving a little taste of home. I've heard nothing but good things about Makai Pacific Island Grill, so I suggested it and that's how we ended up here.

I really liked the concept of Makai. It's almost like Chipotle in a sense because you get to choose and build your plate as you walk down the line, but with Hawaiian flavors instead. You choose what size plate you want, and from there you pick your base, meats, and sides. The Ono'er (Medium) was definitely enough for me. I went with the brown rice, Kalua pig, spicy ahi poke, mac salad, and sweet corn. Keep in mind that the premium meats are extra, which isn't a big deal at all. The teriyaki steak and Pulehu steak are both $1 extra and the Hawaiian poke and spicy ahi poke are both $1.25 extra. My sister also went with the Ono'er option and chose the teriyaki chicken. While ordering, she noticed that the teriyaki chicken was almost out and decided to wait for the fresh batch that would be coming off of the grill in a few minutes. Meanwhile, we paid and took the rest of our order to the table that we were lucky enough to snag!

My food was just okay. For starters, the Kalua pig here just wasn't appealing to me, which is really unfortunate because Kalua pig is one of my favorite local dishes. It didn't look appetizing on my plate, but I tried it anyway. The flavor was there, but the meat was way too fatty for my liking. I ate a few bites of it after picking around the fat and then just pushed the rest to the side. The spicy ahi is a different story. It was fresh and soft. It didn't have that fishy taste to it, which I liked. It was cut into perfect bite-sized cubes and it didn't take much effort to chew... You know the poke is good when it just melts in your mouth! The poke did not let me down at all. My sides were nothing spectacular. The mac salad has potatoes in it, which is different, and the sweet corn reminded me of the stuff they take out of the can and serve to you in the cafeteria at school.

Anyways, the other reason I had to give this place three stars is because the teriyaki chicken that my sister patiently waited for was undercooked. She took a bite into one of the pieces and it was rubbery and still a little pink. We brought it to management's attention and they were very apologetic and replaced it without a problem. 

Overall, our first experience here wasn't the best and I'm not sure that we'll be driving 35 minutes across town any time soon to give it another go. Hopefully our next visit in the future will be a better one."}
{"text":"This place is good, but they ran out of poke and I was so sad.  Everything is season really well and they have a lot of sauce options."}
{"text":"Here's what I liked: poke as a protein option. And, it was really good poke. The portion size overall was generous and I found myself with a bit of the itis after.

The wait at lunch was pretty long on my visit. Something was up at the register, thats cool no worries it happens. But after being in line for over five minutes (an eternity in fast casual chipotle style assembly lines) the girl behind the counter is dancing around and socializing. *blank stare* 

Anyway, theres a few items on the menu that have been removed like the chicken *pulehu? so beware. Also, the seared ahi is made to order so don't expect to get it right away. 

The teri chicken had some flavor but I got the bottom of the pan, so unfortunately I wasn't a fan. I'll give them another try, hopefully the experience is better on the second go."}
{"text":"After coming back from my trip to Hawaii, I was definitely craving some good authentic Hawaiian food. So I quickly yelped, and this spot came up. It was close to home so I thought I would give it a try. The food was good and so was the service. Made me miss Hawaii so much. Whenever I need my Hawaiian food fix, I come here."}
{"text":"This is our go to fast dinner place! My favorite is the teriyaki chicken.. always fresh and the Mac salad is on point"}
{"text":"Let me tell you something.... Makai is my shit!!!! I drive 30 minutes ONE WAY for this slice of heaven, and I'm gonna keep on doing it too. That macaroni salad is the answer to all of your problems. Y'all wanna know when Jesus is coming back? Jokes on you because he's already here, slinging and slaying the macaroni salad in the kitchen."}
{"text":"By far, hands down, my go to place for my (hawaiian food) comfort food. Best in Las Vegas. Their Kalua pig, bbq chicken, fresh ahi poke and lastly, the house salad dressing they have is to die for!!! I will highly recommend to anyone and everyone!!! Customer service at its best as well! Mahalo Makai Pacific Island Grill! See you soon...real soon!"}
{"text":"I'm beyond happy I found this place. I love the subway/chipotle model of food where you just go down a line and pick what you want! 
And this food is fantastic. 

Like seriously... Bro! I got so much food for like $10. I got steak, chicken, pig, Mac salad and rice for $10! Man! Was this food good too.

You know a place is good when it open at 10:30 and you get there at 10:34 and there are already 5 customers sitting and eating in the restaurant. 

Kalua Pig was the best thing in my opinion! My second favorite was the Katsu Chicken. Both of these items I will get over and over again! 

Great place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time we came here was a good experience then I tried to come back for lunch on Wednesday I think and it was a totally different experience. First they offer vegetables on their menu but have been out of them for the past couple weeks, on Wednesday they also eliminated one of the chicken options, and were out of the corn and poke. Clearly not well run if they have all of these issues. Also the women who took our order and made our food, could not have been any less interested. No apologies for being out of things or anything, just let us know like she could care less.
Disappointing, I have high hopes for this place but I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Man!! This place is hella good!!!!  all the dishes are amazing !  I have eaten here twice and both times i wanted more!!!   I would def recommend this spot fir some good authentic Hawaiian cuisine.   They really know how to cook"}
{"text":"The food here is fire- especially the kalua pork! We just happened to be in the area and stopped in. Best Hawaiian food in Vegas that I've had in a while. I'll be making the drive back here. The staff was super friendly too so that's a plus. Telling my friends and family to come here - they won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last minute. We used to frequent a lot in this area because of Thai House and Sweet Addiction and was surprised to find this gem in the same area. I love spicy ahi, to the point where my parents have to bring up at least 5 lbs every time they come and visit. I was surprised to see it as an option of protein. I love the concept here. It's super fast and super cheap. Would visit again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Since my first visit about a month ago, I've been coming here 1-2 times a week.  They've hired more workers so I haven't seen the brothers/owners as often as I used to.  I think that's a lil unfortunate because they always greeted their guests with the aloha spirit; I don't receive the same friendliness anymore.  Another unfortunate coincidence - the taste of food has gone down.  Last week I ordered pulehu steak & it was over cooked; I was so disappointed.  This week I ordered spicy poke with mochiko chicken- the poke was too spicy, I couldn't finish the tiny container; the mochiko chicken tasted a lil different."}
{"text":"Makai is a wonderful on-the-go or perfect lunch spot. It'll satisfy your savory and texture craving. Their foods constantly being made fresh & they make their poke daily. That means they can run out for the day unfortunately. So don't go too late like I did one day around 8 PM! I recommend their spicy poke, moist but crispy katsu, flavorful wings, well-cooked brown rice, & Mac salad. Also, don't forget their sauces on the side! Simple concept but satisfying food."}
{"text":"Delicious!! The Wings and Katsu are the best I've ever had! Mac salad was delicious and I tried some of the sweet corn and it was amazing as well! Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"I have had this placed booked marked for soooo long and finally got the chance to try it. I called in to make an order and to see if they had mochi chicken for the hubby. They had mochiko chicken wings. Even better. They were so patient with us (we were super hungry and indecisive lol.) 
We walked in, everyone was welcoming and hungry. They were 12 people deep waiting in line. We walked right to the register and ready to pay. Food was almost ready (called 6 minutes prior) so they're super speedy!

We ordered a large bowl consisting of mochiko wings, poke, teriyaki chicken, white rice. All their sauces on the side and a glass of water.  

I would recommend this place to friends and family. There is also a dessert place right next door. Cookies and ice cream to finish it off right. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place when they first opened, but not so much anymore. I used to eat here twice a week because it was that good! But just as another reviewer mentioned, the portions get smaller and smaller each time I come here. The last time I came here, I ordered a small mochiko chicken and it came with 3 small pieces of chicken for almost $7 (they charged me an extra dollar for the mochiko chicken). The employees are not the same as before but they're all pretty friendly!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian food serve like chipotle, zaba's and cafe rio style. The food is just alright, but bank for your buck tho. 
The food LQQKS better then it taste , I got the 2 entree.. Mochiko wings (3) and steak teriyaki (which was a bit chewy) it was flank steak and not much flavor.
The 2 sides where kimchi coleslaw and macaroni salad both was OK! 
The decor is very simple with no pictures or color.  The table and chairs is just plane and boring.

I don't think I'll be coming back, it's one of those restaurant you try once and THAT'S IT!!"}
{"text":"Just found my \"go to\" place for quick and simple Hawaiian take out! It was my first time there, and the staff was very helpful. It seems like a very friendly place.

My favorite combo at the moment is: Teriyaki Chicken, Kalua Pig, Kimchee Slaw, and the Macaroni Salad. I like that their Teriyaki Chicken is marinated. Other places just make bland chicken and pour some sweet sauce on top. You can taste the smoke in the Kalua Pig, which I like. The Kimchee slaw goes well with everything and brings a nice balance to the meal. The Mac Salad is also good. Will need to come back to try the Mochiko Wings and the Poke. The menu is small, but I I don't have a problem with that. Keep the menu small so you can concentrate on the quality."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. As soon as we walked in, I felt like I was back home in Hawaii, it must've been the Hawaiian jams they were playing . Anyways, the Hawaiian poké was perfectly seasoned!! It was so delicious!! Everything we ordered was delicious!! We will deff be coming back with families. I'm glad my brother referred me to this place!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, 1st saw it on Yelp & thought the portions would be small. Been there twice so far & haven't finished a plate yet lol"}
{"text":"This place has a chipotle vibe where u can choose ur options. Looked at reviews n almost decided what I wanted to eat even before entering. They covered most of the options so I couldn't c what they looked like. I ordered the medium plate with pulehu steak(big mistake) and the Hawaiian poke. They had it covered like I mentioned n it didn't look very much like steak when they added to my bowl. Didnt taste much better. My sides were kimchi slaw and sweet corn. My mom was going to order the mochiko chicken but it looked burnt so she changed to teriyaki chicken and the chicken katsu with kimchi slaw n Mac salad. I tried a taste of everything my mom had too n it was ALL good except that pulehu steak. Maybe ask to look before choosing. If the steak looks like the one in my picture pick something else lol"}
{"text":"I got the salad with poke and sesame dressing to go, it was delicious and I'm super excited to have a place serving poke so close to the house.  Will absolutely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the food this place puts out. Great chicken and steak and of course even better poke. I love the combo meals and they make it so simple to order!!"}
{"text":"Opened early in the year by brothers from Oahu, this Hawaiian fast food restaurant follows the popular Subway/Chipotle assembly line format. With different meal sizes and formats there's something for any sized appetite. The \"Ono'er\" has been my go-to size with two choices of meat and two sides. The teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu are the standout proteins, of the ones I've tried. The pulehu steak was a bit tough and the kalua pork slightly under seasoned, while the macaroni salad is the side dish not to pass up. For a fast food spot, Makai is a clear winner for a quick bite at affordable prices with large portions."}
{"text":"This place smokes any other HBBq I been to from NoCal, SoCal and Vegas. I see people gripe about portion size and I don't get what the gripe is. It's plenty of food. The quality of each item is what makes the difference. The chain places are garbage compared to this place. The wings are legit and the tuna cuts are legit as well. Not the stringy junk they serve at some of the poke places around town."}
{"text":"Just visited this restaurant, was \"helped\" by Tino, I asked him to sub out rice for extra mac salad but he refused to, though there had never been an issue with that request in the past. He laughed at me for asking about the portion sizes for chicken as he cut me six pieces for two orders instead of what I had been informed was the standard 5 per order. I asked him why he was laughing at me and his response was a sarcastic \"no reason\". I felt incredibly disrespected as would anyone, I'm not sure as to why he would think that was an acceptable form of service. There were two other employees around who both apologized for the employee when he walked to the back, who mind you, sent another employee around the corner to look at me, laugh and walk back. The food here is good but the atmosphere is tainted with cruelty. It's not hard to find Hawaiian BBQ in Vegas, you'd think they'd teach their employees to be respectful given the immense amount of competition."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Staff was friendly and restaurant was clean. Always enjoy eating to some good island music. Definitely going to come back for more."}
{"text":"Hawaiian hits Vegas! Interesting concept and price point is on point. Under 10 bucks gets you a ton of food. I got the large place. Came with 3 different meats. I tried the Mochiko wings, Teriyaki beef steak, and Poke. The sides were rice, corn, and macaroni salad. I can probably eat this stuff on the daily. Great comfort food served in a round tin foil. It quickly gets crowded here for lunch. You get a little bit of everything and it all has that island flavor. Thanks to my buddy Drew for posting about this place.

Recommendation: Mochiko wings, macaroni salad, and poke"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. My go to is the chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki with mac salad and kimchi slaw. The price is actually really decent for the amount of food you get. There's a small which you can choose one protein & one side. I usually get the medium which has two protein and two sides. They also have a large which has 3 protein with two sides. All come with white rice (brown rice has an extra fee). 

They also have Poke for extra fee.

I love this place especially after the gym."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for my birthday weekend. Not a huge fan of hotel buffets. Prefer local eateries. Saw the reviews on this restaurant and decided to give it a try. So glad I did! Food was amazing! Tried the pork and Katsu. My boyfriend tried the steak. All of it was great. Definitely will be back on my next Vegas trip. Wish
I could take some home with me"}
{"text":"We've been so excited to check out this place, and we finally got to tonight! When we walked in, we were promptly greeted and the young lady at the front explained their menu and even offered us various samples to help us decide.
I got a large bowl with the teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, and kalua pork, along with the tossed salad in ginger dressing and corn!
MM MM MM! Everything tasted fresh and authentic. The teriyaki they use here is slightly sweet, and gives the meat a great flavour. (also try the spicy version!) Their katsu is by far my favourite! 
This is by far the best Hawaiian restaurant I've been to in town. I'll be back, and I think if you enjoy a fresh approach, similar to Chipotle, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I've been on the lookout for some bomb island food and I think I've found one to add to the list; probably top 2! 

Once you enter you get into the queue/line to the left and there's a huge menu that describes the size of the plates and what it comes with. Since it was my first time here with my kuya last week, we ended up asking a bunch of questions and were given some really friendly service and great advice on what to order. The lady that helped us as well as the lady that cashed us out (I'm sorry, I wish I knew their names!) was soo sweet and helped us order within minutes. 

TIP: We wanted to try almost everythingggg, and ended up making the most of our money by adding a quarter pound of poke each because it's just a bit larger than what they would give you if it was a \"meat side\"! 

DELICIOUS food, great and friendly service, and the portions are pretty generous for the amount that you pay. I'll definitely be back whenever I'm on this side of town!

EDIT: their names are Kim & Chelsey! I came in and they both were there just as friendly as before! Thanks ladies!"}
{"text":"The crunchiest Katsu chicken I ever saw. Or heard!  I knew it was going to be great when he chopped my piece into strips. The crunch was loud and proud.  I also got the mochiko chicken wings. Also very good, but not in the same league as the Katsu. 

Got mac salad and garlic edamame for my sides. The garlic edamame is served cold but I think it would be way better served hot. Served cold it just doesn't work for me.  Wished I had ordered double mac salad because that was the money side. Not the best I ever had, like on the Big Island, but better than Q&Q or other places with Hawaiian items on their menus. 

Beverage situation includes some canned tropical selections and a self serve Coca Cola dispenser. The Coke machine features Strawberry Fanta. Don't see that every day. 

Mikey C says: did I mention how crispy the Katsu is?  I did?  Ok then."}
{"text":"Been going here over 5 times and the service and food is still amazing! One of the girls there remember me now hah!"}
{"text":"Yum! To preface, I've started to watch Hawaii Five-O (the remake) on Netflix and it's made me miss Hawaiian food. After a gym session (with a trainer who is Hawaiian), my husband and I were doing Yelp searches since we aren't sure of what to eat for dinner and up pops amazing reviews and photos of this place. I struggled with going to a healthier place but said, \"screw it, I want good food right now\", and we made our way over here. Ordering is Chipotle-esque, which reminded me of Braddah's, but I do think the food here is better than Braddah's because I immediately wanted to go back (went back after 2 days). In comparison, I haven't wanted to go back to Braddah's since I first went even though it's a close option for me. 

So what to get? Depends on what you like. Both brown rice and white rice are available (brown rice is 50 cents extra). I really like their flavorful and tender kalua pork and pulehu chicken. Mac salad has macaroni and bits of potato and is perfectly creamy. My husband is a big fan of the mochiko chicken wings; I haven't even gotten a bite in of them yet because he gobbles them up. I tried their toss salad as a side - they include candied almonds and I got the creamy sesame dressing. It's very simple but packs a lot of flavor that pairs well with the rest of your food. Portions are very generous and prices are amazing. To get so much food for under $20 bucks for two people is ridiculous. I even saw some big guys unable to finish up their plates. They have a variety of sauces on the side, but be warned, the to go cups to place the sauces in are a bit flimsy (a few bursted on me on my short drive home), so if you're taking to go, I think it's best to just put the sauce on your food directly before you head out or place them inside your plate within the cup. There was a substantial line for lunch today, which made me very excited, because I hope this place does well. The owners I have met are very kind and their staff seems happy to work there and be part of what they're doing."}
{"text":"Had the Ono'er which was plenty of food for the price. Rice to entree proportion was on point. Got mine with the teriyaki steak and spice poke with mac salad and kimchi slaw. Poke was very good, steak was nice and tender. Loved the slaw but wasn't really a fan of the Mac salad. It was good but didn't like having the potatoes in 'em.

Service was fast and even after a line built up after us, they had a pretty good system going to get customers taken care of. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Addicted. I don't care if I have to drive all the way here. Katsu is crispy just how I like it, mochiko wings are flaaaame. Medium size bowl for $9. U get more for what u paid for!"}
{"text":"This is the only place in the world I can get all my favorite things in one meal. Ahi Tuna, Steak, and Chicken Katsu with rice, edamame, and another side. I can fill all my cravings in one sitting. By far my favorite pacific island grill in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The spicy ahi poke is what gets this restaurant two thumbs up and 5 stars. Prices are more than fair, and the staff is very friendly. Dining area was clean. Great place to grab a quick lunch before you have to dash back to work. So glad my boss recommended it to me! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Have to give this place five stars. It's very affordable but they definitely don't sacrifice on the quality of food. Excellent service too!! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because it had high ratings. Walking in we were greeted by a staff member and I noticed that the place was pretty empty considering it was dinner time. The workers here do not have much energy or very welcoming and I did not see a single smile. One of the workers proceeded to tell us that they were out of katsu, kalua pig, and poke. I was extremely disappointed because those were the three top choices of meat I wanted to try. In the end I got a medium size bowl with chicken wings, puleho steak, brown rice, kimchi Cole slaw and salad. 

To start off, the puleho steak was probably the best thing out of my bowl, especially when you eat it with their spicy sauce. The chicken wings were disgusting because 2 out of 3 of my wings had the feathers on it still! I immediately threw it away and just proceeded with my food. My salad came with a choice of either sweet onion or sesame dressing so I sided with sweet onion. The sweet onion sauce had a peculiar color because it looked like pepto bismol medicine. I decided to dip my fork in it to try it and it was WAAAAY too sweet. The whole time I watched the worker put my food into the bowl I felt like I was getting all the leftovers even though they still had two hours till closing.

Overall this place is okay. Their prices are pretty decent and you shouldn't expect much service because it's basically like a fast food place. I'm not sure if I would come back because I've read previous reviews that they always run out of poke and kalua pig by a certain time and those are the two items I want to try most, not to mention their chicken wings had feathers on it still. If you want a good experience, I suggest going during the morning or afternoon when more meat choices are available and you don't get the leftovers."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot! Clean and great food! Lovvvvvvvve the food!!! I wanted to go and order seconds"}
{"text":"Went here because I had friends recommend it to me.  Walked in and  wasn't even greeted.  The girl just looked at me and smiled (at least she smiled).  I ordered the medium plate with Kalua and Chicken Katsu with Kim Chee slaw.  Food was real good, BUT sorry the Chicken Katsu was dry.  Even with the Katsu sauce it was too dry for me.  I didn't say anything since this was my first visit, but made me wonder if these owners ration everything.  I get they have to weigh the Poke, but when I saw the girl at the counter cutting up the Katsu, put 4 strips of chicken (not lying) on the plate and then put the rest of the chicken back in their pan, just made me think, back home the whole chicken piece is the order!  Kalua was the bomb, the Ahi Poke!!! YUM!!  I was in heaven eating this. I'll eat here again definitely.  This food is really like home."}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious the brown rice is winners I never order brown rice but here is a must everything is so flavorful the best all the time never changes pelehu steak and kalua pig with Mac and Toss salads with creamy sesame dressing to die for yummm!!! With spicy poke a must yesssss...."}
{"text":"I honestly love Makai. For me, there aren't too many places around town that you can get a homecooked-feel type of meal. Makai fills that void. I always get the medium sized plate and for the price ($7), it's hard to beat. Sometimes I feel like the meats get a little on the fatty side, but that's nothing new for Hawaiian joints. A good friend of mine consistently gets the Chicken Katsu which he loves because of how moist it is. 
The thing that I love about Makai the most is the POKE! It's amazingly delicious. Fresh, clean, and delicious. I've even introduced it to my mother who NEVER eats raw fish and she enjoyed it. I've read some reviews about how some people felt it wasn't okay for them to run out, and I actually 100% disagree. If Makai only makes a certain amount of tuna every day to consistently keep things as fresh as they have it right now, I'm okay with it. I always call ahead of time and confirm availability or hold a pound or so to ensure I'm not disappointed. Because a trip to Makai and walking out without tuna would certainly be a disappointment! 
The restaurant is run by three brothers who really provide great customer service, a quality product, and at a great price. How can you go wrong with Makai??"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Makai?! I'm obsessed with Hawaiian plate lunch, and Makai is affordable and delicious. 
It's the perfect build-your-own plate lunch that is assembled in a jiffy via Chipotle-style lunch line.

Pick 1, 2, or 3 proteins (upcharges for stuff like poke or steak, but it's totally worth it).

Pick your sides. As always, you gotta get mac salad. I always like corn here, too, for some reason.

Sit down almost immediately and feed your inner monster. It's hard not to shovel your food into your mouth; it's so good! Satisfying and not too sweet. Parking is a no brainer in this shopping center, so easy in and easy out!"}
{"text":"So happy that Makai opened up!  The food was so Ono (delicious), the place was clean and the food was served w/ lots of Aloha!  I ordered the Ono'er (2 meat combo, upgraded to poke [raw tuna salad] & teriyaki steak), it came with 2 scoops of white or brown rice and 2 sides.  I chose the Onolicious fresh kimchee slaw and Mac salad. I love that you can upgrade to add poke cause sometimes you don't feel like ordering a full plate of poke to yourself, when you just want a little variety w/ your plate lunch combo.  Instantly, I was happy that they offered that.  The price was reasonable and the quality of the food was excellent.  I also got to try the teriyaki, pulehu chicken, & mochiko wings from my family's plates and those were sooo tasty too.  I would definitely come back for some more onolicious eats!  Support your Locals!  Eat Local!"}
{"text":"Makai is one of my favorite Hawaiian spots in town! Honestly they have one of THE BEST kalua pork I have had since I visited Hawaii! I think their portions are great and they have three different bowl sizes to accommodate everyone's appetite. I usually get the kalua pork, the ginger salad, and brown rice but once in a while I feel like I can step outta my comfort zone and order something else but its all good because everything here is bomb. I would give 5 starts but the customer service could be improved, the people behind the counter are pretty robotic and lacking in emotion and smiles. Haha as long as the foods good ill keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This is the BANG for your buck deal to the fullest! I absolutely enjoy every single item served but the fact the poke is made daily is also a major plus to the quality! But I definitely recommend this spot hands down!"}
{"text":"Service wise, I would give this place a 5 star. They usually greet me right when I come in, ask me if I have any questions, etc. 

I ordered the medium plate with a choice of two meats and two sides. This is usually a good portion for me when I'm just the right amount of hungry. I got the Mochiko chicken and the spicy poke. Now, I'm not really the best judge of poke but this place is always a hit or miss. Sometimes it tastes bland, sometimes it's too spicy or just the opposite. I can say with confidence that their Mochiko chicken is one of the best I've had. 

Their Mac salad is also delicious! Go crazy with their sauces because they leave it near the drink machine so you can take as much/as little as you want. My gf mixes the spicy and non spicy sauces. I, on the other hand, is a fan their spicy sauce. I practically drink that. 

I wish they had other locations that weren't so far on this side of town."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often, and no matter who is working you'll always be greeted warmly. The atmosphere is nice and the music is great, makes me feel like I'm back home.

My go to order here is the pulehu steak, brown rice, and mac salad. Sometimes I'll order some spicy ahi on the side. Regardless of what I get though, the food is fresh and always tasty.

There are lots of places to sit inside, and their outdoor area is nice and spacious as well. Perfect place to just chill and talk with friends and family while eating great food."}
{"text":"Pretty average food. Not many choices. With all the hawiian places to eat in Vegas this would not be first on my list. But it is a convienant location for me so I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and order the medium (two meats and 2 sides) along with rice. Great deal for less than $8.00 and could not even finish more than half of it. I ordered the chicken wings and chicken katsu for the proteins. Staff very friendly too and had the Aloha spirit."}
{"text":"First time eating here and tried it because of the Yelp! Reviews.  Me and my husband tried the Ono'est which had 3 proteins and 2 sides.  The serving was a lot but we never had the intention of finishing it in one sitting but we just wanted to try as much of their proteins. The mochiko chicken was my favorite it had just the right amount of sweetness. The teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu was also good. The Kahlua Pig was so tender and moist and the Spicy Tuna Poke was not too spicy and it was my first time trying Poke and I think it paired well with the rice. I loved their Kimchi slaw and it wasn't too overpowering. The staff were very helpful since it was our first time. They have all these different sauces for the meats. And for 22 bucks including tip (which was optional) you really get a lot for your money and had leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"This place is rad. They have really delicious poke - fresh and flavorful. A really great place to stop to be able to get a healthy meal on a dime that will fill your belly. :-)"}
{"text":"Got the ono'est with three choices of meat, two sides and a base. I got mochiko wings, chicken Katsu and spicy ahi poke. As for the sides, I got garlic edamame and kimchee slaw with brown rice. So good and worth the drive. Great prices. The only negative thing was that my Katsu was full of fat and barely any chicken.

They do need to add spam musubi to the menu!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out while visiting my cousin. It was alright. It kind of reminds me of ordering a Chipotle bowl. You pick your base of white rice, brown rice, or salad + meats and side. I got the one item of kalua pig with mac. My girl got the poke with mac. The kalua pig was definitely better tasting than the poke but it was too salty to me. The poke is kinda standard. The mac was also too salty. It did have potato bits in it which was kinda nice.

There was a lot of people here and the staff is friendly but I thought the food was just okay."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for poke. FREAKING BOMB!!! I prefer the spicy poke, but the Hawaiian poke is also delicious. I usually get the Ono' est (large) with white rice, katsu chicken, teriyaki chicken, spicy poke, spicy kimchee, and garlic edamame. SO MUCH UMAMI!!! They have a spicy 'yaki that just goes so perfect with everything, but as you can probably tell, I like the spicy stuff!! Please go get you some of this, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I got there a little before closing and was told it would take about 8 minutes bc they were making the meat to order.  I ordered a teri chicken bowl and it took about 10 minutes.  You assume that they are either reheating it on the grill bc you see someone at the at grill and you are waiting longer than normal .  I was surprised that when I got home (less than 10 minutes) the chicken wasn't even luke  warm, maybe even one piece cold.  It was a bit disappointing and misleading.   The chicken was charred at some point but I just didn't understand the wait and the chicken being cold."}
{"text":"Island girl approved! Ordered the Ono'er with Pulehu chicken and steak, kimchee slaw and garlic edamame as my sides and one serving of yummy spicy ahi poke!!! This is what home (Hawaii) tastes like! Real homemade quality food, quick and friendly service. I love the condiment station with local flavor options and Sriracha.  Best part it's in my neighborhood! This is officially my fave Hawaiian cuisine joint in Vegas to date.

And their sticky rice is spot on! \"Hawaiian\" food chains often don't."}
{"text":"Everything you choose will be absolutely amazing. The Pulehu Steak, mochiko chicken, and spicy poke are delicious! The combinations are endless!

It's always been busy the few times we've gone. Now that the word is out that this new food spot is up there as one of the best on this side of town, expanding would be ideal. With that being said, there needs to be signage put somewhere that due to limited seating and the high volume of customers, customers shouldn't be allowed to reserve seating until they've gotten their food. The space is small with very few tables. 

Tonight, my family and I walked in and waited in line to order our food. A family of I would say 15-20 people walked in and just sat down while some of them walked to the back of the line. The 15-20 people already in line had nowhere to sit while the family of 20 sat without ordering. One of the kids they were with took some of the sriracha sauce and teriyaki sauce bottles (the ones next to the soda machine) to the table and began to put some sauce on his finger, licking his finger and then putting more sauce on his finger after. Mind you, this kid was touching the hole from where the sauce was coming from. Disgusting. Where was management during this busy time? 

Still doesn't change the fact that the food is amazing, so I'll only deduct one star for tonight's bad experience."}
{"text":"Out of poke - really!? - very disappointed. Maybe you should have fish available if you come all the way over to get what they are known for."}
{"text":"Finally we have a bomb place for island food! And priced reasonably, There hawaiian style poke is so fresh and full of flavor. This is now my new favorite place."}
{"text":"You all are amazing!!! We came in for the first time today. The location was clean and the staff was so friendly. The gentleman who put our meals together helped my son pick his meat by showing, and explaining, each choice. The food was amazing as well! We are definitely going again and can't wait for the new location that is closer to us!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG I Love this place!!! Why have I waited so long to come here? So I really love Hawaiian food and this place has definitely made it to the top of my list! The fact that there are so many different Hawaiian places in this area makes it tough to choose however I might have to place them as a new favorite! I came in last week pretty close to closing time which I hate doing but I was hungry! That didn't stop much though! Even though the selections were minimal since they were about to close I was still able to get some of my go-to dishes such as the chicken katsu and teriyaki steak! I was greeted right away by one of the employees in the lobby and he was so friendly and helpful! Even told me don't worry about feeling bad that they were getting ready to close! With knowing it was my first time he helped walk me through their process and become familiar with how the menu worked! The food portions are huge and well worth the price you pay! I believe I got the medium size bowl that allowed me to choose two meats and two sides! I'm in love with the macaroni salad and decided to double up on that along with my two meats! I will be back very soon to try out some of the seafood options!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to eat a Hawaiian style plate lunch so I brought her here and got her a medium size bowl which contained 2 choices of meat, choice of white or brown rice and choice of 2 sides. The price is also very reasonable.

There was a sign that said they were known for their mac salad so naturally I had to give that a taste. I also tried a sample of their katsu sauce which surprisingly was very good. The flavor in that sauce is on point.

My friend had the chicken katsu with the kalua pig, white rice and a double serving of the mac salad.

The mac salad is one of the best. They use little chopped potatoes which actually makes a huge difference that turns the texture around.

The fish surprisingly tastes very fresh so if you're looking for a spot for poke then come here. They will even let you take a sample before you decide to buy. I asked where he got his fish from and he was able to answer my questions before I even got to ask any of my other questions about the fish so they do know what's important information to us and I appreciate that. 

I'll be using this place as an example for my friends what we on the islands eat daily."}
{"text":"Second time here and I'm not gonna stop. This place has some of the best kimchee slaw around. It will fill you up and for a great price."}
{"text":"I've been there once a week for the past month. Love the ahi and all the meats, macaroni is on point. Slight obsession with this place right now."}
{"text":"They cook food and put them in heated stainless steel containers, when I got there the food looks like it's been there for hours. Got a large 3 meat, the portion combined is smaller than what I got at other places. If you freshly grilled Hawaiian food go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Aloha Everybody.
Excited that we had another hawaiian restaurant in Vegas, we finally decided to make the drive from da east side to Makai which is way out there. Happy for those who live on that side with the convenience of a local style restaurant in their neighborhood. All excited for some pulehu chicken which was on the pictures I looked at in yelp. We get there and the girl who by da way didn't greet us, just looked at us like ok what do you want. Being that is was our first time there didn't know anything about da menu or the different size of plates they had. So, we start to order. I proceeded to order da pulehu chicken and pulehu steak combo, well to my disapointment, even tho da pulehu chicken is still on the menu, they discontinued making pulehu chicken. Being a guy who likes to eat, I decided to go with da large plate with 3 choices of meat. Went with da pulehu steak, kalua pig, and teriyaki chicken. This is where I start getting disappointed. Da steak was already cut up, sitting in a container which I can only assume is hot. I could already see da fat on da steak turning white like it is getting cold. I'm thinking maybe they going to micro it but duh it's in a aluminum container. Da portions were not quite what I'm used to being that I just came back from Hawaii. Large plate I guess meant larger portions of rice. Da teriyaki chicken was burnt and also already sitting in a container. Kalua pig was sitting in its juices, thinking ok that looks good. At this point da only friendliness I got was from da cashier, who flipped the screen and told me to pick a % on how much to tip. I still gave da max 15%, \"support da locals\". 
Sat down to eat, and wow da kalua pig was super salty, da teriyaki chicken was burnt, and as I thought da pulehu steak was cold. My daughter loves shoyu, so I put some on her rice. Aloha shoyu is da bottle but it was watered down. She had da chicken katsu and da sauce tasted like ketchup and worterchier mixed. No real katsu sauce. I am by no means a food critic and not here to put people on blast, but this was not a good dining experience. 
Da staff should have more ALOHA, it wasn't busy at all to be rushing us on our order. Not to mention, not even assisting us first timers with da menu. Maybe that should be da first questioned asked. \"Aloha is this your first time here?\" It was to obvious that da reason da cashier was a little friendly, was because of da tipping aspect of our encounter.
If you don't sell items on da menu anymore, please take it off da menu and somehow inform your customers on da website or yelp.
Poke was horrible, they only had one kind which was spicy tuna. Not spicy at all.
Da lack of communication from da time you walk into da place needs to improve to include taking items off da menu.
Da food is like \"LUNCH WAGON\" food. It's like someone went to a construction site in Hawaii and brought da lunch wagon back to vegas and stuffed it in a restaurant. Da food would be perfect for sweaty construction workers and people at da beach. Not really good for a restaurant type atmosphere. 
If da owners did a few tweeks to improve da quality of how da food is stored before serving, how its cooked (over cooked and over seasoned) and teaching da staff to spread \"ALOHA\" to all da customers who come in. This place would be a perfect addition to da hawaiian community who live in vegas. 
Sorry it was a long review guys, but I think this place could potentially be a great place to eat at. Mahalo for reading."}
{"text":"Always looking for new spots and this is close to my next appointment. Certainly didn't disappoint. 

I got a medium plate with the chicken katsu and the Kailua pig. Wrapped it up with brown rice, macaroni salad and the sweet corn.

Let's start with the chicken katsu. Might be the best I've had. They are making full pieces of chicken breasts and slicing it to order. The breading was crispy and the chicken was moist and delicious (oh yeah, I said moist *wink wink*). Kailua pig was also tender and very tasty. What can be said about macaroni salad and corn? Get out, they didn't mess it up.

Service was quick, the price is hard to beat. If Hawaiian bbq is your jam, definitely check this out. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I tried this place w the kids and it was good! A little disappointed they didn't have Mahi mahi but they made it up with the ahi poke."}
{"text":"Awesome food , good Local Hawaiian food choice especially the poke. Large 3 choices plus 2 sides 9.99 can't go wrong. Very friendly staff and clean environment a place to come back to."}
{"text":"This place was super ono! Didn't get a chance to take a pic of my food cus I was to damn hungry but,  sooooo Yummy! Me and my bf got a medium plate which felt like a large which was awesome cus I felt for the price you get a bang for your buck. 

I got the Teri chicken and Katsu, I felt like I was back in Hawaii with the flavors. I wanted to try out there spicy poké cus no place here I tried yet has hit the top like Hawaii does. Nothing ever taste as fresh as Home, but their poké was fricking amazing! The flavors were on point n the fish tasted fresh, so glad it's just a walk away, if I'm craving the taste of aloha we know where to go now. 

We both were pleasantly surprised that it was as good as they claim."}
{"text":"So glad they opened up a second location near my work!! This place is the best! Best island food in Vegas. The large plate with chicken katsu, Teri chicken and the ono Mac salad.. this place is da kine!! Definitely have to stop here for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This place.. Da kine  I had the Ono'est plate with my choice of 3 meats and two sides and two scoops of rice. I had to try all my favorites: Kaula pig, teriyaki steak and teriyaki chicken were my meat choices. For the sides I went with Mac salad and Kim Chee slaw. Prices are good and portions are even better. Let's get down to the food.. The max salad is probably the best Hawaiian Mac salad I've had out here. The kitchen slaw was a first for me and very good with a nice amount of spice. The Kaula pig was a little bland but juicy and tender. I think places out here are afraid to salt the pig... Just salt the pig! Lol. Chicken and steak were very good. I think I found my new spot and it's close to home. Onolecious!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Every dish is full of flavor. Huge portions. Quick service. This is probably the best Hawaiian food I've ever had"}
{"text":"Love the food at this place and the staff has always been nice. Only thing I can say negative is that towards closing the meat is not always readily cooked (in which case you get it cooked right off the grill unless they are out of tuna... then you're out of luck) I like to get the two meat medium bowl. I like their teriyaki chicken and the spicy tuna. I like to get the salad and macaroni for the sides. Their spicy yaki sauce and BBQ sauce are both great!"}
{"text":"Makai is ma guy for Hawaiian food. I usually get the Ono'est (3 meats + 2 sides + rice). You really can't go wrong with anything here. 

My favs: the chicken katsu, mochiko wings, poke (both regular and spicy), kimchee slaw, mac salad, and their garlic edamame. I've had the Pulehu steak twice, but they were dry both times.

Service is friendly and accommodating. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. With the Ono'est, I usually have leftovers. 

Will most likely be back in a few days..."}
{"text":"Makai is the place to go here in Vegas if you're looking for solid Hawaiian food. The portions are very generous. I got the Ono'est, which is their large bowl, and I tried the Mochiko wings, Pulehu steak, spicy mayo poké, and sides of their garlic edamame and kimchi slaw. The highlight for me was their poké, which was a little unexpected considering it's not what they specialize in. The mayo was light so I could really taste the freshness of the tuna. The Pulehu steak was a little dry and chewy (tasted like jerky), but maybe I got a bad batch? I also heard that their chicken katsu was dank so I'm gonna have to try that next time! 

Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Makai presents itself with the same set up as your typical Chipotle with the option of assembling your own meal. I got the large portion with 3 protein options and 2 sides. Here's the catch, the protein option is not a set base price for all protein which makes it a bit misleading. If you decide to get the steak it's extra, if you get the poke it's extra. I have no problem with paying more for better quality meat but it should be made more clear. As for the meat itself, they sit in warmers which did not do a great job keeping the meat warm. The steak was tender but the poke was very salty. Now on to the sides, I chose to go with the mac salad which was good and the garlic edamame was as well. Makai is a nice option if you're on this side of town and seeking a clean Hawaiian food option. There are areas where they could improve but if you get just the basic meats without up charges it is a good deal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I aren't usually on this side of town, but we wanted a healthier alternative and this place caught our eye. When we got there, the workers were really friendly and offered us samples of everything. 

The teriyaki chicken was really good. I also got the kalua pig, the salad and garlic edamame. It was definitely filling and satisfying. 

The only thing is that the cost can start to add up with any added extras, so it's not the cheapest meal around, but definitely good."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot. Price is affordable and poke was good. Coming here again for sure! Hubby isn't a fan of Hawaiian food but he tried. Coming again next week to get my poke fix and his Mac salad. I wanted to  take a pic of my plate but got too excited lol"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes Awesome food. Love this place and the location. The staff is always nice. The tables and entire restaurant is always very clean and the food is consistent"}
{"text":"This is the best local food I have had since moving to Las Vegas! The Chicken Katsu is so crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside, and the macaroni salad is some of the best I've ever had! We come with our family once a week for our cheat meal... it is incredibly affordable and so much healthier than all of the other alternatives. If you're looking for a new place to eat at, this is it!"}
{"text":"This fast-casual place is churning people out like crazy. Like a sandwich line where you tell them what you want and it's prepared instantly. 

I ordered the small which is the perfect amount of food for one person. You get a protein, rice, and a side. I don't think anyone actually \"needs\" more than that lol. I noticed it can get pricey if you choose the more expensive proteins or want brown rice. (I hate it when the more healthy option costs more -_-). It's $1.25 extra for ahi tuna, plus .50 cents for brown rice. Not too bad but I'm always looking for good food AND a good deal. The chicken katsu was cooked perfectly, not too dry but still had that great crunch to it. The mac was a little too creamy for me, but I can see why everyone loves it. It compliments everything really well. My chicken didn't even need the sauce it came with, that's how good it was on its own. 

It's right down the street from my hair salon and my nail salon, so I can't easily see this becoming my go to for a fast, delicious, and satisfying lunch!"}
{"text":"Went here around 6ish for dinner..they ran out of poke which I came for which was a bummer but I stayed and tried the katsu and mochiko wings. Boyfriend got kalua pork and chicken katsu. Kalua pork was kinda tasteless ..chicken katsu was good but the katsu sauce tasted like straight ketchup which we didn't really like..the mochiko chicken wings was OK..I had a chicken wing with a feather still on it..the sides was probably the best thing...the Mac salad was good..kimchee slaw was also good but a little too salty. Hopefully when we come back the second time they will have poke. Service was good that's why I gave 3 stars otherwise I would have put 2."}
{"text":"Super excited about this spot! I was craving some poke and it was the closest to my house... now I cant stop going back! Not only is the poke amazing but the way its setup so you can try a little of everything is what I loved! It brings me back to when I was in Hawaii. I could come back here once a week for my poke craving and have some chicken katsu as well! They are always busy when I go in, so you know its a great spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious Hawaiian food. So happy we decided to try this place.

I got the chicken katsu and teriyaki chicken.
Sooo good! Tastes like a genuine island bbq.

Definitely be sure to get their kimchee slaw, it tastes amazing. Already looking forward to my next meal here."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice a week since it opened. I'd probably go more if they were open Sunday, but I digress. 

I've had almost everything on the menu, and haven't been disappointed. My favorite is the Spicy Ahi and I try to get the corn or edamame- although the macaroni salad is beyond excellent. I like the simple menu, and the fresh take on the usual Hawaiian.

The service is fast and friendly, and we recommend it to everyone who comes into our store (which is nearby)."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Hawaiian food. Yelped Hawaiian food and they popped up. Glad we decided to stop by because their food was bomb! I love their Mochiko chicken! Customer service was fantastic! Makes me miss Hawaii! Will stop by again when we visit our parents in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oh no I hate doing this :( the meat hasn't been the same the last 2 times I was there... VERY dry!! Both pulehu and Teri steak! Also chicken was hard! Whyyyyyyy:((((( it was perfect before. The worst mistake in a business is inconsistency! :("}
{"text":"I stopped in the other day because I read all the 5 star reviews. I'm so glad I did!! The chicken teriyaki was amazing!!! I can't wait to go back and try all their other meats. Definitely go check it out!! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy at all had it and that night it made me throw up all the food I ate. I don't know if it was the meat or something else but it wasn't good at all. Would recommend checking the meat before eating it."}
{"text":"Makai Grill, I hate to rain on your parade but this place was so disappointing. I came here based on all the rave reviews. I waited in line for nearly twenty minutes. Now that is incredibly long when you got a Chiptole like set up. 

I ordered Katsu, Teriyaki steak, with 2 sides. The Katsu was so over cooked I took 2 bites. Not to mention the sauce for the Katsu was terrible. Ok, now the steak. I paid $1.00 upgrade for steak and no kidding, worst steak I've probably ever had. It was so chewy, no matter how much I chewed i would of choked if I continued to try. The bathroom toilet was broken, and their 6 bottles of teriyaki sauce were all empty.

So I put the lid back on after about 4 bites total and gave it to a homeless dude."}
{"text":"Got the large bbq plate with katsu chicken, teriyaki beef and chicken and a side order of spicy tuna poke. The bbq plate was good specially the teriyaki meats. The poke was fresh and super tasty. plate comes with two scoops of rice and choice of 2 sides. We got green salad and macaroni salad. Lots of people came for to go orders while we were at the restaurant. The food is truly ONO."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmie!! I love POKE! 

I got the two kinds of Poke and rice. One is shoyu tuna poke and the other is spicy ahi tuna poke. It came with two scoops of rice. My friend got chicken katsu, shoyu tuna poke, mac salad, edamame and two scoops of rice. Now that was a meal in itself. All the food was delish. Everything flavorful with the taste of the islands.  

The place is cute. Big enough for a couple of groups. Clean and well organized. The sauces for chicken and stuff are on the counter. Serve yourself soda pop. Staff is friendly and helpful with the food items. Great job to the owners of teaching them well manners. 

I can't wait to go back. It's delish here."}
{"text":"Best place to go for fast and simple Hawaiian food!! Mochiko fried chicken and Teri steak with salad and their sesame dressing the best!! Onolicious and two thumbs up !!"}
{"text":"Finally got to check this place out and I'm so happy I finally did! When people say it's just like Chipotle yes they are but with them they're not shy with the rice! This place is absolutely amazing I wish they'd open another location closer to me."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place. This is one of my go to places for chicken katsu, wings and teriyaki chicken. The poke is good too! I always find the best variety of Hawaiian Sun here and theres tons of sauces to take home. I will always keep coming back."}
{"text":"Not a wide selection of items, but definitely authentic! Great portions, food is absolutely delicious! Dedicated to their food! You gotta be to slow cook kalua pig for 14 hours! This is our new Hawaiian food place! Hubby even said this tastes just the way it did when he was in Hawaii."}
{"text":"I use to love this place back then i could barely finish the plate but now ate the whole meal was still hungry!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to grub here in Vegas. Always providing me great service and hooking it up with the best portions. Pricing is on point. The pulehu steak is money and can't go wrong with their poke as well. Teri-chicken and Kalua pork are also good protein choices to get when I want to change it up. 

I always leave Makai feeling satisfied. Definitely a must go when you need that island style grub to make them muscles grow!!! 

Big shoutout and Mahalos to Makai for always helping ya boy with the GAINZ!!!"}
{"text":"everything was amazing and the portions were great ! my boyfriend and i were looking for something quick and fast and this just did it! especially for our first time. even though it's kind of far from us we will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Went here once earlier and gave them a 5..... Several months had to go back to verify.......seriously off the hook... Best Indian food in Vegas..... Great environment.... Saag is wonderful..... Highly recommend....."}
{"text":"When you walk in, the place is clean and nice. They play some good Hawaiian music and the vibe is good. As I wait in line, I anticipate in getting the pulehu. As I proudly order the ohn'er, I say I would like the chicken pulehu! And the man says, I'm sorry, but it has been discontinued. The room got dark and the trees started to die around me. I then proceeded to order the teriyaki chicken and the Kalua pig with macaroni salad and sweet corn. The teriyaki chicken was okay. Nothing special from the other places with teriyaki chicken. The chicken was a bit dry, but still edible in its form. The Kalua pig, was too salty for me. I don't eat pork, but I took a few bites and thought it was too salty. I gave the remainder to my BF, which he gladly ate. Overall, nothing wowed me, but it's a great place for cheap and fast food. I'm not sure if I would come here for my Hawaiian food cravings, but if I was hungry and needed something fast. Sadly, the high reviews didn't meet my expectations and fell short for me."}
{"text":"Service was quick. Chicken katsu w/ teriyaki chicken 10/10. Side of macaroni and kimchi. Their Da katsu Sauce was probably the best sauce I've sampled in a long time. Definitely returning with more people."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is the real deal. I can't really add any fresh perspective since they have so many well earned 5 star reviews already. I stopped in and ordered the Ono'er(medium) $6.99 with kalua pork, spicy poke ($1.25 upcharge), macaroni salad, & garlic edamame with a white rice base. The spicy poke and the macaroni salad are outstanding! Both of these are worth the trip here alone. The pork and the edamame are really good. I would definitely order them again but may switch them out next time to keep trying their menu. The service was prompt and friendly. You get a great value for the price. This place will definitely become a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"This place is yummy! I got the medium option that came with two choices of meat and two sides and rice. I got katso chicken and teriyaki and I loved them both equally. The mac salad was exactly what I hoped for it was perfect. Edamame was my second side and it was good as well. Coming back again. My entire office was a huge fan"}
{"text":"I love the concept of having a chipotle styled L&L but L&L is nothing compared to this place. The prices for the meals are relatively cheap for what they give you. The Katsu was dry, the kimchi coleslaw was really salty, and the macaroni salad was missing something because it tasted just like mayonnaise. If you do visit try the spicy sauce located near the soda machines bc it adds a kick to the plates they offer. 

Would I come back? Probably not. I feel like you're well more rounded at L&L."}
{"text":"I always love Makai when I am craving something good and fast. Love the choices and love the fact that everything is ready to order. They have options for healthy and unhealthy diets lol.

I always get the same items when I come here. Brown rice, spicy ahi, pulehu steak (or teri chicken depending on my mood lol), and double salad with creamy sesame dressing. 

Food is always good and service is always on point."}
{"text":"Oh this is a keeper! Lots of ways to customize your Hawaiian plate. And you can have poke as one of your meat choices! Which I did, the spicy poke. Also had delicious teriyaki chicken, 2 scoops of rice, Mac salad and kimchee Cole slaw all for seven bucks. Beat that. Hurry to this place, also clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"I love the Mochiko Wings, will try the poke next time around. I also like that it's near my work. Looking forward to the Rock Springs location, will be my dinner stop on the way home."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out because I love poke.. I guess they are known for there poke heard its usually sold out before 7pm. So I ordered the chicken teriyaki salad w/ sweet onion dressing.. Im the type of person that hates salad but I'm trying to eat healthy and I'm so glad I ordered it.. That was one of the best salads I ever had in my life. I am definitely coming back to this place . I just wish they can put a little bit more meat on the salad but other than that it was perfect! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Authentic Hawaiian food. They recently opened and I stopped by yesterday. A casual, super clean, airy place. They offer healthy option and ordering your food is simple. The food is already cooked and ready.  Choose your size (small, medium, or large), your meats ( Pork, Chicken, Steak, or Ahi tuna), then your base (white or brown rice), and finally your sides ( mac salad, corn, edamame, veggies, or kimchee slaw).

I got a small order of their popular Chicken Teriyaki $4.99 , salted Edamame with brown rice $.25. The second order was Kalua Pig with Mac salad. The pork was so tender, juicy and flavorful.

Makai also offers A la Carte if you don't want combos. Also must try their Mochiko Wings. 

The service is friendly. Great value for the price!"}
{"text":"Tried this place and the concept is nice and the poke was very good, but the steak was extremely thin and only had one option which was well done. I would definitely come back for poke."}
{"text":"Food is great and the people are really nice. Good environment always leave full. They are a great post workout treat"}
{"text":"I have become so addicted to this place! Their food is so amazing and you get so much food for such an amazing price!! If I could go there every day I definitely would. My favorite is definitely the chicken and steak with brown rice, macaroni salad, and corn!"}
{"text":"Was recommended here by a friend and I am so glad we went. Food was Ono, service was good and the vibe reminded me of Home (Hawaii) SATISFIED!"}
{"text":"We ordered two takeout plates each with two main and two sides.  We tried the mochiko chicken, kalua pig, teriyaki chicken and spicy ahi for the main choices.  For the sides we tried the tossed salad, Mac salad, kimchi slaw and corn.  Everything was tasty and the only suggestion to the owners would be to separate the cold items like the poke, tossed salad and mac salad from the hot items when making a take out plate.  

I also remembered that the white rice as our base wasn't very good.  It either wasn't cooked right or the quality of the rice wasn't very good.  As a Hawaii born Japanese, rice is very important and it can make or break the whole dining experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here. I usually get a medium which comes with two scoops of rice, two meats, and two sides. With that I get white rice, their teriyaki steak is so delicious, along with Hawaiian poke, for my sides I get mac salad and sweet corn. Good prices as well."}
{"text":"I usually get the teriyaki steak and poke. I never leave the place unsatisfied. Clean restaurang and friendly staff. This may be the best place to get hawaian food fix in town."}
{"text":"Gladnie, Mana, Brayan were the best! They were so friendly and helpful because this was our first time at Makai. We had a large with tonkatsu, teri chicken, poke, rice and kimchee slaw, soooo ono! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in the shopping area where Makai is located and decided to try the food out.

My son had the chicken katsu, my husband had the poke, and I had the mochiko chicken wings.  The wings are a MUST try!!  The katsu and poke were delicious as well.. The menu isn't like an L&L BBQ, but it's similar.  Overall, the family and I loved the food, especially the wings.  The prices are very reasonable as well.

My only complaint would be the white rice.  I think it was cooked with just a tad too much water, which of course is an easy fix.

The people working there seemed extremely friendly with that \"aloha spirit\".  There's plenty of parking and best off all; they're right next to Sweet Addiction if you're craving ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"The service was awesome great people working there the place was super clean!!!

And the food WOW!!!!! Very reasonably price had 3 adults eat for $21 and it was amazing !!!!  

This is my new Favorite Place to Eat!!!!

If you like good food go here!!!"}
{"text":"Makai is one of the best Hawaiian BBQ spots in the Southwest area. They are a bit more expensive than other places, but I think it's worth it. Their portion size is bigger than most places, by the way. Some items were slightly over cooked, but nothing was too bad. Their protein selection is relatively small, but they have all of the \"core\" Hawaiian BBQ items. The service was good. The interior was clean too.  I think Makai is a good lunch spot."}
{"text":"I been here a couple times, the food and service have been excellent everytime. You also get a lot of bang for your buck, the portions are huge! I can eat but I have not been able to finish their medium plate both times that I have been. The staff is also super friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have.
 I will have to say the mac salad is probably my favorite thing on the menu (I love my carbs people). As for the proteins they serve, they are all good (I cannot speak for the beef because I haven't tried it yet). I am not a huge chicken wing fan but theirs are delightful! I will probably get them every time I come because they are that good. The chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu is also very good. Perfectly cooked!  I have tired both poke options and it is good poke but not the best I have ever had. If you are in the mood for poke, it gets the job done and it is very reasonably priced. I would probably order some of the other protein options before the poke just because the other protein options are so good!
The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because a couple of items were really salty (the corn and Hawaiian poke) but this in no way will keep me from coming back because the food is that good!"}
{"text":"Great customer service In-store and on the phone. I recently ordered a pick up order. The food was ready no less then 5 minute. Since I requested the food to be ready soon as possible. I like how they ask what time you'll be in to ensure the food is hot and fresh for you. Clean environment and greeted as soon as I opened the door. Thanks. Love the new location!"}
{"text":"There're expensive and stingy with their food. Not a true Hawaiian spot. Go to island flavor it's 100x better"}
{"text":"TLDR: Chipotle-style ordering; Americanized flavors; quick service; minimal options 

After passing by this location on several Sundays, I decided to make a special trip with my friend when they were actually open. To my surprise, it wasn't a full service restaurant, but that's ok because it just meant we were going to get our food faster. 

You place the order at the front service counter depending on the number of meats and sides to order. The availability of proteins were limited. I opted for the tuna poké, Mac salad, and white rice. They offered a regular Hawaiian-style and a spicy version. When I asked the serve the difference, he rudely stated \"Well the spicy has mayo and sriracha. Does that help?\" No it doesn't snatch because I've never been here before and I want to know the other sauces. If you're tired of explaining the differences, then make a sign. Either way, I opted for the spicy version. The other server weighs the exact amount of poké for the $1.25 upcharge. 

I left hungry and unsatisfied. The poké was of poor quality. The mac salad containing potato bits was flavorless and left much to be desired. I question the amount of fellow Islanders in line as the food and service wasn't even worth the trip. Their teri sauce was super oily and the total food portions were very small. Definitely an Americanized version overall or maybe just a bad batch of foods. The 4.5 star rating is very confusing and I wonder if the reviewers have ever had true Hawaiian food. 

Needless to say, I won't be coming back to visit anytime soon. A serious change would have to occur in order to earn my business. (Not even a yelp check-in offer would entice me to visit in the near future.)"}
{"text":"Another quality restaurant for us \"ninth islanders\" to get our Hawaiian food fix. One thing That makes Makai stand out is that everything is ready! When you order your food, they are actually making your plate or bowl. No waiting!!! Plus the portions can't be beat for the price. They even carry poke everyday. So if you find yourself in the area, stop by and try it! Ono Grindz!!!"}
{"text":"I finally tried Makai and I definitely was not disappointed! 
First of all, portions are crazy huge here! My friend and I shared a medium sized bowl and we were both full and happy! 

We got the teriyaki steak with spicy mayo poke I believe? The poke bits were big and flavorful! The steak was good but dry, so I'd probably get something else instead. The steak and poke are additional charge to the base price. 

As for our sides we got macaroni salad and kimchi slaw. The kimchi slaw is so so good!! I'd probably get that as both my sides! It also came with 2 scoops of rice, so again, plenty of food."}
{"text":"Great place to get a big meal for good value. I typically get a Medium (rice, 2 meat, 2 sides) with white rice, katsu, mochiko wings, and double garlic edamame. It's a lot of food and I can rarely finish the whole thing in one sitting unless I'm really hungry. If you order katsu, they cut it right in front of you before they add it to your plate. Don't forget to grab some Katsu sauce before you eat! I personally don't eat Poke, but when I eat at Makai with friends, they rave about how good the Hawaiian style Poke is. They order it every time we come, so it must be pretty darn good. 

Their system is similar to Chipotle/Subway where you go down a line, tell someone what to put in your order and so on until you reach the register to pay. Sometimes the line gets pretty slow and it seems like they run out of stuff often, then you have to wait a bit for a new batch. Maybe I'm a little unlucky, but they never seem to have mochiko wings when I come in, so I end up having to get double katsu more often than not. I'd recommend coming well before closing time to ensure that they'll have the meats you want. I typically take my order to go, but there's plenty of tables if you choose to eat in. Still though, Makai is a good option to fill any cravings for Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot ! Food is really good and the amount you get for the price is well worth it 
I get the small bowl and I get soo full ! Definitely recommend the teriyaki chicken ."}
{"text":"Came and got dinner tonight it was awesome!!  Between the two of us we had some wings teriyaki chicken and chicken Katsu.  It was all awesome!  Cooked just right and full of flavor!!  Both brown and white rice were spot on as well . Also had garlic edamame and macaroni salad!  The guys were fast and super friendly!  We wi definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Need to figure out how to get over the portion control by weighing every little thing and figure out how to serve more than one person every 5 minutes.  Make sure you plan accordingly if you plan on eating relatively quickly."}
{"text":"Very nice place! I ordered the large bowl - 3 meats, 2 sides and a base. My favorite was definitely the katsu, since I am a big katsu fan. Even though I noticed it was not the freshest, due to its being the last piece, it was still delicious and crispy. I had seared ahi which was delicious, and chicken wings which were also good. Their macaroni salad is good - I would definitely have that again. The same goes to their garlic edamame. My only complaint was the rice - it was a little stale and dry, you had to dig deep into your scoop for it to be delicious."}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying this place easily deserves a 4 star rating. Their staff is friendly, the food is delicious, and the service is generally quick. 

Lately, however, I've been coming here and they don't have any poke left. They say they make a batch of it every day and whenever it sells out, it sells out. I typically come here at around 6:30 or 7. The place closes at 9. Not everyone has the luxury of coming to a restaurant early enough to order one of their 6 or 7 menu items before it sells out for the day. Additionally, I frequent all the time and this used to never be a problem, so it seems like lately they are making less poke every day to maybe save money.

Their food is delicious. And I still recommend eating here. But they would receive a much higher rating from me if they didn't \"run out\" of one of their main menu items 2 or more hours before closing.

Also, to piggyback off of other people's reviews, they definitely take their time to weigh out portions of meat when the difference in weight and cost to them is very miniscule. It is kind of frustrating to watch."}
{"text":"Super good food super good proportions really loved the quality for the price def going back..."}
{"text":"Omg!!! This place is soooo good!! Love everything they have on their menu esp their original poke! Price is also reasonable for the amount of portion you get! I would say this would have to be my favorite hawaiin restaurant to go to:)"}
{"text":"One of my go to local food joints in Vegas now! I usually stick to the medium size plate that comes with two meat options. I have tried the chicken katsu and teriyaki chicken. Both are tasty and the portions are BIG! You also get to choose two sides including mac salad, kim chee, and edamame. 

I've also gotten spicy ahi poke and it's not bad at all. One of the better ones I've tried in Vegas. Nothing will ever come close to poke back home in Hawaii, but this certainly hits the spot when I get the hankering for some local food!"}
{"text":"Tried this yesterday and was very good I ordered mochiko chicken, chicken katsu, and teriyaki chicken with white rice salad and kimchi. I have to say it was all so good I love the kimchi chicken was all good not dry ."}
{"text":"Mahalo a nui for filling up my opu! The spicy poke and teriyaki chicken were on point."}
{"text":"Might be might favorite place in Vegas but let me explain. First off best Hawaiian restaurant I've been to and I've been to a couple. First off if you make your plate right it's very healthy, teriyaki chicken and poke come on, and  to add that it's very tasty. The steak is amazing the mac salad is fire and the kimchi slaw bomb dot com. I have to stay here for three weeks been here twice and I'm coming back because the price is right. Plus the service is great tried the chicken wings as a sample might get that next time. Roll past that in and out and stop by here it's"}
{"text":"So I've never been to Hawaii before, so I don't know how good the poke is there, but if it's anything like Makai, then OMG I have to go to Hawaii soon!!! I tried the spicy tuna poke and words cannot even describe how delicious it was. I've only really tried the big chain Hawaiian food spots like L&L and while they are good, Makai is on a whole other level. The Katsu was perfectly crisp and flavorful and the kimchee slaw was amazing! If you're in Vegas this is definitely a must."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food in town. I literally eat this place every day for weeks on end and never get sick of it. Fresh and delicious ingredients. Great staff. Nuff said"}
{"text":"Literally the best Hawaiian food in town. Great fresh ingredients. I eat here for weeks on end without ever getting sick of it. It's healthy and hearty. Great for my active lifestyle"}
{"text":"I work across the street and have had customers tell me how amazing this place is so I decided to give it a try! I was not disappointed!! I got the Ono win white rice (it's nice and sticky!!), Mac salad (it's so creamy but not overly mayo tasting!) and teriyaki chicken. The whole meal was so satisfying! Try it out!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, reasonably priced, fast paced, assembly line style HI food! The Poke was good as was the Teriyaki Chicken. Surprisingly no Short Ribs tho. Really good, but wish they had the beef ribs and a variety of Poke's rather than just 2 :) ALOHA!"}
{"text":"I love makai!!
Simple, delicious, and doesn't break the bank. 

This was my first time coming to this location and my first impression was how clean everything was when I walked in. 


The guys helping me were both very friendly. 

I always get the teriyaki chicken + one other protein, like the wings or shredded pork

I have to check a side of Mac salad and corn every time, it's just too good. I love the way a little but of the Hawaiian soy sauce tastes drizzled on the Mac!"}
{"text":"Dude......so good, so affordable and so fresh!   I will sooooo be back!!  I had the clerk give me her favorite small plate!  So yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is good, but I only come for a pound of poke, seriously \o/ 

Located at ROCKSPRINGS and Lake Mead, look for this in the same strip mall as In and Out, that means across the street from Chipotle.

Oh and if you have ever been to a Chipotle, this is kind of how the place is set up.  Go to the far right and start ordering what you want, pay at the end, sit down and eat.  

I can't wait for them to expand their poke options outside the spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Oh so close to a 5-star!  More on that later.

Being a native Maui (Built) Boy, naturally I wanted to support our local small businesses.  Especially when it comes to local Hawaiian food!  Run by actual Hawaiian locals!  None of this, I'm L&L Hawaiian BBQ or Ohana Hawaiian BBQ...but owned and run by all Chinese folks!  Ah, da pilao!  Pilao!  No offense to you franchisees, but who behind the line am I gonna run Pidgin English by?  I want the food...but I also want the friendly banter!

Luckily, Makai Pacific Island Grill owned and run by genuine kine locals!  Da kine dat understand da Pidgin!  Good for me, not so good for mainlander folks like the wifey.  Oh well, it's okay bebe, let me do the talking!

This place is pretty far for us to drive to but on a Friday night we decided to make the little trek on down to the SW side of Vegas.  I think it was a little after 8 PM so it wasn't very busy, maybe only 2 or 3 other tables occupied.  That gave us a lot of time to look at the menu boards and talk with one of the owners behind the counter.  Pidgin accent do I detect?  Oh yeah, howzit brah!?  \"Oh yeah, you from Oahu?  Yeah, yeah I from Maui...\" and so on, and so on.  Within a 5 minute conversation I was able to easily navigate through Makai's menu.

Very similar in style to Chipotle as well as another local-run joint Braddah's.  Except instead of stuffing it into a burrito or a taco, you get a fancy foil bowl.  A taste of Hawaii, all in one!

 First you choose your SIZE of bowl:
*Ono (small) $4.99 - 1 meat, 1 side, 1 base
*Ono'er (medium) $6.99 - 2 meat, 2 side, 1 base
*Ono'est (large) $8.49 - 3 meat, 2 side, 1 base
*Bowl $5.99 - 2 meat, 1 base
*Salad $7.99 - 2 meat

Then you choose your base:
*White rice
*Brown rice (extra)

Then you choose your business (meat):
*Chicken - Teri, Pulehu, Katsu, or Mochiko Wings
*Pork - Kalua
*Steak - Teri or Pulehu (extra)
*Ahi Tuna! - Poke or Seared Poke (extra)

Then you pick a side:
*Garlic Edamame
*Corn
*Grilled Veggies
*Mac Salad
*Toss Salad
*Kimchee Slaw

Things on the line were dwindling that night so I asked if for our order they could cook us up fresh, not a problem!  Hot and tasty stuff from the grill.  We ordered:

-Ono'er bowl with rice, chicken katsu, teri steak, mac salad & kimchee slaw
-Ono'er bowl with rice, kalua pork, pulehu steak, double mac salad
-Salad with kalua pork, pulehu steak & creamy sesame dressing

Food was ONO!  Grilled items great with the papa'a (burnt) edges just like I like it.  Flavor was good and the katsu was moist & crunchy.  Mac salad was cold & simple the way it should be, kimchee slaw was a nice surprise!  Not too spicy.  Rice was actually cooked CORRECTLY!Wifey & kid liked their bowls as well, we pretty much sopped it all up!  

Don't forget the secrets here - shoyu & furikake on the rice (ask at the counter), shoyu, pepper, and Tabasco on the mac salad, Da Katsu Sauce on da katsu!  Sauces are clearly labeled at Makai!

OK, only reason Makai didn't get a 5-star?  They ran out of POKE!  NOOOOO!  Locals in the know, know that hot rice & cold poke make a person happy.  Next time Makai, make sure get poke for last all day long!  

Another plus for Makai though, they serve Coca-Cola products!  Plus for me anyway.

Makai Grill, I will be back brah...but make sure, bettah make sure, get nuff' poke for when I come around!  

MAHALOS!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. I had the Ono'est with mochiko wings, kalua pig, and pulehu steak. Their brown rice is done well, and the wings were amazing. I'll be coming back here many times."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch! Its pretty cheap considering how much food you are getting. You can pick what kind of meats and sides you want, and the number of meats and sides depends on what size you choose. I would definitely recommend getting their spicy poke as a meat and their kimchi slaw as a side! After purchasing, they have a great selection of sauces for your food. One of my favorite places to go to when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"If your looking for real poke and real local food made by Hawaii people, dont look any further. This place has ono food at great prices. Portions seem small until your full with food still in your plate. Definite new favorite"}
{"text":"This place is just bomb af, the best katsu I've ever had. I always go for the large plate and get all katsu white rice and the macaroni. I cannot fathom the feeling I get when I come into this place."}
{"text":"Cute and good location 
Next to boba tea. But...Not a lot of options to choose and over priced... for the size. 
Rice was very hard and poké is too small 
Ono plate doesn't come with ono !! Lol"}
{"text":"Makai has been on my radar for awhile. I never made it out SW so I was excited when they opened their Lake Mead location. 

Both times I went it was pretty slow. I have to say I never rushed here because I just couldn't imagine it being that good. I was pleasantly surprised!

Makai serves Hawaiian plate lunches in a non traditional way. They have you choose white or brown rice THEN you add proteins! They have a lot of classics and then they have some special items that make the cost go up like poke and mochiko wings.

The food was all really good. I enjoyed everything. My recommendations would be their poke and their garlic edamame. The classics are done well and really hit the spot like the chicken katsu and the kalua pig.

My one gripe was the noticeable portioning. Hey man I'm all about food costs and making a living, but the first visit I had one of the servers take some food out of my tray because the portion was too much I suppose? Come on guys! Be a little slick! 

Overall I support local businesses and I'll definitely be back. The food hits the spot and it gives you a variety instead of ordering a huge serving of only one entree."}
{"text":"This was place amazing! I live in Henderson & made the 30 minute drive to try Makai out. It was definitely worth the trip, & I would do it again. The service was great & the food was even better. Everything was reasonably priced. For 2 scoops of rice, a serving to teriyaki chicken, some spicy poke, garlic edamame, & macaroni salad & a drink it was about $10. I still had leftovers. You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, and I really wanted to like it. The poke was good and the steak was average. I didn't like the corn, even though I always love getting corn with my local plates (you know, the ones in Hawaii that are school fundraisers). I didn't think it was that much food despite the price, and even though I normally have a lot of leftovers, I left a bit hungry. The poke is a tiny serving, especially because they charge extra. I may try them again, but I won't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Makai Pacific Island Grill - Rock Springs (same parking lot as In-N-Out)

A few months ago, I was at the In-N-Out off Rock Springs and noticed that Makai Pacific Island Grill was opening soon.  I've always been a fan of the OG location.  I couldn't wait for this location to open.  Finally, Makai is open!

Makai Pacific Island Grill serves Hawaiian food that's big on taste, big on portions, and small on price.  Ordering your food is simple...choose your size (small, medium, or large), your meats (chicken, pork, steak, or Ahi tuna), your base (white or brown rice), and finally your sides (edamame, veggies, corn, mac salad, or kimchee slaw).  I usually order the Ono'est, which is their large.  The large comes with 3 choices of meat and everything is weighed to the ounce.  The chicken Katsu serving is 4 ounces, Teri chicken is 4.5 ounces, and steak serving is 3.5 ounces. That's 12 ounces of meat for only $9.99.  Dem Gainz at a cheap price!!  Makai also offers their food a la carte if combos are not your style.  Welcome to the area, Makai!  I'm sure that you will be seeing me again soon, very soon."}
{"text":"All Good!! It's all good here at Makai.  All of my experiences at Makai have been really good ones.  This is fast Hawaiian food at its finest.  Ordering your food is simple...choose your size (small, medium, or large), your meats (chicken, pork, steak, or Ahi tuna), your base (white or brown rice), and finally your sides (edamame, veggies, corn, mac salad, or kimchee slaw).  

The pricing is as good as it gets and I dare you to find another restaurant that sells quality Hawaiian food that even comes close.  The Ono, which is their small, is $4.99 and comes with your choice of one meat, rice, and a side.  The Ono'er, which is their medium, is $6.99 and comes with 2 meats, rice, and 2 sides.  The best value is their The Ono'est, which is their large, is $8.49 and comes with 3 meat sources, rice, and 2 sides.  Steak is an extra buck and the poke depends on their current market price.  I had their bowls and love the teri chicken.  I also like the fact that you can also order a la carte.  My most recent order was a side of 5 oz. steak and a 1/2 lb. Spicy Ahi Poke.  Both were great and at that price, a steal.  Overall, I do recommend and wish a place like Makai would open all over Las Vegas.  

2017 Yelp Review #41"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for the first time. I ordered delivery. I appreciated that the restaurant called and informed me they were swamped and the delivery driver would be at the house shortly. They wanted me to know it wasn't the driver's fault. The food was delicious and worth the extra wait. I see why they were swamped. Definitely will order again. Next time I will order an extra ginger sauce. OMG! It was so good. I'm full and satisfied."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming a new favorite place of mine. Between the affordability, the convenience of prepared food, the Quality of everything and the generous portions, there is almost nothing wrong with this place. I've still yet to have a bad experience eating here or picking up. Top quality"}
{"text":"Reason I gave this s 3, its because the taste so good but too much sodium!!! I was bloated and took a 5 mile walk, whoa!!! So staff were very friendly, thanks."}
{"text":"Where does one begin on something so amazing? I am completely obsessed with and addicted to Makai. I've tried a handful of the menu and have yet to find something that I wouldn't eat over and over and over again. I frequent here 3x a week. Both kinds of like, teriyaki steak, teriyaki chicken, corn, the edamame are just a few of my favorites."}
{"text":"The place is awesome!!!! The only reason why I have them a 4 stars instead of 5 was because the chicken had quite a bit of fat on it. The flavors where awesome!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Hawaii food I have had in Las Vegas!  Everything was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Its like Chipotle, but Hawaii-food!  

Got the ono'est plate with mochico chicken wings, chicken katsu, and hawaiian poke with side garlic edamame & kimchee slaw.  Mochico chicken was a bit on the dryer side, but still very tasty.  The katsu was very moist and crunchy on the outside... So hard to do, but it was perfection.  The edamame was good, and well spiced and not overcooked.  The kimchee slaw was something else!  Its like a normal slaw, but with a kimchee base liquid... So ono!  The teri chicken for the kids was also moist and flavorful, but right on the borderline of too much char for me personally.

And now the best part... The poke!  The hawaiian and the spicy ahi poke was probably the best I have had in vegas.  Fresh, cut right, and without all the stringy parts.  Perfect amount of spice!  Also a decent price (was $13.99/lb).  

As a tip, do not order poke as a protein option for your plate.  You pay $1.25 more, for a tiny little cup.  Its totally not enough!  Its probably best to just get a 1/4 pound on the side.

My only two real disappointments with this place... The Samurai Hawaiian Frost cups cooler was wrecked!  Hardly any flavors left!  Also no fruit punch to speak of in the soda dispensers...

Also don't go on Sundays!  They are closed... (Ohana time)

Totally coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"I'll second all the other reviews.  SOOO good and they are SO friendly!!!!!!  I am so glad I came here because of the Yelp reviews!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been to Hawaii so to me this is super good Hawaiian food compared to other Hawaiian restaurants in Vegas. I get the Ono and my boyfriend always gets the Ono'er and the portions are way to big for us! We usually just end up taking it home and we end up with the Ono'est.
If you're looking for great, cheap Hawaiian food with large portions this is your place! They also have really good ice cream, the orange is super refreshing."}
{"text":"Delicious all around!  Bummed they were out of Poké when we came for dinner, but it seems like a certain lunch hot spot so that makes sense. Not a fan of the cold edamame, but I can get over that in trade for how delicious my teriyaki chicken and Kalua Pig were--I'll be back again for sure; if not for the poké definitely for the island atmosphere and delicious cuisine!"}
{"text":"Okay before getting into the food, I just want to say that we've been here two other times specifically try their poke and they were out of them both times..
BUT! Third times a charm and they finally had poke. While the food was very good and flavorful, I wish they had more poke with the entrees. It comes in those little 4 oz cups."}
{"text":"Came back and this place is still amazing. The prices have gone up a bit but still a total steal of a deal. Tried the Pulehu Steak this time and it tasted so good!!"}
{"text":"I come here often. ! I definitely do always have a craving for this place. It's excellent if you like Hawaiian food. No much places like it out here In Vegas. It's a reasonable price too. A small usually fills me up. It's about $5/6. I get white rice. I love love love the teriyaki steak. And the corn. The poke is pretty good. Not the best ! Just cause I'm a sushi fanatic so it doesn't compare my satisfaction. 
But I definitely recommend to check this place out. The costumer service is very welcoming. And the menu is very clear. And the restaurant overall is very clean. !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Hawaiin fusion place to eat. Their food is always excellent and it's very filling for the price which is not bad either. Their seared ahi is the best in town."}
{"text":"Good food at a great price. I was just thinking I wish I could find place that has good teriyaki chicken? Look no further this is the place! Unfortunately, they were out of Kaluah pork and poke bit I heard from other patrons that these items are just as good. Sides include sweet corn, Kimichi slaw, salad, macaroni salad. Each plate comes with plenty of good sticky rice! Many size plates to choose from as well. Service is fast and when reggae music is playing that's always a plus for me. Great place to eat if your tired of regular Vegas fare."}
{"text":"Yum-Yum-Yum....is all I have to say! My Second Eldest Niece came here first, and said I have to try it when I was in the area. Yesterday, after our 2 hour shopping trip at Ikea, we came here. And, I must say...It filled me up really good!

How their Menu works is that you have your choices of 3 sizes...Ono (Small), Ono'er (Medium), and Ono'est (Large).

I saw a picture of the menu on here, so I won't go into great detail in that. I'll just give you the Basics.

Ono: Consists of 1 Serving of Meat, 1 Side, and a Base (White or Brown Rice).
Ono'er or Medium: Consists of 2 Servings of Meat, 2 Sides, and a Base.
Ono'est or Large: Consists of 3 Servings of Meat, 2 Sides, and a Base.
Bowl: Consists of 2 servings of Meat, and a Base.
They do have a Salad for I Believe 6.99

I had a Medium: Which was White Rice, Chicken Katsu, Teriyaki Chicken, Macaroni Salad, and Salad with Creamy Sesame Dressing( Which was Delicious)

I didn't think it was gonna fill me up, it did! I will admit, the portions they give are not as plentiful, and it may not fill most people up. 

My opinion?? I would definitely be back, should I ever be in the area...but it is too far for me! You don't have to take my opinion for it.....Try it for yourself! =)

Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Yup! This place is my new favorite for quick Hawaiian. I highly recommend the spicy poke. They have different containers for the weight of poke you want. I got a 1/4lbs, and it was plenty to go as a side for my meal. 

The only weird thing is they have a bowl that isn't like most places that have a \"bowl\". Basically, their bowl is the 2 meat combo without sides. You might as well just get the 2 meat combo because then you get 2 sides! I chose garlic edamame and kimchi slaw. I love kimchi, and this was a kimchi like coleslaw that paired great with the white rice. 

I can't wait to go back and try some more stuff."}
{"text":"Tried this place while waiting at a doctors appointment. The teriyaki steak was a winner for me. Brown rice wasn't cooked well but altogether was a good first try."}
{"text":"Amazingly outstanding customer service! Great food, at prices that is up to par with the food! Suggest this place of you just want to try something good that's affordable, filling, or just something new. My new goto spot close to home."}
{"text":"Could it be possible the food here is better than their 1st restaurant? Had my usual kimchee slaw with the teriyaki chicken and it was a lot more flavorful than I remember. 

Love this place and recommend it for a delicious cheap lunch ($4.99 for small plate)"}
{"text":"Traditional Hawaii dishes. Nothing too exciting or differentiating from any others around Las Vegas. However, it's not bad either. Their teriyaki chicken is delicious and their kimchee coleslaw was definitely a nice twist to the traditional kimchee side."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is delicious, my favorite is the pulehu steak with a side of the Kimchi slaw. The service is good, the portions are very generous, the price is reasonable, and it's overall a pleasant experience. They have catering services as well ;)"}
{"text":"I just had the worse experience from this place.  It's not the food but the customer service of this PoPolo guy.  He is very rude and NO ALOHA at all.  The last time I checked this place is owned by locals!!  Already texted Kawika the owner and let him know that we are furious and to be treated like shit by these non HAWAIIANS!!I was charged for Ono'est and I only received 2 types of meat!!  They made me wait 15 minutes so they can cook Chicken Katsu but I don't see katsu on my plate.  I don't think so!!"}
{"text":"Living in the 9th island for almost a decade, you will find plenty of Hawaiian cuisine to suite your taste buds. From authentic to super chain, you will find the best spots here in Sin City.

I teach at Blend Vegas right next door to this new place called, Makai. I didn't know what to expect, new restaurant, new owners, new chic cool, chipotle style decor. I had the steak and the spicy mayo poke. I was an instant fan. The marination of the steak and the freshness of the poke caught my attention because it tasted different and had that taste of the island. They have a good amount of meats to juice from, but I resorted to my usual steak and poke palate. The portions are worth it and the price point is not bad compared to some of the other spots in town. I recommend this place if you want a taste of home here in the 9th island."}
{"text":"This place is beyond delicious. I bought the \"Ono-est,\" which is the large platter. It comes with 3 meat servings and 2 sides. Both times I've gone, I had the chicken teriyaki, kahlua pig and palehu steak for my meats. Kim chi slaw is UNREAL and the macaroni salad is perfect. This last time I forgot the sauces they offer on the side and was already at home when I realized this. I was bummed, but after I started eating... The food is seasoned so well, it doesn't even need sauce. ESPECIALLY the kahlua pig. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I came back today. It was absolutely wonderful again. I tried the pulehu chicken, teriyaki chicken, and pulehu steak. All were awesome. Got the Californian poke, excellent. The mac salad & slaw were great too. This is my favorite Hawaiian spot in town by far.

I wish I didn't live way across town!"}
{"text":"I tried the spicy poke today and it was...drum roll...delicious!!! 
Mac salad was again, DELICIOUS! 
Teriyaki steak and teriyaki hockey is good! 
The pulehu steak is just salty, and tastes nothing like the pulehu steak from Bruddah's island style. 

Service- always friendly with a smile. Nice job!"}
{"text":"Craving for Hawaiian-Style food so I got some brown rice and teriyaki chicken meal with a side order of Spicy Kimchi slaw and their famous 1/2 lb Hawaiian Poke. 

Love their friendly staff and food is always fresh!!!"}
{"text":"First review of 2016! And boy, this place is AMAZING! Legit brok da mout!

3 brothers opened this amazing island eatz! They're legit island boyz, none of them imitation wannabes! This place is legitimately delicious! And not the small kine! I literally stopped eating my food to write this review. 

Upon entering this restaurant, you're kindly greeted by one of the brothers, he shows you his meats ;), and you make your creations!

The price point is seriously on point, 4.99 1 meat, 6.99 2 meats, and 8.49 3 meats ($1 extra per serving for steak and $1.25 extra per serving for poke.) Of course sides and a base. I decided to balls to the wall and get one of each, minus pork. The pulehu steak is seriously melt in your mouth delicious! Best I've ever had! The pulehu chicken is so succulent and delectable! The Ahí Poke in island style is out of this world! I don't even like fish! Katsu is tasty and not greasy! Mac salad is buttery and flavorful! And I'm legit the mac salad master, and this one is bomb!

The inside of this place is clean and beautiful and the employees seriously care here. They make sure the food is delicious and you are completely satisfied. I am just seriously blown away! 

I don't even live on this side of town, but I promise I will be here once a week! It's seriously, hella bomb! Man, I will add more to this, but food here is seriously onolicious!

Aloha!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be the best Hawaiian food you could get around this part of town but the longer it's been open, the less the food becomes. It tastes old and of poor quality. Service here is also lacking as staff always act as if you're an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Good kahlua pork. spicy poke was okay...not the best I've had, definitely not the worst. Got double salad for my side and ordered with the creamy sesame.  Unfortunately the guy forgot to put the dressing on...so can't rate how good/bad that is. Loved how quick the service was.  Super easy for in and out at lunch time. Pricing was great."}
{"text":"Twice in one week! I went to both Makai location here in town and both the food and service was good. The food in both locations were consistent and their chicken katsu is one of the bests that I've had. The poke is also fresh! Kimchee slaw here is also a must."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorites for island food.  Tried this place the other day and it definitely did not disappoint.  I got the ono'er and it was definitely enough food - good portion sizes.  The chicken katsu was tender and the steak was very good and flavorful.  I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great service and great food ! You can't go wrong with this place, it's fast so you can leave within 5-8 min if you're in a hurry. And make sure you get plenty of Da Steak Sauce cause that is the best sauce ever, put it on everything"}
{"text":"Let's just say I used to eat chipotle everyday and now I'm going to eat Makai everyday. It's delicious and everything is season well and tasty. I got the large plate with 3 meat and 2 sides. I got the pig, steak, and the chicken wings. For the sides, I got the kimchi slaw and macaroni salad. I also got a 1/4 of the spicy ahi poke on the side. Everything was so delicious. I like their sauce they provided on the side by the condiments. I loved their Kim chi slaw and the chicken wings. Perfectly made! Their steak was tender and the pig was too. Can't say anything wrong or bad about this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great food! Great staff! I've been here twice. And every time it has always been a great experience. The food is very tasty and is full of flavor not like some other places where the chicken is kinda dry. If you have not been yet you should go and check it."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out due to my love for Hawaiian food. I must is it like a chipotle/cafe rio style type of ordering. I ordered the Onoest (3 meats/2 sides) kalua pig, pulehu steak, and California style poke. 

Kalua pig wasn't dry. Nicely flavored and moist. 
Pulehu steak was very Ono. Cooked just about to medium. 
Cali poke was also good. Not too spicy and etc and I'm sure a lil more spice wouldn't hurt. Still good. 

One of the down falls was that the portions was not \"Hawaiian\" style. Meaning on the smaller side. U know them Hawaiians are not afraid to eat. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food I've tasted in LV! Been here so much times and they never disappoint me. Spot on customer service and food & lets not forget the great prices! Always brings me back home whenever I eat here."}
{"text":"This is the best Hawaiian chipotle style restaurant I've ever been to! Everything is wonderfully flavored and fresh! How do you keep your katsu so darn crispy?!  Salad, poke, rice the options are close to limitless for anyone in your crew. Carbo load and meat? Sure! Meat and Salad  only heck yes! Pass out on fried food it's there for you! The only thing missing is the Island view and the sand between your toes."}
{"text":"Love this place.If I feel like eating a plate lunch.Ono delicious.And the price is reasonable. And there close by."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place out yesterday for lunch and ah the grindz broke mah mouth lol!
I've been waiting for a place that sells poke by the pound since I moved here from Hawaii, well at least one that's close to me.

Taste:
My husband got an Ono'er combo (2 rice scoops, 2 meats and 2 sides) with brown rice, BBQ Chicken, Katsu, corn and cold slaw. The BBQ chicken was pretty burnt and hard. My husband came here first and said the BBQ Chicken the day he came was cook just right. Katsu was good.

I got a pound of poke in both half regular and half spicy. The spicy poke wasn't spicy at all.
But I understand that not many can tolerate spicy food. They had some sauces on the side which I didn't bother checking out so I probably missed out on some Sriracha or something so that was my fault. The regular poke was a tad, juuust a tad salty for me. Maybe it was just the batch. It wasn't too bad though. I had some of my husband's brown rice and mixed it with the regular poke to fix it. Other restaurant wouldn't bother on this but I do like that there are some seaweed and masago in their poke.

Quality:
It was BBQ chicken and Katsu, dark meat but cheaply priced so it was fine. Beside the pulehu being pretty burnt and hard. I honestly can't say too much about \"fresh fish/sashimi in Vegas\".

Portion:
The Ono'er was a generous size.

Price:
I believe our bill came out to around $25 no drink but including a 10% tip. It wasn't bad at all.
They charge extra $.50 for the brown rice option and $1.25 for each poke choice on the combo which was totally ok. A whole pound of poke was $13.99.

Service:
The employees were nice but should come out of their shell. 

Ambiance:
Love the music. It was like I didn't get off my car. The place was nice and clean. It was very similar to Chipotle's food concept and restaurant design.

Location:
Very convenient spot. Safe and open plaza. Will definitely add this to our new spot for when we pau grocery shopping.

Overall:
This is like Chipotle but Hawaiian, good concept. This place is better than To See Roll. I wish they had Mahimahi though.
I really wanted to give this place 5 starts but it's a 4 and a half for now. Well go back again and go from there. Overall it was still ono, mahalo!"}
{"text":"Makai - think: chipotle but for Hawaiian/Asian fusion cuisine. There are pre-made items that you just pick and choose.

You get to select what size you want, the smallest being 1 meat and 1 side. The next would be 2 meats and 2 sides. There were even options to make your own bowl or do an a la carte selection.

I chose the smallest. This was $5 and honestly was pretty satisfying - did not make me too full but I was good. It'd be a great lunch size. 

I ordered the teriyaki chicken with a side of garlic edamame and you get your choice of rice. Brown rice was a little extra, fyi. 

The teriyaki chicken was cooked to perfection. They have a station next to the drinks that has teriyaki sauce (+ a spicy version if you so desire) so you can add more or add it to your rice like I did!

The garlic edamame was cold. I'm wondering if you can ask for it to be warmed up as I didn't like it as much cold. 

Overall the food was enjoyable and I'd come here again for either a quick lunch or dinner. Definitely possible to go in & out if you're on a time crunch and the options give you a variety where you can try something new every time you come!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!!! and I love how they have the set up of this restaurant, It's like a chipotle but for local food. I do think maybe a little bit more meat portions. My chicken katsu, pulehu(bbq) steak, both pokes, and sides (corn, and chamber slaw) are amazing. The only side I didn't like personally was the kimchee slaw, it was a weird flavor but that is just my OPINION. My mom got the Kulua pig and teriyaki chicken and said it was good as well. I loved it, and I don't really care for local food places out here in Las Vegas. A+"}
{"text":"Went today (Thursday) about 4:15 and the place was empty. Obviously we looked like it was our first time, so we got the know how's explained to us. :) Got the Ono'est with the Pulehu Steak, Poke, Teriyaki Chicken, Mac salad, and Edamame for the sides. Between the rest of us we had almost everything on the menu. First time in there and felt like a cafeteria setting seeing the foods sitting already cut and in hot pans. Sometimes that's bad, sometimes it's ok. You know what I can say is \"Backyard Party\" time back home in Whitmore Village! Ono! Simple! Somewhat generous portion, and everything tasted like it was freshly grilled. Right on for the braddahs with this simple concept and clean atmosphere. The only thing holding me back from the \"5th\" star? You don't feel the ALOHA from the workers behind the counter and if you know what I mean, no matter the restaurant, place, time, it always make you enjoy everything that much better with a simple \"greeting\"! Recommended overall if you're on this side of town! Food is fresh, prepared and seasoned just about right. Katsu sauce wasn't katsu sauce, Teri sauce was too sweet, overall worth what you pay for."}
{"text":"SOoOOoO!!!!!!!!! GOOOD!!!!!! 
I ordered the teriyaki chicken and katsu oh my goodness, the bbq chicken was amazing I don't even like teriyaki and I ate mine and my boyfriends it was so good! The katsu was okay.. But this place is killing L&L by far!!! And I'm a big fan of L&L.. I ordered a ton of food and my total was only $25.00 which I thought was really reasonable for 4 people to eat.. 
The poki is awesome! I'm from Hawaii and I definitely will be coming here often!! And they have Hawaiian Suns so I'm a happy girl"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, we come here often! One of my Yelp friends visited this place & I've been coming here ever since/ like once a week lol
 they're fast -they're cheap- they're convenient -they're friendly & most importantly the food is super good quality & delicious like you can't believe -give it a shot you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and awesome customer service! 100x times better than that crap hole Sweet Poke. Delicious poke!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is OUTSTANDING!!!! The portions are generous for the price that you pay. Very fair and reasonable! I live across town on the north end of town and I drive out here quite often! So worth the 25 minute drive!!!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place on our last trip to Las Vegas (for my high school class reunion). The chicken katsu and kalua pig were excellent; the kim chee slaw and mac salad were tasty too. Loved that you can pick and choose in order to assemble the perfect \"mixed plate.\" Although I really don't care much for Vegas, I would come back just to eat here!"}
{"text":"The Mochiko wings here are 

Makai is a super casual Hawaiian BBQ restaurant. You order up front, customizing what you want to add onto your plate and then proceed to a self serve booth for sauces! I ordered a large bowl with mochiko wings, kalua pork and chicken katsu, for sides: the macaroni salad and the kimchi slaw. I shared with another person and the portion size was perfect for both of us.

I found the food here to be a little salty- especially the kalua pork! Other than that, the portions were reasonable, the line moved fast and the food was not bad. The mochiko wings were definitely the highlight!"}
{"text":"Amazing, love this place, love the atmosphere. Kinda like chick-fil-a you crave it the most on Sunday. I always get the medium with katsu and sometimes poke. The kimchi slaw is to die for, and i never liked kimchi until i went here. the edamame is good also. friendly service and quality food. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came because of some of the reviews from yelp and because I was craving some Hawaiian food after watching FoodNetwork. When you walk in the place is pretty nice and there's a lot of parking space.

Set up is definitely similar to chipotle where they put what you want in a bowl while going down the line.

I got the Ono'est (largest) where you get 3 meats and 2 sides. For the protein I got the Kalua pig, Mochiko wings, and Hawaiian style poke while sides I got macaroni salad and garlic edamame. 

Pros: The Mochiko Wings and Hawaiian Poke! The Mochiko wings were awesome. Sweet and salty and the chicken was still moist which is always a plus. The Poke was great. Nicely cubed and marinated with great flavor throughout. (But both have a fee to get them as a protein)

Cons: The pork and macaroni salad. The pork was way too salty. I had to take a bite of rice with it just to eat it. The macaroni salad I found was a bit saturated in mayonnaise so that's all I could taste which was a bit of a let down. 

Overall it was not bad. Would I come back? Maybe but I think I'll try different places to compare first."}
{"text":"I had the Kailua and katsu with white rice and Mac salad. The meat tasted great,  but the rice wasn't sticky rice, and the mac salad didn't taste like other Hawaiian places we've ate at I wasn't a fan at all (of the mac salad). Employees were nice, place was quiet and clean. Price was great for what you get."}
{"text":"If I could eat here everyday I would (its more like every other day) Idk how long this place has been here, but i swear it's a gem! I drive past this place all the time to go to my favorite Thai place next door. I finally stopped in. They have FRESH AHI POKE! ++++ I don't have to drive across town to get Hawaiian style poke that you can buy by the pound now. Or those little fake ass poke bowl places that are everywhere now, no thanks! Ordering is simple, menu is simple, & the prices are great. They also have Hawaiian sun products  (this is coming from a Filipino/Hawaiian) I just spent the past month in Hawaii visiting my family & this makes me happy to come back to knowing its next to the house. Better quality & freshness than L&L, & u don't feel like sh*t after LOL"}
{"text":"We received a flyer a few days ago and decided to try the food based on the very positive reviews that we read. Although the menu is limited, the assortment of food is as close to 'local' as you can get. The portions are generous and very ono, especially the poke and cabbage kimchee. Sure wish they could add lau-lau to their menu. They've been open only for a few months but hopefully 'word of mouth' will spread very quickly about the food and service. Really beats cooking. Inexpensive, clean restaurant, and outstanding service."}
{"text":"So this is not our first visit to Makai grill and we normally really enjoy it however tonight's visit was not as great as I remember it being.

It was a pretty busy night upon walking in and we already knew what we were having. 

I went with the Ono'er (Medium - 2 choice meat, 2 sides & rice) with Pulehu Steak $1.00 additional and Teri Chicken, mac salad and kim chee slaw.
And the Ono (Small - 1 choice meat, 2 side & rice) with Kalua Pig and corn. My little favorite!!!!

The pulehu steak was chopped up way too small and was not hot. And my mac salad was also not cold enough. I don't remember the steak being chopped that small the last time i had it but it almost was like I was a baby eating baby food. I get the portion control but it needs to be sliced or chopped bigger in my opinion especially for the extra cost you're  paying.

We will be back again hoping or next experience is a little better like how I remembered it!"}
{"text":"Oh I'm stuffed! Great food, easy menu. I ordered the large with katsu chicken,  kalua pork,and teriyaki beef.  Also macaroni and Kimchi slaw.  Very clean inside,  friendly service. It took a while to order but there was a huge family in front of us so I won't criticize that."}
{"text":"I traveled 2750 miles just to try this place! Nah j/k. We went to Trader Joe's just down the street and I stumbled across this place on yelp. I'm glad I did! The menu is kind of complicated and hard to understand but the workers are very patient and explain everything clearly. I had the large \"plate\" with 3 meats 2 scoops of rice and 2 sides, all of which were delicious! I especially loved their spicy poke! Bbq chicken was over cooked and kinda dry but the kalua pig was yum! I'd definitely return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Good portions and well priced. I always get chicken katsu, rice, spicy poke, Mac salad and garden salad. Love that this place is simple and service is fast."}
{"text":"Came here tonight to grab some dinner. My mom is in town visiting and I always rave to her about this place and how they have really good mochiko chicken wings. So I decided to take her there. 

First, there was no more poke. Not complaining, maybe had I come earlier, there would've been some.

Second, my mom and I both wanted the steak. Come to find out it's made to order so I was asked to wait 10 minutes, no big deal. However, 20 minutes later I was still waiting for my steak. Why it takes 20 minutes to cook steak is beyond me. 

Third, my steak finally finished but was told I'd have to wait for the mochiko chicken to finish frying. That's when I was like, what the hell. I just waited over 20 minutes for my steak, now you're asking me to wait longer for my chicken? Instead I said to cancel my chicken and I'll just take something that was already cooked. I was trying my hardest not to get mad. I used to be in customer service, so I didn't wanna be that customer that gave a hard time over something that was out of their control. I had my mom and 2 year old in the car waiting, so I was kind of in a hurry and was not expecting to be waiting for that long.

I really do think their system needs to improve. Because waiting over 20 minutes for my food was a little ridiculous. Customer service was still great, everyone was very apologetic. I might not come back for awhile because of what happened, but my mom said the food was still delicious and it was worth waiting for.

Oh and another thing, the person grilling the steak and chicken was spraying so much Pam on the meat while he was grilling it. Why?! Never in my life have I ever seen that."}
{"text":"Happy this place opened just down the road from me! I used to have to go to the Trop and Ft. Apache location for my \"island\" fill! 

It's great to see a place focus on a few menu items and do them well rather than serve everything mediocre. I really suggest anything that appeals to you on the menu and try it. Chances are, it will be good.

I prefer the teriyaki chicken, brown rice, and salad with the sesame dressing, but if you want some comfort food go with the Kalua pig with Mac salad!"}
{"text":"I love how this restaurant has a fairly limited menu, but the quality is very focused and on point. I order the salad with teriyaki chicken, or steak, with seared Hawaiian poke."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out from this place quite a few times, but this was the first time I actually ate inside. It was a Saturday around 12 and there was no wait or anything in the line and plenty of open tables. The set up is pretty small, but cute and the ordering style is sort of like chipotles set up. I also liked that they had a tv in the dining room with the top news playing.

My favorite go tos here are the spicy poke and garlic edamame. The small bowl was just the right size for me. I've also had the teriyaki chicken before which was pretty good, love the spicy teriyaki sauce! 

I recommend checking this place out for some tasty and healthy hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Makai has all the right elements to make for a great fast casual Hawaiian restaurant. A build-your-own plate style menu, a clean eating environment, and decent service, but when it all comes down to their food, it needs a little tweaking. 

I'm aware I'm not the most knowledgeable when it comes to Hawaiian food, but I know what tastes good, and whether or not management is being stingy. 

I ordered the Ono'er (the medium sized plate). It includes 2 scoops of rice, 2 choices of meat, and 2 choices of sides. I got myself the teriyaki chicken, kalua pig, and a side of macoroni salad, and kimchi slaw. 

As a server builds up my plate, I watch him for a good 10 seconds each, picking out the smallest portions of meat he could find. Does he not think it looks bad on him to place a larger piece of chicken on my plate, only to put it back and replace it with a significantly smaller piece? At least they weren't stingy on the sides. 

Before you dig in, it's highly recommended to pick up one of the sauce bottles that are accompanied by forks and napkins. I prefer the Yaki sauce, even on the chicken katsu. The katsu sauce tastes too much like ketchup. 

The thing is, the food is good. But you have to douse every meat with the Yaki sauce, or else they'll taste a tad bland. The meat can also sometimes be a little dry. It's all these small things that add up. I really want to like this place, but they'll need to work on quality control for me to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Poke is excellent and they nailed the macaroni salad - tastes just like Hawaii.  The teriyaki sauce aka 'yaki sauce is fantastic, I would go back just to eat that sauce.

I wish they had a tofu \"meat\" option like furikake or teriyaki tofu for the non meat eaters."}
{"text":"I really like this place the food is good (except for the beef thought it was kinda dry) The service was good and it is fast and cheap Getting a lot of food for the price Have been here a few times already in the past few weeks This is going to be my spot"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this perfect lunch spot. They have everything I like about a quick Hawaiian style lunch. I typically go for kalua pig and Hawaiian style poke with corn and mac salad on the side, plus a can of Hawaiian Sun (though every single time I've been here the juice doesn't seem to be refrigerated well).

It's a simple menu: you choose the size (1, 2, or 3 meats), choice of meat(s), white or brown rice (2 scoops), and side(s). The meats all taste ono. The kalua pig (which is hard to find that tastes good out here) is tender and moist. The chicken and steak taste like home. Poke is also good; although most of the time, the Hawaiian style poke runs out and they only have the California style left (which is mehhh). You get all of this for a decent price.

Only thing I dislike is the rice. It's too hard. I don't know if it is undercooked, or if it's the type of rice they use, but I like my rice sticky and moist in my Hawaiian dishes. Also, maybe it's just this one occurrence, but there was a funky tang to the kimchee. For the sides, I recommend simple sweet corn, garlic edamame, and mac salad.

EDIT: They seem to have upped their rice game. It's consistently been much more moist."}
{"text":"If you are like me who is tired of L&L or if you love L&L this is the place for you! Their menu is pretty basic but very tasty! You can select 3 portion sizes, small, medium or large. You can pick white or brown rice and your protein. Teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, kalua pork, teriyaki steak, or poke. 

Most of the options looks great, but I will highly recommend the kalua pork! I ordered the medium dish which also comes with 2 side dishes. I enjoyed the macaroni salad. For some reason the food feels fresher and healthier than their competitors. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food. Awesome \"fast food\" place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My mom and I went in for an early dinner today. We both did the two meat plates with white rice, macaroni salad and kimchi. I had chicken katsu and poke and my mom had katsu and the wings. Everything was DELICIOUS! There's two kinds of poke and I sampled both but chose the one with the spicy sauce and it was too die for. The rice was perfect. The Mac salad was perfect, I love Hawaiian Mac salads. The chicken katsu was juicy. My mom is still drooling over the kimchi, neither of us had had it before! My mom liked the wings too but I didn't try them. The place was super clean and the staff was friendly. Huge portions too. We spent $23 for both meals and drinks. Will absolutely come back again. My meal ended up being two meals and was just as bomb left over."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST try. The food, service, and cleanliness of the place.....All deserve an A+!!! If you're looking for authentic Hawaiian food, you just found the spot."}
{"text":"Was disappointed? The Kalua was dry & tasteless, Teri chicken over cooked doubt I'll every return ohana grill so much better"}
{"text":"Yummy food, awesome service and great atmosphere! We were introduced to this place by a friend and fell in love with it."}
{"text":"This Place Is Good & Affordable. The Only Reason Why I Didn't Give Them More Stars Is Because The Service Sucks. One Of The Workers Always Has An Attitude When I Go There. She Even Tried To Sell My Sister Old Poke & Gave My Sister Attitude When My Sister Said No Multiple Times."}
{"text":"I heard really good things from a friend at work and now have to say they are pretty outstanding. My wife has celiac and they were very helpful although I'm still a little worried they weren't completely sure what was gluten free but they said the Kalua pork, kimchi, one of the steak items and edamame were gluten free. Oh and the Katsu sauce sounds gluten free. The food was great and employees were helpful. Kimchi was surprisingly good. Definitely will come again. Btw don't try to compare this with island flavor because island flavor is in its own realm of Hawaiian foods, but much cheaper than island flavor. Aloha"}
{"text":"Dis place is onolocious and the price is right. The mochiko wings, poke, pulehu and teriyaki chicken is good. The pulehu steak was tender and if you want more flavor they have sauces on the side you can add. The edamame and Kim chee slaw is tasty and fresh. Service is swift and the aloha welcome you get from the bradda is right on \m/"}
{"text":"Nice friendly atmosphere. Very courteous staff, prices are great especially for the amount of food you get. Their garlic edamame is real delicious. I'll deff add this spot as one of my go to places. Location is real convenient right off the 95."}
{"text":"Good food! All they need is the lilikoi drink& it's complete  love the plates and their prices are not bad too. The chicken wings are the best one in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new Hawaiian spot for months since Retro Bleu closed for expansion and I could honestly say this place is no Retro Bleu but their Mochiko Chicken wings were amazing. I ordered my brother and myself two medium bowls and one side of their regular Poke for a very fair price. I was just disappointed how salty their Poke was and their Teri and Katsu chicken were slightly cold. Overall, their service was great!"}
{"text":"Brought here by a family from O'ahu, it's a relatively simple menu highlighting one of Hawai'i's most quintessential meals called Plate Lunch or Mixed Plate (if the plate has more than one entrée). There's no shortage of choices with nine meats, five sides, three bases, and a myriad of sauces. 

My brother and I visited in the middle of the afternoon last week and it was surprisingly busy for a random weekday. There weren't any tables available when we arrived, but that quickly changed by the time we had our food. It's a very familiar style of ordering - you wait in line on the left and order down the line at the counter until you reach the cashier.

Pricing:
Ono (Small): 1 meat, 1 side, 1 base | $4.99
Ono'er (Medium): 2 meats, 2 sides, 1 base | $6.99
Ono'est (Large): 3 meats, 2 sides, 1 base | $8.49
Bowl: 2 meats, 1 base | $5.99
Salad: 2 meats, dressing | $7.99 (or $5.99 without meat)
*Steak is an extra $1 per serving
*Poke is an extra $1.25 per serving
*Brown Rice is an extra $0.50.

We opted for two \"Ono'est\" plates to try as many options as possible. The first plate: Pulehu Steak, Kalua Pig, Hawaiian Pok?, Tossed Salad with Creamy Sesame Dressing, Macaroni Salad, and Brown Rice ($11.24). The second plate: White Rice, Mochiko Wings, Chicken Katsu, Seared Spicy Ahi Pok?, Macaroni Salad, and Kimchi Slaw ($9.74). We really enjoyed all the items. Everything was flavorful and exactly what you want in Hawaiian eats. The tossed salad was fresh with a great dressing; the kimchi slaw was surprisingly delightful; and all of the OGs were done right (Kalua Pig, Poke). This is definitely the best plate lunch spot in Vegas!

Extra details: There are two types of Ahi Poke, Hawaiian and Spicy; both can be seared per request. There are sauces available next to the soda fountain: Da Katsu Sauce, Da Spicy Sauce, Da Steak Sauce, and Da Yaki Sauce. (The names may have changed a little because I swear there was a Spicy Yaki?) I really liked the Spicy/Spicy Yaki sauce; it went well with the Pulehu Steak and Katsu."}
{"text":"Pros:  Fantastic food!  Great prices.  I drive a considerable distance to eat here.  I've tried every meat, and every side and it's all awesome.  
Downsides: When you walk out the door you're in 100+ degree heat and not in Hawaii (it's easy to forget where you are when inside.)

Fast, friendly, delicious, not expensive... what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Been to Makai a bunch of times. I'd say the food is decent but not special. It's run pretty well and very clean"}
{"text":"First of all, the food is awesome. Please try the kalua pork omg! And on top of the food being great, everyone that works there has been super cool and very helpful!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Fast service and tasty food. The steak is a bit hard and dry but the katsu and poke is good. The kimchi slaw is just the right amount of spicy."}
{"text":"The only thing I love from here is mochiko wings. Their rice is too dry for my taste. Katsu chicken is a sometimes dry, sometimes not. Teriyaki chicken and Kalua pork are good too."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out because a lot of friends were posting really great pics of the food. 
I love that the menu is so simple and it's easy to pick which meats you wanted. 
I ordered the large, with katsu chicken, kalua pig, & the spicy poke. Sides were white rice with garlic edamame & macaroni salad. 
The chicken & pig were super good. The katsu was not dry at all and tasted great with the sauce. The pig was juicy and had great flavor. 
Garlic edamame was basic but good. And macaroni salad was great, better than L&L in my opinion. 
The spicy poke was good at first but it got a but salty and I ended up not finishing it. 

Overall, would definitely come back when I'm craving Hawaiian food! :-)"}
{"text":"Ordered a huge catering size order for my kid's graduation. Steak, Katsu chicken. Grilled chicken, Mac salad and poke. Fed 40 people for under $400. Quality was nice and food was tasty. On the downside. They forgot to put the sauces in the bags so we had to send someone to pick them up...we live 30I min away  so check to make sure you have your katsu and tery sauce before leaving. No worries.. we'll be back! 
They were super easy to work with and let me place the order and pay over the phone. Some other places wouldn't do that. Kudos to Makai Grill!"}
{"text":"Best island food! Simple and onolicious! Only place I got one at good authentic food! L&L is pure !!"}
{"text":"Good stuff...fresh food and staff is nice.  3rd time I've been and hasn't disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Tried the large size meal that comes with rice, 3 meats and 2 sides. Everything was so yummy! Great portions and very flavorful. Love the ambiance too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here at least once a week. The portions for each of the plate sizes they offer are very generous. The prices are awesome! Most reasonable prices and best tasting ahi poke you'll find in Vegas! The staff are friendly, and the whole store is both spacious and clean! Best place to enjoy a quick Hawaiian style lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"For me this place hits home. I really love Hawaiian food and something about the food here is just the closest thing I have to the big island. The guys behind the glass are so kind, I came in a group of 3 and one of them wasn't really hungry but they insisted he eat. It was that Hawaiian culture that nobody sits and doesn't eat. I really enjoy the teriyaki chicken here, as they mentioned it was the top seller.

I always go for the Ono (small) plate, it comes with brown rice or white rice, just keep in mind that the brown rice is an additional $.60 charge. The proteins available are teriyaki chicken, kahlua pig, chicken wings or you can pay the extra $1 for the ahi or steak. 

The mac salad on the side is also my favorite mac salad of any Hawaiian spot in the valley. Something about it here tastes extra fresh and there's that love put into the recipe that I really admire also!

I was in the area and wanted to get something yummy to eat and I knew this wouldn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great location for a Hawaiian restaurant! Food tasted home-cooked and prices incredibly reasonable. Staff is very friendly. Inside is simple, but functional. Spacious and clean. Only recommendation would be to provide a little more meat to go along with the generous portion of rice and sides. Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to try out if you're into Hawaiian food. We had two styles of poki and loved them both. Also had the Kalua pork. Authentic Hawaiian cuisine with a great atmosphere. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Makai! The customer service here is good & the food is as well. I love their teriyaki chicken. The meat is juicy & the sauce is very flavorful. I also think their spicy ahi is great but I wish they gave you more for the extra amount you're paying. The last two times I went & got the spicy ahi they fill up the little cup & will actually take the time to take extra ahi out of the cup before giving it to you. Scoop in my ahi & leave it, instead of breaking my heart by showing me you're giving me less."}
{"text":"My wife and I started going here about one year ago, for this type of food it is by far the best I have had, she likes the Poke salad and I prefer the catsu chicken. The prices are good the only thing I recommend is don't forget to get your own sauces on the way out the door if you order to go."}
{"text":"A family member had told us about this place so we decided to check it out. My husband had the poke and said it wasnt that good. I had high hopes for the katsu chicken it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. They allowede to try foffenrt meats and explains the flavors to me. I will defiantly be a regular here."}
{"text":"Because the service was great & if you don't have time and looking to grab some food in n out within less than 10 mins this is the place! The price was decent and the food were good  overall I had a great experienced here! Well definitely stop by again someday!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on instagram. It was so delicious and service was good. Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"I was driving around my neighborhood when I Yelp'd Hawaiian food and Makai popped up. Saw the location and didn't recognize it on the map due to the fact that I drive by there 4x or more a week and didn't know about it blew me away. Regardless of having heard about it or not the reviews were fairly good on Yelp though there were  only 10, I had to give it a go! (After talking to one of the three owners who are brothers I learned they opened only 3 days prior to my visit, pretty amazing reviews considering how long it has been in business).

I walked in and it wasn't very busy but there were a handful of people eating in. Walked up to the counter and right away and was greeted by a friendly guy with a big smile. I asked, \"so how does this work?\" Meaning, how do I order? After explaining I pretty much choose the amount of meat I want and I get 1-2 sides along with rice (base). I ordered the Ono'est= Large: chicken katsu (x2), pulehu steak, tossed salad with sweet onion vinaigrette and garlic edamame. 
-Chicken katsu: crispy, hot/fresh, not greasy considering its deep fried.
-pulehu steak: tender, juicy, perfectly sweet and savory, real island bbq.
-tossed salad: fresh and crisp, tried it with glazed almonds and though I'm not sure if it is homemade it paired great and was delicious.
sweet onion vinaigrette: vibrant color, not too sweet. *there is also a creamy sesame dressing that sounded great too. 
-garlic edamame: if you like garlic you will love this, edamame was still firm with a good crunch.
They also approached me instead of me asking, if I wanted to try the poke and of course I did. The two I tried were ahi (tuna), one had a creamy texture/flavor and the other was traditional. Flavors all poke lovers would enjoy! 
*Try to go early to be sure you get your hands on some.


Words to describe my experience here:
Fresh, authentic, savor, Aloha, the bomb-dig-gity!"}
{"text":"I've gone here 4 times and I'm still impressed. You get tons of food for the price. Always very fresh, always very friendly and never a long wait. These boys are doing something right. I hope they continue to open more locations. Menu is simple and easy, and every item I've tried has been delicious."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Used to go to the one on Flamingo but now this is closer its even better!    Not much signage so if you don't know Makai then we have to promote it here.   Being next to In and Out and behind Arbys makes it hard to see if you arent looking for it.  Best Terayaki bowl in LV in my opinion.   Teri Chicken is amazing and kimchi slaw and mac salad is a total winner."}
{"text":"Generous portioned food! Worth the $$. 
Generous customer service, specifically from the a manger! Mahalo sir! 
Generous cleanliness in the entire restaurant.
(We had it for early lunch, and was full for most the entire day)
Thank you Makai!"}
{"text":"The lady and I went around 2 pm or so on a Saturday right before a big flood of people came in and created a line. She said it reminded her of Chipotle in a sense of choosing what you want and they just put it in those plasticy-metal..(?) containers. It's pretty self-explanatory.. Choose your \"size\" (example: I got a 'medium', 2 meats and 2 sides). I read from past reviews they run out of poke sometimes, and thankfully they didn't run out of either spicy or regular poke from when I ordered. Maybe I got lucky!  Shoutout to 'Joe M.' for the help and suggestions. I'm definitely coming back..
They have many options from both meats and sides, and they also sell poke by how much, 1/4 lb, 1/2 lb, etc. Bomb dot com!"}
{"text":"Oh wow this place was good! I was in Vegas for a quick work trip for just one afternoon and the boyfriend found this place through Yelp so we gave it a try. We both got the large bowl with three meats and I was impressed with the portion sizes. We tried the pig, wings, poke and steak and loved all of them. The sides were good too. All in all, really good Hawaiian food. Definitely different from places like L&L's. Much better. Good quality meat and they give good size scoops of the meat and sides. Definitely going back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The service is great! And the food is even better!
Got the Ono'er size meal with chicken Katsu and poke with white rice, Mac salad and garlic edamame.
The poke has great flavor and the chicken Katsu is delicious! Makes me miss visiting Hawaii! Definitely glad we have a Hawaiian place back on this side of town and one that sells poke! Hopefully they will start making more varieties of poke on the menu."}
{"text":"I wish I would have taken more pictures of my food but I couldn't wait to dig in! No disappointment at all. The teriyaki chicken was so flavorful and so filling. The poke was amazing. Best I've had in Vegas. I want more now that I'm thinking about it. The prices are worth the food. It's just simply delicious. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was so worth the travel and the wait, the food is to die for and the service was amazing the servers really take care of you and walk you throu the process, they don't rush you and really know their food. I'm coming back for sure. I am recommending this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Large portion with great value!! 

Pulehu Steak ($1 extra), mochiko chicken and kalua pig! They were all very delicious and packed with taste. I, of course, got the biggest Ono'est. and OHNO, I'm pretty hooked. Hah. 

It's a \"chipotle\" or \"subway\" style of ordering. So it's quick and easy! 

Next time, I'm going for the poke!"}
{"text":"Dropped by here for lunch since it's a new business and I'm so glad I did!  I was happy to see that food was being grilled and that there was some food ready to be served.  It's a great spot to grab and go.

I ordered the Ono'er sized meal which comes with 2 servings of meat, 2 scoops of rice, and 2 sides.  I chose the Kalua pig and chicken katsu while my partner chose the spicy poke (+$1.25/serving) and teriyaki chicken.  Also, they have brown rice available as well!  For our sides I chose the kimchi slaw and macaroni salad while my partner chose the garlic edamame and the kimchi slaw as well.  If that sounds like a mouthful, it's because it is!  We couldn't finish everything and had to take it to go because there was just so much food!  And that is just for the medium.  

We went when everything was fresh and hot, but I can imagine when it's slow that the food wouldn't be as hot.    

One thing I want to mention is that they can also sell poke by itself.  When I went it was $13.99 per pound because of the market value.  I loved their spicy poke and can't wait to try their regular poke!"}
{"text":"Second time here and the main such as steak both teri and pulehu style and poke on point!! Disappointed with salad, to much carrots and dressing im sorry it's horrible thought the pink dressing was the juice from pickled mango li hing mui with fish sauce  and the ginger one isn't so good either. The Brown rice is hard, and the staff seems unhappy, seems angry with the choice i make for my plate, and seems so uninviting. I rushed my food to get out, unfortunately, poke is good here and ill come back for that but if employers seemed unhappy it'll make me run as fast i can... Where is the aloha when you need it especially with powered by good poke and a good concept ?"}
{"text":"Super nice staff, very helpful n the Hawaiian food I've ever had! The poke is fresh and tasty! Gotta try their spicy teri sauce"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were missing our home town so we wanted a little taste of Hawaii so we decided to try this place out. We both got the large bowl with half pound of limu poke & spicy poke. The poke was Ono & our plate was yummy as well. Also I Love how clean this place was :)"}
{"text":"I was in a food slump, so I hit Yelp to find some new restaurants to try. As a local island girl myself my standards for Hawaiian cuisine are pretty high. I checked out their menu on their website and was impressed. They keep it simple and the photos looked Ono (delicious). My two friends and I came in at noon on a Friday and the line was long, but worth it. The team was friendly, took time to explain the offerings, and customer service continued once you sat down. I had the medium and it was a HUGE amount of food. The teriyaki chicken was tasty, the teriyaki steak was so good, the Mac salad was just like my tita makes it in the islands, the kimchee coleslaw was perfection. I highly recommend this place for island style food and will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"The \"$\" signs should \"$$$\" signs. Started off with a bowl at $6.49. Brown rice 50 cents more. Upgrade second choice meet to Poké, $1.25 more. Small cup for water 25 cents more. The cost for water bothers me the most. I don't know of other restaurants charge for water from a fountain."}
{"text":"I love this place esp the salad dressings is to die for .. its just the salad is kinda too plain .. i love mochiko, teriyaki chicken is just regular im not too fond about .. steak are good cook as medium well .. love the sauces near the fountain drinks .. its just they need to keep up cleaning the dining area .."}
{"text":"Order large plate. Great lunch with my family. Fast and easy to order. The food was good and I tried the California  poke which I think the poke is what makes or breaks the Hawaiian  food. Was pretty happy with the food."}
{"text":"Probably going to become one of my favorite places to eat. A healthy alternative to the regular takeout. Super good. Everything tastes fresh. Huge portion sizes especially for the prices they charge. The staff was very friendly. Very calm environment."}
{"text":"I think this place is definitely a great deal for a large amount of food. I discovered this place thanks to another yelp elite :). This place is fast food style, all the food is precooked and lying on trays and you get to pick what you want kind of like chipotle. They have size options that comes with rice, meat, and sides. They also have up charge items like brown rice, beef, and poke. 

I got the large size because it's the most bang for your buck. You get three meats, and two sides.  I got the spicy poke, chicken Katsu and mochiko chicken wings. Sides I got the kimchee slaw and of course the infamous macaroni salad. My friends also got the kalua pork, teriyaki steak and teriyaki chicken, sweet corn, and garlic edamame. We basically ordered the entire menu. 

Everything I had was pretty delicious. The poke was definitely fresh and flavorful. The pieces of tuna were large and fresh!  My chicken Katsu was very crispy. It isn't seasoned so you need a sauce. The mochiko chicken wings were sweet!  Really bomb. The kalua pork was fatty and juicy, not dry at all. The kimchi slaw was a great balance to everything cause it was refreshing and spicy. My macaroni salad was creamy and traditional. The sweet corn was very good as well. For the edamame I couldn't really taste the garlic. 

The only thing I would stay away from is probably the steak. It and as very dry, overlooked and tough. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Been back here a few times since my last review, and the food taste is much better now. I also tried the poke, it's not bad. Price is very affordable for the amount of food you receive. This is now one of my go-to lunch places."}
{"text":"I don't even like Hawaiian food and this place is BOMB! It is frankly the best food out of everything in this general area and that includes the In N Out in the parking lot. 

The steak is super amazing. It's tender and juicy and completely embarrasses the Chipotle across the way. The Kailua Pork is one of the best things I have ever tasted. My kimchee slaw was perfect. Everything at this restaurant is perfect.  You need to go here or you are missing out."}
{"text":"Ordering is easy for a first timer here. Clean place. My surprise was food is already made on warmers which is good for people on the go but kind of loose the quality of certain items. I ordered the pulehu steak with 2 other items as well. Was very let down from seeing reviews and pics on yelp and how it looked from what I have gotten. Steak looked like what you put for robertos burrito filling with no grilled flavor. I'm not sure if management changed or cooks do it differently now but food was not consistent from previous yelpers reviews."}
{"text":"Lived in Hawaii and this place brings the island to Vegas!! The food was high in quality and customer service was too notch! Pulehu all the way!!! I will definitely be going back quite often!!!"}
{"text":"I read everyone else's reviews and I live just around the corner from here and I love hawaiian food and decided to stop in.  My first impression is the only hawaiian vibe I got was the name on the sign. Inside is totally plain. There's not a single piece of hawaiian decor, atmosphere, feeling etc inside. I placed my order for a 2 meat item including poke.  The prices were fine, the portions were fine, the food was fine. Everything was just EH/FINE. Nothing I tried was bad or anything, but again everything in this place was just EH/FINE. Not one bite of macaroni salad, kimchi slaw, pork or poke did I go OOOH this taste really good. It felt like the owners didn't really know what hawaiian atmosphere/food really was. I mean you don't even have spam musubi which is a hugely popular hawaiian item.  This place is missing the hawaiian atmosphere and definitely missing the love of hawaiian food, it feels like someone looked up a recipe and TRIED to follow it, instead of just cooking and putting the hawaiian flavor/love into it.   There used to be a great place also nearby called Kauai Cafe and I quickly got to know the owner Dawn and her family. The family was all hawaiian and their food was AMAZING. She actually had the best spam musubi I have ever had. Sadly the only reason she closed was because she was over worked and burned out. I hope you can connect with the hawaiian culture a bit more."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried has been amazing the poke, wings, chicken katsu, steak, are all delicious. I've been coming by at least once a week since I discovered this place! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, instead I was left wanting. It was somewhat busy Saturday during lunch but not hectic enough for the workers to be so irritable. No hi, welcome to Makai was uttered, not even a simple hello. What greeted us was a lifeless what is your order going to be? Ummm ok, awkward.

We decided on 2 Ono'er (medium $6.99) plates, 1 Ono'est (large $8.49) and salad ($7.99). The way they have it set up is you pick your base, sides and protein. Price is standard until your \"upgrades\" and then bam before you know it, your plate is close to $10. I don't really mind paying more if it's worth it but when meat portions are somewhat questionable and taste is sub par then we have a slight problem. My mom's salad was definitely not worth $7.99, there was barely any greens and proteins. I enjoyed my pulehu chicken, great flavors. Spicy poke was just ok as was the mac salad. Edamame needed to be boiled longer, was so hard that I couldn't take out the bean without crushing it. Garlic seasoning was tasty but it was frustrating eating those suckers. The kalua pig was salty and barely had smoky taste and flavor. My husband enjoyed his mochiko wings and said the kimchi slaw was surprisingly good, I wasn't on the same page.

Not in a hurry to go back but will give it another go one of these days. Hopefully the service won't be as chilly and a better experience all around."}
{"text":"I'm a little annoyed. This is our first time ordering.  They didn't give us napkins, utensils and no sauce or salad dressing.  The food was cold. I was told 10 minutes and my food was sitting when I got there in 10 minutes.  The girl who rang me up was not friendly at all. I understand this is a new place, but some things are just not cool. I didn't feel the aloha spirit. She couldn't care less. Definitely not as good as L & L. I called and was told to come in and order because it's quick serve and the sauce is on the side and they try to remind you to get it. I didn't see any sauce and was not told. Then to top it off, my teryaki chicken is half cooked! First impressions are lasting. I won't be giving a second chance to get food poisoning."}
{"text":"So amazing! 

Love how this restaurant is set up, just like going to a local Hawaiian version of Chipotle.

Staff was friendly and greet you as you walk in, even offered samples of the poke. We got the pulehu steak, poke, and pulehu chicken. All of these were very good! The white rice and side choices were all delicious! Perfect place to enjoy some local Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"I finally made my way to the old Makai and the food has improved again.. just missing that Aloha vibe!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance: playing Hawaiian music that's transports me to the islands and a video showcasing other food: in this case it's a restaurant making rolled ice-cream on loop and I'm pretty happy about that

We ordered the Large plate: 3 meats and two sides, great for sharing. Kalua pork, Pulehu Steak (basically a tender steak) and spicy Poke

If you're allergic to shellfish don't order the Poke or edamame. In my case I got the poke all to myself 

Great customer service too makes this 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to island spot. It's near the freeway which I like. The decor is subtle, but the food is amazing. Staff is cool too! Bathrooms are clean. Fountain drinks never taste watered down. I'm happy eating here!"}
{"text":"Makai's food definitely has an authentic taste, it tastes like any hawaii grown person's Aunty and Uncle or Grandma and Grandpa's cooking back home! You know they make your food with love, their pulehu steak is always juicy, their rice is soft, and their spicy tuna is super ono!!! I always get the ono'est bowl, comes with two scoops of rice, three choices of protein, and two sides. They got \"da yaki\" sauce and aloha shoyu, which is bomb.com with your bowl. The portioning is big and you get more for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out as my friend mentioned this was a great place to eat and she's pregnant with a craving. I wanted to order for pick up and I called from my office and cell found it odd that the phone was never answered. I get there and there are 3 people in line. I placed my order and asked for an extra side of spicy poke I was told I can't unless I order the large meal. I even told them to charge me they apparently couldn't do that either. When I got to the register I asked to verify the phone number it was the same one I had called. He said that they don't answer the phone if they are busy. To me that's just bad service. You may ask why I still went only because it was the pregnant friend of mine whom really wanted the food..  the food was good but the service hmmm not the best. 

Spanish translation 

Decidí ir a este lugar ya que mi amiga me lo Había mencionado y también tenía el antojo por qué está embarazada. Primero intente ordenar por teléfono pero el teléfono jamás fue contestado se me hizo raro de igual manera me fui a local. Cuando llegue solo habían 3 personas en línea en otras palabras no estaban ocupados. En pese con pedir mi orden y le pedí al muchacho un side adicional de spicy poke pero me aviso que no podía que tendría que ordenar otro plato más grande que no me podía cobrar por lo que pedía así que lo deje y seguí. Cuando llegue a la registradora le pregunté al otro joven que si me podía confirmar el número de teléfono y si yo había marcado bien le mencione que llame varias veces y de varios números y que no me contestaron. Y me dijo que si ellos están ocupados que no contestan el teléfono. Y eso para mí es mal servicio. Tal vez te preguntes porque igual fui ahí no fue por mi si no por la embarazada de mi amiga que tenía antojo.. la comida estuvo bien pero el servicio no tanto."}
{"text":"Honestly I really did like this place. Went when it wasn't extremely busy and the service was great quick and helpful to my questions. I've tried different Hawaiian Food places and this one is more of a refreshing healthy food trip instead of how Hawaiian foods make you feel like you're going to have a Kanak attack after eating it. Loved everything about this place just the shopping structure it's in needs to fix their parking lot. Great job Makai Grill definitely would recommend based on service, food and the portions are amazing for the prices loved it!"}
{"text":"Feels and tastes a lot like home! They give large portions and their poke is so good. I ordered the Medium with teriyaki chicken and kalua pig w/ tossed salad and garlic edamame. Everything was not too oily or salty. I will be back for more Hawaiian food when I'm on this side of the city."}
{"text":"HOW HAVE I NOT MADE A REVIEW ON THIS PLACE YET???? WHERE DO I BEGIN? So the first time I've been here was over a year ago around the time they first opened since I work at Driven Boutique next door! The first time I ate here was before I became pescatarian so I've tried the teriyaki chicken and the steak and they were SOOO good especially when you get the steak fresh!! (I would request it, does take a bit longer but it's so worth it) But now that I'm pescatarian I'm only able to eat the poke which I'm not complaining about!! My typical order now would be the small with brown rice, w/ either just the Hawaiian poke or I get half and half of the Hawaiian and spicy tuna which is another tip I suggest if you want both, and the green salad with the sesame dressing (YALL THIS IS BOMB DONT SLEEP ON IT) with the candied almonds on top(ALSO OBSESSED WITH THIS ASK FOR IT ON THE TOP OR ON THE SIDE) I always ask for as much almonds as they can give me because it just goes so well with the salad and dressing! The small gets me at a perfect and satisfied full, not too full where I feel bloated but satisfies my hunger! The staff is always so nice and sweet to me! The only complaint I have is that they up charge for brown rice.. I mean it's only 50 cents more but why :( other than that I love this place and eat here multiple times per week! Perfect healthy and satisfying meal! Another tip is, when you come past 8 chances are they are out of poke! Also, I hate that they are closed on Sunday's because sometimes after church I be craving but remember it's close but I like that they give Sunday's off to their employees to have family time which is what Sunday's are all about in my opinion! I love love love this place y'all need to try NOW! Also I've talked with some employees & seems like they're working on opening multiple locations so I can't wait!!!!"}
{"text":"This place reminded me so much of back home. I ordered the Ono (one portion) of spicy tuna with a side of garlic edamame and should've just got the bowl, instead. So four stars for it not being portions like they do in Hawaii. The fish was fresh and can't wait to go back to try something else. Lots of customers looked local and made the atmosphere more homey. \"Ho cuz, was Ono booooo!\""}
{"text":"To show you how great this place was for me, I came here on two consecutive days and I was staying at Mandalay Bay.  Some of items I triedI included: Katsu (cripsy outside, tender inside), Teri chicken (good flavor), mochiko wings, (not enough mochiko for me) kalua pork (tender and not dry) , spicy poke,(yummy)  garlic edamame (So good! ), kimchi slaw (yummy, carrots included) mac salad.(Not overly sweet, shredded carrots included). 

I really don't like having too many carrots for the side dishes because my bestie is allergic to carrots, nuts, soy, and corn. So pretty much everything on the side was not a great choice. 

I haven't tried the pulahu (grilled versions) since it was $1 more, but will next time.

However, the protein here is really good. Their teri chicken among other meats are grilled and has that great BBQ flavor you find on the islands. Their sauce (Da sauce) here, oddly enough is very watery.  But when I ate more and more of it, I actually liked it more because it doesn't cover up the bbq taste and just give a hint of teri sauce or spicy, depending which bottle you get. 

Their Ono'er (Medium) is about $7.50 after tax and pretty much is enough to feed a grown man. The Poke here is delicious and I was able to just buy 1/4 pound as well.  Will be back soon for Ono gridz!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place! But now, I'm now sure  Seems like every time i get my food here, their portion is less and less, especially if its rush hour. Their new employees are not that friendly anymore, especially when it's almost close time... Wish employees take their time to take a deep breath and smile to customers..."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for fulfilling your Hawaiian craving without a long wait. I love how there are different sizes for your plate lunch to pick according to how hungry you are! Regardless of the size it's a great deal for what you get.  Food tastes great and plenty of options for sides. The homemade sauces are also a nice touch; my favorite being the \"spicy\" sauce which I didn't really find spicy. It's basically like a kicked up Teri sauce. Only con is the availability of the poke; get there early before its all gone!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food.  The poke is amazing but can run out early. If you can't get that then I would suggest the mochiko wings which are very delicious.  Solid Hawaiian place and great for lunch"}
{"text":"The teri chicken has a GREAT flavor! Clean, tasty fast food place. If the line at next door In N Out is too long, pop in here for something good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i come here for lunch almost every Friday and the staff are always super nice and the food is always on point. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"So good! My husband brought me here. He said It was his co-workers favorite spot and he knows I love Poke. We happened to be on this side of town so we came in with our kiddos (2 and 4 years old).  Everyone ate ALL of their food! Seriously delicious! I wish there was one closer to my house but I'll make 20 minute drive to come back again! 

Also, the staff is super nice, fast and clean. Added plus for great customer service."}
{"text":"5 star flavor but 3 star experience.  The only reason 2 stars were knocked off on experience is because they didn't have a couple items available during my visit.  No chicken katsu and no mixed veggie's.  
I went in at 12:30 on a Saturday.  The katsu would've taken \"8-10 minutes\" to prepare.  I probably would've waited but he already had the 2 other meats on the plate when he told me there'd be a wait.  (When I said the 3 meats I wanted I said in this order \"mochiko wings, chicken katsu, palehu steak\").  I believe the guy at the start of the assembly line was pretty new, so I understand.. But to not have some katsu even cooking during a lunch rush was a little disappointing.  
Regardless of this experience the food I did order was so ono I will definitely be back.  
I ordered the mochiko wings (awesome flavor, juiciness & crunch) pulehu steak (tender and seasoned just right) Hawaiian style poke (almost as good as poke express, just wish the cup was a little bigger), Mac salad (finally a Hawaiian place that puts potato in the Mac salad!  Just like my grandmas), garlic edamame (delicious), and brown rice (just brown rice lol).
My mom ended up with the same plate I had since they didn't have Katsu or mixed veggie's.  After she ate she forgot she wanted anything different.  Also ordered a \"kids meal\", white rice, poke, and they include edamame, just wish a small drink for the keiki was included."}
{"text":"Food is great! Went there to try out and see if their food would meet Hawaii people's expectation, and yes, it certainly has! We did not order the plates, but we bought a la carte and brought it home to share. 

The pulehu steak was pretty good. Could have provided us with a little more, but it was certainly good. 

I like chicken katsu but have a difficult time looking for a Hawaiian Food restaurant that can make good chicken katsu, and this place had some bomb ass katsu. The chicken katsu was thick, not flat like most restaurants. On top of that, the katsu was super juicy. My son absolutely loved it.

The kalua pig was juicy. It was so delicious that it really made me feel like I was at home. I can make kalua pig at home but when I don't have time or patience to cook it, I would like a restaurant to have it. Makai's one was so ono!

I am not a big fan of Poke, but my brother and boyfriend thought it was good. Almost to the point that they wanted me to make a second pick up within 15 minutes of bringing the food home.

They also sell a handful of different flavors of Hawaiian Sun drinks. Of course, the price is pretty high for a can of Hawaiian Sun but my kids loved it so I purchased it for them.

The atmosphere is simple but relaxing. Super clean, and the people were pretty nice. There are lots of parking. I can't wait to try the different types of chicken and steak. I recommended this restaurant to a lot of my friends that live in Vegas, and I hope they feel the same way about their food the way I do."}
{"text":"I was trying to go to magic noodles next door but it was temporarily closed so I noticed makagrill was next door and it had good reviews so I decided to go in. The prices are fairly cheap for what they give you but for any beef options you have to pay extra so your basically left with chicken only if you don't want to pay extra, chicken katsu or teriyaki chicken etc. The other meat options were $1.50 more. The portions we're decent size. So you get two types of meats, two sides and two large scoops of rice for like $8 with bottle water which is fairly cheap. 

The sesame dressing was dam good. It was for the salad but I used it to dip the chicken katsu and it was better than the katsu sauce. I would have given them another star but the service seem a bit shotty. The restaurant was run basically by high school kids. When I went in Friday evening. They had run out of all poke I guess that is understandable since it was an hour before closing. The girl who was ringing me up asked me what salad dressing I wanted and I didn't know what they had she rattled off so fast that all I heard was sesame and that's what I took. 

She needs a lesson in service, not all customers who come in are regulars and know what salad dressing they have and she needs to slow down instead of just rattling off like I'm bugging her. It wasn't like the place was busy I was the only one ordering at the time. Also it was my first time and they could have asked me if I have been there before and if I needed any help ordering. Even tho it's basically self explanatory if you read the menu board. It's all about how you treat your customer that have you keep coming back."}
{"text":"Please is incredible, staff always nice, fast service and the food is addicting. I've brought all my friends here and even they good addicted. Aloha"}
{"text":"This place is pretty dang good especially for the price! It was my first time here and I've heard nothing but good things about this place. I got a small plate which you get to choose 1 meat 1 side and it automatically comes with a scoop of rice for only 4.99. I got the teriyaki chicken and Mac salad and it was a decent amount of food! It filled me up and didn't over stuff me like other Hawaiian places. I'm usually picky with my Mac salad but this one was very good and the chicken was good as well just kind of fatty. We spent a total of like $12 for T
Two small plates and a drink. Well worth it and I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! 
Great Food - Great Service - Great sauces - if you love poke you will love this place - you get your choice of rice and two sides - plus you can choose the number of proteins and plate size. 
Will be back again and again - yummy"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I was impressed. The chicken is so tasty and tender, the Poki tuna taste very fresh. I highly recommend trying it out. Big portions for a reasonable price. Place is very clean and staff is friendly. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"All around great, friendly staff, perfect food and great prices! Definately beats any other Hawaiian food place I've ever been to. The price what what you get can't be beat. It's all fresh and well made. The chicken Katsu is BOMB!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Hawaiian food in Vegas. Period. It's extremely hard to not get the large size bowl to get everything they have to offer!"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal! I stopped in on a whim today for the first time & am so glad that I stumbled upon this gem!!! 

I had the teriyaki steak, chicken katsu, and the mochiko wings, with the side salad with their sweet dressing (I can't remember the name of the dressing ) and salted edamame. 

I was absolutely floored with how amazing the food was! The meat was so juicy, because sometimes ya know, you get dry meat and it totally ruins the experience (especially with Katsu), but that was not the case! 

And to top it off, the staff are so friendly and offered for us to taste whatever we wanted to make sure that we were happy with our order before ordering! I will definitely be adding this to my rotation of staples of restaurants to come back to"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Instagram and decided to come with a few friends. It's basically a Hawaiian version of chipotle. They have 3 sizes to choose from (Ono, Ono'er, and Ono'est), along with 9 different types of meat, 6 sides, and 2 bases. The area is very clean and the workers are friendly. 

It wasn't busy at all when we came in (thank goodness) - but a long line formed as soon as we sat down. 

I went with the smallest bowl (Ono) and got the Hawaiian poke (+1.25 per serving) with a tossed salad as the side - it also came with a ball of white rice. It came out to about $6. 

I don't know what the hell they put in the poke, but it was delicious...sucks that it was a small amount so I cried a little on the inside. The rice was a bit dry, I'm not sure if it was old rice or that's just how they make it. The salad just pretty plain with romaine, carrots, and some cucumbers - still good though but I could just make that at home. 

I would definitely come back to this place to try something else! I prefer it over chipotle any day - too bad it's a bit far from my house."}
{"text":"Could have been 5 stars but they ran out of Teriyaki chicken and salted edimame and had to wait for the chicken. Overall, excellent meal for the money. This was a great find and will be back."}
{"text":"I had the Ono'r size (med) mochiko chicken, spicy ahi poke ($1.25 extra...Yes please) Mac salad, brown rice & toss salad with creamy sesame sauce. The food was Ono & you have the option to make healthier choices at same price...Yummy!!  The set up is similar to a chipotle restaurant."}
{"text":"So I come here and the other location quite often but today was a super ghetto experience.  Don't get me wrong, the food here is normally great but the girl working today needs a new job.  So I come around the same time and it's before the dinner rush, so usually the trays aren't full. No problem, today the mochiko chicken wings left were looking a little sad, slightly burnt and super small pieces.  I didn't say anything, just ordered, so the girl says oh the wings are small I'll throw in an extra wing.  I'm thinking wow that's great what good customer service since you are recognizing these are super sad looking chicken pieces.  So then I put in my second order which is all mochiko chicken. She's short one piece and instead of taking her lazy self and making some more, she goes to my first order and removes the extra wing and puts it in my second tray....  Did my wings in the first order grow between the beginning of the counter to the end of the counter.  seriously?! I even asked did you just take a wing from one tray and put it in the other?? she just looked at me and said oh well I gave you an extra....girl don't offer if you are going to be an Indian giver.  Next time I'm just going to be super annoying and say I'll take the chicken jerky.....oh thats's not chicken jerky....then you better get over to the fryer and make a fresh batch instead of serving burnt ones.  And unfortunately I can't avoid this location since it's closer...but if you have a choice go to the other location location."}
{"text":"Went in with some low expectations but we wanted a quick easy dinner with something our 2 year old will eat.  This is hot food tray style establishment, you pick, they scoop.  I picked the medium combo with mochiko chicken wings (extra 0.50) and ahi tuna (extra 1.25).  As we were getting our food scooped, I was thinking oh man they are kind of stingy with their portions....haha.  The medium came with 3 chicken wings and small maybe 1/4 lb or less of ahi tuna, 2 scoops of rice and a 2 side items.  The mochiko wings were surprisingly tasty and juicy.  The ahi tuna was really fresh and well seasoned as well.  For about $10 a plate, the portion is right.  I was full but not stuffed, but I also opted to only eat a small amount of the rice.  The creamy sesame dressing for the tossed salad was really good as well.  The kid's meal is also a good deal and cheaper than most places, a scoop of rice and either kahlua pork or teri chicken as the meat for $3.75.  Great casual Hawaiian restaurant!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Local Hawaiian Food is finally here in the South West! I have heard of this place from Facebook and it surpassed my expectations. It is not only very affordable but very onolicious! I always get the ono'est its only $8.99 and there portions are so big that you get TWO meals one for there and one to take home. This is the cheapest but the most home cooked flavor Local Hawaiian Place in Vegas! I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up last week. I ordered the Ono'est, and it was so much food for one person. It was enough for me to eat for both lunch and dinner on the same day. Gracious portions! For my ono'est I got brown rice, which was delish with the chicken katsu and the pulehu steak. I swear their chicken katsu is the best I've had. It wasn't over fried and it had the precise moisture and texture. The pulehu steak was delish as well. It wasn't overcooked or dried. It was perfectly tender and the flavor was on point. I will definitely get the same thing the next time I order here. Also I had a bite of my friends poke, and it was fire. Texture melted in my mouth and it was perfectly spicy. For my sides I got the sweet corn and the macaroni salad. Sweet corn was also really good, perfect amount of sweetness, and very very flavorful. The macaroni salad was good also. It didn't have that heavy mayonnaise taste. You cant go wrong with the macaroni salad if you like macaroni salad, try this one. Promise you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great above fast food choice for lunch. I had the medium bowl with brown rice, Teriyaki chicken and katsu chicken. Added salad and garlic endamame for sides. The hubby had the large bowl with wings, steak and seared poke with salad and kimchee slaw. Every dish tasted delicious. Rice comes as two scoops. We both had leftovers. Excellent choice for a quick, flavorful lunch on the rub."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Best deal I've ever gotten on such a hearty meal. Service was outstanding. I'm officially a regular from here on out. Must go!!! Hawaiian Sun is the nectar of life!"}
{"text":"It's a Friday evening and Flaming Fajitas was on fire with the wait. I've had this marked so twas the best time to do it since we were already on this part of town. There were a few people in the building enough to make you think, wow...these folks definitely got business. 

Service was mediocre. Nothing welcoming nor unwelcoming. Just a bunch of folks standing behind the counter doing their job. No prob, though. I was just excited to try somewhere new.

We ordered a bowl (2 proteins and 2 scoops of rice) of chicken katsu and spicy ahi, 1 Ono (1 protein, 1 scoop of rice, and 1 side) with the chicken teriyaki, 1 Ono'er (2 proteins, 2 scoops of rice, 2 sides) with spicy ahi and mochiko chicken, and an extra order of garlic edamame on the side. All our sides we opted for garlic edamame and 1 of their sweet corn.

I love the concept of this place! From choosing your protein to your sides. I love garlic edamame so honestly, being able to have this option on my plate was seriously the need for me to try this spot out. 

But to be honest, the food was jusssst alright. I had 4 pcs of mochiko chicken wings that were the tiny kine chicken wings. By the time I finished the wings, which didn't take long at all, I still couldn't figure out if the mochiko chicken was legit. I think the flavor almost had me by the 4th one, but I feel as tiny as those wings are...they should increase the serving. Not to mention the chicken was pretty dry and chewy. Clearly been sitting for abit. The spicy ahi was pretty decent as well. It tasted super fishy, though. Which may sound funny to many out there, but fish shouldnt taste l...\"fishy\". My husband enjoyed it. I liked it...but not a fan of fish tasting like fish if you know what I mean.

The sweet corn kind of reminded me of canned corn. I was hoping to feel excited off the corn, but I wasnt. That got abandoned. 

My son had a couple strands of hair in his serving of poke, which they gladly replaced. Same batch of poke, just no scoop of hair in this one. The young lady running the register did apologize. My son didn't really like his poke because he got a lot of the peices that were the chewier cuts. The chicken katsu is made with chicken thighs. You get 1 thigh cut into voila, katsu status. Overall, the son agrees that everything on his plate was jusssst alright. I could tell he wasn't excited about it because he didn't kill his plate as he normally would if something was on point. The kid is only 8, but he's a beast when it comes to his food and he has impressive tastebuds. His opinion matters. Lol.

The other son had the chicken teriyaki. I mean, chicken teriyaki is pretty basic. I believe the chicken teriyaki is chicken thighs as well just cut into peices. The Ono was a perfect serving for my 6 year old, who didn't even finish it. Not because he didn't like it, but because he's the polar.opposite of his big brother. He, too, is an edamame lover so he def killed that.

Overall, we spent about $26 for our meal. The dining room was filled and folks were still coming in. I started feeling bad for those who got their food, then had to do the grueling search for an open seat you know has yet to exist. 

I would recommend someone in the area to give it a shot or anyone who just wants a different hawaiian eating experience. We probably wouldn't make such a drive specifically for this place being that it's across town. Nothing wowed or had my tastebuds on its knees for more. The first experience just didn't go too swell.

Definitely kid friendly and you could get away with bringing a stroller in here as well.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Chipotle style restaurant with delicious Hawaiian food! The pork and teri beef were very tender. Rice was ok, but try to get fresh because we had both fresh and dry crunchy bottom of the pot. The chicken was dry, but you can get your own Katsu sauce so that makes up for it. They serve poke too! Closed on Sunday for family time, which is nice to see, but sad for when we need our ono-grindz!"}
{"text":"Well I'm pretty disappointed. I haven't been in a couple weeks since I bright the roomie and it has gone waaaaay downhill. She was craving it tonight and I was stoked to go. 

I ordered a salad... The price confused me because it costs seventy cents more and you get one side less than the two meat bowl. As you can see the 'salad' is lettuce. That's it. No topping as shown in menu. My 'salad' cost me 10.80. Look at the picture. That's sad. Lettuce and some meat. 

The chicken was weighed and weighed again. She took five different pieces in and out of my bowl... I'm just like dude is five grams of chicken thigh that serious? The chicken was old and dry, which was a bummer. I love their chicken and sauce usually. 

When I asked for two different dressings to try a new one she told me it would cost fifty cents... Then she has my friend bring me an extra so I had two of the same dressing!! Why?"}
{"text":"True Story: I am hooked on Makai!  From the delicious \"Mochiko Wings\" that I could devour by the dozen to their crispy, juicy \"Chicken Katsu\" to my favorite side of \"Kimchee Slaw\", all of it freakin rocks and has they've become an almost weekly stop.  I never eat in, always take out.
 
But the queen of the castle, cream of the crop, apple of my eye, most beloved item on the menu is their spicy ahi poke.  The portion as part of a meal is never enough, so I order the larger size on its own.  There's been several times where my wife and I get a pound of it for $14 and pair it with rice and salad at home for a satisfying dinner.  I try to go before 7pm because they occasionally run out and that's really the only time I end up on Skype with my psychiatrist in a parking lot as they help me through breathing exercises while I sweat profusely, rocking my body back and forth with Celine Dion's version of \"All by Myself\" on infinite loop.  Perfectly normal!"}
{"text":"Makai was on my girlfriend's bookmark list for the longest time, so it was nice finally being able to cross one off her list, but I'm also really glad we stopped by too.

Knowing I wouldn't be back for awhile, I decided to go ahead and go balls to the wall and order the large. The large is composed of 3 meats and 2 sides. Heads up: the poke, steak, and brown rice is extra, but believe me when I say the spicy poke is absolutely worth paying extra. I'll get into more details in a bit.

I ordered the kalua pig which is a shredded pork, the spicy poke, and chicken katsu. So, back to the poke I was talking about earlier! If you're a fan of spicy, it has a nice little bite to it. The poke bits were nice and chunky too. It's absolutely worth paying extra for!

The kalua pig was thankfully moist thanks to the natural fattiness of pork and the seasoning was just right. I'm not a katsu fan, but I got it anyway. It was good, but I'd imagine it would be pretty damn good to someone who actually orders katsu regularly.

As far as servings go, they don't hold back here. The medium probably would have sufficed, but as I mentioned earlier, I wanted to go all out.

I didn't catch the guy's name that helped us, but he was funny and overall a cool guy.

Next time in Vegas and if our journey permits, I'll probably swing by, especially if I'm looking to load up on food and save my leftovers for dinner."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp a million years ago and bookmarked it. I was finally in the area and dropped in, I got the ala carte katsu and Teri chicken, They were both delicious!! My partner but the Mac salad, kimchi, and the spicy poke. Everything was great. The Mac salad a bit mild in flavor for my taste but I still enjoyed everything, the service included! I wish this place were a bit further north as I'm not usually in this area, but if I am again, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I'm homesick and want to eat a quality plate lunch! I usually get the large plate, which comes with 2 scoops of rice, 3 choices of meat, and 2 sides! I would recommend the pulehu steak, chicken katsu, and spicy ahi! They never disappoint! The pulehu steak is always well seasoned and cooked perfectly. They have the spicy ahi and one other type of poke (I think it's called Hawaiian but I'm not too sure). For sides, I'd recommend trying the mac salad, kimchee slaw, or garlic edamame. They have canned juice or fountain drinks if you're thirsty! Staff members provide quick and friendly service! The line moves pretty quickly when it gets busy. You can also call and make a phone order if you're in a rush/just want to pick it up and go. Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Last few visits not so memorable...today the server touched his nose before weighing out our food..not good. So the quality is great. I wished the mochiko wings were boneless since everything is weighed too may get around 3-4 depending on the order. I dont ever remember anything in Hawaii being weighed, but this is what is close for Hawaiian food. To the young servers, if you touch your face please wash your hands."}
{"text":"By far the best Hawaiian I've found in Vegas and Henderson. 

If you haven't checked out this small joint on the Southwest side of Las Vegas, cross streets Tropicana and Fort Apache, 1.5 miles South on Fort Apache Rd. from W. Tropicana Ave., then read the reviews and check out the customer-submitted pics.  

Salivate, drive to Makai, eat, yum, sleep, work, repeat. Lol"}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii and being able to have food from home is such a nice treat when you've been gone for so long. I love the service and the price here!  I got an \"ono'er\" (medium sized plate lunch) and it was only $7. That's a steal! You get 2 choices of meat and 2 sides. From sweet corn to Mac salad etc. with your choice of white or brown rice. I will definitely come back before I leave. 

For my plate lunch I got chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken with sweet corn and edamame. Its so ono. Definitely didn't disappoint. I'm not even half way done and I am full. They are very gracious with the servings as well. My mom got kalua pig and steak pulehu (to add steak it's $1 more but so worth it) sweet corn and Mac salad. They also have Hawaiian-sun juice.  

I definitely recommend this place to anyone. They just opened but I hope to see them succeed and any more to their menu!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best teriyaki AND chicken katsu! I came here after a long active day at Glow Zone, so I was ready to grub on some good food. Makai definitely hit the spot. I ordered the Medium bowl with teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, brown rice, kimchee slaw (10/10 for kimchee lovers), and the garlic edamame.  

The teriyaki chicken was cooked to perfection, it was still moist and not covered in an unnecessary amount of teriyaki sauce. The chicken katsu was perfectly crispy and the inside was soft and juicy! The kimchee slaw was delicious on so many levels. I'll probably end up getting double kimchi slaw the next time! They do have furikake so make sure you ask for it and put it on your rice for some extra flavor! 

Now the only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because of their poke. I had a couple of bites of my gf's poke, and it was a little too salty. I checked with her and my other friend to make sure it wasn't just me, and they agreed. I'm sure it was probably just this batch of poke, so I'll make sure to come back and try it again because this place is still bomb!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food is amazing for a great price !! Highly recommend the poke and teriyaki chicken to every one."}
{"text":"I was really excited that they opened one on my side of town. Both locations I can always count on really family-friendly staff and a really clean restaurant and some really YUMMY hawaiian bbq. My go to items here are the Mochiko Wings & Chicken Teriyaki. Their portions are really big. A medium size plate is usually more than enough for two. You get two scoops of rice (brown or white), two meats, and two sides. Their plates are a little pricey but it's worth the price because you basically get two meals worth of food if you're eating alone. Love that they play your island jams from Kolohe Kai, Rebel Souljahz, J Boog, and few of your other popular bands."}
{"text":"Was very happy with the food! I had three sides: mochiko chicken wings, teriyaki chicken, and chicken katsu. All of the meats weren't dry and they were full of flavor. It was my first time here, they were very friendly and let us sample the poke. I liked the regular tuna over the spicy but they were both yummy. You get a lot of food in all portions. The restaurant was clean. The staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good for chipotle style food service. The chicken Katsu is a lot bigger than traditional style but yet still retains its juiciness. Kalua pig and mac salad is standard with good flavor. Kalua pig doesn't have cabbage though. Kimchi slaw is sweet and tart !"}
{"text":"Prices went up a little bit, but the food is always great. Wish they had a location in Henderson, but it's worth taking the trip to get good island style food. Staff is ok, it can be packed at times, and they run out of poke from time to time."}
{"text":"Such onolicious food and cheap, too!  Now we can get our Makai fix relatively closer to our house.  The newest location is right off the 95 at Lake Mead and Rock Springs in a plaza that's usually filled with cars because of the popular burger spot on the corner (if you know my fiancé, you know which one I'm talking about).  We recently went to Makai for dinner and it was relatively deserted.  It shouldn't be, though, because the food here is so good!  My go-to is the Ono'er/Medium plate where you get your choice of 2 meats, 2 sides, and rice for $7.89 (there are upcharges for brown rice, teriyaki  or pulehu steak, and poke).  My two choices for meat were the teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu with sides of mac salad and garlic edamame--delicious and filling!  I usually can't finish all my food, but that's okay with Mel because he's willing to help out with what I don't devour.  Get your aloha on here!"}
{"text":"Chiming in on the love for Makai, it's definitely fantastic and fast.  I am a fan of the Teriyaki Chicken and Mochiko Wings for the tasty protein.  Add some brown rice and mac salad and/or corn and, voilà, a fabulous meal with all the ono food groups that Makai is great at providing.
The staff shares the aloha spirit with you the whole time and the price is right for what you get.  I don't think I've ever ordered anything larger than the medium (Ono'er) which gives you two choices of protein and two sides, but that's enough for me and it's only $7.59 (there's an upcharge if you get Premium Meats like steak and poke, which I haven't).
The only down side for us is that it's so far away from our house.  If you're in the area, stop by and try Makai!"}
{"text":"My family an I love it here. We are always here!

Always clean, always great customer service, and always great food. The price for the amount of food is the best part. Many choices. I will continue coming here every week. 

Their creamy sesame dressing is amazing. Great poke and kalua pig. *please serve poi one day*"}
{"text":"This place is really good for Authentic Hawaiian Food! Very simple and clean. You pick and choose your food combinations based on the size plate you get. Everything is fairly? priced."}
{"text":"This place is clean and friendly. The food is good. Prices are reasonabl. The only issue with this place is that they always seem to be out of poke when I go, and at times, they burn the meat. In the last two months, they haven't had poke. I don't understand why they don't make more poke in the mornings for the high demand of poke. I noticed there are a couple new poke places opening up, hopefully they can stock up their poke. I want poke!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. I like the meats etc. Except the poke seems bland needs more flavor and does seem fresh. The kimchi slaw Im not too crazy about neither. Just my honest opinion , but I'll still go there and skip the poke and kimchi slaw."}
{"text":"Food is delicious & the customer service is great. It's definitely like Chipotle the way you order your food. The kimchi slaw is one of my favorite side dishes! It is so delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. They let me sample the meats and choose my favorites. The medium size is enough for me and my daughter to share, all for $7, or about $9 if we get poke. So worth it! The poke melts in your mouth. I hope they stick around. We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"Today we ate lunch here for the first time.  And it will not be the last time!  Fabulous!  Food is delicious.  Good size portions.  And the flavors are awesome.  Took a picture of my ono (small) but forgot to take hubby's ono'er (medium)...  We chose teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, wings, kimchee slaw, macaroni salad and rice.  We basically ended up sharing the meal because we wanted to try all of it!  Mark came over while we were finishing up and told us about the rewards program, so I downloaded the app right there and he made sure we got credit for what we had just purchased.  DEFINITELY putting this on the weekly rotation for lunch.  So happy we found it!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here the spicy poke was good as usual but the teriyaki chicken not so great will come here again and hopefully the teriyaki chicken will be better."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars the price of there food is perfick as well as the food an amount the give is the best the food is omg so yummy so unlike other places u feel like u r home again n the staff is amazing nice an great greeters smiles so come down n check them out an enjoy good music n food"}
{"text":"Very pleased with everything I've tried at this place! The poke is awesome! Tastes like real Hawaiian poke...both the Hawaiian style and the spicy are great. Kalua pork is delicious. Katsu chicken is crunchy and juicy. I love that this is like mixed plate style that you get in Hawaii but you can make your base salad if you don't want  to do rice. Lots of ways to vary your plate. Everyone can get something to please them."}
{"text":"Used Makai to cater a party at our home for about 40 people.  We did Chicken Teriyaki, Katsu Chicken, Kalua Pork, Mac Salad, Kimchee spicy slaw, and tossed salad with sweet sesame dressing.  We also had both white and brown rice.  The overall tab was very reasonable at about $300.  Our guests raved about the food, and kept asking the address so they could go on their own!

Mahalo!   You made our party a big success!!"}
{"text":"Ok.. I'm one tough cookie to impress when it comes to local food... and this place has left me so full because I couldn't stop eating it!!! CLOSEST TO RAINBOW DRIVE INN IVE FOUND! it's clean, good island music, food is hot, not over salted like most Hawaiian places in town, and is damn good! Wow! Had the Teri chicken, beef, mochico chicken wings, and kalua pig with rice and mac salad ! ALL SO GOOD! And the Hawaiian poke was then best I've had in town! We got a pound of it to go because we had to have more for home lol! WE WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"First  time here. Heard it was good and they were right. I had the Salad with 2 meats (steak & wings) and creamy sesame.  Very tasty.  I liked the Hawaiian music too!"}
{"text":"I had a bowl with steamed rice, pork, and chicken wings and it was so good! Came to about $10 because the wings are extra but everything was flavorful. I ordered a side of Mac salad as well ($1.99) and I think it's the best I've ever tasted. I tried the other locations' and it wasn't quite the same. Whoever they have as the cook/chef is the bomb lol"}
{"text":"Pretty simple menu; I got the bowl with poke (one each of the two varieties, the one without the heavier sauce was my favorite of the two). It's pretty basic but also tasty and reasonably priced. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"A Hawaiian girl on the 9th island... will search for Hawaiian style food options.

My mom and I come here all the time. I probably came here for lunch for 7 times. Both dine in and to go.

It's in our neighborhood and satisfying \"fast food\", just walk in, pick your choices in a matter of a minute and eat in or take it to go. 

I always order the mochiko chicken, corn, garlic edamame, and brown rice. I have tried their poke but I think I rather just stick to their mochiko chicken. My mom usually orders chicken katsu, kalua pig, mac salad, corn and brown rice. 

Indoor and outdoor seating. Parking lot outside.
A punch card would be cool. Good Hawaiian plate lunch style spot in the SW area."}
{"text":"Finally made the trip here to check it out and was it ever worth it - grrrrrrreat steak and kalua pork, delicious sides (had the kimchee slaw and garlic edamame) and BIG portions! I had a medium bowl and couldn't finish it, leftovers for later :)

Place was spotless, crew were friendly, and the music was local. This is basically Blazin' Steaks on steroids so if you know what I'm talking about nevermind this review already, come check um out! \m/"}
{"text":"Las Vegas is seriously on the come up with island food. They don't refer to us as the 9th island for nothing.

Makai is located on Fort Apache, right across from Walmart and in the same plaza as Sweet Addiction.

It kind of reminds me of Chipotle in the sense where you get to choose what you want in your order. They have an assortment of sizes to select from that all vary in the base (white or brown rice), meat (chicken, steak, ahi poke, etc.) and a side if available. You can also choose to add on a side if you'd like. The ordering is pretty straight forward, so just go for what you'd like. If you decide on the poke, there's a regular one and a spicy. I opted for the spicy and it was delicious!

The restaurant itself actual resembles Chipotle too. It seriously is, just the Hawaiian version of it. The food is amazing and the staff was nice. There's a lot of seating inside, but if the weather permits.... Definitely choose to sit outside as there are seatings on the side.

Our first visit will definitely not be our last! This place had my boyfriend claiming it to be his favorite and I expect us to be visiting again shortly."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place on my way to In N Out and I am so glad I did! It was my first time to I got the 3 meat plate. Chicken Katsu, Mochiko Wings ( Super Delish ) and Spicy Poke with dbl Mac salad. They also have kulua pork and Teri steak, sweet corn, spcy and reg edamame. With a drink it was about 14$ this spot is hidden in the back of Arby's by In n Out and it has a REALLY kind staff and helpful as well... I walked in and automatically felt positive vibes I love the music!"}
{"text":"My new favorite local food place. If you haven't tried it you don't know what your missing."}
{"text":"Fed 2 with drinks for under $20 so pretty good value. 
Tried the pulehu steak, mochiko wings, kalua pig, garlic edamame, sweet corn, and kimchi slaw (we shared a small size and a medium).
Food was good for the price. Best items were the steak (a bit tough though well seasoned), kalua pig, kimchi slaw, and garlic edamame (tasty but served cold which I'm not a fan of).
Service was adequate but not too friendly or helpful.
Bring a jacket, the place runs cold.

One star knocked off due to food/service/ambiance all not quite 5 star worthy but acceptable for value."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is fresh and the portions are huge. So glad they have a 2nd location"}
{"text":"If you are looking for consistently good Hawaiian food, served quickly by some fantastic owners and a clean place to eat then Makai Pacific Island Grill is your answer. The owners are brothers and are always welcoming and very happy. 

I love meeting my wife there for an easy and quick lunch or for an affordable dinner when we just don't want to cook. My wife loves the Kimchi Slaw and I love the California Poke and Steak. The food is good, with large portions, at affordable prices. We have already enjoyed 4 meals there and will hope to enjoy for many more meals. 

It's closed on Sundays for family time \"Ohana.\""}
{"text":"These guys are great!  Portions are awesome, prices are fair, never a line when I go. I only wish they weren't always out of poke when I go (I've only been for dinner)"}
{"text":"Everything is so damn good here. The chicken wings, Kahlua pork, Katsu and poke are jammin. The grilled meat is so tasty, the katsu is rightly crisp and the ahi is yummy.  They give you a ton of food that won't hurt your wallet.  They also have different table sauces to choose from. Overall really satisfied. 5 solid stars!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place out.. not bad!  Good flavor and lots of food!  I didn't get the \"Hawaiian\" feeling as you suggested, not even the \"aloha!\"... must work on that for sure!  Also, keeping up with the cleanliness of the restaurant is a deal breaker if you don't pay attention to details.. Good luck and keep up the great flavors ~ food is delicious...thanks to grandma! Definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"Great simple menu. Moderately priced with delicious flavors. The Mac salad is delicious. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"That chicken is just amazing!!!
Do the small size & it's just the right amount of food for most. I wish they had a location closer to Downtown Summerlin but the 10-12 minute drive isn't so bad.
Love that chicken!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Hawaiian/Asian fusion place. I had the Ono'er dish with two meats - teriyaki chicken and steak, plus brown rice and edamame and slaw. Very tasty dish and very good food. Excellent prices."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff! Hawaiian fusion menu is really good and they offer brown rice and other healthy options if that's what you're looking for. $10 gets you a mountain of food here!"}
{"text":"This place is so good.  I had the teriyaki chicken, kalua pig, rice, corn, and salad.  The kahlau pig was my favorite, all I needed was some cabbage and poi.  I will ask for it to be separated because it was pretty juicy and I don't like soggy rice.  The taste was all on point.  My mom had chicken katsu, brown rice, kalua pig, Mac salad and garlic edamame.  The Mac salad is really good you can tell someone from Hawaii made it because it is ono.  I will be going back for sure.  FYI, kalua pig is going to be salty, it's not like pulled pork."}
{"text":"Came here last night about 30 mins before closing. There was a mishap with my order but the manager addressed and fixed the issue. The food was and service was great!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Hawaiian places to eat! Delicious food, with some of the most tender pork you'll ever try and perfectly cut ahi tuna! Portions are huge, so you really get 2 meals in one! Love makai, have definitely recommended to many friends and family!"}
{"text":"It's great to finally have a go-to place for Hawaiian food other than your usual L&L! We are regulars at Sweet Addiction, so I was excited to see this place being built a few doors down. I hate to admit it, but we have been coming here at least twice a week. The food is just so good!

The first time I dined here, it reminded me of a Chipotle, but Hawaiian style. I do appreciate the different sizes that they offer - you can choose a small plate that comes with one meat and one side, or the large plate that comes with three servings of meat and two sides. Don't care for the sides? They also have a bowl with two servings of meat. So far, my favorites are the Teriyaki Steak and the Kalua Pork. The Teriyaki Steak has great flavor, is cooked well and never disappoints. The Kalua Pork is also delicious and I like how they don't put cabbage in their version. I'm so happy because it is very hard to find good Kalua Pork in this city. Usually I find it to be flavorless, dry or too watery. Makai and Braddah's are the only two places where I can eat it. I'm not too crazy about their sides, but if I do get them, its usually the edamame and corn. I choose the brown rice once, but it was kind of dry. Maybe I'm just a rice connoisseur, but I feel that many people don't know how to cook brown rice. Normally it requires more water and longer cooking times. But no problem, I am cool with eating white rice.

The employees are very friendly. Glad to see that there are always many people at the restaurant. Definitely give this place a try if you are looking for good Hawaiian food!!"}
{"text":"Makai is a Hawaiian style spot that opened up recently. Despite only recently opening, I have already been twice and have enjoyed each visit.

You can select from several different sizes varying from a small bowl with one protein option to the largest option that allows you to choose three different proteins. On my first visit I ordered the poke, kalua pork and pulehu steak with brown rice. The kalua pork was good but not great but the poke and and pulehu steak were tasty. On my second visit I went with the Mochiko chicken and poke salad which was delicious. 

I enjoy that they offer so many health options and allow you to choose brown rice or salad in place of white rice. I look forward to returning soon for some more poke and Mochiko chicken. The prices are reasonable but can get high as you add additional add-ons."}
{"text":"My second day in a row. Great food great prices and AWSOME service and workers. I found this place because literally everyone was snap chatting pics about there food and I finally asked."}
