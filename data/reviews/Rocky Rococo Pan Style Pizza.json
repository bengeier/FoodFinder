{"text":"Its not gourmet pizza, but it is good for a chain. Its one of the only places to get a slice of pizza on the go for a reasonable price. 
The breadsticks are a great indulgence, especially if you like butter and garlic, its not not just dry bread. 
The staff is always friendly and there is almost never a wait if you order at the counter. We almost always take it to go, I am not a fan of the seating area. It smells very much like fast food and is not too comfortable. 
Overall, its a great place to get a slice and breadsticks for lunch or dinner on the go."}
{"text":"Bout as low quality pizza as you can get, but it definitely can serve a quick, greasy pizza fix if you need one. 

They have a drive thru so you can literally drive off with an 800 calorie greasy square slice of pizza for $4.50 in under one minute. It is probably best to go around peak times so it'll be fresh (or to ask which slices are most recently cooked)."}
{"text":"Awesome as usual.  Delivery was right on time, both the order taker were pleasent and professional, and the pizza has always and seams to continue to rock."}
{"text":"This is a solid Rocky's location.  I generally get fast service, the prices are average for Madison, and they have a nice bit of games and a fireplace.  The pizza is similar to Unos but I consider it less greasy.  I would recommend this Rocky's to people planning to try the place out.  The one on Monona drive is nice also.  AVOID the East Wash location."}
{"text":"Very, very greasy pizza, but what do you expect from Rocky's? I do appreciate the deep dish pizzas, but I haven't come back in years, because of the heavy and unhealthy fare. Kids love it though, and the sausages are actually a guilty pleasure of mine."}
{"text":"We really didn't enjoy the raw wings and undercooked pizza. However, the fact that we were not refunded what we paid was over the top bad customer service."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever. The service was terrible and the food was horrible. The pizza was very doughy and undercooked. We didn't receive any plates to eat off of in the dining room the people working behind the counter were rude. Such a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I love me some Rocky's, but this location has a number of strikes against it. First, it's got a strange location that isn't the easiest to get to. Second, the layout is odd. They were updating the exterior, though it's the interior that really needs help. Lastly, the pizza was ok, but didn't seem to live up to what I usually expect. Plus they gave me the wrong slice to start with."}
{"text":"It's at a hop, skip & a jumps distance, in front of the hotel. That is why I decided to go for it first. 

It has a spacious family dining area. They offer pasta, BBQ rib tips, Buffalo wings, salad bar, beer, and four varieties of pizzas. However, I wasn't too pleased with their pizza by the slice. It's very good, but not pizza by the slice material."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here.  The help really sucks though.  It doesn't seem like anybody wants to be there.  I get it, they cook pizza and wait on people for living, it's not the greatest, but cmon...at least try.  Pizza good, attitude bad."}
{"text":"Let's just put it out there:  You don't get to meet Rocky when you come in.  It's a let down for sure.  

If you're in the neighborhood wanting some lunch, I love this place.  You'll get a good deal on a slice of pizza, their salad bar, and a drink.  

For the pizza?  It's quality stuff.  Think Pizza Hut, but with a more flavorful crust.  I'm also a fan of the rectangle orientation.  Not sure why a rectangle pizza tastes better, but I don't question it.

Bottom line, you won't be disappointed.  It's a quality pizza, and a great place to stop by for a good lunch."}
{"text":"This is your average Joe pizza chain. 

The difference is that you can get both Sicilian style pizza and thin crust pizza. For healthy people, there's even the option to switch out your normal dough crust with whole wheat crust. 

I don't recommend getting pizza by the slice or even the value combos. They aren't worth it."}
{"text":"OMG this place sucks. I didn't want to wait for a made to order pizza, so I go the slices. It seems that they sell quite a few slices, so you would think they would be okay or at least edible. It was HORRIBLE. They are slices of undercooked doughy bread, as the crust, with grease oozing everywhere. Literally, I had to take a napkin and place it underneath the slices in the box, because I didn't want the crust to become soggy. IT WAS PURE CRAP. And get this, each one was about $4."}
{"text":"I eat lunch between 10am and 11am because I begin my day at 5am.  I went to Rocky's  recently at 10:30am to give them another shot.  Their door said they opened at 10:30am.   The door was locked.  Waited for two minutes,,,,, still no one.   Went to my car.   As I drove out the lot I saw someone opening the door.   Bye bye...."}
{"text":"It was our sons 13th birthday and he wanted to celebrate at Rockys with his favorite pizza and games. The pizza was as expected but the service was atrocious! Worst we've ever had!!! It took 50 minutes to get HALF of our order. They delivered our pizza to another table - twice! The sad thing is that my son was apologizing to us for wanting to come here. We will probably not come back again"}
{"text":"What a horrible, awful experience! I was the only person in line, & the counter person Carlos, could NOT get the order right to save his life. Really?! First, they did NOT have iced tea. What restaurant on planet Earth doesn't offer iced tea?! Not at the West Towne Mall location. Also, the flavors of slices available? Cheese, sausage, pepperoni or a sausage & pepperoni combo. That's it!
Our order was completely wrong for two slices; I mentioned this and the female co-worker rolled her eyes in contempt. I also asked for flat ware to eat with & they were mad at ME for inconveniencing them? C'mon! Your incompetence is NOT my fault.
I gave it one star because the pizza was decent; but that pizza chain has bit the dust long ago and nobody employed there cares. Stay away & eat something healthy, Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"I guess I got spoiled.

The Whitewater, WI location is leagues above this location, and it's unfortunate because I used to love going to Rocky's when we lived there.

In three visits to this location after moving to the Middleton area, I've had my order incorrect all three times, and each instance took at least an hour or more. Whether it was an incorrect order slip, or having my pizza given to someone else, it's going to make it difficult for me to ever go back to this location. Each time I also requested wheat crust, but each time we were deceived... we always wound up with the regular crust.

I'm not trying to hate on these guys because they did try to make it up to us by giving us a free pizza... but unfortunately that free pizza order was the one that was given to another customer by accident."}
{"text":"The food was fine, the young girl that took my order for today's lunch was incredibly rude and brash."}
{"text":"Kind of surprised at the low reviews, then again, I've only gotten delivery from this Rocky's location. Deliver in general has been decent. There was one occasion where it was a good hour+ waiting time before our pizza arrived, however, it was also a Packer game on during the time we ordered. A medium pizza has 12 slices. The slices are cut into squares and are pretty large. 2 slices should feel you up. A good 2-4 people should have able to get full from this size pizza but I guess it depends on how hungry you are. Personally, I like their pizza. To this day, I swear by Costco having the best pizza so I cannot say it's the best but it's better than other pizza chains."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Rocky's since I was a kid. It is great when what you want is fast comfort food. My kids have grown to love it too. Not super healthy, but yummy for a treat."}
{"text":"I love me some Rocky's once in a while - their pizza is always spot-on and the various restaurants are mostly consistent.   This location does not disappoint - it's larger than others, so you can find a table off in a quiet corner if you need one.  It's pretty clean and the staff were friendly enough.  The salad bar ingredients were pretty fresh and tasty.

For me, this is a nice meet-in-the-middle location for lunches with folks working in other areas."}
{"text":"Loved this pizza place, if you are looking for a greasy, cheesy pizza this is a wonderful place. Their customer service was great and they were very helpful and nice. 

Glad I didn't pay any mind to the reviews before mine because I believe this place definitely deserves more that 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"I was in a hurry for lunch, ordered a super-slice, forgot to order water. Asked for water, they said to get it from Taco Bell, and refused to give it to me. I protested, and the person who identified themself as the manager said they would call security to kick me out of the mall, just for protesting them not giving me a water. I demanded to know their name and who was their supervisor, and they refused both questions and had me kicked out of the mall by security. I used to love rock's, but all of my fond memories have been wiped out by recent experiences, I'm through with them."}
