{"text":"This place has it's ups and downs. Sometimes you can get good deals, sometimes you can get totally ripped off. It's a good place but I think it's given more of a good reputation than it deserves. I get lost every time in here, every area looks the same. It's so confusing that they had to give the aisles names (like streets)!"}
{"text":"Pacific Mall!! A huge chinese mall filled with hundreds of shops. 50% of those shops are electronic stores with iphone accessories and stufd, 20% of the shops are clothing stores for women, 20% of the shops are bubble tea shops lol, and the other 10% are random stores.  There are some cool stuff out there and dirt cheap too. Weekends get crowded like crazy, parking is CRAZY!! Don't expect to find a spot close to the mall. Pretty cool place to check out once in a while. I stumble upon this place every once in a while."}
{"text":"I think this mall is worth a visit, but I don't think that I would frequent it that often if I lived in Toronto.  It's so big!  With rows and rows of booths....but not much variety.  You've literally got cell phone accessories, cosmetics, and clothes.  The end.  There's so jewelry stores, videos, and random other stores, but for the most part, it's all the same.  There's a large food court area upstairs that looked pretty good.  There were also lots of home goods stores and hair salons.  Just not sure if the crowds and the incredibly hard to find parking is worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty sure everything here is stolen property, there was an iPhone for $2 with an Apple Store security tag on it."}
{"text":"I really like Pacific Mall, you will find cool stuff, all in one location, that you couldnt get anywhere else in T.O. I went there with my sister and she didnt like it as much because mostly everything is fake. This didnt bother me though.  The food there is ok, the same chinese food as anywhere. I  never knew that parking was so bad as people are saying. Everytime I went was a weekend, and it was not very crowded at all. I guess bad parking is just holidays time."}
{"text":"I really do love going to pacificmall with my friends, it's a great place to spend time and shop.  The food there are ok I guess a bit small in the food court....  Never buy any key chain, cell chain, necklace,bracelet, and those sort of things... like in those buy 2 get one free places... like i'm not saying don't go there.... you could if you want... but in my opinion you shouldn't. I think most of them are own by the same people.... since they sell the same things and the concept is the same.  I found many things in those store that are REALLY CHEAP in China, the price was like 18 dollar for a little plastic keychain....like in China I bought it for 2 dollars.... that's like 16 dollars difference... so use your money wisely....  There is one cellphone store I went to, and let me tell you this ask EVERYTHING about that phone before you buy it.... they will hide stuff from you.... no refund too i think...."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall has been on my Toronto To-Do list since I got here two years ago and I finally made it out there. Needless to say, it was completely packed; I'm not sure if that's because it was Lunar New Year's Eve or if it's normally that packed, but I had to practically Mario Andretti myself into a parking space.  There are some amazing things to see in Pacific Mall and the photographer really wanted to come out in me; I restrained myself, however, what with being one of the few blonde people in the joint, I thought it best to refrain. There were all kinds of roots, herbs and pickled things, but which were written in Mandarin/Cantonese, so I'd have zero clue what they were for.  I ended up buying some DVD's (10 for $30), which rocked; of course, they are dubbed in Chinese characters which I can't seem to turn off. Meh -- win some, lose some. :-)"}
{"text":"Great o to place for electronics and while waiting u can cruise this crazy-fun eye candy mall"}
{"text":"50% Cell phone cases, 25% Off brand women's clothing, 25% knickknacks. Wonder around and count the clerks on their cell phones.   Inexpensive Asian culture, without being in Kensington Market. Mind you, there's a lot of markup on things you could get off eBay, but feel free to haggle and observe the endless % off signs."}
{"text":"The only problem I have with this mall is parking! Mango slushy is a must when we visit. Other than that we usually come here for our optical needs. Sometimes look for deals on electronics or car accessories."}
{"text":"I was walking in Leslieville with sarah l., having just uttered the words, \"I'm so glad I got to revisit Pacific Mall when it wasn't crowded,\" when a woman smoking a cigarette outside Comrade's busted out with, \"When is Pacific Mall NOT crowded?\"  So I'm going to write basically what I told that lady last night: \"Have dinner nearby like at Chung King Garden Restaurant http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chung-king-garden-restaurant-markham#hrid:GUC6ZshBQ3vfj_Ckfpke2g then head over to Pacific Mall around 8:00. Most of the stores will be closed but you can hit up Ding Dong Grocery http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ding-dong-grocery-markham#hrid:TvUe4KBLF87f6h0gAG8Jxg and go to the arcade, and even get a watermelon juice from the bubble tea shop on the second floor.  No, the bootleg DVD stores will not be open at that hour but the mall will be empty and you won't be tossed around like a blow-up doll in a frat-boy circle jerk, either.\"  I will only go to Pacific Mall at night, and preferably with sarah l."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I really have nothing bad to say about P-Mall...You can find anything at P-Mall and it's on big building so you don't have to be freezing your ass in the winter!!"}
{"text":"Remember! No exchange and No refund.  I bought a sunglass at Royal Care Optical in Pacific Mall. I paid $150.  The ticket price was $350. (more than 50% discount)  Next day,  I checked the product's retail website and found the original price is only $79. I complained it to the sale person (Doris). She said it's my mistake not checking the retail price before buying it. :("}
{"text":"The mall was big with many stores on three different floors. The style is very Hong Kongish with electronics stores like in Mongkok and other boutique all in one.  There's a food court on the second floor with many food selection. I would definitely stroll around if I'm visiting Canada again in the future."}
{"text":"I try to avoid coming to this mall. It is always packed full of people. I usually only come here if I absolutely NEED to or if one of my friends drag me with them.   Majority of the stores are cell phone related, bubble-tea stores, bootlegged DVD's, \"Asian\" clothing stores/cosmetics and saving the best for last, Asian Candy Stores. However, the best part of pacific mall is definitely the food court where you can get awesome food for cheap prices."}
{"text":"Good place to go at least once in your lifetime...you will get a small taste of what it's like to be in HK.  They've got lots of different stores and as other reviewers noted, if your kids like like cute stuffies and all things Hello Kitty, you won't be disappointed, though it's not the cheapest place to buy them."}
{"text":"Great place with alot of stores to hangout. If i ever need a phone or parts i always come here because you can bargain and get a good price.  Lots of variety for food here as well."}
{"text":"I use to go here All when I was little had the best memories in the arcades! So many Japanese arcade games to play like street fighter now it changed though. my grandpa would always bring me here I miss going here it's been years... Hope I'll come back here soon"}
{"text":"No, not that good, maybe the food court, but even then... Prices are not that low as some might imagine. First of all the quality of the goods sold is low. A knock-off is a knock-off even though it has a piece of real fox fur and a Canda goose label on it. Is it worth a couple of hundred dollars? Some think it is. I don't. Second there are other Asian plazas, malls around GTA that offer lower pricing on the same goods. The reason to go to Pacific Mall I find is to just hang out: bubble tea and food. Ok there is a great selection of phone cases but I can get them in Mississauga twice cheaper. The vendors are smart enough to keep the prices high because of the traffic. I can only imagine the margins they take :) I walked into a jade store, the price must have tripled in a second,especially for me, often there are no tags, you have to ask. As far as the food court goes, I stick to the dumpling/noodle place. You can recognize it easily by the loud sounds the hand-pulled noodles produce when they hit the table. That guy is pretty strong.  As far as parking goes, arrive early, that's all I can say.  For Collectors: If you go to the Market place. There is a porcelain vase shop on the alley behind the stage. Among random stuff you will find some authentic porcelain vases there, with the artists' signatures. A few of those are stunning."}
{"text":"If there is anything that anyone needs, and they need it for an affordable price, Pacific Mall is the answer. The indoor \"Hong Kong\" is filled in with wide range of stores from optical to electronics, from clothing to fancy purses. Its also a \"Makka\" for cell phones and mobile technology, it definetly meets the needs for any common mobile use user out there with pretty much any phone.   Sometimes some store owners may be a little annoying, but just keep walking and stepping in other stores as well, coz .. the place is filled with multiple choices."}
{"text":"Indoor mall with a lot of asian shops. Everything from cloth, electronics, household goods. Good upstairs food court. Gets busy on weekends and holidays."}
{"text":"I have an extremely deep bond with Pacific Mall as I grew up in the area. Pacific Mall's the closest Mall near my old house and the only one in walking distance.   The mall is a great place for KPOP fans who are looking for recent albums and posters ´**` or Anime fans who are interested in buying stuffed animals or merchandise. ¯\_(?)_/¯   Although there are many cell phone cases stores I do not recommend buying cases at this mall. Why? They're made from cheap quality and are extremely overpriced. GET THEM ONLINE!   Cellphone repairs at P-mall are also a terrible idea. Not only will you be paying way too much for the service, but your phone will probably be in worse condition than it was before! ( -_- ;)   What do I recommend to buy at P-mall? food (2nd floor) .. and BUBBLE TEA! I prefer Ten Ren & Real Fruit but there are also many other different stores. (Chat time, preso)"}
{"text":"Pacific mall is a great place to get eye glasses for a super cheap price compared to Lens Crafters or Hakim.  My eyes are pretty bad, -6.25 and I think -4.50 with a pretty bad astigmatism in one eye and I got a pair of Hugo Boss frames with high index lenses with all the coatings etc for $310 all in (when I used to go to Hakim I would pay over $500 for one pair of glasses).    There are tons of eye glass locations and a lot of them have the same products so walk around to a bunch of them and ask them to quote you a price based on your prescription.  Either bring you prescription with you or they can check your prescription off your current glasses.    Don't mind the price on the frames, they always say, oh today we are having a 50% sale off the frames or if you can buy a second pair for $1 etc. I think the listed price on my Hugo Boss was like $350 - $400 at most of the places and the highest place to quote me a price said $200 for the frames. They can also provide an insurance receipt if you need it."}
{"text":"This place is an indoor flea market. Well, a very nice and neat indoor flea market. The big difference is majority of the goods are brand new. If you are looking for the Gap or Starbucks, this is not it.   This is one of our stops in our Canadian weekend. The mister's brother told us to visit here. At the time, I was like okay and he said the word \"mall\", as this shopaholic loves a mall. Once I was stepped inside, I was like, Am I still in Canada? How come I don't hear \"Eh\", and everyone here is Asian?! Little did I know that Pacific Mall means is the mall to buy anything that's asian, sold by asians, cooked by asians, etc. I felt that I have been transplanted to Hong Kong.   Don't get me wrong, me loves anything asian but I guess I was expecting a Gap or Starbucks mall. I did not have those happy shopaholic moments. I did shop my heart out and went browsing in the clothing shops. The clothing sold here were okay quality. I could not find anything I liked,  if you are a size 0 or a skeleton this is the place for you. I was in one stall, deciding for the longest time to get a new phone case and they were really cheap, but in the end, I concluded that I don't need a new phone case.   There are places that are like Pacific Mall back home, but I have to say Pacific Mall beats them all. For my friends back in Queens, this place blows Flushing Mall out of the water in terms of atmosphere and variety of goods sold. I feel the ones who would appreciate this place would be non-asians. If you don't want Starbucks, there is bubble teas everywhere!"}
{"text":"I'd usually come here for accesories for everyday phone use an other gaming needs, but in all honesty the only thing i recall actually spending money on here are the bubble tea corners everywhere! D: they're sooooo goood!!! None the less get you're electronic needs for cheap guys."}
{"text":"Went here a few times while visiting Canada. It's always packed no matter what time of day. They have a decent variety of food and lots to choose from for cheap."}
{"text":"Good for quick side dishes (egg waffles, walnut cakes, egg rolls, spicy fish and beef balls). Nothing much to see but a good place for cheap stuff."}
{"text":"I''ve been to Pacific mall many times in the past but have not been there for over a year and decided to go to day to see if anything had changed or any new upgrades.  It turns out nothing new or exciting.  I find that everytime I go there, really there is nothing  to buy unless you are there for food, cell phones and accessories, little nick nacks etc. I find it quite boring there.  Not a good place for shopping.  Probably, better off at a regular mall.  The washrooms always gross me out!  My family and I are just fond of the good asian food around the Markham area especially dim sum.  Never go there on weekends, you just end up fighting for parking spots.  I say a waste of my drive to be honest since I'm coming from sauga."}
{"text":"I come here once a year every time I'm in Canada.   Everyone that I go with (teenagers, I'm the only adult lol) agrees with me when I say this place is amazing.   Off the top of my head there are:  DVD stores that will have tons and tons of movies, animes, dramas, etc for super cheap Anime merchandise stores Snack stores with candy, drinks, food etc.  Asian Fobby gyaru (?) type clothing stores (Their stuff is expensive! But just haggle with them, they're easy!) Nail salons Jewelry stores  A nice but really packed food court  Comments on personal things:   You can buy every fricking phone case in the world. My friend bought a life proof case for 18$ and it works. So much better that online even.   There's this one place in particular that we always visit. I can't remember the name but it's a DVD store that always does this deal where you buy 4 discs you get 1 free.   You can buy sets of DVD's for dramas, animes, movies, tv shows etc here.  For soooo cheap. I think most of the movies were about 5$ each. I in particular looked at the Miyazaki stuff. Those DVD's in America would have cost me 20$+ each.   We always end up getting a ton of stuff here."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall is a cool place to walk around and browse. It is a complete departure from your typical North American mall experience.  After going here several times over the years. It does have its place.   Perhaps you may find something unique and imported that's not available at any of the other malls you frequent.  You can get your spicy fish ball fix in the SE corner, imported cell phones along the East side of the mall, latest video games from Japan, computer parts, some HK fashions and of course there is no shortage of cheap bubble tea.    Business operates a little different in this mall. So bring ca$h if you catch my drift. :p  Parking can be a pain on the weekend especially on statutory holidays. It's a popular spot for locals and out of town visitors a like.  I hit up pacific mall aka Pac mall/p-mall from time to time and see what's new.    Random fact, this was where the Cullen Country Barn once stood. The comedian Russell Peters likes to mention this mall in his jokes."}
{"text":"We went to C-starepair in Pacific mall to get a cellphone screen fixed. We were told it would take 45 minutes and it took 1 hour and 45 minutes.  The screen given was scratched and they tried to hide it using a screen protector that was poorly put on. The screen also now has a part that is not working that was working before. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"From a malls standards its pretty bad. Should you expect pac mall to be what it is, well of course you should.   obviously words cant describe the parking experience here. Case in point come earlier than what you think is early. Ive never driven here as the steeles bus or a long bike ride has done it for me.   My favourite place has always been the arcade upstairs on the 2nd floor, though the price to play even 1 arcade game is hefty.   Go here if your short on tablet & phone cases or need to get something unlocked. Not to mention the bubble tea here ain't half bad. Oh and check out market village right beside it."}
{"text":"There's only two reasons why I come here, the food and getting a haircut.  Each time I come here, I go directly to the chinese ramen shop that hand tosses their noodles right in front of you.  The extra addition of soy milk on the side goes perfect with the hot ramen.  Something about their chili paste on the side is outstanding.  There's a smokey taste to it that i have never tasted anywhere else besides this place.  Once i get my ramen from here I hit up the kabob place that has all sorts of meats you can choose from and of course I get the SPICY SAUCE! And for dessert I grab the egg pancakes and icecream wrapped in waffles. Everything is cheap and good.  Oh the shopping is okay, they have about 100 phone accessory stores, FOOD court, arcade, few computer stores, and a few apparel stores. I did get a customized t-shirt in the food court area and they turned out really nice.  They have a bunch of prints you can choose from and they use a heat transfer method to transfer the prints."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall in general is a cool mall, but one store has left me with a really bad impression! (understatement)   The store is called \"Magic Space\" A sleek, modern looking store specializing in cell phones. They sell, repair, and trade phones, and obviously accessories. The employees are a bunch of young adults, mostly just staring down at their phone. Seems legit. Yeah I've got to say Literally the WORST customer service I've ever had in my life. Below is pretty much an essay on why the store is so f*cked up. Sorry for the long review, I don't normally waste my time with this stuff but....this time I just had to.  This took place july 4th 2013.  Recently my aunt's iPad was accidentally dropped, leaving the screen shattered and useless. I immediately thought of Pacific mall, I knew they had crazy amounts of repair shops for iphones, ipads, ect. Once I got there I looked around for the best place for repairs, one place was $135 for repair, another was $130, but this one shop called \"Magic Space\" only costs $90. Despite some skepticism from my aunt, I thought it was a great deal and trusted them to repair the screen. They told us it would take 45minutes to 1 hour. It eventually took them around 2 hours to repair the screen.  Once we came back after a long overdue wait, we were presented with our \"fixed\" iPad. I thought all was well, and was pretty excited. After I inspected the screen, it was seriously messed up. The corners has some major bubbling, there were lines under the screen that you couldn't clean, it was just really poorly done! It basically looked like a poorly put on screen protector, made out of glass!   We immediately complained and they asked us if the bubbling was caused by us touching the screen. It's a god dam touch screen; you'll have to touch it eventually. I was started to get pissed, a 2 hour long wait to get back a messed up iPad. We obviously demanded they fix it, and this is where the real problem occurred.  Note that the store and I agreed to pay after the iPad is fixed, but obviously since this isn't considered fixed we cannot pay! Some Asian lady, probably in her 20's demanded us to pay first, then they'll give the iPad repair another shot. We argued, stating that it is unfair to pay first when we previously agreed to pay AFTER it's fixed.  The Asian lady was extremmmely rude, she was yelling at us, forcing us to pay first. She kept on saying the repair this time will be perfect, and flawless, saying there will no problem whatsoever, but we just had to pay first. How can I trust you if the first repair was seriously F*cked up? She was talking loud as hell, yelling, saying the same B.S over and over.  She is literally the rudest employee I've ever met, no regards for the satisfaction of the customer. IMHO she needs to be fired a.s.a.p (how did she get the job in the first place?), if she's the owner, I recommend her closing down shop, and consider therapy. Despite her obviously being wrong, and arguing an unjustified argument, she continued to yell and scream. Note that the store had other employees and other customers also, they were shocked, probably never witness such rudeness. She threatened to call security, we gladly suggest that she does.   She was bluffing, she just wanted out $90, which really isn't hers yet because she hasn't fulfilled her end of the bargain. My aunt and I were so heated, we never expected this from the store. The store looked really professional, and they lady was dressed decently, thought she had more sense. After an argument that felt like forever, the rude lady ended by saying \"whatever\"...obviously knew her B.S arguments were not getting anywhere, and she looked incredibly stupid in front of everyone.  After some more heated exchange of words my aunt just gave her the $90, on the condition that we closely monitor the repair. (They do repairs in a separate, sketchy looking store) Some guy finally \"fixed\" the iPad ONCE again, there wasn't any bubbling at first glance so we just left angrily. Once we got home noticed the entire glass panel of the iPad was peeling away from it's body, there was a noticeable gap in between. It looks as if the new glass panel wasn't properly bonded with the body. The home button was crooked and didn't have the same feel also...   Needless to say our beloved iPad 4 is still pretty f*cked up, and I've just experience the WORST customer service in my life, literally. The rudeness and lack of respect towards customers from that lady is insane, she is not suitable for any job that requires human interaction.  In conclusion, Don't break your iPad, and don't get it fixed by the cheapest store in pacific mall by some dumb Asian lady with a lack of respect for the entire human population. I'm kinda stupid for going there in the first place, but at least I learned my lesson so you don't have to.  Just another reminder, don't go to \"Magic Space\" in Pacific mall, unless you want your balls to explode from anger..."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time going to pacific mall with my sister in law. We went just to check it out and we found out it's just a Chinese mall full of scammers. After reading reviews we decided not to fix our phone screens there .. Both our iPhones have cracked screens.. But we checked out some stores. Knock off sunglasses range from 65-95$ in one store! The Celine logo on a pair of knock offs was noticeably fake.. Fake ray bans were 65$ looked legit.   A girl in one store owed 5$ change and we never received it and she argued she already gave us change so watch closely !!   Some other stores sold brand names but I wouldn't trust it. The Canada goose was obvi fake . I checked for myself. And they wanted 550$?! Also a lot of sun glasses for 300-600$ .. Go to sunglass hut or somewhere you know you are getting the real deal and it's probably cheaper .. The people in there are all Chinese and SO RUDE.  We were walked into. We opened the door to go inside and the girl pushed us out of the way and walked threw... We should've took that as a sign to just save our time and leave. I heard the food is good but it looks ghetto as ever in there and wasn't clean so we didn't test that. The washrooms have signs on every single door back and front saying how to sit on the toilet and if u put ur feet on the toilet seat they charge u 50$? ....What the actual hell?? Made me think what kind of people are working / shopping here... Also all stores say no refund or exchange so they don't trust their own garbage they're selling. Also stores say no pictures or video allowed.. Probably because they'd be charged with all the knock off stuff being sold. A pair of LV flats 400$ ... A pair of fake Tory burch 200$.. In Tory burch store the real shoe is 225$-250$...  Save ur money and buy from legit stores. Knock offs are the same price as the legit thing here and they have no manners or class."}
{"text":"I've been coming up to this site for many, many years - back when Pacific Mall was still Cullen Barns. How many of you remember that? Over the years P-Mall has essentially stayed the same. It's a booth-style mall specializing in all things \"Asian.\" Although most shops take credit cards now, it is wise to bring cash. Most times you can bargain a bit and pay the \"sticker price\" (i.e. no tax) if you pay cash.  DO NOT come early as none of the independently owned shops open before noon, and most close up around 8pm. If you come on a weekend be prepared to fight with some feisty Asian woman driving a Honda Civic with stuffed animals lined up in her rear windshield for a parking spot! It gets really crowded really fast.  Walk along the west side for electronics, games & consoles and DVD's, lots of clothing and accessories stores in the middle - and if the items start to look similar after a while it's because most of them own each other. I found this out by trying to pay with a credit card at one store, and they sent me down a couple of booths to their sister store to use their credit card machine! There are lots of places for good take-out bubble tea and there are lots of food options upstairs.  Canada Computers is a good place to check out if you are looking for computer parts, cables, etc.  My favourite thing in this mall is Mosaic jewelery store, since I can't fit into Asian sized clothes or shoes (*sigh*), I don't buy bootleg bags, DVD's or toys (yes, there are bootleg toys...Kello Hitty anyone?).   i've recently learned that there is a Beard Papa location in this mall, so I may just have to pop buy sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Much like the Chinese shopping malls, it is suitable for young people shopping malls, there are many Chinese style snacks, and restaurants, recommend friends to visit."}
{"text":"I'd like to score food and clothing separately, food 4 star, and clothing 2star, so overall 3. I like the food court upstair, either you want to have some snacks or a meal, they always have tons of choices for you.  I've never bought any clothes from this place, they are way too over priced. Yes, you may find a lot of affordable stuff, but still, over priced. I've been to Taiwan once, I find the Taiwanese cosmetics they sell, are almost 3 times more expensive than the price in Taiwan! Well I guess if you a Taiwanese cosmetics fan,but not plan to go to Taiwan recently, then you have no choice but go Pacific mall. I almost forget the other stores. If you're from China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, and looking for your home style cookware, yes, you are in the right place."}
{"text":"Me n wifey been wanting to checkout this mall for awhile.  Definitely an asian mall.  Lots of little mini stores inside to checkout.  We had dinner at the Axia bar cafe I guess in the food court. I always go for the bento box's and never get disappointed.  My wife said the teriyaki chicken was awesome.  I imagine it can be very crowded on a weekends n shops are small n hard to walk through.  I would recommend a weekday visit."}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese mall to kill for a couple of hours if you have nothing else better to do.  The Chinese New Year celebration is the highlight.  One caveat, the parking is a hassle to get in as well as out."}
{"text":"I came here because I'd heard that this is the place to get cheap eyeglasses in Toronto. Given that I don't have very good \"vision insurance\" at my job, and I desperately needed new glasses, I decided to check it out. There are actually about a dozen optical stores, if not more -- most of which are selling largely the same merchandise. The store I ended up going to was Good Vision Optical. The salesperson was very friendly, she showed me about a dozen frames before I finally found one I liked. I was able to bargain a bit on the price and got a pair of Hugo Boss glasses (frames + lenses) for $200 all-in. Much better than what Lenscrafters was quoting me. The glasses were ready in less than 24 hours. Next time I'm in Toronto I'm going to pick up another pair!"}
{"text":"Pacific mall is known for selling cell phone accessories, DVDs, bubble tea, glasses, and a bunch of other random things. I absolutely hate coming here as the parking is always crazy and the mall is always super crowded. I only come here if I really need a new screen protector or case. A lot of the cell phone accessories shops are owned by the same owner, so the selection and prices are pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Never. Fucking. Again.  I've been here twice. Once when I was like 10, and once a year back to get my phone fixed. The good part is that they fix electronics for cheap, no complaints here. They also have one of those Dip n' Dot machines, which, here in Toronto, are a god damn needle in a haystack to find. This improved my experience substantially.  I distinctly remember both of my visits. I'm not an Asian, and hell, they'll let you know it. They all give you this...look. Like some \"look at that outsider\" shit.   I saw somebody in another review down there complain about parking lot rage, and this is my main concern. Everybody here is in a rush, yet 90% of them cannot drive. I'm not trying to be biased, I'm being quite serious. Narrowly avoided a couple of collisions here. One time in the parking lot, a driver was backing up as I was driving. He was close to hitting me, as he didn't see me while he was reversing, so I honked at him as a warning, \"I'm behind you, don't hit me.\" So what does this guy do? Steps out of his car, bangs on my window. Like hands off my car and get the fuck back in yours, you're 5'4\". No damage to the window, fortunately.  People here have an attitude, and it's noticeable. I wouldn't recommend going to Pacific Mall, unless you're Asian of course."}
{"text":"I try to avoid coming to this mall as much as possible.   Here's what you'll be putting yourself through by coming here: 1. Asian Drivers from your worst nightmare 2. Parking Lot Rage 3. Overpriced cell phone accessories  4. Overpriced & bootlegged DVDs, 'Designer' clothing/handbags...etc. 5. Filthy washrooms  6. Tons of stores selling pretty much the same things, namely: Cell phone accessories, bubble tea stores, Asian cosmetics, DVDs, excessively lacy clothing  The only reason to come here is the food court on the second floor. There's a pretty awesome hand-cut noodle store and a place that has delicious turnip cakes!   Other stores that stand out are the hair salons, chronic ink, karaoke (not sure if still in business) and the arcade on the second floor.   Tip: There are pigeons inside their indoor parking lot, so be mentally prepared to return to your poop-covered vehicle."}
{"text":"Came here a few times during my last few trips to Toronto. This place is like a China Town but cleaner and in a mall. I believe this is the largest Asian mall in north America. So with that in mind, know that there are a TON of little shops throughout this mall... and I mean just aisles of little shops here, from clothing to cell phone accessories & companies (to sign up a new plan), to electronics to dried snacks and everything else all in between. So bring cash (like you would when you come to China Town).  Food court is on the 2nd floor. There are also a lot of little eateries here that make freshly baked and warm sweet treats here, which I love to try every time I come here. The smell is just so enticing.  However, the restrooms or washrooms (as the preferred term here in Canada) are all the way down in the basement... hmm, guess whoever built this place didn't logically think this through did they? Why would the washrooms be all the way down there when there is a food court on the 2nd floor? Ok.... :/ Parking here can be a bit of a pain, but the small number of times I've been here, I've always been pretty luck to snag a parking spot.  I always come here whenever I travel to Ontario and will keep doing it the next time I come for another visit."}
{"text":"Various shops, with anything your heart desires.  Cellphone cases, tablet cases, bubble tea, tasty food and snacks.  I'm here like a million times a month. I can say no wrong."}
{"text":"I visited Pacific Mall with my parents during my Thanksgiving break. After reading about how there are hundreds of stores in this mall, of course I wanted to go and check it out! I guess I expected too much. I imagined visiting a mall like one from a TVB series but got something completely different. Here's my review as a first-time visitor from NYC.  1) If you're from NYC and have been to Flushing Mall before, this is basically a HUGE Flushing Mall. However, there are hundreds of stores selling the same merchandise...it gets boring.  2) Nothing here that is designer brand is authentic, well except for a few stores (I'd be extra careful buying anything they claim is designer here). For those that appreciate and wear designer, this mall will make you boil with rage. I did not enjoy seeing counterfeit items everywhere like it's Canal Street - it disgusted me. Heck, they even sell fake MAC makeup!   3) Overpriced. Some stores had good deals on clothing but most of the stores had ridiculous prices!! Some woman tried to sell me a plastic Hello Kitty chain for $139, which is currently being sold for $35 on the official Sanrio website...her reason for the price? It's REAL, wow.   Tip: before visiting the mall, visit several Asian clothing/accessories websites for a good idea of what the prices should be, including shipping costs.  4) Come here for good prices on pirated dvds.   5) Food is decent. I ate lunch here, it was alright...  Overall, it was an interesting experience for my parents and I - that was our first and last time at Pacific Mall."}
{"text":"I like coming here but only for the food upstairs. The parking is always crazy no matter what time of day. I never really had many pleasant experiences. I just needed to get my shellac removed and nobody acknowledged me at all. I sometimes get mistaken for a Chinese person so I get greeted in Mandarin or Cantonese, but once they realize I am not its a different atmosphere. I don't blame them at all but I'm still a paying customer. The stores change around quite a bit as well. I only ever come here when I really need something and I'm out as fast as possible."}
{"text":"DO NOT go to a store call \"Just In Case\" at Pacific Mall for any of your cell phone repairs!!! I'd recently went there for a screen replacement because of suppose water damage causing my screen to have permanent bright spots on screen, BIG MISTAKE!!!...   First off, they told me I need a complete screen replacement (glass+LCD) and it will cost $180. I agree and they told me to come back in around 30 mins to pick up my phone. I went back multiple times after 30 mins and finally, someone brought back my phone from \"another location\" an hour and a half later. I was running late for work so I inspected it quickly just to see if the spots were there, the spots were not noticeable at that moment so I paid them and ask for a receipt. They said they don't give out receipts and just taken one of their business card.    24 hours later, my phone was in a parked car for 2 hours and I noticed my \"suppose professionally replaced new screen\" starts to peel off on its own at the bottom and the bottom left corner, I freaked out and looked at it and noticed a blob of glue had started to melt, leaked out to the edgr of my bezel and a piece of double sided tape covering my suppose button area (I own a One plus One and the bottom portion of my phone has 3 illuminate button area). So not only did they do a very unprofessional repair, they even have poor workmanship.   During that night, I also noticed the white spot CAME BACK at the EXACT SAME SPOTS so I started to inspect my phone as if I'm doing an autopsy. Here's the best part, I'm using the EXACT SAME SCREEN as before!!! My original \"water damaged\" screen has a small chip mark on the outer edge of the glass at the top and this has it at the EXACT SAME SPOT!!   My conclusion is they heat gunned my phone, peeled the glass off straight without taking anything off, start blow drying my supposed irreparable screen from that open space, gave it back to me and scammed me.   I went back this afternoon to talk to the exact same 2 people who took my phone in and the girl said they did replace my screen. She then proceed and pulled out a random screen and said that was mine. I told her of the situation and here are her responses :   1. Any phones screen will start to peel if u leave it in a car for 2 hour. (Bull*****, this is the first time it EVER happened to me in 17 years)   2. Why did u start and lift your screen up after that, u should have just pressed it back down. (Anyone will want to inspect what caused it and why it happened so yes, I lifted it little to see what happened to my phone!!)   3. I showed her the chipped mark on my glass and told her I did that 6 months ago and is at the same spot. Her response was \"that's not part of the glass, is the bezel\". Mind u this WAS part of the glass and not the bezel, how do I know, cause the glass was peeling off on its own and u can tell clearly how the glass runs.   4. I asked her to please repair it and replace my screen. Her response \"I already replaced it the first time, not going to do it again, I don't know how your white spots got on your brand new screen after 48 hrs of use, but I can't replace it\". She also refuse to give any help or refund my money so that's $180 down the drain!!!...    Fellow citizens PLEASE help spread the words so there wouldn't be another victim such as myself in the future!!    STAY AWAY from a store call \"Just in Case\" located at Pacific Mall unit A29!!!    https://www.facebook.com/a29justincase"}
{"text":"Parking is a challenge, bring your handicapped sign if you have one. Otherwise, prepare to walk five minutes from the end of the parking lot to the door of the mall.  But all in all, I buy all my beauty products here. I can only use Clinique, but can't afford store prices, and if i bring cash I can insist a discount.  I bought a cast iron tea pot, and after some haggling was given tiny tea cups complimentary.  I adore the cute earrings/bracelets and purses.  I also love eating the noodles, at any food vender.   I've brought out of town relatives to this mall and they liked the uniqueness. It's a place to take them on one of those cold winter days....."}
{"text":"This place makes me miss home.  I tend to spend a whole day here.  Lunch in the upstairs cafeteria consists of noodles.  Just follow the loud banging noise.  It's handmade noodles the Asian way.  Then I'd walk around and snack on fried dough and bubble tea.  There's lots to see and lots to do so don't be lazy.  Walk into stores and browse."}
{"text":"This mall is similar to the mall in toronto chinatown.. Im not sure if I like it... Also if you are planning to go and eat there in food court, theres only few tables/chairs so you might have to wait."}
{"text":"I feel like I just step foot into China. I'm from NYC. It's like a mall in Chinatown. It gives you the feeling of being in mainland. They sell clothes from China that are different styles from here.  There are many cell phone stores."}
{"text":"This is a fun Asian mall with a lot of small vendors. On the top floor, there is a large variety of food vendors, where you can choose from a range of main entrees to snacks to desserts. We snacked on a number of items. If you are looking for gifts, check out the department a good located on the food court top level. While many of the vendors sell similar items (cell phone cases, toys etc), you will find some unique items. I love to browse the boutiques for unique fashions, and the toy stores and home goods stores have items you never realized you needed. Just a lot of fun to browse!"}
{"text":"Cash is King! Especially in the food court which is why I always stop at the TD on the corner before coming to Pacific Mall.  P-mall  - where to begin... - Always crowded It's an Asian and tourist magnet. Right on the edge of Markham and Scarborough. my cousins for MIssissauga take special trips here. - There's loads of parking, but it's hard to find a free spot 90% of the time It is easily accessible by TTC (corner of Kennedy and Steeles), but the majority of people come from the 'burbs or they just want to show off their souped up cars  - Tons of shops... but they all sell the same things Phones and Iphone cases, clothes, dvd's, bubble tea, anything Hello Kitty or Totoro and, of course, stuff to add to the souped up cars - Good reliable cheap food, but most shops only take cash Food court is located on the second floor. If you're craving for any Chinese dish, you'll most likely find it here.  Been going here a few times a year since it opened so I've learned a thing or two on how to get the most out of P-mall. Getting there & Parking: I usually get my sister-in-law to drive since she's more patient when looking for a good parking spot or try to look for one furthest from the mall. Since I've moved downtown, I can easily take the TTC Avoid the huge crowds: It's inevitable, there will always be crowds just be prepared for it. Avoid going on holidays, best to go on a weekday. If you need to come here on a weekend, arrive when they open - a bit tricky cuz I never really know when they're open - around 11am or 1pm? Shopping: I only shop here if I feel like buying trinkets for my nieces and nephews. Got my phone unlocked and bought a T-Mobile sim card so I can use my phone in the US. Visit the 2nd floor shops near the food court cuz they are cheaper than the ones on the main floor. Food: It's the main reason why I come here. Sun's Kitchen has awesome fresh noodle soups and Japanese Express makes great jap chae.  If you have nothing else to do and want to waste a few hours, just come in and go \"aisle-ing\" - walk along each corridor and see what people are selling, but don't forget the bubble tea and good food.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"TVB store at pacific mall very bad customer service. We are asking for a tv box to watch hong kong tv series . If you have a child never walk into this place. TVB in the last row by the windows on the site left hand side. The guy who works or own the place very kid UNFRIENDLY. We were about to buy to tv boxes. My son just look at the tvb box which has a tvb doll in there did not even reached his hand to get the box, then he started to shout don't touch. He was just looking with his eyes!!! If there would be any place to report him that he is against children i would do so! This guy is acting like my son could break his entre store with his eyes. Very soon he has to close down his place with such a bad attitude to children!"}
{"text":"This is purely from a visitor/tourist's perspective...  Feels like one of those malls with a bunch of booths in China, except the booths are actual stores with walls and things are legit and legal! That also means they prices aren't much cheaper than normal stores, and it's just a mall with lots of booths that happens to exist in an area with a dense Asian population. It's like your go-to neighborhood mall with eye doctors, computer stores, cute merch stores, clothing boutiques (many repeating stores despite how big the places is though), except many of your neighbors are Asian.  We went to the old Chinatown in the city the day before, and I highly prefer this environment.   We got to Pacific Mall in the morning before the stores opened, so we went for some dimsum. I love the \"ren qi\" here, that real feel that you're in a Chinese community that enjoys this like it's part of the regular Sunday routine, unlike back home where people go for the novelty of the experience. The only non-Asians in the restaurant were married to Asians... how about that!   All in all, I enjoy the environment and the feeling of a modern Asian community, but as a visitor, I would only come here for the dimsum. And maybe a haircut."}
{"text":"It's Pacific Mall nothing about it changes all that much, you have tons of mall vendors selling you about the same stuff, electronics, gadgets, Kpop and Hong Kong pop music novelty. It's a bit crazy but hey it sells you Asian stuff you wouldn't see anywhere else. They have boutique shops and fashion wear that I cannot afford enough it's really cute. Upstairs you have many food vendors. The latest thing I'v seen is the \" Real Fruit,\" drink stands that seem to have become a major chain throughout Toronto and Markham area. We tried it I had passionfruit drink with real passionfruit delicious. I didn't buy much there as a lot of the stuff to me is a knock off of some real brand. However, I always make stop into this mall whenever I am in town because it's a place where I use to go with my husband when we first got married."}
{"text":"Best meal we had in Toronto with hand pulled noodles, crispy roast pork and roast duck, curry fishball on a stick, egg puffs.  My daughter kept repeating it's the best noodles she's ever had.    Shopping - can one ever have too many mobile device accessories?  I guess not...  Cute toys and wonderful asian snacks."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this weekend, like finally i get to visit the legendary pac mall.   If i had a thing for a large selection of cartoony crap or phone covers then this would be heaven but it really was a pointless visit.  I did not check out the upstairs but maybe next time that will improve my like of this place"}
{"text":"It took thirty (mumble mumble) years of my adult life to finally enter into the hallowed halls of the infamous Pmall. Truth be told the rumors of their dangerous parking lot kept me from crossing the threshold from Steeles and Kennedy into the Bermuda Triangle of no return.   Finally this weekend I was forced to weather the parking lot storm as I attended the Taste of Asia Festival. The hype was certainly on point as I spent the better part of 30 minutes playing vehicular dodgeball (minus the balls) as I searched for parking. Mind you this was mostly simply due to volume and not poor driving as the rumors had suggested... that was until I was exiting later that day. I actually watched a woman drive against oncoming traffic on a 1 lane each way enter/exit to the parking lot and attempt to marge in with the exiting traffic whilst blocking oncoming traffic entering. Lets just say she got a few choice hand gestures and an ear full from several peoples horns (including my own).  Enough about the parking, now what lies inside these doors. A lot... of nothing. If you're looking to get some bubble tea, or get your nails done, or buy cell phones or cell phone accessories.... or cell phone accessories.... or cell phone accessories..... or cell phone accessories.... you're all set. After about the 100th cell phone case store I decided I was good and didn't bother to check out the food court which is supposed to be legendary. I figure I'll save that for my next visit.  There WERE some other shops, like a hobby shop selling replica guns :-o, the various knock off designer clothing/ handbag shops or the many \"Clearance sale\" stores whose clearance signs were so aged you wonder if this is the longest sale ever.  I think what I did like was how bright and clean the space was. I also loved how Pacific Mall provides various sized store fronts for vendors. I can't speak as to what their rents are but many of these shops would be kiosks in a regular mall, so it's nice to see them having a solid store front they can lock up at night and call their own - so props to supporting local micro business owners P mall!  Can't say I'll be back again too soon but for what it is... it's aiiiight!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Toronto, I always come here. There are lots of shops here but nothing I want to buy.  I am here straightly for the food as it hosts many food vendors and restaurants inside."}
{"text":"This is a sad, unclean, rundown complex that needs to be bulldozed.  So many stores are either closed or out of business and today, on a Friday afternoon, you could shoot a cannon through it, it was dead.  The only decent store is the aptly-named \"The Best Store\" and Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake.  I guess you could get a deal on eyeglasse or phone stff but otherwise there's nothing here that's worth making any kind  of effort to go there.  Turn it into condos, or something."}
{"text":"great food, movies, bubble tea, affordable cell phone cases, fix your broken cell phone screens, etc I mean I don't know what I missed but you have to check it out. This place is the best and looks way different compared to other malls. I mean it's bubble tea how can it not be a 5 star rating?"}
{"text":"Unlike any mall you've visted. I gotta say this is a place you come to when you dont really need anything in particular. The majority of this mall is cell phone accessories and bubble tea. That being said, there are some good finds here. Lot of cool clothing boutiques and rare finds, a shop that does piercings (not the tattoo shops) 2 vape shops (shoutout NA) and a very good foodcourt. I have been coming here since 2011 but im local now so pmall is very near and dear to my heart. I always pop by and always bring a friend who hasnt experienced all its glory. Cash only for the most part but noticed a lot of vendors do take debit now. Its always good to bargain here for the cell phone stuff but be careful because a lot of these shops are connected and they will snitch on you to other shops."}
{"text":"Ah, Pacific Mall. One of the prime weekend destinations many moons ago for geeky teenage me. I used to frequent 'PMall' quite often, but it's really gone down hill, although it's not as bad as it once was. If you've never been, Pacific Mall can be an interesting experience, quite different from any other western style malls. The layout is divided into grids, with most stores confined within fairly small stalls. Once the novelty wears off, there's not really much there.  Essentially, PMall is  1/2 bubble tea stores, ¼ cell phone accessory stalls, and ¼ overpriced clothing booths, with a few nail shops and bootleg DVD shops thrown in here and there. Most stores look like copies of each other, so it's quite easy to get lost if you've never been before. Most stores either only accept cash, or debit if you're lucky.   There are some little treasures though! You can find various types of Asian cuisine upstairs in the food court (ranging from Chinese, to Japanese, to Korean... even waffles!) If you're into chinese medicines and herbs, PMall does have a few herb/ginseng and Asian candy stores. One of my favourite stores is on the basement floor, and it's called \"Ichiban Living\" - a Japanese discount store where everything is $2! Some great value finds there. If you happen to wander by the Marketplace next door, there's also a great store called \"One's Better Living\" which carries various kitschy home and housewear items.  Also parking is an absolute nightmare. Good luck, young warrior, because you'll need it. I'd recommend parking around the back, or at least arriving early if you're planning to attend on a weekend."}
{"text":"This shopping location, impressive! I usually shop for gadgets, computer peripherals, camera equipment and this place has all those items under one roof for cheap! There are lots of fakes, but if you are not too keen on telling the differences, may be you need to stay and shop at local malls.  I consider myself an experienced shopper; i know how to tell the differences of fakes that will work and the ones that will break down soon. Thus, most of the items sold there are real. About DVD's, hello kitty items etc...not referring to those items.  Toronto can get really cold, thus having an indoor area to dwell, shop, experience, is really comforting."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall is the perfect place to go if you're Asian or are into Asian culture.  There is so much one could do at this mall:  Dim Sum, game at an arcade, sing karaoke, get a stereotypical Asian haircut, get a hydro-massage, drink bubble tea, get lost multiple times, find some crazy cure for your cold, shop, and then shop some more.  I actually live 5-hours away, but my friends and I will make the drive up at least once a year, because this mall is just that awesome."}
{"text":"I hate the organization of this place.  Street names on a tight grid.  It's actually quite confusing.  I have a pretty decent sense of direction and I still get disoriented.    There are repeating bubble tea vendors throughout.  Same with cellphone gadgety type shops.  Oh, optical stores too.  You like Asian clothing and accessories?  Plenty of all that.  Upstairs, there's a food court and scattered food \"stalls\" along with a few restaurants and random stuff.  Something for everyone I suppose.    I don't understand how you can have basically the same type of store, over and over again, and yet they all seem to stay in business.  Go figure.    The parking situation is insane on weekends.  Have you been to Asia?  Do you know the reputation of Asian drivers?  Good luck.  Weekdays, it's much more tolerable.     Love it or hate it...  I feel a bit of both."}
{"text":"OMG best mall ever, I love this place, I'm like a child in a candy store when I'm here. It's a mall with nothing but Asian shops!!!!!! I love this place"}
{"text":"Closest thing I have seen to a mall in China or Korea outside of those countries.  No guarantees on quality, but there are not many places where you can get a cute cellphone cover, medicinal herbs, Asian candy, a lawn statue, Chinese BBQ and set of aftermarket rims.  Also, I saw at least six bubble tea places, and there are certainly more I missed.  If you are in the area, it is worth a stop for the kitch factor alone.  I can't wait to go back to find more."}
{"text":"There's something about Pacific Mall that keeps bringing you back, no matter how much you hate the amount of people and lack of parking... Been here countless times over the years, but it is pretty much the same (if it hasn't gotten worse).  Parking is a nightmare, as there are literally no spots at any time, and it seems everyone is fighting over the spots that are available, making driving conditions terrifying.  Once you get inside, there is essentially a maze of stores, and you can never seem to find anything more than once. You kind of just stumble across a store and go in. A lot of the stores repeat, as there are many stores under one owner, and they all have similar or identical stock. However, prices are usually dramatically cheaper and you can haggle from time to time, depending on the store. Some of the smaller food vendors upstairs are quite good though. Some of the best curry beef balls can be found here!  Overall, this is one of the malls that I hate going to, but is the go-to place to get certain things. If you're in the market for cheap phone accessories, everyday items, makeup, or even clothes, this is a good place to go (if you don't mind the parking and crowds of people of course!)."}
{"text":"watch the cashier when you pay at THE BEST SHOP upstairs they over charge 2 of my items. she put 3 instead of 2x and 5x instead of 4x. They do it so quickly and there's no refund too. Be careful!"}
{"text":"Nothing really special about the stores here, its all bubble tea shops, cellphone accessories, and bootleg cd/dvd stores.  The food court upstairs is pretty good though, its usually one of the only reasons to come here. I remembered a time when there used to be a lot of unique stores  but many slowly became  cellphone/ipad related, its a shame really.  There was a nice little gachapon store here that had a lot of machines with authentic japanese toys and knicknacks, It was my favorite place to visit whenever i had the time to come to pacific mall.  It makes me sad that a lot of great places are now gone but at least i wont have to line up to get mango  bubble tea or a new iphone screen protector.   Also there used to be a couple stores that sold gundam model kits and now its reduced to a single store located upstairs in the foodcourt area. The prices are expensive but what would you expect? Hes gotta try and keep the gundam spirit in this god forsaken mall alive somehow."}
{"text":"This is a tourist attraction at best. Somewhere to bring your friends who are out of town once and that's it. There is nothing but cellphone shops and bubble tea. Sure there is some spots like the convenience stores and a spice shop or this or that which I can imagine is the only place you can get certain stuff for those without paypal (or patience). But besides that it's some of the worst parking lot driving in Toronto hands down coming from a guy who has been going there on and off for about 5 years. Usually just Christmas I go there because it's the only place opened.   There is 16-20 cellphone related places when I walked around the first floor. It reminds me of albion and islington how it was all gold stores on one block. You'd think after 2 were opened people would try other places. You go upstairs and just like the mall beside it, it's all places you've never heard of so you're kind of hesitant to go to any of them. The stores are all very tiny and because of the layout which could have been better you miss all the in between shops and have to weave around the place like a snail. No other mall in Toronto I've been to is this monotonous to see every shop in the place.   I think besides the cellphone and glasses places all I remember is the airsoft gun store, the action figures , hello kitty stuff, some drone camera store and a very unappealing arcade and the two or three convenience stores full of stuff you probably won't find anywhere else. On the plus side if you go on a slow day it's quiet , clean and the exact opposite of a mall in a bad neighborhood. Oh and there's a mcdonalds and one of the worst dollar stores ever are in that plaza too outside of pacific mall called the cool dollar.   ways to improve  *a video game store for the kids - asian imports would sell well. I may have seen one there years ago but more don't hurt  *bigger stores , half them are so small if you blink walking by you don't see them. More shops is not better. *the source or something similar would be nice for DIY projects  *some larger franchises in there. Not just mom and pop shops that the only reason people go there are to support their people and don't mind paying the extra dollar or 50.  maybe a valet or something to park your car - no not really but I know you guys laughed  the good news the people are all quiet and keep to themselves , a nice atmosphere  the escalators work - wow!  its clean  you can get stuff you can't from other places like I've mentioned   I'm sticking to local places, this isn't anything to do with racism just to \"clarify\" just there isn't anything there, there isn't \"that shop\" or two. I'm sticking with local places and online shopping. This place I have to go that extra mile for what seems nothing other than a change of atmosphere. Everyone locally seems to like it because the parking lot is always full but for all I know that could be the employees in that crammed place so if it wasn't for that I'd level the place and make it \"pacific\" stop on the RT station so it would make it easier for kids to go to college/university or STC. Anyways see you guys christmas when nothing else is opened."}
{"text":"After hearing of this place as the butt of many jokes from Russel Peters, I have finally come to witness Pacific Mall.  Personally I really don't get what the big deal is.  This isn't a \"mall\" in the North American sense.  This is more like a middle to low end shopping center in Hong Kong.  No real stores in the shopping mall sense but lots of cubicle like stalls for stores and shops.  Looking at those stalls does bring me back to Hong Kong.  The stores are a mixture of bootleg DVDs, FOB-tastic clothing, Asian jewelery, dry goods, house goods, boba and even a froyo shop .  Basically this a Chinatown (minus groceries/butchers/fish-mongers) contained in one building.  In California, this would be one gigantic strip mall, like the one by Pacific Commons in Fremont or that big mall in Milpitas.  But it is one building because walking outside would not be fun in the winter months here in Ontario."}
{"text":"Great place to go to if your looking for some great deals. It is kind of a flea market in a mall setting. Great to go to if your looking for unique things for your home or a great outfit. Also, some great cell phone stores to fix, get a new phone or get a cell phone case. The best part of this mall was trying the different foods. This place should be considered one of Ontario's tourist sites Overall great experience :)"}
{"text":"This was highly recommended.  Parking was terrible.  . There is a large variety of shops . There is also a lot of restaurants and Bubble tea. We got to see a lion dance which was one on the best that I have seen.there is something for everyone . You could spend an easy 4 hours"}
{"text":"I do love me some Pacific Mall!  Where else in the GTA can I get boxes of eyelashes, Hello Kitty car mats, shark fin soup, eye glasses, DVD's, dried persimmons and a jade necklace in one place?!  For all the stalls and vendors, the layout is quite good.  If you are going, I recommend to do so during the week when the crowds are at bay, and to park underground so you do not need to schlep your jacket around with you.  I have also been told that this mall is fairly easy to access by public transit from downtown.  There are 2 levels of shopping.  The top level is mostly food services.  Do not miss out on the bubble tea and juice.  I had a strawberry banana juice (in February!) that was to die for.  Cash is the preferred method of payment for most vendors.  There is only one cash machine on the main shopping level on the far north side.  Also, there are washrooms only on the top shopping floor and the top floor of underground parking."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do not get your phone fixed at D9 (not sure what the exact store is called but it has a pink sign). I went to fix my cracked iPhone 5 screen there for a price of $50 and afterwards I noticed that my back camera stopped working. I couldn't go back to fix it right away since I live really far. When i had the chance to go back, they told me no refunds and questioned why I didn't come back sooner and if I wanted to get my back camera fixed I would have to pay an additional $40. The sales associate were very rude and even yelled at me, when they were the ones at fault. They refused to reduce the price to fix my camera even though they were the ones who broke it. I REPEAT DO NOT GO TO D9 IN PACIFIC MALL."}
{"text":"Try to stay away from this mall unless you really have to go there and have no other option. I have been to this mall around 4-5 times and had awful experiences all the times. Most sellers are very rude and just trying to rip you off ESPECIALLY if you're not Asian. Will never go back to Pmall."}
{"text":"DO NOT BUY ELECTRONICS HERE - ESPECIALLY PHONES FROM THE SHOPS. YOU WILL REGRET IT.   The Rogers at the front entrance (Steeles) is a good place to start if you're looking to open an account/switch over. I highly recommend getting in touch with Allan - this guy is great!  The food here is delicious. I highly recommend the BBQ Grill upstairs. You MUST try the grilled squid skewers and the lamb skewers! You'll be coming back for more! The lady who works there remembers me because I come there so much. She is so friendly and that just makes her restaurant one of the best there is in that mall.  What can you take away from this review? ONLY GO FOR THE FOOD!"}
{"text":"Wow!! that was an experience....i am visitin toronto and on 25th december that was the only mall that was open...totally worth it..  Soooo many shops...i havent seen so many in a long time now...i liked the small heritage village on the second floor...the mall houses \"Beard Papa's\" cream puffs...I used to be a regular at the hollywood blvd, Los angeles...unfortunately they were out of the vanilla custard...  Bubble teassss...i havent seen so many of them in my entire life :)  I would surely go back and pick up a dress for my wife from the traditional village..."}
{"text":"First time there... If you've seen one you have seen it all but the place is very clean. Amazed by the bubble drinks though... every lane/ aisle got to have at least one bubble drink stand. Good experience."}
{"text":"man, how come I haven't reviewed PMall yet?...   so this is the ULTIMATE PLACE for everything you can and can't imagine.  you need to get cup shaped like a camera lens? - find it here you want to get fit? - go dance few hours at the DDR machine on the 2nd floor's playdium you want to feast? - the whole second floor is crowded with tiny and big restaurants and cafe and food courts with dirt cheap and yummy food! same goes for dessers and bubble teas of different varieties. you want to relax and kill some time? - there are dance shows/singing shows/bingo shows... you name it! at different times of the day on the first floor. you want to get movies that never came our on DVDs? - find them here!=)  and it only takes 20min on a bus from the finch station to get there. or bike there in summer!"}
{"text":"Everything you have heard about Pacific Mall is....probably true.  Although some stories may or may not be exagerated your experience at Pacific Mall can be quiet or extremely entertaining depending on what you choose to spend your money on.    Yea this mall has plenty of parking but beware of busy weekends and fast cars and pedestrians in your way.  There are a ton of shops around the mall and your food options are pretty much endless if you are craving anything close to asian food.  I always come here to get glasses for myself and my family and the best part is if you bring cash....you can haggle and ensure you get the best price!  However...be prepared to walk away and go to another store if they do not meet your standards.  You can get car parts, cell phone accesories, candies, and those Super expensive Green Tea flavores Kit Kats from Japan that cost anywhere between $6 - $12 for one pack but its so worth it!  I always get the egg thing where they sell 3 for $5 and it tastes so good every single time!  Pacific Mall is ALWAYS open!"}
{"text":"I remember Pacific Mall being a lot busier and livelier in the past with many more shops. However, a recent visits threw that notion out the window. Pacific Mall has become dull, but it still serves a good purpose of killing time and walking around."}
{"text":"This mall is full of a lot of fraudsters.  I bought a Android Box and after 2 days it didn't work as promised.   On their monitor it works fine and then the box doesn't work at home.  So I return to the store expecting a full refund only too be told too bad.   I advised the owner that is not what your wife told me two days ago.  She said if I had any problems I can return it .   The cheap prices aren't worth it   Too much fraud in this mall. Then you contact management and security and they were not helpful at all.  Over heard the security asking about free merchandise.  So they are all complicit."}
{"text":"Honestly I only really come here for one thing and that's to buy prescription glasses from either Advance or Global Optical.  It's been one of the 2 places for about 10 years or so now.  The one thing everybody will notice about this mall is that on weekends the parking here is practically like Yorkdale or worse.  The parking lot design itself is pretty crazy with limited ways of getting in and out to either Kennedy or Steeles considering the place is so large has so much parking spaces to offer.  I think the parking issues alone may deter people from coming here.  There is parking underground as well as outdoors.  The place is a mall of many Asian stores and a wide mix of different types of businesses from banks, restaurants, grocery, optical, electronics, computers, etc.    Overall it's not a very pleasant experience coming to this mall because it's always so crowded when we come which is almost always a weekend.  I've only come to this mall once on a weeknight and it was still pretty busy.  I've never seen this mall not busy!"}
{"text":"Parking is almost impossible to find after 12 noon. Pmall is by far the #1 chinese mall in Toronto. They are overly saturated by phone cases shops, bubbletea shops, and make up stores. My fav phone store is Gosu Mobile. Always have what I needed. Cafe Hollywood at Market Village is a nice place to have quick & cheap food"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Most of the clothes range from XS - M.. Shoes are a great deal - i got slouchy boots for $60!  They have tons of accessories, statement bags, korean contact lens, cute japanese fashion, and tons of cell phone stuff. Make sure you don't get lost, drink tons of water and eat  some food before you go.  They usually open around 1pm or so. Try to go on  a weekday -- Sat /Sun are crazy!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how I feel about this place other than the fact that I get annoyed and impatient every time I come here. Perhaps in the past it was not this chaotic... but I feel like the mall is just overly packed and everything is just a repetition.  Truthfully, there are perks and there are downsides to this mall. Perks wise, there is a lot of cheap things you can get here that you won't find in other western malls. For example, phone cases are ranged from $5-$10 with a huge selection of different phones and designs. In western malls, you'll find the exact same phone case for $25. Same thing goes for jewellery, accessories, and such. And if you're good at bargaining, this is the place to be. Use bargaining here to your advantage and it will save you a shit ton of money (even though you already are).   As for the downsides, let's start with the parking. You'll find that the parking here is a living nightmare. On the busier days and holidays (yes, this mall is open all year around) it will be practically impossible to find a parking spot and when there will be, without a doubt, there's gonna be other angry Asian drivers fighting over it. And that whole stereotype about how Asians can't drive? Well let's just say that you have no idea what true road rage is until you come to Pacific Mall.  Secondly, this mall is full of the exact same stores. And I mean there are literally 4 or 5 of the same shops in this mall and after coming here a few times, you will start to lose interest really quickly. The shops you will find here consist of bubble tea shops (Bubbletease, Tea Shop 168), electronic stores, hair salons/makeup/beauty shops (The Face Shop, Holika Holika, MISSHA), jewellery stores, and optical shops.   Don't expect to come here and be treated like a VIP customer cause you're going to get the exact opposite. You will find that a lot of the sales associates have broken English, and occasionally you'll find a few that will completely ignore your presence and fiddle with their phones.   Also, don't forget to bring cash! This is very important because although a couple stores do accept debit, it's a bit sketchy if you ask me and it's better to take precautions.  Overall, I would avoid this mall at all costs unless I'm coming here knowing exactly what it is that I need to buy. Otherwise, this isn't really the place to just hang around if you're bored - especially not during the weekend rush."}
{"text":"New purpose for goign to Pacific Mall (but along the same lines)  My NDS was broken, and after going to my usual place, and realizing there might be somewhere cheaper, I scoured the myriad of game stores to find someone who will fix it.  A lot of stores tested it, and said it was broken, but refused to open it up and fix it, or see what's wrong.  I found JConcept (B28b) a new store, who said they can give it to the technician who will check it out and let me know how much the damage will be and I can decide if I want to fix it or not.  They were the only store that offered that, and the cheapest one to buy a new NDSi (if I wanted it).  I also noticed some non chinese there, asking to fix things, and he wasn't like his counterparts and speaking to me in chinese, or refused to serve me until they left. He was really welcoming all kinds of customers and didn't seem to discriminate."}
{"text":"Yea... FOB's wet dream.    I really hate shopping... but this is probably by far the largest Chinese mall in North America... really... why can't California have something like this??? All the Asian malls in California are sh*t compare to this. After driving 9+ hours from Ohio to visit our relatives in Toronto, this is the first place we hit.   This place really reminds me of Hong Kong (but the malls in HK still the best). It's 2 story high. If all the parking spaces are fill, no worry, there's a underground garage. There's a lot of shops on the first floor and some on the second floor. First floor is laid out as a uniform grid of glass cubicles. I would say there are several hundred shops here. Food court and restaurants on the second floor.   Pretty much has everything you want here. Their glasses and sunglasses are much better than what I can buy in the US... much CHEAPER TOO!!!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place. There is nothing like this in the USA, hands down. One thing that has changed recently is that the stores which used to sell \"kawaii\" toys and collectibles have become cell phone case stores. SO MANY CELL PHONE CASE STORES. Not only that, but they average 15.00 per case and I have seen most of those cases in ebay for 2.00 with free shipping. I hate that they don't open till 11am because I am an early bird. However, if you get there early, many of the food/bubble tea places are open and you can grab a bite before spending your entire day checking out the clothing, accessory and CELL PHONE CASE stores. There is an arcade upstairs and if you find some special spots in the mall you can even use the free wifi."}
{"text":"Always a worth a short visit. Inundated with phone accessory stores, bubble tea shops, herbal and car shops I think they can evolve this mall by creating some planning. Limiting competition and bringing in new options would be great. How about a Asian film movie theater, maybe a gym."}
{"text":"Was here with a friend last week. I generally hate coming to this mall. The parking lot is always a zoo. I don't even drive and I can't handle how bad it is. I would advise anyone planning on buying things to use cash. Most places shave off a few dollars, sometimes a lot, deals they are unlikely to give you if you use a machine for debit or credit. The mall is full of cell phone stores, and on this last visit, I got a pretty gold hard case for $8. There's also beauty stores, convenient stores and clothing stores there. Upstairs there's a few food stores in a food court type area, a couple of restaurants and hair salons. The mall has pretty much everything, aside from furniture I believe.  My friend and I also bought bracelets with jade stones from a shop upstairs, and we got drinks from Cha Time. It was definitely one of my more fun visits, although I think I still hate visiting this mall. There are definitely great things to see, buy and eat, but the overall enjoyment level decreases when faced with the trek there and the battle to get in and out."}
{"text":"I heart this Chinese Mall.  It's one of the first Chinese Malls my family took me to as a child. As a kid, I loved visiting all the shops filled with Hello Kitty items (still do as an adult). As a teen, I'd come here to take sticker pictures. They have a lot of stores with sticker picture booths. I don't do a lot of shopping here, it can get very pricey. You may find a good deal on a iPhone case or iPad case from time to time.   The main reason why I give Pacific Mall 4 stars is because of their Food Court and snack joints. I love all the options and the prices are fair. If you are looking for bubble tea, visit a shop called Fruit Jungle. Their bubble teas are really refreshing and I appreciate that they use fresh fruits. They also have a Beard Papa's. Grab yourself a delicious cream puff.  There will always be a special place in my heart for Pacific Mall."}
{"text":"The mall was a cool visit, but I thought the first floor of the mall was selling a lot of repetitive useless items (phone items, bootleg anime stuff, stationary, etc) that was quite pricey. My favorite part of the mall was the upstairs (food court). The food court had tons of different types of Asian foods and drinks, and there was also many seating upstairs. I visited this mall more than 5 years ago, and I do not have any recollection of what I ate. I often remember foods that tasted good - so I guess the food I ate 5 years ago was probably alright."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure 98.5% of the staff at this mall are not aware they are in a culturally diverse country in which they will encounter people of other races - virtually every store (except Deco-It & Ten Ren) that we went into - the staff were beyond rude, stared at us incredulously and showed blatant rudeness when asked simple questions about their wares.  I heard about how this mall is so great - it's terrible and apparently my money is no good there because I am black.    I went into a store with children's pillows and blankets etc...so I asked the shop keeper what do they have that would be a good gift for a baby shower - she then proceeded to tell me in not-terrible English that she doesn't know what that is.  I said it's a party, held for pregnant women where the guests bring her presents for the baby.  She said \"Sorry, I don't know...\" Hmmm...0_o  I went into a store with bins of very exotic looking produce. Being the curious shopper that I am and taking genuine interest in learning about new things, I asked two ladies - who folded up like tents the minute me and my friend entered and stared at us like we had on ski masks and were about to hold knives to their necks - \"Oooh, excuse me, what's this?\" This woman kept her back to me, turned her neck to the side and shouted over her shoulder, \"GINGER!!\".  Totally taken aback I decided I wasn't going to just whimper out of the store so I went by the counter - I saw these unusual dark green things in jars behind her - so I said, \"Oh, and what are those?\" Now, I couldn't hear her first response so I said, \"I'm sorry, what's it called?\" \"It is Sea CUCUMBER!!\"  And no, I am not reading more then there is into it because her face told me exactly what her problem was.  I then said, \"Oh, ok, is it for tea?\" \"Of course not!\".  Alrighty then....We fulfilled their wishes and exited the store.  People at Pacific Mall (actually, a glorified flea market) get over yourselves.  You are not back home, you are in the city of Toronto.  I will never go back and I encourage other black people not to as well since our money is not wanted.  That goes for all the Asian owned hair supply stores too - most of them hold racist ideas about us and don't want our blackness anywhere near them so much so, they are even willing to put their full prejudice on display so you are well aware.  Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Yeah!! Asian mall! Yeahh!! Perhaps because I am not from Toronto and we don't really have any Asian malls, I find this one so super super cool! Everytime I visit TO, I always have to make a trip to this spot.  One) awesome food court, especially the waffle booth   two) cute stores with cuteness overload merchandise like the one in the food court. I bought 4 cute keychains like hello kitty for 10 bucks!  three) variety of asian brands boutiques with sometimes unique clothing   four) there is i believe few japanese snack stores...which I once broke my wallet there. I got so many of those Japanese food making kits (kracie) seriously I wanted to tell the cashier to take all of my money...just take it!  ok so those are my important 4 reasons for wanting to live at this mall.   I think it's a great place that everyone should visit at least once! And warning, if you like Japanese junk food and snacks, steer clear of the snack shops. You WILL break your wallet and cry from happiness then regret when you realize you are broke."}
{"text":"4 stars because of cheap food!!!!  Yes, as most people say, it's a nice walk and it's different from the usual North American style mall.  You'll find things Asian (Hello Kitty, Gundams, Bubble Tea and of course, food) but what you will realize is that even though there are multiple different stores in there, they all basically sell the same thing.  Especially phone cases.  Still, even with the over abundance of phone cases to browse, you can easily still kill 3-4 hours just looking at everything around there.  That's what my girlfriend and I did this past Sunday.   Parking, every time I have been there anyway, has been brutal.  It's always packed at least on the weekends.   Up stairs there's in my opinion one of the greatest dim sum places but I somehow usually end up in the Asian Village area to get cheap food.  Damn my Asian genes... always looking for a deal.  There's also an arcade there that I took a step inside.  It has the classic arcade games and the odd Asian DJ game.  Not really my cup of tea though. The kid in me always wants to check out the Gundams too.  I did purchase one but I have to say this.  Now I'm not sure if this applies to other items in other stores but let the Asian genes work it's magic... ask for a deal.  Most places in there I've found will at the very least give a 10% discount and then no tax if you pay cash.  Anyway, if you're in the area and want to blow time or have a lack of funds for food, pop in there.  It's a nice tour."}
{"text":"Oh wow. I can't believe I haven't rated P-Mall or wrote anything about it, but these points should summarize it very well:  -Largest indoor Chinese mall in North America -100's (probably not exaggerating) of cell phone accessory stores and they have it cheap. -Bubble tea places -Asian DVD's  -Some okay food options.   -Crazy parking nightmare on weekends and holidays.   -Easy to get lost since everything looks the same and there are duplicate stores (e.g. like 2-3 Real Fruit bubble tea places). -Gift stores   Overall, it's a touristy place, somewhere to buy cell phone cases/accessories, drink bubble tea and buy Asian DVD's if you can put up with the parking.  Tip: Come before 11:00 am on the weekends and make sure when you park, you can get out easily."}
{"text":"*2.5 stars to be exact*  I always want to go to Pacific Mall when I'm traveling to Canada specifically Toronto. I always want to come here because of their snack shops, they have a variety of food and bubble tea stands, and interesting gift shops.   I went to Pacific Mall with my fiance and my future brother in-law along with his wife since they both enjoy walking around malls and checking out for interesting snacks. We went on a Monday  afternoon after dim sum instead of going on Sunday to avoid the crowds. Unfortunately, when we arrived on Monday it was very crowded. It's like Canadians don't have work.  They're living the life!  Moving along, when I came here in July 2015 I noticed there was a lot of mobile and electronic accessory stores which I found it to be annoying. Guess what!?!? There was a lot of them again! It's like everywhere! I mean, honestly do you need 15-20+ mobile and electronic accessory stores? It's boring and pointless!   I must admit this mall isn't as exciting as it used to be when I was a teenager. I wished there were more shops related to like gifts, hair accessories (I can always use more hairclips), and more seating area besides what's on the 3rd floor."}
{"text":"I decided to come here on a Monday because I was on a mission. I was looking for two specific items that I knew could be procured at an Asian \"themed\" mall. First of all many of the vendors were closed when my friend and I arrived at the mall ... this was at 12:30 in the afternoon. I have been to Beijing a couple of times so I know approximately how much knock off items cost. I wasn't looking for big ticket knock off. Just earrings and some pens. It was shocking the amount of money the vendors were asking for these items. Considering they probably buy them in bulk for 1/10 of the price they are charging. I passed. I did buy some lovely beauty products which I'm looking forward to trying out. If they work out I would probably go back to Pacific mall. Only for the beauty products and bubble tea .. nothing else"}
{"text":"Not much here anymore. I went during the week in the afternoon. I felt like a giant walking around and probably stood out. Haha!  Lots of cell phone places and beauty stores selling the exact same stuff. Maybe 3 DVD stores. One X rated store which seemed odd to be in the mall. The upstairs got revamped from how it looked a year ago. Nothing exciting. If you need fake lashes every third store has them. Haha. So I got a pair of knock-off MAC lashes. Lots of nail places but I didn't see many sinks in them. How are the tools being cleaned?  It's neat to walk around but that's about it. Gone are the days of countless fake purses & sunglasses for dirt cheap."}
{"text":"It's open during holidays and it's a great place to catch up with friends. If you want expensive korean brand name clothes or phone cases you'll enjoy it here. Bubble tea is good and the food is terrific. Kpop fans come over to pacific mall to find an outlet for their love of korean music. Money goes fast here so watch your wallet and don't expect a good bargain if you're not of asian descent. Sales associates are over attentive and pushy so know what you want before coming in here."}
{"text":"Basically chinatown in a mall setup. Same stores repeat throughout 1st and 2nd floor.   Food court is worth coming here. All ethnic Asian foods and drinks here.  Waffles and bubble tea gyeah buddy!  Uncle Tetsu awesome. Bathrooms are not clean here."}
{"text":"Are you up for adventure? Do you want to try Chinese street food? How about sampling some unique snacks and candies? Do you like haggling for bargains? Then Pacific Mall is for you.  This mall is HUGE! It's like a mini Chinatown. You need an entire day just to look around and see all that it has to offer. Lots of cute little shops, yummy eateries and even beautiful artwork.   The bad thing is that I couldn't find a directory. All I could do was to wander up and down the aisles then go up and down the escalators. Not knowing where I was going or what I would find, it felt like an adventure.   It looks like an indoor swap meet that you would find in California except the stalls have glass walls. I did notice that each aisle has a street name and address, so if you find a store that you like, make sure to note down the \"address\" so that you can find it next time.  The parking is crazy! The easiest way to find a spot to park is to follow someone coming out of the mall and take their spot when they leave. You could also take the bus and avoid all the chaos."}
{"text":"It's ridiculously hard to find a specific store here but if you're down to explore, you won't be disappointed. They have pretty much everything you need, all in one place and sometimes you can barter.   Today I came to get some custom t-shirts at Unique Outfit at the back of the food court. Tshirts were $5 plus $8 for printing and you can get a better deal if you buy bulk and they will screen print for you.   I had some great Korean food for $10 (tax included). Burlgogi, rice, noodles, salad, kimchi and tea. How amazing is that?? Of course I left with some boba (mango with tapioca). Delish!   Minus one star because not all the entrances are handicap accessible. the directory isn't up to date (prbly due to stores changing often). Also, there used to be more authentic Oriental things like a photo booth section (like the ones you'd find in Hong Kong or Korea) but I couldn't find any this time :( boo"}
{"text":"It's not bad here, a mall like no other   It's a large mall like space however instead of built in shop units the safe is filled with small market type units   Easy to get lost and forget which way you came, place needs a map in more places than just the front doors   Upstairs there are loads of traditional Asian stalls selling all manner of Asian food   The waffles are wonderful and it also has one of the longer ten ten bubble tea locations however service is a little slow   Most stores have people watching you constantly which doesn't make you feel like browsing or ever purchasing   It is worth a visit even if the car park is a logistical nightmare with all the crazy drivers"}
{"text":"WHAT HAS PACIFIC MALL BECOME?! It used to be a place that resembled Hong Kong the most, selling products that were in Hong Kong's \"Fa Yuen Street\", bootleg DVDs, just a HUGE variety of things.  No more sticky picture stores, I don't see many curry fish balls for sale here, not a lot of stationary stores.   Although the famous stores are still there, the ones mainly in the middle and a few others like the junk food stores, Taipan, Bank of East China, the rest has changed. Now, it's all about the phone cases, the nail salons, the overpriced bubbletea that doesn't even taste that good. WHYYYYY?!  The upstairs portion still remains as is though, which I'm pretty glad about. I guess if you walk on over the Market Village, it's still the same, but PMALL?! It just doesn't feel the same."}
{"text":"I love me some P Mall! If you're ever looking for a bargain then this is the place to come. Everything from phone, laptop, and tablet accessories and cases; electronics; clothes; and of course, food and much more. I've been going here since my teenager days and it never ceases to diminish my P Mall excitement."}
{"text":"One of my go-to spots whenever I need phone accessories/ tech related goods or unique keychains. You'll find 20 of the same cellphone stores that sell mostly the same thing. Some stores have better deals than others, and relatively cheap compared to the cases you'll find at cellular kiosks at your local mall, or best buy.   The food court selection is pretty impressive. You'll find ramen/ chinese street food, fried chicken, and even dessert stands in the mall, and the amount of bubble tea is endless.   Only downsides are that they don't have enough bathrooms for how big the mall is, and also it is very very easy to get lost, especially with how crowded the actual mall is. Also, parking is an absolute nightmare.   Still always find myself here when I need a new screen protector for my phone though."}
{"text":"May 2014. After visiting here yesterday, i noticed that price have gone up a bit. If you can wait 2-3 weeks, i highly recommend buying off ebay. Prices are dirt cheap with free shipping and the exact same items found in pacific mall.   the stores in this mall are so hit or miss. i went in to one store to get a screen protector. it started to peel after a month. i take good care of my phone. i went back to ask for a replacement and the girl gave me so much attitude. she pulled out her phone and proceeded to tell me how she has to replace her protector every week. this isnt something that should be replaced every week. a screen protector should last for atleast a year if you take care of your phone. i was a nerve away from telling her off. i just walked out. i went to another store that sold me a screen protector and i told them briefly about how i had the other one for a month and it started to peel. the guy told me if i had any problems to come back and that shouldnt happen. theres a vitamin store that i went into to. the guy followed me around the whole time, which didnt last long. the store was small and it made me so uncomfortable. i dont really trust to eat at most of the restaurants here but i do sometimes have the bubble tea or fruit drinks. some of the products in this mall that can be found at other malls and store are over priced AND fake. there is a wide selection of products in this mall.. everything from electronics to beauty products. parking is a huge pain on the weekends. i avoid at all costs and go during the week. you gotta be careful what you buy, it can definitely or most likely be fake. i dont spend a lot of money at this mall cuz i dont trust it completely but i do go in for phone related products and little things. they renovated their washrooms in the basement which was long due. its been a few years since it was done and its great. prior to that, the washrooms were filthy and disgusting.  not all the stores have the same hours. some stores open later than others, which can be annoying. i went into a nail salon and the manager was nice enough to sell me used nail polish(no sarcasm) that was very hard to find that i really wanted, i really appreciated that."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall is known to have chaotic parking situations. So I try to avoid this place, and would only go if I need something specific. Because I find that for the other things that people could buy here like bubble tea, Chinese food, pastries and baked goods, they can easily get somewhere else without having to deal with the frustrating parking situation.  I only go here for one purpose, which is to get cellphone screen protectors and have them installed for me. As I find Pacific Mall has lots of these cellphone stores and I can just pick one of them.  For cases and phone accessories, I just buy on eBay. I find that the same cellphone case that costs $3 on eBay costs $28 here, so why bother? Prices here are on the expensive side for most stores, so I don't find this place to be a bargain-hunter's dream.  On the rare occasion that I visit Pacific Mall, I always make sure to come by the 2nd floor and get some Pinoy Waffles, as I love their food, and they make them really fresh with only a 2-3 minute wait.  Over-all a good place to go, but not on the weekends. Ideal time would be weekday evenings, if you really need to check this place out.  Review 39 of 100"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows Markham, knows about Pacific Mall.  It's the place to go for illegal pirated DVDs, cheap cell phones, glasses and designer sunglasses.  Growing up in Markham, I've seen the progression from Market Village to the birth of Pacific Mall, and the popularity of it.  It seems like overnight Pacific Mall went from being a little Chinese plazas (there's many of these in Markham) to a tourist attraction.  The great thing about Pacific is that it is opened 352 days a year. I can't think of a holiday is which pacific mall is closed on. Maybe Christmas if anything, but even that I'm not 100% sure.    Upstairs there's a food court.  You can watch the cooks make fresh noodles from scratch, stretching them out from a ball of dough.  It's quite amazing!! While  you're there, try the bubble waffles (not the technical name).  Just follow your nose until you see waffle like makers, you cant miss it.    When buying the illegal dvds, buyer beware. The newly released movies in my opinion, unless you are dying to see the movie, better off not buying.  The quality is often pretty crappy, and you might as well download it online (it's the same thing).  Stick to buying the movies that are already released on DVD."}
{"text":"Hello Kitty & Bubble Tea!!!   Upon first time entering, it can be quote overwhelming.  Thankfully, I had someone to help navigate.  It's like a giant flea market seperated in glass.    The mall features my two of my most favourite things as mentioned. But seriously, I live for hello kitty and bubble tea.    Other than that, they have clothing stores, electronics, makeup, giftware, and a food court.    To be honest, after spending a few hours there, I still didn't get a chance to thoroughly see everything.  There was still a lot more stores to check out. Can't wait to go back and continue my search and enjoy more bubble tea."}
{"text":"Waking up in a good mood is the best.... like yas let's get shit done it's the   weekend!  This place feels nothing like a mall... It looks more like an Asian market..but then again there are a few shops located inside the pacific mall...  Well, it's a Chinese mall....so there are a lot of Chinese (and Japanese and Korean) things to buy there....You don't HAVE to bargain with the sellers... but you can get a better deal if you do....The clothes are kind of pricey even though all the shops claim to be having some sort of sale every time I go there....  Also, even though some of the clothes are cute....they aren't really made well and are usually poor quality....so be careful of that....They sell movies that are pirated....but I've never bought any so I wouldn't know about the quality of the video.... There are a lot of Asian cosmetics as well.... but you have to be careful of fake products....I usually come here for the foods... Since there's so many areas in Canada famous for Asian cuisines...you should at least stop here for a quick lunch and do some mini sight seeing... I never get tired of looking at The malls layout feels like I'm actually in Taiwan shopping..."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe P-Mall.  It's a place of magic, wonders and feats of supernatural proportions.  You can buy anything here.  ANYTHING.  And it's all dirt cheap.  Sure, it's all designer knock-offs.  But damn son, at this price, I'll buy 'em all.  Be sure to try out all the yummy food here too.  No need to go hungry at P-Mall!  Be warned, parking is what nightmares are made off."}
{"text":"This spot is definitely Asian central. Come here for all your Asian needs. I've never personally been to Taiwan but a lot of people compare this to be quite similar concept with the little shops by each other and street foods to eat.  A lot of places doesn't open till 11 AM. Got a chance to explore around for a bit and there was a lot of food options to try! I really want to come back and try all the food. It's so much to eat but not enough stomach space for it lol"}
{"text":"This mall had tons of little shops of gadgets, clothing, and food. Their were similar shops around each corner. My favorite was the egg puff and real fruit drink."}
{"text":"Great place to go to go since it's an Asian mall. Most popular Chinese mall u can go to.   Cheap cell phone accessories and great snacks to have upstairs in the food court. Fish balls, waffles, Taiwanese chicken, Vietnamese coffee and we can't miss the most important beverage bubble tea!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this mall, even though the parking makes me want to shoot myself in the throat. People don't know how to read stop signs, they shoot out of their parking spaces without a second look, and they will run over pedestrians.   Let's start with the good stuff! However, I love coming here for cheap electronics or other stuff that will be way overpriced anywhere else. The one thing I don't like is how the stores are so repetitive- if you're not familiar with this place, you can easily get lost because it all looks the same. Here's a tip though, if you're planning to meet someone here, at all the 'intersections', up on the wall, there's a 'street name/#' so it can make it easier.  Here's some of the notable stores in pmall: G nail - relatively cheap (compared to other places) and pretty nice nail designs! The workers/managers are all very nice and helpful. Phoenix - if you're looking for nyx cosmetics or cheap nail design supplies, this is your place, girl! They have OPI, NYX, China glaze polishes for cheaper than other places. Phat buddha - I have a review on this so if you want more info on it, go look at that. But great artists/designed tattoos for a decent price! Lucky Jewelry - if you're looking for AAA quality replica bags, this is your place. I took my real LV neverfull into here and the one Cici sells was almost exact. And I'm expert at telling LV replicas apart. All the other ones from the random stores are just dingy and bad quality or ok quality but jacked up prices. The prices match the quality pretty well even though I'm not a fan of the replica industry. Real fruit - best bubble tea in the mall (thats right, including chatime), they usually have fresh mango deals (buy 2 get them for $2.49 each/buy 1 get 1 free). Don't pass it up!! The fresh mango is amazeballs.  Solestop - this place sells your typical 'swag' clothes, obey/diamond/hundreds/vans etc. It's slightly discounted (due to sales), but they're legit. The candy stores - they sell japanese/korean/chinese candy/snacks and they're soooo good! Hard to find it anywhere else.  The bad stuff.. You can't walk into a store without being bombarded by sales people thirsting for your attention. Even if you don't walk in, they'll still call out to you from inside the store.  90% of these stores charge a 15% tax rate if you pay with your debit/credit card- if you shop here, be ready with cash. Also, the security guards that work here.... not sure if they've never had female interaction in their life, but they definitely do not hide the fact they check out every female walking past. Ugh. PLUS! AVOID AT ALL COSTS ON WEEKENDS/HOLIDAYS!!!! Unless you want to be bombarded by herd off the motherland, oh gosh.  Another thing, if you're not obviously from an asian descent, many workers will not be helpful to you here and may talk shit about you while you're in the store. I've witnessed many of these interactions before. They may also try to scam you for a higher price than what others pay."}
{"text":"I dropped my iPhone 5s on a concrete pavement by mistake one afternoon. The screen cracked and small parts had shattered. I was dreading going to the Apple Store to get the screen replaced, knowing I'd have to wait for a week or two (so I've heard from others). I was on my way to Pacific Mall that afternoon and thought to ask one of the store owners of a cell shop if my phone could be fixed on their premises. Turns out they could fix the shattered screen in an hour, and just for $80. It was just a coincidence that I was going to Pacific Mall that day, but so glad things worked out so well!"}
{"text":"Great place to get phone cases, Asian snacks, a bite to eat, bubble tea! Lots of parking available. Food is cheap."}
{"text":"You have got to check this place out if you have never been. Lots of cheap stuff and the mango drinks are the best."}
{"text":"This place is evil. This mall is filled with DVD stores. For a long time, I resisted from buying bootlegged DVDs. I respected the copyrights of other people. Companies like Yes Asia sell these DVD series for $60 to $80 per series. The stores here sell them for only $10. The quality is not as good, but what the hell. The last straw was seeing white people buying unreleased Hollywood titles and bargaining with the stores. Finally, I gave in and took the apple from the serpent."}
{"text":"As a child Pacific Mall was my mecca for all things Sanrio/Anime. Now as an adult, I am more interested in the delicious food they have here!  TBH I wouldn't come here for the shopping because it is limited to clothing imported from China, video games, and beauty/trinket stores. My brother was bored to death!! I did pick up some Korean and Japanese beauty supplies but the prices are STEEP.  There are plenty of bubble tea places and the food court is pretty legit. I love the lamb skewers and the curry fish balls!"}
{"text":"This mall is a bit too crazy for me.   So many tiny little stores all jammed in one space.    I wished I had more time to browse around but this mall was a total chaos.  I didn't find the cheap stuff instead found cheap-looking imported goods that you know they got it in HK, and China for $2.00 a piece and they were selling it for $300.00.  If I was in the right state of mind - I could shop here!"}
{"text":"Ok, any other given day, I would rate this 2 stars.  But the truth is, Pacific Mall is a go-to spot for me when I'm in Toronto.  And I'm not someone who frequents malls!   Yes, parking sucks.  In fact, you'll find most Asian driver stereotypes in full display here.  One major warning: do not attempt to go here on a weekend.    Also, bring cash.  Some establishments accept cards, but they may give you discounts if you pay cash.   Another thing: don't expect a luxury mall, or even a clean mall for that matter.  This is Pacific Mall.  It's fashioned after a Hong Kong street market.  There will be smoke coming from pots and ducks hung on display in food stalls.  Think of buying clothes and trinkets as a treasure hunt.  Restrooms are... restrooms. Bring sanitizer.  ... yet Pacific Mall is still 4 stars in my book.  I love Hong Kong, but don't have the luxury to go there all the time -- Pacific Mall will do.  They have fish and squid balls, takoyaki, roast duck, ramen, milk tea, special tea, dim sum, ice cream crepes, HK waffles -- all my guilty pleasures in 1 floor.  I love window shopping, checking out electronics and curiously asking about all the herbs and spices on display.  I also always end up buying trinkets and head bands and other stuff that I don't need but were just too cute to pass -- hey, at least I haggled down the price!  Oh, and prepare to haggle -- it's an official sport here.  Pac Mall is not for everyone, but if you're looking for something unique, or just something good to eat... it's got a little bit of everything to satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"The mall is typical Asian mall - but the best thing to come for is the food court on the top floor - excellent food, fresh produce and super cheap (kind of like old China Town food without the new China Town pricing.  Come here for the food and the bubble tea and juices.....the shopping is meh!  Not much in the mall really shopping wise - just repetitive stores of phone and ipad cases, sunglasses, reading glasses and cheap Harajuku style clothing.  So for about $7 you can eat super yummy Chinese/Asian food - so forget the shopping here - just head to the top floor of the mall for the food."}
{"text":"I wish they have an Asian mall like this in the US. Hundreds of stores selling Asian and non Asian products. Tons of food venue and a great food court. We stop by here every time we come. Yes parking is crazy so get here early. The food is great and very reasonable priced."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here about two decades ago.  Now I only go there if I have to purchase something specific.  It's predominantly filled with cellular phone case shops.  There's just too many of them there.  If I have to go there, it would be early on a weekend morning or on a weekday when I take a day off work.  Otherwise it's crazy busy during the weekend afternoon there with parking filling up just like that.  It's worst when they have them Chinese holidays and them festivities there which attract everyone under the sun."}
{"text":"This mall is alright if you want to buy a lot of Japanese snacks that they don't sell and most grocery stores but I found most of the phone cases were very overpriced I was specifically looking for a sailor moon phone and all of them are over $20 I could buy either 2 or 3 for under 20 bucks on eBay! I didn't really trust too many of the food places the chicken that I ordered from one of the fast food places in the food court kinda gave me a bad tummy cramps after when I went into some of the \"nerdy\" stores most of The anime figures plushies etc. Are bootlegged lol I was lucky enough to even get two good Sailor Moon posters for under 3 bucks there :) Lastly most of the places don't accept debit or credit unless you're spending over $10 so if you're going to Pacific mall anytime soon I suggest you bring a lot of cash if you're planning to spend a lot of money! Personally I don't think I would returned here anytime soon I find the mall kind of overpriced or you don't really get a discount unless you're really Asian decent lol"}
{"text":"this mall isn't too shabby.. legit people would always make fun of me for going there so much LOL \"DAMN VIVIAN BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE PMALL\" (sorry had to do it)    but yeah pmall consists of - overpriced cheap clothing stores  - a trillion and one bubble tea shops - many phone-related (mostly cases) shops - nail shops - the evergrowing amount of korean stores   that's about it ... i miss those gachapon stores like GAGOO or KIDULT. that's actually the one of the many reasons i go to pmall but those kind of stores don't rly exist anymore which is like bruh why"}
{"text":"Came here in 85*F weather- not the best idea! Super hot, AC isn't strong enough! The restaurant/stalls were okay. A little of a downgrade compared to a few years ago."}
{"text":"This place is full of mini stores! I loved walking through the whole place and discovering multiple places to shop for clothes, gadgets, snacks and food. There wasn't much to buy but I enjoyed trying the food stands on the second floor. I would definitely recommend getting the mango smoothie on the second floor. They make them out of fresh fruit and it's cheap!"}
{"text":"I like going to this mall. It's something different from the typical malls that I already know around canada. It's a good place to go when you want something new. Plus, it's interesting to walk around and browse through their selection of shops.  The thing I noticed about these stores is that they cater to mostly women in terms of clothes, shoes, beauty, and accessories. Depending on the shop, some of them are pricey.. and when you go to another store.. it's a bit cheaper by a couple of dollars. So my advice would be to browse around first before committing to on a purchase. AND, it's always good to pay in cash, depending on the shop, if you pay in cash they dont really put in the taxes.  For the men, well... there are a few stores that sells clothes and shoes...but it doesn't really compare to the shops for women. So don't expect too much if your looking for something awesome. And oh, they have a car accessories store there.. just saying.  They do have electronic stores though.. so it's a good place to go and shop for a cellphone or a computer if your looking into buying.  The food.. okay, am not lying.. but the food court caters delicious and afforable asian food. The bad part about it is that... well, they dont have much seats. And it's kind of annoying. There are two restaurants there...one korean and one chinese... if you rather skip the whole food court thing.   Overall, this is a nice place to visit.."}
{"text":"This place used to be \"the place\" to be, with it's events and small store of gadgets, glasses, phones and video games. However, when you walk through now all I find is almost every other store selling phone accessories, particularly phone cases. And if it's not a store just selling phone accessories and it's a clothing store, they got phone accessories to compliment their offerings as well.  Walking through on a Friday and think what this place used to be and wonder if the weekends are any better. It was not very happening. Even the pirated dvds feel like a thing of the past as it must be better profit selling phone cases.  So come here for phone accessories as you will have too many to even decide. But for everything else, might want to try elsewhere. Perhaps the weekend events that goes on at the middle of the mall might be enough festivities to bring you here though."}
{"text":"Welcome to North America's largest indoor Asian Mall! So, what's it like? If you like asian food, bubble tea, bootleg DVDs and anime, you've definitely come to the right place. Personally, I don't drink bubble tea, I borrow my DVD's from the library and I no longer watch anime (except for the occasional Studio Ghibli produced Miyazaki film). So, this mall doesn't really appeal to me much any longer, but, for those who do enjoy these things, Pacific Mall is the quintessential place to go to meet these needs. I definitely don't intend to go here again. If I have a limited amount of time to spend in Toronto, I don't plan on making any expeditions to Markham."}
{"text":"Although, alot of people like this mall but I personally don't like it. If any of you have travelled to Hong Kong and/or China, Pacific Mall is like a HK and/or China flea market.  I honestly think majority of the stuff in that mall are fake, from clothes to sunglasses to the DVDs don't really think anything is real in there except the human beings...  The parking gets very chaotic during the weekends which I don't understand why, its not like its the only Chinese shopping mall in Markham.   Alot of young kids and Caucasian people go there for I don't know what reasons...  The only reason I come here is that if I desperately need something that I absolutely can't find anywhere else. If I had to pay more to buy it elsewhere. I will do it!   Like a zoo is such pretty much the most accurate word to be used here...Like a zoo WITHOUT security that is...=)"}
{"text":"Save yourself the HK airfare and just stop by Pacific Mall.  With a few of the chains making it here (HLS dessert, DTF shanghai), an amazing curry stand, food court, Boba tea, shopping... who really needs to go to HK?  You even have the cheap DVD stores.  I can literally spend hours in here.  Highly recommended if you're into the HK scene, one stop shop for everything you need."}
{"text":"Always somsthing interesting to find here that's forsure haha. You can find just about anything anywhere in this mall. Cool place to wander."}
{"text":"This place is really cool and I don't think I can add much more than what other yelpers have said but I like the uniqueness of this mall. Each \"lane\" you walk down on has a street name so you can remember where your favourite store (or shack) is at and although I've never been to HK, I'm sure it resembles the street markets!  Gwai-loh's and non-asians need to beware, I've heard of many times the store owners jacking up prices when they see non-asians enter their store. Make sure you go with a chinese friend and it'll be all good!   Also I don't think any story about Pacific Mall is complete without this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsd0ZJOrIZQ (starts at about 25 seconds in)"}
{"text":"2nd visit.  At first glance it seems pretty 'horrible'. Truthfully a lot of it is awful, horrible, ugly. There is also a uniqueness, charm, weird element. Rows of tiny stores; must be at least 12 tea/slush drink places, 10 or so nail salons, countless tiny shops selling phone cases.  There is also an arcade upstairs (Fun City), cool little labyrinth of mini restaurants.  Parking can be a nightmare.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"it's huge! we had fun walking around the place and discovering little tinkers. i wouldn't mind going back again."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss with customer service.  Mifi probably has one of the worst I have experienced from multiple encounters.  The sales people are pretty much telling you \"Don't come NEAR my store unless you are 110% you are making a purchase\".  Beside this one lady who is willing to answer questions and smiles, the rest of them just don't even want to waste their breaths on you. Times Circle on the other hand is amazing.  Every staff is knowledgeable on the products and very detailed and friendly."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall has been my go to place for many emergencies and deals. Whether I'm buying prescription glasses, designer sunglasses, you can't get a better deal, especially when you buy more than one at a time.   Their cellphone prices are also awesome if you're like me and you break one halfway through your contact :-S I also get all my cellphone accessories, because there really is no place cheaper and they put the screen savers on for you!   It's also a great place to go to when you're bored and nothing else is open. Or if you need a last minute Christmas gift....on Christmas day.  The only downfall is that most stores aren't open until about noon"}
{"text":"wow, this place is a mecca for all things asian! beware of the parking lot during peak times though; it gets ridiculously crowded and it can easily take up to 30 minutes of circling and stalking to find a spot.  there are tons of bubble tea shops in here, as well as lots of DVD places where you can buy pirated copies of current and older movies for a few bucks, if so desired. i also like checking out the makeup stores because they carry hard to find brands from japan and korea, although prices may be a bit on the higher side.  if you get hungry, there are plenty of asian candy/snack stores, aforementioned bubble tea shops (many of which also carry food) and the large food court to sate your appetite (also follow your nose to the freshly made waffle snack stands). there's also a subway if you are overwhelmed by all the asian-ness and just want a sandwich. :P"}
{"text":"This mall is not to be taken lightly--step in here and you'll see why it's the biggest Asian mall in North America. Protip from my first visit here: enter into the lot next door for Market Village and walk over if the lanes leading to the main entrance are congested.  Or go over to the back.  The mall contains all sorts of different shops, from clothing to accessories to electronics to cosmetics. I'm not the shopper type, though I did enjoy people watching and walking around. There is a dearth of good food though. Bubble tea shops repeat themselves throughout the main floor, while if you go upstairs you'll see a lot of somewhat mediocre restaurants. There are a few good food stands though, and you can always go next door to the Village for food."}
{"text":"40% are cell phone accessories stores, 40% are eye glass stores, and 20% misc. This place is a total bore. Prices are actually high for a Chinese mall. Looks like some places are overcharging to make up for rent. The place is definitely a waste of time with no deals to be had."}
{"text":"For those of you who are familiar with Chinatown's Elizabeth Center in New York City, the Pacific Mall blows EC off the map.   The Pacific Mall is ridiculous. It's the largest Asian mall in North America. Even so, the size of this mall does not reflect the quality of the merchandise sold.  Nearly every other store had a bootleg this, bootleg that. Boutique this, boutique that. (minus one point)  Every once in a while, you'll pass by a cubicle that actually sells pretty decent stuff.   From an Asian's perspective, the Pacific Mall hits pretty close to home. If I was a foreigner, I would understand their enthusiasm. There's no other mall just like it."}
{"text":"This place is massive.  Worth coming just to wander around for hours.  Great food in the cafeteria.  Lots of stores but only a few had anything I was really interested in.  Either way, everyone should come here at least once if you live in the GTA."}
{"text":"Have I really not reviewed Pac Mall? Geez. Pac Mall really busted the notion you can't have a mall without one or two anchor stores. I've seen Pac Mall also go through a number of transitions over the decades. From a place to get exotic spices to knock off products and stickers of weirdly squished pandas to CD/DVDs to a place where you can get all manner of bangle, lerkim, and diffendoofer for your cell phone. As always, you can find shops offering innovative ways to fuck up your $30,000 car with $200 of cheap shit for the hood and steering wheel.   Parking is a nightmare. Pro tip: park across Steeles in the largely dead Splendid China Mall. Then walk across Steeles. My theory is if some crazed driver bashes into my car in the Pac Mall lot, it's on my dime. If some crazed driver bashes into me, OHIP will pay to repair me. And I get a few days off of work. It's about the win-win.   I suspect prices here for many things are based on a pay-what-you-can, where pay-what-you-can is estimated by the sales person."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall is... well... Pacific Mall! Like other Yelpers have said, it's a great place to just walk around and chill with your friends.  You'll find a lot of electronic, clothing, accessory, and beauty stores here, as well as plenty of stores selling typical Asian things (think Hello Kitty, slippers, and rice cookers). Lots of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean foods too.  It's generally really crowded and hectic, which I personally find adds to the fun of browsing the place. =) Something you should know about P-Mall is that you'll see 5 of the same store scattered throughout the mall. I swear there are at least 5 Tea Shop 168's in the place! Which can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it.  Upstairs, there's a reasonably large arcade, which is also a fun place to hang out. There's also a karaoke place, and lots of Asian hair salons.  In terms of how much you'll spend, the clothing there is on the pricier side (at least for a poor student like me). Sometimes you can get pretty good deals though, like $20 for a cute pair of wedges, or shirts that are 2 for $15. I find the clothing really cute and Hong Kong-like. Stuff you can't buy at non-Asian shopping malls. There is a LOT of fake stuff though! Especially fake jewelry, which is REALLY cheap but not worth it unless you're a 5-year-old.  Overall, go check it out if you haven't! Even if you don't buy anything, it's still great fun. =)"}
{"text":"It's just a little mall that's really really Chinese and acts more as a tourist attraction. Nothing fancy and definitely over rated.  But this is a great pace to find little gadgets, snacks, and other yummy foods that you might have trouble finding elsewhere! And everything is pretty cheap so its basically a students dream.  Parking seems hard but if you know where to look, you won't ever have trouble. But the drivers are terrible. People don't look before crossing the road and cars randomly stop and don't signal. Just be patient and careful and you'll be fine"}
{"text":"Im seriously inlove with this MALL.  Every time i go to Toronto i usually end up going to this mall. I love the stores although they're a little over priced with most of the stuff.  I do recommend coming here during the weekdays when it's really not busy so you can browse around freely without bumping to anyone.    The main reason why i go to this mall. 1) Asian MAKEUP! i always wait to go to this mall for make ups and avoid online delivery fees. Honestly, it is a little pricey but there are some stores that i know they sell them cheap. You just have to find and browse around.  Usually the stores that are  on the edge of the mall are the cheap make up stores with the same brand you'll see from the stores.  I recently bough an electric eye curler since i dont' like to use the normal curlers and let me tell you; it works wonders. Then i have my favourite store which is the FACESHOP, i usually go there to get my BB Creams but now that there is one at Square One, i can go to that mall and get them.   2) FOOD! - their food is probably one of the reasons why i go there too.  The beef balls and tripes are sooo good! I usually get 5 orders of each and sometimes ends up taking them home.  Of course everyone can't forget about \"REAL FRUIT\" they serve real fruits for drinks and i mostly order either avocado or mango with tapioca sometimes.   3) PHONE CASES - Half of the stores SELLS CELLPHONE CASES and there are store that sells them over priced.  Letting all the viewers knows that the store \"BABE\" something OVER PRICE their screen protectors and some called \" labor \" when they do it for you.  Please, im not bout spending 20$ where you can get it for cheap.  I usually get mine done at a small cellphone shop on the far right edge stores with the other cellphone stores.  They only charge me 5$ and the screen protector, i always get it with sparkles ( im an sg3 user ) - usually when i go back to that store, its a different girl and she would tell me that it's 8$ but i tell her that i got it done for 5$ and she would give it to me.   4) Lastly, i get my polaroid mini films there since I HATE paying online delivery fees and they over charge the films online...even on EBAY and im a big EBAY buyer.    I come here most of the time when im bored...i havent gone to Pacific Mall just by myself or even if i do; i try not to spend a lot of money.  But its Pacific Mall...you're going to end up spending your money away anyways."}
{"text":"I love pacific mall to find a variety of great cat items, and shoes in small sizes and great hair do dads.   We like to shop at ONE and we usually have dim sum at the Golden Regency although we were dissapointed in the choices on the carts the last time we visited.   Parking can be a real challenge if you arrive late during the weekend."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on our roadtrip to Toronto and had no clue what to do so we went to Pacific Mall as recommended by one of my relatives. First off, LOVED THE FOOD. We literally skipped the whole first floor and just went to get food first because we were so hungry. There was so much to choose from that we just decided to skip a legitimate meal for dinner and ate from multiple stands. Be sure to get the skewers that is towards the back of the floor near the bathroom. The chicken and beef one was good but the lamb was not so great. Bubble tea was good, mini hot cakes were great too. Overall food was perfect.  The first floor with the stores was not so great on the other hand because the stores are situated in a weird pattern that its really hard to navigate through. Also, there wasn't really much to see in them so we just browsed through and left."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall really has fallen, even from just a few years ago. Out are some of the more reliable and high end shops, like the Japanese dishware shop on the second floor.. and in are more Tea Shops 168 and stores selling nothing, but iPhone covers.  There are less than a handful of stores that import toys, plushes and trinkets from Japan now; which was one of the primary reasons for my visits. There are a good number of electronic shops, but they're either nothing special.. or they're knock off devices / hardware.  The one positive Pacific Mall does hold on to is the food, which has a wide variety of options on the upper level mostly. There is also one of the last few arcades in the GTA located here, although it's moved on to less traditional games lately.  For someone coming from downtown, it's too far to warrant a visit. You'll find everything you need in either major Chinatowns downtown, plus you'll have options of wandering else where downtown.. instead of being in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"Good place to go when you are in Toronto and have an hour or two to kill...decent bubble tea place and lots of stores to buy hard-to-find-in-the-states Japanese snacks."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as a child, even though I'm from the states. Last spring, I decided that I needed to revisit this place to relive some nostalgia and see how this place has changed.  From Toronto, take the subway to Finch, then take the 53 Steeles East bus.   USEFUL:  Y'all look alike: Every store looks similar because many stores sell the same thing. Grab a map. better than getting lost.  $CAD: Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money! dolla dolla bill y'all! (credit wu-tang clan)  Prices: weren't as cheap as I had hoped. However, if you enjoy asian import products, you'll probably end up paying the price. Try haggling at your own despair. It may produce more amusing than beneficial results.   Clothes: They are made to fit the size of ants. Just to let you know.   COOL: Dim-sum: upstairs place is very good. Noisy, bustling, fast cart turnover; easily more delicious than any dim-sum place in the states (except for those in San Francisco, which are Godly). I'd give it a try. Must get authentic mango pudding dripping with condensed milk.   Sticky pictures: no photobooths around because the upstairs arcade is gone! There's one store that specializes in sticky pictures but they won't be like the trendy japanese ones. Still, a nice place to go with friends and grab a photo memento because you can still customize the designs AND print size.  Weapons: my friend bought a novelty sword here. We told him he was an idiot because we didn't want a problem with Homeland Security when we returned to the states. Thoughtfully, he went back to return his sword, only to come back with two smaller swords. Nothing happened to us at the border luckily.  In conclusion, still the largest North American asian mall with worthwhile things to check out. if it still had the arcade, it'd be awesome. For what it IS, which is an Asian community of vendors in a weird, glassy mall, I'm glad it exists. Here, bubble tea staves off big, bad, Starbucks.   P.S. Funny is a style. SWAG!"}
{"text":"Great place to kill some time.  Reminds me of when I visited China because all the stores are all mini and there are no changerooms - just a curtain for privacy.  Definitely fun to browse and sometimes you can get stuff for decent prices without ordering it off eBay and getting it direct from China."}
{"text":"To say that I like this place is an understatement.  I used to come here every week.  It is a big mall with many small stores.  It has 2 stories of stores and has 2, not 1, food courts.  If you look up, none of the wall of the stores touches the ceiling.  In other words, the stores are in cubicles.    There are all things Asian here:  Food - dim sum, noodles, Korean food, Japanese food, bubble tea, tea shops.   Clothing & Accessories - many stores and mostly gears towards the teens and twenty-something  Wireless phones services and accessories - every wireless carrier has a representation in the mall.  There are numerous phone accessories stores, unlocked phone stores and phone service (some will unlock your phone)  Optical and professional services - I lose count of the quantity of optical stores in the mall; there may be 10 of them here.  There are also doctors, dentists, tutoring, etc  Beauty and Natural Health - there are many beauty spas and beauty products stores.  There are also herbal stores and vitamin stores.  And there are many more.............  Now you know you should go and explore.  If you are not an Asian, then be a local tourist."}
{"text":"Really fascinating mall with tons and tons of shops.  Many sell the same things, but they all price differently but some allow haggling.   So many gadgets, trinkets, candies, eyewear options, toys, clothes and stuff.  Great food court on the top floor.  A must visit if you are in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Not being Asian myself, I visit more as a tourist.  It is very large and quite fun, though as other reviewers pointed out, the stores tend to be a bit repetitive.  70% fall into three categories:  cheap electronics, bootleg dvd's and herbal stores.  There are also lots of bubble tea places, some jewelers offering very attractive looking wares (have no idea about the quality though) and two small food courts with some very good and very reasonable lunch food.  The upstairs \"heritage\" area features some decor of the glorified Chinese restaurant variety.  There is one Japanese store offering a nice selection of porcelain, lacquerware and the like.    I visited the other two Asian malls nearby and found them much less interesting except for the nice supermarket in the one next door.  If you have friends visiting from out of town, this is a good place to take them if they are non-Asian and want a different style shopping experience.  As for Asian people, I'll take the word of those posting here as to how this place reflects a cultural experience (or does not)."}
{"text":"If you want to get a taste of what it's like to travel to Asia, just visit the pacific mall. You get to immerse yourself with tons of Chinese/Asian people and have unlimited access to fresh fruit boba tea. If you're looking for kitchen supplies like a hot water dispenser, rice cooker or woks this is your place. Oh and there's iPhone cases, zippos, couple's jewelry and an arcade for kids. It's not like your average mall, this is Bargain city. Have fun :)"}
{"text":"When you think the place is the cheapest, just look for it one more day! Its a nice place to visit.  I just shop elsewhere.  Usually find it cheaper.  Its always a bit more expensive here and no one will bargain with you!"}
{"text":"It is not like Pacific Mall is amazing, but it is nice and different. It is often busy and can be difficult to find parking. Inside you will find good eats, interesting decor, clothing, herbs, electronics, hair salon, karaoke, bubble team, and an arcade.  You should probably know you can bargain and don't forget to check out Market Village. You can often find the same goods for cheaper there or even in a different shop in P-mall."}
{"text":"Cute mall to get your knick knacks. Phone cases, snacks, asian-brand makeup.... and even electronics haha. I usually come here for the food though!   Bubble waffles are a must! The udon I tried here was OK but the rating is overall for all the snacks, the food I usually get and the times I've been here.   Will be putting up a second review about the other food I usually get and enjoy. Definitely not an upscale mall, but it's nice to explore and enjoy an inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"This mall is wild. It's like knockoff central up in there. If you want a fake anything you'll find it here. The mall is packed, parking is hell, bathrooms are gross but if you want cheap stuff that's what you have to go through to get it. This mall has everything from anything you could possibly want for your cell phone, to home supplies, beauty stuff, to purses, clothes & more. It's deff worth checking out once if you live in Toronto. If your a tourist I'd skip this one, so many better things to see."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: n/a (vary b/t stores) Cleanliness: 5/5 Decor & Setup: 5/5  Damn I love this Asian mall.  Lots of restaurants, and boba tea places, and great lil food places to eat! very clean.  bright. HUGE. Lots of asians (duh).  anything you can think of that is Asian, sells here. Don't go during crowded times.  Gets to crowded. too much hello kitty.  (I gave this rating a 5/5 compared to other Asian shopping malls I've been to, such as: ones in Cali, Houston, Oklahoma)"}
{"text":"This mall is so awful. People who come here often because they like it, probably have the worst taste. Such a shitty mall, waste of time."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Pacific Mall yet. This place is like my backyard. I have been coming here since 1997 when it used to be half empty. Now it's always packed especially on the weekends. This is your ONE STOP SHOP for everything Asian. Like, everything. Really.   As a long time Pacific Mall (aka pmall) insider, there are some dos and don'ts to note about this place.   DO: - get bubble tea! Or fresh fruit juice! Lots of independent and chain tea shops here. Most of them are decent. When in doubt, look for places with long lines. The crowd is usually right. OR, you can ask me :) I think I've tried every tea shop in this mall.  - eat in the food court upstairs. Cheap and delicious Chinese / Asian food. Lots of choices ranging from noodles, fried rice, Japanese, Singaporean, Vietnamese, to dim sum, and Chinese bbq. If you need more choices, head next door to Market Village. You won't run out of options.  - browse and compare cell phones, wireless providers and accessories. Every major wireless provider is here and you can easily compare and find the best plan for you. Ask for deals. They have lots of deals because Asians love a good deal! Lots of stores with cute cell phone accessories! Also the place to go if you want to unlock your phone.  - get your car stuff and electronic stuff and computer stuff. As you can tell, I don't know much about these \"stuff\" but I know from my friends that this is the place to go to get these \"stuff\" for a good deal.  - come here for your Asian fashion needs. Lots of clothing stores with various styles from Chinese traditional gowns, party dresses, to anime costumes, street fashion, and the latest trends in Asia.  - and of course, do ASK if they have any specials available. For example, many places will waive tax if you pay cash, or give you a discount if you buy more than one or more than two. They may not always tell you so it's good to ask.   DON'T: - buy something without checking out a few stores. Usually more than one store carries the same item and  you'd think they offer it at the same price but sometimes there's a huge price difference. I once found a hair clip for $15 at one store and $40 at another store and they were totally identical.  - expect you are getting the real deal if you're buying something branded. It doesn't matter if it's a designer bag, jewellery, sunglasses or even ginseng. I'm not saying everything's fake, but I'm saying beware. Even if the owner says they're the real deal, you be the judge. I've heard too many stories."}
{"text":"Dream store at Pacific Mall is selling FAKE \"ANELLO\" bags. The bags are priced like original items, Don't be FOOLED!!! They will tell you that the bags in Japan also came from Hongkong.... BS!!!"}
{"text":"Pacific Mall just isn't what it used to be.  Back then, all the booths challenged each other in offering the lowest prices on goods, and people would casually walk into each store to find the best deal. However due to the growth of Markham, the parking lot outside has become a scene of collisions, bad drivers, unobserving pedestrians, and overall confusion. Meanwhile the mall interior is now full of customers pushing and shoving each other to find the deals...except there's no more competition anymore, everything is priced the same throughout.  I also remembered when I used to always play in the second floor arcade before they changed it to some Playdium wannabe ripoff. No more of that anymore. I also remembered when the food court and bars had somewhat tolerable food. Again, many of those have gone downhill in quality.  For the tourists wishing to visit Pacific Mall, may I suggest First Markham Place. You get the same deals, and the stores are much better organized."}
{"text":"Meh, just come here if you need a cell phone case, an unlocked cell phone, sunglasses, cheap chinese DVD's or whatever a Chinese mall would have to offer.  Definitely don't come here for the clothes. Sorry, but it's just not my cup of 'CBC' tea if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"This mall has so much Chinese/Asian products (Japanese/Chinese/ Taiwanese/Korean products). Most of the stores have Chinese (Cantonese/Mandarin speakers) and English speakers. Numerous of snack stores , tea/slush/bubble tea, home appliance,Maneki Neko (Fortune Cat), freshly made egg rolls & the 2nd floor is restaurants and food court.  I like to come here to purchase snacks. They have a lot of Asian snacks that you can't find in the US BUT most of the items are over price. Also even comparing the prices for the same item store to store it is approximately the same because some of the stores are the same store/chain. It's great when you are willing to pay the higher price when you want something and you don't know where else you can purchase it.  TAKE NOTE: Weekends it is crazy crowded ! Especially during lunch time. Even with the huge parking lot they have, it will take some time to find parking. Best way is to follow the people leaving Pacific Mall."}
{"text":"It was a quiet mall with repetitive stores. I did not really enjoy it because the prices were a little high for me. I come from California and the prices there were higher than Chinatown in California therefore I did not end up buying anything. The food court was decent but very Chinese centered and not Asian centered"}
{"text":"Pacific Mall is a unique place. It's so special, it was recently named by the US as one of the most notorious markets in the world for counterfeit goods!  Eh, whatever. It is a really fun and fascinating place. It is pretty large, and mostly looks from the outside like any other shopping mall. Inside, it's full of tiny booths, kind of like the halls at the CNE.  75% of those shops are cell phone stores of some sort or another, but the remaining shops are full of great goods, from fashion and jewelry to homegoods and salons. It's mostly goods from Asian countries, so it's a little bit of a Chinatown and Japantown all combined. There are stores with every flavor of Kit Kats, there are stores with beautiful arrays of jade, there are lucky cats and purses of questionable origin.  Food court is great, full of all sorts of tasty places. This is a great place to just people watch and window shop."}
{"text":"Gotta love P-Mall in all its randomness. Under one roof, you can find: - Bubble tea shops - Chinese herbs - Themed hair salons - A music school - Real estate agents & travel agents  - Trendy fashion from Hong Kong (be warned, many items are 'one size fits all' and happen to be very small!)  - Lots of opticals - my favourite, Optical 88 just closed though:(  - An arcade  - Stores selling phone accessories, kitchen appliances, photography equipment, Hello Kitty stationary, and bootleg DVD's  - Loads of restaurants (main food courts are upstairs)  - The last remaining puri kura (Japanese sticker picture) booths I have seen in the city - A central court that hosts events like singing competitions or on my last visit, 'Birds of Prey' - live owls from a local conservation group   Pacific Mall is fun to wander around or bargain hunt. There are basically a few types of stores repeated over and over again, so it's easy to get lost (many stores look the same). Just be warned that parking is scarce on weekends and even more scarce on holidays, because this is one of the few malls that stays open on stat holidays. Bring cash, as some businesses will offer a 'discount' (or don't charge tax...) if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"Only come to this mall if u like anime KPOP dramas Asian fashion and Asian food. Or else u will be wasting your time. But I love it"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here on a Saturday morning and the mall wasn't really that crowded .... until we got to the food court on the 2nd floor! Even though we did not eat here, the food court was the highlight of the mall by far. We had just eaten, but the aroma of all of the food stands definitely had us contemplating eating more!  The mall was pretty much what we expected: a variety of snack, cheap goods and bubble tea stores selling a variety of different items at 'discount' prices. One thing we definitely noticed was that there was no shortage of bubble tea shops inside so if you're thirsty or seeking a good beverage this is an excellent stop to make. Honestly, there wasn't anything special about the mall other than the fact that every shop inside was Asian owned. It made for a nice time killer/waster as we walked around the 2 floors."}
{"text":"Shortened name being \"Pmall\", This place is very popular to people of all ages (and races, too). Very good place to buy unlocked cellphones & cell accessories, clothing, appliances, accessories, stationery, makeup, cheap dvd's, vid games, sticky pics, you name it. Also contains hair salons, karaoke places, a lot of little eateries.   Most of the places are Canto/Mando owned, so it is a large plus if you know one of the 2 languages. Better for bargaining. There are a few places that are Japanese or Korean owned, but not very common. These days, there are quite a few non-asians shopping at Pmall since there's a lot of products that this mall has that most places do not.  Pros: -open 365 days a year -large variety of different products sold in all the stores -largest Asian mall in Canada, possibly in all of North America (?) -this place can get crowded, but it is never ridiculously crowded -No tax (most places) when paying cash. Most places do not accept CC/Debit, and even if they do, they usually will put in the tax.   Cons: -parking. Really sucks on weekends, sometimes we had to park in the mall across the street (decent walking distance). -clothing & accessories are usually very overpriced. Evaluated over many of the clothing stores.   I have 2 unlocked phones both from this mall. The cellphone places are great, and the people know their stuff. Most cellphone stores do cellphone repair (mainly for smartphones), and have cheap cases and accessories.   There are also a ton of accessories stores across the mall. From cute clips to wigs to necklaces.. Although, usually very overpriced and sometimes bad quality. I have seen many Korean made necklaces go for $5-10 online, and they would be $15-25 in Pmall stores. There are also many stores and stands that sell cute handbags. Be warned, many of the animal print bags are bad quality, and colours get washed out after coming out of the dryer.  Shoes and clothing are usually decent quality. Shoes tend to be cheap at pmall, and theres usually a very large selection of cute/classy choices.   Many stores are also now selling circle lenses, but also extremely overpriced (sometimes almost double the price of buying them online). There are not a lot of places that sell prescription lenses (I have yet to find one).   Cheap DVDs/music - this is the place to get your bootlegged DVDs, all are from Mainland no doubt (Taiwan has banned bootlegging).   There are also a few chinese medicine stores, bakeries, ice cream places, and BBT places. I cannot really comment on the first 2, but all the BBT places I have tried so far at pmall are pretty good.  I can go on and on. Overall, Pacific Mall is just a great place to hang out with friends or be with family because there is a lot to do and shop for."}
{"text":"Make sure you browse all the floors before making a purchase, many vendors sell similar things at similar prices, if you pay cash you can definitely barter here. For example a beauty store Holika Holika sells beauty stuff at retail price with Buy one get one something deals. Another store private owned will sell herbal fruit tea for $80 a bag and eyelash glue for $20. If you know ebay/other places sells it for less, you can always check on your phone and maybe barter with them that way, depends how much you want to pay for convenience or other.   Bubble tea is a alright deal here if you buy 4 to 10 you get a card and then you get one free. there are good deals by the food court upstairs like 3 for 5 or 7 dollars. A lot of noodle, sushi and authentic Singaporean satay shop here. It's definitely fun to bring your friends.   My parents are fond of the herbal stores here. There are stands that sell wedding photography packages which create a book of very aesthetic photos~ very lovely and also stand that sell honey products, when we came in the summer.   Previous years we had hair cut and styling services which average $30 to $70.   The architecture of the mall is beautiful and makes it seem clean, bright white walls, flooring and lights with clear glass dooring, it can also seem like a maze because the stores are shaped squarely.   The DVDs are a real bargain but they aren't authentic, the bookstores are though. I have  a rhinestone belt I purchased here years ago which is in great condition! You should have a keen eye as some things are knockoffs if you don't prefer that.   The jewelry stores have authentic jade, gold and silver emblems like zodiac sign statues and necklaces. The home goods store is overpriced and when they are busy they tend to ignore you.  A must see if you are from out of town. Snack shops are higher in retail price than Chinatown's of America. Parking can be a challenge weekends and evenings.   Phone cases and clearance items can be a good deal here, they sell Vivienne Westwood shoes all the time, the same design, lol, unsure if they are real.  I want to visit a nail salon here in the future."}
{"text":"If you want to have an experience that is somewhat similar to the markets in China, then it's a decent place to go.   You can make some interesting finds for cellphone accessories, street food and miscellaneous beauty products.   Lively space but parking can be very chaotic."}
{"text":"I love this mall. All stores are Asians owned, meaning that the prices are reasonable. Great deal. The best part of this place is the food court on the second floor. Check it out."}
{"text":"I find that when you go Pacific mall any women's clothing store they push you to try it on and they watch you, and the store is so small you can not move around.  Why in the world they make the store so small.   If you want to get a discount from any store they won't give you as they used to do that back then. They don't bargain anymore they go by their price.  And I find the washroom is so dirty from downstair and upstair as well."}
{"text":"Overpriced stuff. The good thing is most sellers and shops will take cash. It has recently in the past few years lost a bit of it's hype. Back in the 90's I remember it being a tourist attraction point. The golden days have passed in this mall but there are still shops where you can find amazing deals for electronics, gadgets and movies where you can't buy anywhere else. They have a nice selection of Chinese dishes in the food court and a cool arcade to play in. Other than that, there is just so much competition these days and there are other great malls you should visit."}
{"text":"Fun place! Lots of cute shops, lots of yummy food and lots of random things ! Love it!"}
{"text":"For me, once is enough. I came here to attend a wedding reception at the Golden Regency restaurant and I was really excited to see this place after hearing all the hype for the past few years. Parking was definitely the most stressful part of the visit, but I found the \"mall\" itself to be quite boring because so many of the places sell the exact same things. I guess if I came here looking for something very specific I might have been successful, but the flea-market look doesn't do much to make merchandise appealing, and overall there just seems to be a lot of knick knacks for sale. Fine if that's what your after, but I guess it's not for me.  My big question is how do all these vendors stay in business selling such similar merchandise so close to each other? Is the market for cell phone covers really that big?  The food selection seems okay - there are quite a few priced reasonably but don't look for anything like a North American chain - the only western-style food is Wanda's Belgian waffles, which looks like it does more business than nearly any other vendor selling food there!   I strongly advise you to avoid going here on the weekend if you're just out for a casual visit."}
{"text":"(Review is based on the Heritage Town Food Court + shopping for an iPad Mini Case.)  Dear Pacific Mall,  Please consider taking a bulldozer to your \"Heritage Town\" food court located upstairs.  It is cramped, dark, 'n dingy.  Communal dining is never glamourous, but here, it's just plain disgusting!  I sorta felt like one of the hungry animals at the trough.  I'm sure that you're also breaking some zoning by-laws by having a nail place right beside the walnut cake stall.  May I also suggest that you move these shops OUT of the food court area as they don't belong here??  Taking out the miscellany will not only make more room for the food stalls, but the dining area as well!  New chairs/tables are needed as the current ones are grungy.  This place is, for some strange reason, a tourist attraction, and this is no impression to leave on people visiting from other countries.  Granted, I will say that you have cleaned up your washrooms.  Some people still don't flush, but hey, at least I don't cringe each time I hafta pee.  I realise change hurts, but it'll garner result$$$.  Trust me.  Yours Sincerely, Stephanie.  P.S.  For those of you who are thinking of coming here to look for a case for your iPad mini, think again!  Every store carries the same merch from China.  Cheap quality at not-so-cheap prices.  Seems to be more variety for the iPad, but still bad IMHO."}
{"text":"This is a decent mall to go to if you are a tourist. There are a lot of souvenirs here as well as a lot of knick knack stuff. Went to a few stores and bought a few things. I was a little peeved when I went to a store to buy a few things for some people back in the states and I was being followed the WHOLE time. I understand people steal but ugh be less obvious about it. And good luck with parking, you will get honked, cussed out or even get the middle finger if someone tries to steal your parking space."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall has got to be the most overrated mall I've ever been to and it drives me nuts.  For starters, the parking is absolutely dreadful.  Finding a spot early afternoon on any given day or at all during the weekend is next to impossible.  With so many smaller stores/restaurants, plus Market Village, so close by, there's just not enough places to park.  Add to the fact that some of the lanes are extremely skinny and with the awful drivers. you'll have a headache looking for a spot.  Never go on weekends.  The inside of the mall itself isn't as bad.  It's generally kept very clean and the halls are wide enough that people can walk or stand in the halls without blocking people off, even at the busiest hours.  There are several places to eat in the two food courts, lots of places to buy bubbletea and phone accessories.  The foodcourt near the elevator recently got redone and it looks a lot nice and cleaner now so it's a nice place to grab a bite to eat.  The other food court has mostly noodle or meat places, though they're terribly slow.  One place actually took about 25 minutes (no exaggeration) to get a bowl of noodles once.  I wasn't pleased.  My girlfriend was stuck waiting an extra 15 minutes after mine was done.  You could have done a 'little' bit better with the timing, no?  One other noodle place had a fly in her soup but she didn't bother returning it since she ate her other food and lost her appetite for anything after that.  There are so many bubbletea places that you're bound to find one you like, it's just a matter of personal preference.  As for the rest of the mall, there's nothing that really stands out to me.  There needs to be more variety, for sure, as there's too many bubble tea and phone accessory stores.  An area that this mall falls dreadfully short is the customer service.  Two separate instances are below:  -There are a few places that sell random items on the top floor near the stairs and my girlfriend was looking at them.  She seemed semi interested in something but ultimately decided not to buy it.  Whoever was managing it at the time bugged her several times when she was looking at the items, even after she said she was just looking.  The annoying part is that the same lady bothered her the next three times we passed this same place.  -Twice now, in the food court, my girlfriend wanted some bubbletea so she went to one of the places in the food court area.  She told the cashier what she wanted but they gave her a warmed up version instead.  For God knows why.  She told them she wanted a cold one but they refused to give one to her unless she paid for another drink.  She never asked for warm bubbletea to begin with and the fact that they insisted on her paying for another one is ridiculous (she didn't even pick up the first one... literally just touched it).  After this, they switched to speaking in Mandarin, which is the most insulting part.  Since she can't speak that, she had to leave.  The second time, they made the bubbletea warm, but must have realized it wasn't suppose to be so they dumped in a ton of ice.  Yeah, good try.  The customer service needs a ton of work...  and that's an understatement.  If you go into 'most' (not all, I've had two or three stores with excellent employees) stores, employees don't look like they care about anything, don't really smile and don't ask if you're looking for something.  Even in the bigger stores, there's not many employees roaming around to help customers.  Not only this, but when you do talk to employees, a large portion of them don't even speak English.  I understand that it's a Chinese mall and all, but you should know enough English to get you by on a casual day.  Last I checked, we do live in Ontario.  Sometimes, I need my girlfriend to do the talking, simply because I don't speak Cantonese.  That doesn't seem right at all.  All in all, I don't recommend this mall at all.  Back in high school, a lot of people I knew were always like \"Let's go to Pacific Mall\", as if to say it's the best place ever.  I was let down when I did go there the three or four times following that.  They have some neat stores, but nothing stands out and there's nothing there you can't get elsewhere.  The parking's dreadful and the customer service needs a ton of work.  I honestly have zero idea why people like this place so much.  Save yourself the headache of going here.  It's simply not worth it."}
{"text":"Not worth a stop if you are visiting Toronto. It's 30-60 min away from the city depending on traffic and is composed mostly of designer frames, bubble tea, clothing, and cell phone accessory shops. On the top floor there is an arcade and some food stalls that were closed when we came."}
{"text":"A fun experience.  Lots of Asian stores (duh). The prices are just okay, now that the U.S. dollar has become so weak.  Pretty good snack options. There's a food court on the second floor. I come for the egg waffles omnomnom.  There are like 50 bajillion bubble tea places in here too. They offer samples and have various deals. Just don't get conned by the \"buy one get one 50% off\" where you have to buy a humungo size boba.   There's also a dude who sells small aquarium pets. You can get a pet turtle while you're here. Just don't tell border patrol."}
{"text":"This mall has recently been called out on having a few stores that sell counterfeit goods by the AMERICAN government. There is so much to be said about the oddity of that statement alone but I'm not going to waste my time there. It's hardly a secret some stores sell imitation handbags and shoes and the retailers rarely attempt to even advertise those were real. All local people know it and that's why we are there! A majority of the consumers make the purchases fully aware they are fake. You've got to be some kind of stupid to think otherwise - it takes very little effort to make out the differences between fake ones and real ones. Pacific mall isn't just about handbags. This is a HUGE mall with hundreds of shops and food vendors that sell legitimately quality goods and services.   We are consenting customers, so for the AMERICAN GOVT to stick their politically driven noses into this (as they Soooo often do into the business of everyone else's but their own), and insinuating that we are some kind of victim, then I can state right now that we are not. The American govt should stick their stuck up arrogant noses in their own business. They have SO many bigger problems to be fixed in their own country and here they are making judgment calls on a couple of shops in Markham? Please."}
{"text":"I get all fobby when I visit TO. Have to always make a pit stop at Pacific Mall to get my fob on! I've been going here since the late 90's and it's entertaining to look at all the pirated music/movies and funky jewelry. This place was fun before Russell Peters made fun of it..."}
{"text":"I hate to say this but the glory days of PM are fading ...  The food choices are still solid (upstairs).  Even Ding Dong, my favourite place for 'Asian' snacks is now in a much smaller store.   Bought an Uncle T's Japanese cheesecake, a few cosmetics from Japan and had a bubble-tea at Presotea.   I remember the glory days of this mall.  It's not terrible just not the same ..."}
{"text":"This place is overrun with cellphone accessory shops. I did the whole run around of asking prices for a case and a protective film/screen protector. Every little cellphone shop at this mall was selling it for about $50 for the case and the screen protector together. I bet they're all owned by the same group of people. And, they scam everyone - doesn't matter if you're white, black, or yellow, lol. Anyways, all of it is so terribly overpriced...You can get both (same stuff) for about $10 on ebay.   I mostly come here for the imported snack shops. Got to watch out for expired stuff though...some of these stores are quite sketch and don't give a crap about freshness.   Tip: best way to enter this mall from steeles if travelling eastbound is from putnam gate to harvest moon drive to clayton drive."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall is the one stop shop for kitchen, home and personal knickknacks.   In between shopping you can stop for a snack or a bigger meal at the many food, drink and snack vendors dotted along the two storey mall - food court on second level.  Go-to place for cell phone cases, optical needs, inexpensive kitchen and bath hardware.  Need patience to navigate weekday/weekend due to scale and multiple outlets.   Best to come with cash for best deal; possible to bargain (if you dare) - I do."}
{"text":"Hate coming here...   The last time I was at P-Mall was approximately 2 years ago when my friend needed to find a qi pao for her wedding. Otherwise, I will not be stepping foot unless absolutely necessary.   Parking is a disaster unless you're here early. Weekends are the WORST... and it's the prime location for those who somehow were able to pass their driving test.   Most of the stores sell a lot of the similar things. For example there are prob a zillion cellphone accessory stores... clothing (ahh hk sizes and the prices are too high), snacks, etc. Most have the standard pushy sales ppl like in HK. Remember not to cave."}
{"text":"All the Asian malls in Toronto are all the same. If you been to one, you've been to it all. Each mall would have the following \"specialty stores\":   DVD stands (i finally bought 3 for $10, chinese movies, gotta brush up on my canto) Hello Kitty/Sanrio store Herbs / Asian dried medicine stuff / Markets Female HK / Fobbish / Hipster clothing store (girls who work there are quite pushy on making a sale) Beauty / Makeup / Eye glasses store Phone store Facial / nails / massages Tons of foodie stands all over   I think I've been to about 4 malls and this one is the mega one out of Toronto. 2 Floors with two underground parking. If you need anything, don't waste your time at other places and just come here."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to going to this mall for quite awhile, mainly because I hear the words \"cheap\" and \"plentiful\" thrown around. Cheap it ain't.   I'm used to seeing some cheap (quality & monetary) stuff from the Chinese malls in New York and at times, I think some things can be overpriced. But this, this mall jumps carts on the train by far as overpriced. I really can't stand some of the sales people at this mall. They're so pushy and impatient. I went into 2 beauty stores and as soon as I dragged my foot in the door, sales associates came up and asked, \"Can I help you?\" I haven't even laid my eyes on any of your items yet. I went to a beauty shop called Debbie, where the sales associate walked up to me and within 2 minutes while I was still looking, she said exactly these words: \"Hello. Are you done yet?\" At the end, I realized she was about to go home as she was talking on the phone. *Yawn*  Oh my gosh, their impatience really gets under my skin. However, I really enjoyed this snack shop called Ding Dong, which is full of hard-to-find Japanese snacks. Even most of the packaging is what you see at stores in Japan and they had my favorite fish sausage sticks! The staff there actually isn't pushy and friendly. As others have said, the stores are pretty much generic; you'll see phone accessory shops, bubble tea shops (duplicates) and clothing stores. Some clothing stores I went into were reasonably-priced and some were just hundreds of dollars of stuff that even after \"half off,\" it'd be retail price; you won't find $10 shirts here! I disagree with a lot of people who said it's like Hong Kong. Maybe the \"cheapness\" does it but there are actually great deals in Hong Kong.  I went into one of the Real Fruit bubble tea shops and it was so odd that after 10 minutes of waiting and not getting my drink, little did I know the drinks come from the other location. Anyway, I ordered the Strawberry Coolness, thinking it was a drink and my jaw almost dropped at the $6.xx price tag. It's actually a bowl of iced slush with some strawberries and lots of jellies. Surprisingly good but I can honestly say that I have yet had bubble tea in Toronto.  After one full circle of window shopping, I don't think I will look forward to coming back the next time I'm in Toronto.There is nothing here you can't find in Chinatown."}
{"text":"My brief 4 days in Toronto included 8 Chinese restaurants and 4 malls.  If you do the math, that means every meal involved a Chinese restaurant and a mall.  On one of the days, we came here ...  impressive considering it's an Asian (Chinese / Hong Kong style) mall located in Toronto.  The aisles are a lot wider, a lot less people and no shop owners sweeping or spitting in the street.  I looked at prices and wanted to divide everything by 6 to convert to USD ... but that didn't fly here.  I also can't haggle by pretending to speak broken Chinese.  Close ... but not the real thing."}
{"text":"This is a really cute mall that sells almost everything. I was able to spend hours in there to kill some time. They have food courts that are very tempting to try.my favorite  is that some of the snacks you cannot find in the US, you can find them here. Everytime i come to Canada i would always make a stop here to replenish my favorite snacks as well as buy gifts to return home with. some stuff can get pretty pricey if you do not know your conversions. example: bubble tea... i spent about 13 Canadian dollars for 2 small drinks...  This place is kind of like EC (what used to be Elizabeth Center in NY) combined with a food court and luxury beauty shops together. Sections of the mall can get crowded and receive more attention than others.   Parking was a drag though. I spent about 30 minutes trying to find a spot and got one after arguing over one driver who tried to steal my spot.... How is it possible that a parking lot that size have so many cars parked there and not leave?"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh yes. Pacific Mall. \"Tai Koo Guong Cheung\" is actually Pacific Place in HK located in Admiralty, which, is probably still one of the best malls in HK to date.  However, Pacific Mall in Canada is like Ken K said, an \"FOB's wet dream come true\". Feeling homesick? No problem. Just go for a stroll at Pacific Mall.  The sellers here are tough though. They want to make a sale, yet, they want to make money off you, so out comes the bargaining skills -- you're Chinese after all right?  Ken already gave a perfect run-down to what the mall is all about so I'll refrain from repeating. However, the bootleg DVDs are pretty awesome but again, don't buy from the first vendor you see.... walk around a bit, get a feel and then start bargaining.  If you haven't seen Russell Peters' routine about his experience at Pacific Mall you gotta check it out. It basically epitomizes what an experience at Pacific Mall will probably be like for a non-Chinese speaker."}
{"text":"This review is specifically about the arcade on the 2nd floor of Pacific Mall.  I was meeting a colleague for lunch at Pacific Mall today and she was over an hour late.  After checking out all the Hello Kitty trinkets I could handle for one day, I headed up to the arcade, hoping to catch some kids rocking DDR like I occasionally see.  It was pretty desolate today (maybe because it was noon on a Wednesday) so I got some tokens and perused the available options.  There are a lot of Street Fighter machines, and lots of NBA machines.    Then... something glorious happened.  I happened upon Bust-A-Move, my favorite arcade game of all time.  Bust-A-Move, also known as Puzzle Bobble, was a game that I played religiously at HavaJava coffee shop and eatery in St. Catharines Ontario when I was in grades 10 and 11.    I was just SO thrilled to see this arcade classic, that I might go back tomorrow.    I also really like Ding Dong foods here; their shredded pork jerky is to die for, and I also like the beef satay although it is spicy.  There are some jerky varieties without English labels that I never buy, but if they had labels in English I would - note to Ding Dong Foods.  I echo the previous reviewers sentiments about the parking here.  It's a death zone and very frustrating.  BUST A MOVE."}
{"text":"When visiting the GTA there are three things I must visit: -Family -Tim Horton's  -Pacific Mall!  What can I say, I love PMall. We have nothing even remotely close to it here in the SF Bay Area.  The stores are all so tiny and redundant. But, don't let that fool you, as there are some great finds if you walk inside the store.  I have yet to walk out of that mall empty handed!  Let's face it, you'll find bootleg items at PMall.  I've even encountered a moment when one of the DVD retailers caught wind of the police or some authoritative figure and they pretty much did a fire drill by forcing everyone out, closed the store, opened back up in 5-minutes and the store completely changed.  I think now they've tightened up and you have to know to ask.  Other than that, you'll find cool gadgets for your car, cases for your phone, clothing, electronics, makeup, shoes, bags, backpacks, vitamins, knick knacks, etc.  They have a food court on the 2nd floor but I didn't try any of them out.  A few tips:  -Majority of the retailers only take cash, some accept debit, but none I encountered accepted credit.  -Since the USD is about equal to the CAD, all of the retailers we went to accepted our USD, which worked in our favor as we would've lost some value exchanging it with the bank!  -Inspect the item you want to buy, because they all have a sign saying \"no refunds and no exchanges.\"  -It gets so packed during the weekends/holidays.  Not to mention, their parking garage is a biyatch to maneuver.  Regardless of when you come, I'd suggest to come early and park outside.  -Bring anti-bac gel, their bathrooms are disgusting.  Thank goodness all I gotta do is stand. :)  Happy shopping!"}
{"text":"What can I really say that hasn't already been said? One nice perk about this place is that they're open on holidays. I went on Canada day for the first time in ages - busy, but not insane like you may think.  I used to come here a LOT when I first discovered it about 18 years ago, but it has changed quite a bit since then. Nowadays, it's good for cell phone cases, car accessories, nail salons and optical stores. :) It's quite comical, my friend and I were trying to see every store, but we kept feeling like we were repeating the background like in the Flintstones when they run somewhere.  I think there is an Uncle Tetsu's there now, so there's a reason for me to go back...but other than that, a visit once a year to PMall for kicks will be good enough!"}
{"text":"AKA \"P-mall\" to locals. People will roast P-mall for myriad of reasons (less customer service and more stalking customers to make sure they aren't stealing, little room for bargaining, no return/exchange policy, most dangerous drivers in Canada concentrated in the P-mall parking lot, etc.) but all this plus the good things make P-mall, P-mall.   If you're a tourist and someone tells you to visit P-mall, this is accurately what you will find:  - Cell phone repair and accessory shops - Asian beauty boutiques and nail salons - Eyeglass and sunglass shops - Bubble tea shops - Clothing shops that sell funny Asian clothes - Clothing shops that sell counterfeit designer clothes - Taipan Tours coach bus loading Asian seniors to Niagara Falls - Asian candy or traditional herb stores - Shops selling mini aquariums and baby turtles - 2 food courts on the upper level, both with a decent selection of food and snacks - Cute old Asian lady cleaning the foodcourt who EVERY single time I have been to P-mall for the last 20 years  If you want the best out of your visit, come with very low expectations. That and... take the TTC if you're visiting during busy weekends or holidays, especially Chinese New Year."}
{"text":"Dont do any shopping here. IT IS SUPER EXPENSIVE. Even most of cellphone cases are expensive.  I'd probably go here for cheap eats located on the 2nd floor. Egg waffles, variety of fish balls, chicken balls, milkteas... and so on.  Prices for most of the items vary at every one of stores. Make sure to look around first. Front stores near main entrance are the most overpriced ones."}
{"text":"I went to Malaysia, and this felt similar to a Asian Mall. Lot of the same place. Feel like a cartoon with a repeat of same exact mall; Pokemon/Otaku type toys - Bootleg DVD's   - Cool obscur asian imported Candies - cell/tech gizmos - same bubble tea/juice bar. It's kind of kitsch and funny at the same time.   It's pretty freaking huge with crazy traffic to get in, I got lucky in all honnesty."}
{"text":"First of all, when we went to enter the mall, the entrance was encrusted with bird poop everywhere. Even on the door & door handles. Yuck! Not a good impression when entering a shopping area.   Anyway, I haven't been here in years. It hasn't really changed except it's not as clean as it used to be when it was new. We went on a weekday so parking wasn't too bad. But we only went to a few stores here, looking for semi-precious crystals."}
{"text":"If you want to see hundreds of DVD, eye glasses, cell phone and dress stores, this is the place for you. Also has an interesting selection of other stuff too. Unique."}
{"text":"O.k, I happen to love this mall. Yes its dirty, dingy, always overcrowded and its almost impossible to find parking here, but I love it. Its a great place to have a cheap lunch and buy cheap electronics, and you can literally save up to 50% on items such as SD cards, and cell phone and camera accessories. Ironic, a lot of my Asian friends hate this place with a passion, but I still love this place for it's entertainment value and pricing. Don't be fooled by the designer labels though, if you see an original brand here for 30 to 50% off regular retail prices the chances are it will be a knock-off. Remember you are always going to get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is huge!!! An indoor shopping experience you must see. I didn't like all the knock off items for sale and it seem like all the stores were selling the same thing."}
{"text":"I have been going to Pacific Mall for a few years now and I have to admit it's a very unique place. The set-up of the mall is weird in a good way and there are all this amazing Asian products to buy. If you are new going there, you will feel very overwhelmed at the sheer site of this place. The first floor is like a maze and it is always crowded.  With all that said, there are many things that grind my gears about this place.   First of all is the fact that the more I come here the more it looses its magic touch. At first I was so happy and amazed with the amount of stores they had but then you realize that so many of the stores are selling the same thing. Pretend there are 50 store, 25 of those stores will be bubbly tea shops 10 will be computer shops and the rest boutique shops selling the same clothing brands (I see Ed Hardy and Juicy Couture must be really popular with the kids these days).  Secondly is the fact that there are so many bootlegged items in this store, you sometimes feel put off purchasing things. Pirated DVDs and CDs are in so many places while a few shoe stores here will sell you fake shoes that are the same price as the real thing if you bought them in Foot Locker.   My last complaint does not apply to all the stores but to a few stores and that is the fact that customer service is piss poor. After a certain incident this one car parts store had the nerve to laugh at my mom and talk about her in their native tongue. I wish that was an isolated incident but it happens a lot to me and many of my friends that go there. If they know you are not from the same country, they will start talking about you and treat you very cold. A friend of mine that was looking at clothes was followed around by the store owner and told not to touch things. It was like she thought my friend was carrying some sort of disease. Sometimes you go into a store and they don't even speak English. Yes, I know it is an Asian mall but we are still in North America. When this happens they look at you and ignore you.   Well even though I probably sounded like I was ranting the past 10 or so sentences I do advise one to experience this place. It truly is unique and they also have some great food joints."}
{"text":"Better than expected!  Based on its reputation, I assumed this place would be something like a flea market.  But it's actually nice, clean, and not too cramped. Lots of glass windows/walls.  The downside? Literally every second store sells cellphones/accessories. No exaggeration. Every second one.  I managed to find a coin store in between all the madness. Small but seemingly well stocked. I picked up an 1870 Canada 25cent bill. Lots of Asian bills on display. Looks nice.  As for the mall itself, it's A-OK but nothing too special."}
{"text":"wow, this place is crazy.  I'll admit, I can't read most of the signs and I'm a little scared of that parking lot, but this is one huge asian mall with everything you'd ever want in one.  Just behind it is the Mongolian Grill - it rules.  take yourself, take a date, it's fun for the whole family....yet I keep ruining my dress shirts there with teriyaki sauce when I'm eating my noodles with those slippery plastic chop stix."}
{"text":"Where else can you go to an optical store, buy sunglasses for your gf, and have them write them as prescription glasses for you so that you can claim them for free for your benefits?  This place is full of crazy scams like that.   Movies you can get for $2 a DVD (For movies currently out in the theatre, to those available for rentals). You can get the whole Turbo Jam set of 5 discs for $10.   Food is good in this place too, especially in the food court upstairs. A guy makes noodles fresh and in front of you while you watch and wait for your food.   Would advise you not to use your credit cards here though, cash basis is most common, plus they could possibly copy your credit card and you see unknown purchases on your account at a later date."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall has been around since I have grown up visiting and living in Toronto. Located at it's outskirts in Markham, this mall is found at the Cross roads of Kennedy and Steels.  Known for its restaurant eateries and various food kiosks, it also sells electronics, video, cell phone and accessories, garments, home products, and jewelry. Tons of local Asian bubble tea and smoothie stop spots!  One point of concern, you need to shop around to find that one thing you're looking for. I usually go here for electronics. Watch out for incompatible stuff like electronic parts, videos, and gaming videos. There are many knock offs throughout.  So if you're used to an Eaton Center or Yorkdale, this mall isn't for you...but it is a cool part of the Asian culture in the East end Toronto."}
{"text":"Always come here when I am visiting my family members here."}
{"text":"This place is getting very old.  Things there are way overpriced.  You will be able to get the SAME product at a cheaper price online.  Sites such as Alibaba, Aliexpress or even Amazon.    They import these things from Alibaba anyway and jack up the price.  Multiple shops are owned by the same owner, so don't waste your time looking around for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"I like this mall for reasons that are unknown to me.  It's big, but basically there are really only 10 types of stores in here:  Chinese medicine, cell phones, computer parts, clothing, illegal videos/music, buddhist furniture stuff, jewellery like jade or pearls, video games, eye glasses, and food.  It gets hot in the summer and busy on weekends.  If you are driving then you better arrive early or you'll have a tough time parking. I noticed that a lot of stores are closing up shop, probably because they have 1320 other competitors in the same mall.  Nonetheless, if you are into Chinese culture this is a cool place to check out.  Lots of food choices that are quite tasty and reasonably priced upstairs."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with this place? They have everything you want. Clothes, games, food, movies, cheap stuff, expensive stuff. If a place gets shut down, something else will open up in its place the following week selling pretty much the same stuff. Pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This is thee place to be. They have:  1.        FOOD 2.        FOOD 3.        FOOD 4.        Bubble Tea! 5.        Bootleg DVDs 6.        Bootleg everything.. LOL 7.        Nail salons(sss) - yeah, there's ALOT  Every Saturday when I need to satisfy my boredom and hungry stomach, I come here. They have curry fish balls, beef balls, tripe, skewers, all sorts of Taiwanese snacks, bubble tea, and more!  It's the place where they have (almost) everything.  I come here for my eye exams, to purchase my glasses and contacts, get my purdyyy nails done, and to buy CHINESE MOVIES!  Oh and the good old days.. STICKY PICTURES. Unfortunately it's gone now. Sad.. Well they have one inside the arcade upstairs but it's not the same. Which reminds me of the days when they still had jitz tables in the arcade. Good old days!  I practically grew up here, lived here!  Oh what would I do without Pmall."}
{"text":"What is there not to love about this mall?? My favorite boba place is in this mall, and their fish balls are to die for! They also sell freshly made egg waffles!! While you're sipping on your boba and eating your fish balls walking around, you may find yourself enjoying all the cute things the stores are selling. I would be here all day if I could."}
{"text":"Huge Cantonese Mall in the suburbs of Toronto!  Whenever I go here I forget that I'm not in Hong Kong.  It's definitely worth a trip if you have a car and like shopping for Chinese goods or enjoy Chinese food.  There are lots of cell phone, gadget, cutesy trinket booths too."}
{"text":"Fun place! Cool food and snacks and I've gotten my ears pierced here before!"}
{"text":"I think the resturants in the mall area are decent. Beware if trying to buy DVDS or designer items!!!! Parking is crazy."}
{"text":"Years ago I used to love coming here to look and shop at the stores with the Hello Kitty plushes, jewelry, and even take photos at the stores with photo booths. Now I come here and all there is left are stores that sell cell phone cases and clothes. Each hallway of stores you walk down, more than half sell cell phone cases. There used to be much more of an abundance in stores back in the day, and now it's just not the same anymore. I wasn't looking for a cell phone case, but ended up buying one anyway. Once I bought one, I didn't bother going in any other cell phone case stores because I didn't want to go home with just several cell phone cases. It's sad that Pacific Mall isn't what it used to be. I remember there even used to be more stores that sold dried food and herbal medicine, now I only saw like one or two. I'm hoping it's just like this now because cell phone cases are trendy and that it will get better soon."}
{"text":"iPhone screen replace 50$. Can't be beat. Front and back 60$. Cash-no-tax is the name of the game up here."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall.......  It is hard to believe I never bought anything from any of the stores here.   I don't buy bootlegged DVDs. I don't buy fake sun glasses. I don't buy clothes(none of them really fit me because they are all too small..sigh).  I don't like the crowd during weekend. I cannot stand walking around in rolls and rolls of stores selling similar things.  The only place I really enjoy here is the Golden Regency restaurant for dim sum upstairs. I came on weekedays before 11AM to take advantages of the morning specials and of course there's no problem with parking.  Please stay away during public holidays when everything else are closed! This place can be a zoo.... worse than a zoo...  I just don't understand why holidays have to involve going to a mall and shop?"}
{"text":"I love you, Pacific Mall.  I love you because you assure me that it's OK to love Hello Kitty and spend all your money at machines trying to get dangly bell charms for your cell phone. It's normal to want bubble tea more than any soft drink, and it's fine if you want to eat dim sum for every meal of the day.  I do not love you because all your storefronts look identical, and I have no sense of direction. I do not love that all the clothing stores look the same inside so I can't remember which ones I've been in.  But even the parts I don't love, I still love. I love that I can find knock-offs of EVERYTHING here for incredibly cheap. Not as cheap as China obviously, but this place reigns as one of the best places to buy a really good LeSportSac knock-off for under $30 (Who can justify $200 for a nylon bag??! I can't.). Plus they have $15 basic cardigans that I have in every colour because they're THAT good.  If you're coming to visit Pacific Mall, plan a whole day for it -- they're open every day of the year (including Christmas) and they have everything contained within the mall to entertain you. Hell, they even have a tattoo parlour, an arcade, some restaurants and a couple hair salons if you want to get more done than just shopping. As for getting there, they have a huge parking lot which fills up quickly but moves around a lot. After a few circles, you'll find a spot. And if you're taking transit, go to Kennedy Station and take the 43 bus all the way North. Get off at the last stop and enter Canada's answer to the Asian mall.  This was THE place for pirated DVDs, but word on the street is that recently an undercover cop has been stationed to scour the mall at all times, scaring all the stores out of business. I am deeply saddened. Nowhere else could you get 10 seasons of television in DVD quality for $40.  We'll see what Pacific Mall is like without DVD heaven. My bet is that it'll still be awesome, because it's basically China transported on the border of Toronto, and who doesn't like to go to another country for a day?"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place in so long. So weird because I live like a 25min walk away ???! Anyway I missed it a lot because of all the stuff there. Like it's really a good place to just look and admire stuff you can't afford (bc everything is overpriced) I ate at the Korean Japanese take-out place upstairs with the bento boxes and had Chatime. It was great. Me and my friend were looking for rings but the ones we found were either overly fancy (some of them looked like mini colourful shields for your finger) or they looked like a wedding ring. No thanks. We went to Market Village after to One's and I just love that store. Great for house supplies and more cute stuff. So yeah! Great day, great time, we will be coming back! For food! (Probably)."}
{"text":"Being asian myself.. I spent a great percentage of my time in Pacific Mall. When I was in middle school, no driver license and bus was my only transit, Pacific Mall was my home.   Bascially, its just a mall full of chinese stores. Clothing, Bubble Tea Shop, DVD shops (fake or real? God knows...eh? ), K place, arcade and loads restaurants.   Overall experience is quite normal... no excitment, no specials. I wouldnt really want to spend time there if I dont have a specific thing I am looking for."}
{"text":"PMALL is my hood!!! It's the only giant Asian mall you will find in GTA or even Ontario. It's really one of kind around this area. The little stores remind me of some of the mall areas in China. But it would make sense because everyone here is pretty much from there and the business style gets transferred here. Weekend gets overly crowded and finding a parking spot is a nightmare.   You can find anything here from hair salons, clothe shops, food, manicure, tons of trinkets and electronic repairs, Korean beauty make up stores, all which are owned by Asians. It's not sketch and people do business here well. It's a fun place to explore if you're bored of normal malls like Eaton centre and Yorkdale, of course you won't find many brand name shops here.  Throughout the past years there has been an exponential growth of shops selling phone accessories, there's an aisle on the end just dedicated to it. Many might think it's cheap or it's a good deal here for accessories (or even anything else), but be aware it's pretty expensive for the quality they are offering.   There's a food court on the second floor that has many different kinds of Asian foods, and A LOT of bubble tea shops. Many of which I don't like because they use a lot of powder and sugar. Beside PMALL is another mall called market village that has an even larger food court and more variety (used to has McDonald's). There's a giant fish store there too."}
{"text":"This mall practically raised me. A few of my favourite food stalls had closed down over the years, some with stood the test of time.    Tung Tung Dan Quen King Ltd  Good handmade egg rolls ($4)! You can always find buy one get one free egg waffle coupons from Chinese magazines.  Tang's Co Tang's Co also sells egg waffle. Highly recommend ice-cream sandwich ($4.50, I think) with your choice of honey dew, green tea, sesame or durian ice cream (if you dare!)!  Ding Dong Grocery Great place for Asian snacks! Try grilled squid or vegetarian BBQ chicken!  The cheapest accessories place in the whole mall is in the basement, parking-lot level. You can find the latest and the greatest Asian Accessories Sensation from the store!   Don't forget to get fish balls and beef balls from Heritage Village before leaving P-mall!"}
{"text":"Ah the venerable Pacific Mall.  I remember visiting this place several times over the years on various outings to Toronto.  Last trip was at least 6-7 years ago, so when I made a small family road trip to Toronto I was quite curious how things have changed.   Amongst the first floor store, noticeably it seems like every 3rd or 4th store is some sort of cellphone store; either service, repair, or accessories.  There are a lot of juice, tea, bubble tea, and drink places on the first floor too.  However, the other stores didn't seem to contain the unique items I remembered in my younger days, seeming to lack those items which one can remember you could only get in an Asian market.  Nowadays, you can just go to Amazon!   The 2nd floor is much more interesting IMO as the various food stands can be more exciting.  There was Hong Kong cakes, Filipino waffles, a stand strictly dedicated to skewered BBQ meats, Taiwanese, Shanghai, Szechuan, Cantonese, and I'm sure others which I missed.   If you've never been to Pacific Mall, by all means have a visit as it will be pretty cool and a new experience, but for people that have been here before.........well it's starting to get a bit stale."}
{"text":"I dread going to Pacific Mall and it's really not that great if you ask me. There is definitely a tonne of Chinese shops selling a variety of stuff but there are also like 20 shops selling the same things. OK, maybe not twenty but there's a lot.   As far as window shopping is concern, there's really nothing much to see there. The fashion stores are very Asian oriented, not your regular Canadian mall kinda clothing. Personally, it's not my cup of tea. There are shops selling pots and pans, Asian gifts, Asian herbs, cell phones, etc. They call this little Hong Kong but if this is HK, I wouldn't want to go, to be honest (I've been there myself and it's way better of course).  The food court is pretty decent. They have a variety to choose from although not all of them are good. The parking lot is pretty big but there's never enough space especially during the weekend and holidays. I have no idea what's so great about this place. Parking are so scarce that people actually wait in the parking lot, ready to pounce at the first available spot. Seriously? Also, beware, the drivers are extremely RUDE. If there's anything that stops me from going, it's the parking.   Avoid at all cost. You can buy the same stuff from Chinatown or the surrounding areas in Markham. It's a Chinatown in itself anyways. Plus, you get better deals minus all the parking hassle."}
{"text":"As others have said, PMall is no longer the place it was a decade ago, and you're likely to be disappointed if you visit it today expecting it to be the same as it was when you were a teenager. It's still a fun day trip, though, especially if you're coming for food. But in terms of shopping, there's very little variety in the shops that are left: it's mostly beauty supplies, apparel, and stores whose stock is 80% phone cases. The DVD, book, electronics, and anime/toy stores you remember from your childhood have all long since shuttered."}
{"text":"Ugly and disorganized sums it up. It's fine if you are going for something specific, but it isn't a place to enjoy walking around."}
{"text":"I must be missing something wonderful about this mall... Dirty, old, run down. Stores are overly packed with junk. I'm sure there must be a diamond in the rough but I don't see it... I'll have to try it again."}
{"text":"Although Pacific mall has many things to offer (many stores, food stands, and dress shops etc), I avoid coming here. It's always a big headache with traffic and parking. If you do want to come here, I suggest coming on a weekday. I avoid this mall on weekends. Parking is a nightmare!!! I do like the one dress shop in the mall where I got customized bridesmaid dresses for a very reasonable price. You get to pick the style, colour and fabric; they take down your measurements and have it made and shipped from China. The seamstress will do final fitting in the shop when your dress arrives."}
{"text":"How do you even begin to review a place like this? As everyone else has stated, parking here is chaotic, and drivers do not follow basic road rules. By wary whether you're in the car or walking.   Pacific Mall (locally known as Pmall) is the place to go if you have nothing to do but wander for a couple of hours. There are endless stores for bubble tea (multiple shops for the same company too), phone cases, etc. It's the same thing over and over again, yet the crowd keeps coming. Easy place to find all your needs. Mind you, if you need to purchase an item or get your phone fixed, please visit multiple stores before getting it done. Someone told my friend the price to fix her screen was $120 when three other stores down the hall charged only $60! Luckily, I'm a stingy ho and made her triple check before she got her phone fixed.  In my opinion, other than the endless options for just things, the best part about Pmall is the food. There are many different options in the area - from little stalls in the food court to actual restaurants. Most of them are reasonably priced and very delicious.   Yeah, the place isn't the cleanest and service can't be scant (especially if you don't speak Mandarin/Cantonese), but if you wanted an actual mall, then what are you doing here?"}
{"text":"My 100th review goes out to my boi P-mall.   Growing up in the area, you would be a noob if you didn't know that this mall has 15 bbt stores and are right beside each other with 50 cellphone case stores aisle by aisle accompanied by 20 beauty stores that basically sell the same stuff. I remember the times when Video tapes and DVDs were still a thing. There were 5-10 stores that sold bootleg movies and ever so often you'd hear that Pmall got raided again by the authorities and a couple would shut down, to then pop back up later a few weeks after.   Despite their problems, such as horrible parking, stalkerish sales people, over crowdedness sometimes, Pmall is still my go to for face masks, sometimes phone cases, screen protectors, and anything that's pretty much made from China. They are usually the least expensive and can get it right now rather then buying it on eBay for cheaper and waiting for 2 months. I also love dat $2 store in the basement.   4/5."}
{"text":"P-Mall is an Asian mall.  Be prepared to deal with parking lot craziness if you want to drive there during the weekends.   It's a large mall with lots of little shops.   Cell phone accessory shops and bubble tea places are prevalent in the mall.  Be prepared to bargain.  And also ask about their refund policy.  Upstairs you can find different eateries.  Also there's  a playdium where you can let your inner child unleashed.   It's a fun mall to hang out from time to time, and definitely a way for me to feel like i am in Asia again."}
{"text":"Pacific mall, who hasn't been here? Honestly. This use to be my go to for bootleg DVDs and Bubbletease. The now non-existent arcade upstairs, yup, I'm old.   With a parking lot reminiscent to rush hour in China, parking can be a task in its own. As Kris U mentioned, this parking lot can be compared to the Bermuda Triangle. This is absolutely no place for an amateur driver (because it's full of amateur drivers). Get it? Good.   Moving along. Presuming you've never been to pacific mall before, you will enter via one of the 19 entrances and be absolutely sucker punched in the face with an overwhelming smell of noodles, bubbletea, waffles and dim sum. But it does become tolerable after a few seconds.   Browsing around the mall, you will find that their are several types of businesses, such as the clothing stores, imported food stores and about 3000 cell phone case stores. Some legit, some not so much. BUT who doesn't love a good deal right?   The place is pretty clean, I always see janitors walking around and cleaning. Security is everywhere too, mostly around centre court. Upstairs is food food and food. Some other shops upstairs as well.   As a few other users of Yelp have mentioned, some shops can be extremely, blatantly racist. I've experienced it several times, so my Asian buddy now accompanies me every time I go. Call me a liar if you'd like, but I've saved hundred'$ of dollars with him standing beside me negotiating in Cantonese. Also bring cash. You may as well write down your banking information on a piece of paper with your pin if you decide to use plastic here.   Anyways, not what it use to be. A lot of the fake stuff isn't as easily accessible anymore, bootleg DVDs are a thing of the past.. There's a couple automotive stores, bubble tea and easily a million cell phone cases. Besides that and the decent food court, there really isn't much left of this gigantic mall.   2/5 for me!"}
{"text":"I brought my friends from Edmonton here to kill some time. I don't think they have anything like this and quite enjoyed the mall. They seemed to especially like the food court upstairs with all the various snacks available. It was different window shopping with people from out of town and seeing the mall through their eyes."}
{"text":"You just have to visit this place. An amazing amount of randomness and silly things... From inflatable giant Hello Kitty dolls to hubcaps and awesome bean pastries. A fun 2 hours can be had here."}
{"text":"I have no idea how anybody makes any money here!  Competition is stiff and I guess taking cash helps as the underground economy here must be a world in itself. Do you really need a dozen+ optical places with even more cell phone places?  And how many juice joints do you need?  One at every corner?  It's not Starbucks in Seattle!!!! From what I understand, many of the places are owned by the same peeps and they let you think you are doing your shopping best at getting deals. None the less, if you need something - PMALLs got it!  Or they will find it for you - Cash! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Pacific Mall is a Hong Kong FOB's wet dream come true in North America (well Canada really). It is arguably the largest Hong Kong/China style Asian shopping mall I have ever seen on the continent (although I'm sure post 2003 there are fierce competitors in Ontario province vying for the title).  The Chinese name is Tai Koo Guong Cheung, and the name Tai Koo is arguably lifted from Tai Koo Shing in Hong Kong (that also sports one of the first biggest shopping malls in the early to mid 1980s in Hong Kong on the island itself).   The complex or compound rather, is impressively huge, sporting easily space for 500 small businesses. If you have ever been to Japan, Taiwan, or Hong Kong, you may have stepped into these smaller multi story shopping arcades where the average retail store space is much smaller than a 1 bedroom studio. Now imagine 500 of these wall to wall, each selling a product or a service (or snack/food drink) and scattered across a very large building with a gigantic mall sized multi story parking lot, and you pretty much have Pacific Mall.  Most of the vendor offerings come imported from China and/or Hong Kong, and chances are you will find competing vendors offering similar if not identical items, so it will pay to window shop and walk around for the best price. I don't doubt that some items are shall we say counterfeit or bootleg (e.g. DVD movies or software) so if it looks cheaper than an official import, then that is why. I am also willing to bet that the vendor list http://www.pacificmalltoronto.com/directory.html is already out of date. Businesses come and go very quickly in these parts and I'm sure what you saw 6 months ago might not be there anymore (what can I say, HK and Chinese peep$ work in cut throat pace$).  From 2003 this was the kind of variety of warez, products, services offered:  - real estate agency (former gossipy bitchy friend & high school classmate of mom's ran the joint, probably not around anymore)  - shops selling dried sundries (sour plum candies and the ilk)  - chinese herb shops that also sell dried $eafood like $hark'$ fin and dried $callop$ and abalone  - tapioca milk tea type drink stalls  - the latest home console electronic gadgets  - Chinese pop music and movie CD/DVD stores (check for the DVDs priced lower than CDN$10 and shady looking DVD case artwork to ID them as \"China\" DVD-9 imports/non official pressings). Arguably you will find Chinese subtitled or dubbed animation too.  - clothing stores (some are branded, some are not). Be a true AZN and try to bargain the price down.   - probably some hair salons  - cutesy gadgets, plush toys, decorations any local AZN would need for vanity purposes (including their cars). Need some cutesy kiddie character air freshener or good luck charm dangling from your rear view mirror? Or perhaps some thug ass car mod that makes your car look like Knight Rider's KITT? I don't doubt there are import motors accessories type shops here or nearby.  - stalls or shops selling retro style street food snacks (huge plus)  On the upper level of Pacific Mall, you will find the food court, and based on the last visit in 2003, a coin-op arcade (a must for the local AZN mall rats and thug ass wannabe's with their rice rocket$, but beware some of these kid$ you cannot F around with as they know people)  Also on this upper level is Pacific Heritage Town, which probably deserves its own listing (and probably is already listed), where they recreate (or try to) a market from the old days, but the concept ends up being more interesting than reality. A good effort nonetheless locally.  If you be da shiznit AZN, then you will probably try to spend every waking hour here (even for the AZNs visiting from out of town). For those who have been there, done that, one trip or visit is really all you need and then Pacific Mall or Tai Koo, is no longer a novelty.  Case in point, Pacific Mall's neighbor, Market Village, used to be THE hanging place for the AZNs 13 years ago. But now it is just a shadow of its former self, as the Pacific Mall structure makes MV look like a dwarf."}
{"text":"SHOP AROUND! That's my biggest advice. There are so many little stores inside, but they all sell relatively the same things. Be sure to walk around and gauge the prices before purchasing from the first store you see. Also, haggle! The asian store owners are desperate to sell, so if you haggle, you most likely will get what you want :) Be aware that all the \"designer\" things are knockoffs but for the non designer items, it is totally worth the price! Lots of cheap food and bubble tea drinks located throughout the mall."}
{"text":"This place was really cool. I loved all the clothing and accessories. The fashion items were beautiful. I wish I could have bought more, however, the prices on most items were WAYYYY OVERPRICED. I know they are probably imported fashion, but still, the materials used are not even worth the price. I love how cute they look. =/ I only bought one dress for $40 (US Dollar) and it's so cute! But I wanted to buy many other things too. Also, the bubble tea places don't accept cards! You need cash! If I was made of money, maybe I would buy these clothes, movies, plushies, and accessories... but for now, I think I'll stick to getting a deal, not a rip off. =/"}
{"text":"What are you looking for? plan to stay at this mall for a very very very long timeeeeee.  Glasses, Sunglasses, nick nacks, food, whatever you can think of, it will be here.  I love spending time walking around, there are a lot of little \"hall ways\".  You can definitely do window shopping, actual shopping and just walk around!!"}
