{"text":"If you like thai food then this place is the must to visit. The price is really good and there portion is huge too. I got the lunch special with 2 meat/veg and 1 rice/noodle. I couldnt finished it bcuz the portion was huge and it comes with the side of one spring roll or soup(ur choice)!!! I will go there again and again..

About the service, I cant say anything because I had a take out. But the lady who served me had a smile on her face. She looked calm and very welcoming! :)"}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood restaurant, and the best Thai food I've had in Toronto!  The food always tastes amazing... vegetables are always so fresh and they use a great variety.  We usually order the red curry with vegetables or the spicy eggplant. The coconut chicken soup is great too,   and last time we were there we tried the sampler platter.  Highly recommend!  For awhile there we were going once a week!  I don't know why people would go to the yucky thai place up on Yonge when this is just around the corner!"}
{"text":"This is a great, low key Thai restaurant. Friendly and speedy service. Very good pad Thai, veggie dishes, and fantastic soups. That's all I've tried so far. This place is great to have in the Yonge-St.Clair area - will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"For the area, this is definitely one of the better Thai places. I placed an order for take out and it was ready quickly (about 10 minutes waiting). Thai fried rice is one of our go-to's, so I tried the crab fried rice - it was a bit dry and I ended up adding soy sauce and sesame oil to it to try to rescue it. The Thai beef was delicious, but really greasy. We will probably be back for a decent dinner on busy nights, but it isn't the best Thai food I've had."}
{"text":"Have been eating here since the day they opened!
AWESOME FOOD EVERY SINGLE TIME!
Take out at lunch, or sit in on an evening, their food is ALWAYS fresh. I don't know how they do it, but I've taken nearly every friend and family member to this place. So delicious. Their green curry and basil dishes are to die for.  Prices are fabulous for the quality and totally affordable regardless! 5 STARS all the way!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff. I like most everything on their menu. My favourites are Grilled chicken(spicy for me), red curry chicken and the barbecue chicken they serve for lunch! 

Lunch has combos as well as À la carte while dinner is À la carte only. There are no desserts in the menu. I wish they had some.

Filling portions, great taste. I go here once a week at least."}
{"text":"I have come here once in awhile for lunch -- it's always just average.

Whenever I walk past this place, it stinks. I went today on a whim because I was hungry and they offer a good lunch special $6.00 for 1 rice dish and 1 meat dish. I got the pad thai and the BBQ chicken. It was just absolutely horrid!! I took a couple of bites and threw it out. The noodles were so dry and tasteless and the BBQ chicken tasted chemically? msg maybe? 

It was just awful. This is the last time I'll be coming here."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the positive reviews for this place. I mean, the reviews are what initially tempted me to go here. I love Thai food. I love cheap food. Seemed like a win-win. ALAS...no.

Yes, this place is cheap. $6 will get you a small styrofoam container (they call this \"medium\" size) filled with two items of your choosing. A noodle/rice dish and a protein. I went with pad thai with lemongrass chicken. The \"pad thai\" was literally just rice noodles with a sauce that tastes 100% like Heinz ketchup. No bean sprouts, no egg, no tofu, no peanuts, nothing. There was nothing in it except rice noodles and ketchup. I'm sorry, but since when is that considered pad thai?
The lemongrass chicken was a large helping of onion chunks and carrots with some small, dry pieces of chicken that mostly tasted like disappointment and the giant chunks of onions they garnished. 

All in all, the food here sucks. This area has crappy food in general, so I was hopeful that this place would have food that was at least somewhat tasty. But sadly, it did not. 
Now that I've actually eaten there, the glowing reviews are even more puzzling to me. Have all the people giving this place 5 stars never had Thai food anywhere else?"}
{"text":"Good lunch selection. Authentic Thai food.
Owned and operated by Thai family.
On lunch time, you can choose items from the hot table buffet or order from the menu (more costly)
Spicy chicken and spicy noodle are always a tasty lunch combo.
$6 tax incl. for medium, 1 carbs (noodle, fried rice, steam rice) with 1 meat / veg or half and half.
$8.50 tax incl. for large, 2 carbs with 2 meats / vegs + sweet $ sour soup or spring roll.
Sometimes they will give you a smaller portion especially when there are a lot of customers.."}
{"text":"For a tiny little thai resturant, the portions are very big! I think most people have reviewed the lunch special which is very good value but I came here for dinner which was a little bit more expensive. We ordered the pad thai and the green curry with seafood. The curry was too runny and the veggies were too soft. The pad thai was good though. I would probably only come back here to get the lunch special because it's such good value. (in other words, don't come here for dinner - not worth)"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from this place as well as been here with friends.  Service is friendly and prompt. They were flexible with seating and our baby. The decor is neat and tidy. The food itself is delicious and appears to be authentic Thai. Prices are very reasonable. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Came here at 830 for a bowl of the coconut milk and chicken soup. Was very filling. My friend swears by the green curry. Worth checking out"}
{"text":"If I worked closer to this restaurant, I'd probably want to go everyday!  But when I'm visiting the boyfriend or I'm on my way to work and have extra time to spare, I'll visit New Thai.  It's a small restaurant, but they have tradition Thai decor which makes it very homey and the people that work here are also very friendly and welcoming, which is an bonus.  The restaurant always has lunch specials that have a small or a large combo.  All at a reasonable price for the amount of food you get.  I usually get the large combo with BBQ Chicken and Spicy Chicken with vegetables and Pad Thai, since I'm sharing with the boyfriend or I just love the food that I want everything on the menu!  The large combo comes with either a spring roll or a hot & sour soup.  Both are delicious.  Make sure during peak lunch hours, you go there early because there's always a line up!  The food is as close as I will get to authentic Thai food, other than the homemade food from the boyfriend's family.  Just thinking about the food makes me hungry.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed and the food will leave you stuffed, wanting more and most of all addicted to Thai food!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians / vegans beware: everything on the menu is made with fish sauce. I am sure the dishes are tasty (hence the 3-stars as I trust fellow Yelpers) but the server treated us quite poorly when we asked if they have anything without fish sauce and was not even interested in preparing something for us."}
{"text":"This is basically comparable to a food court restaurant that has their food already prepared and the servers have their serving spoons in hand waiting for your instructions on what size of styrofoam carton to put your food in.

The difference is, they are in their own restaurant and do not have to share their tables with any other food counter.

The food itself is average for the most part but you won't leave disappointed nor still hungry.  You just won't be overwhelmed in my opinion. They also have a larger selection of Thai food items to choose from so you may want to go a few times to figure out what you like best.

You probably won't pay more than $10 and if you're short on time, they are quick, even with lineups."}
{"text":"So I just found a pretty good Thai place near work. They have a steam table and do a small combo for $5.50 with one rice/pad thai/noodle and one meat entree. You can also get a large size for 8 or so bucks which is like 3 entrees. A lot of food!

Today I got the spicy noodles and the mango chicken. I was surprised  by how fresh and clean it all tasted. It wasn't greasy or stale tasting, which you sometimes find with those take-out options. A pleasant surprise!

I did take-out but there are a good amount of tables too. You just go up to the counter and order, and you can buy off the menu too. I was just sort-of in a rush today so ordered from what was already there. If that was pretty good, I would expect the cooked to order food would be even better. I'll have to check it out another time."}
{"text":"potion size is fantastic.kind service 
calamari fries is good as appetizer.
pad tai is also good! but i felt ketchup taste.
don't add ketchup in pad thai.
 
You can enjoy thai beer too!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. So many choices of food combos. Great tasting and really good value. People there are really nice too!  Best Thai place in the area for lunch!"}
{"text":"New Thai Restaurant is a place I go to on a regular basis for lunch. Its a small place that can get very crowded at lunch. Its a nice place to sit down and eat or take out is quick if you are on the run.They have great lunch specials that range from $5 to $10. Some selections you can choose from: Pad Thai, Rice, Fried Rice, Sticky Rice, BBQ Chicken, Peanut Chicken, Cashew Chicken, and some other beef dishes. Although this is not the best Thai Food ever. (Probably because I have experienced home made authentic Thai Food) It still is pretty good and more authentic than some Chinese ran Thai restaurants. I know they are more authentic because they are speaking Laotian (Laos - Country beside Thailand). A cheap price and good quality food, this is what keeps be coming back. Also the people working there are extremely friendly. The atmosphere is very authentic with their elephant portraits and their South Eastern looking tables. (You have to go there to understand what I am talking about). I highly recommend this place if you like Thai Food. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"While visit family in the area, we stopped by here for dinner.

The food is very good and the prices are great.
Seating inside is comfortable but there is an outdoor seating area also.
We ordered the food as takeout and just sat outside enjoying the pleasant evening.

Pad See Yu- delicious, great mix of spice noodle and vegetables. Rate 4/5.

Parking is not easy in this area and they don't open on Sat. or Sunday."}
{"text":"Long due review. 
I have been going to New Thai for last 4 years. One of my favourite Thai restaurant in the city. 

Authentic Thai food made by real Thai chief and owners
Their mango Salad is off the hook! Different from any other place I have tried. 
You can't go wrong with any of the curry dishes. My fav is their fish red curry, thick very flavorful curry. 
Other dishes to highlight; Cashew chicken, spicy chicken, BBQ chicken.
Their pad thai is so so.

They also have pretty good lunch special during lunch time on weekdays.
Food court style, small or large size that comes with either soup or spring roll. Not as good as their made to order dishes but way better then your run of the mills food court Thai food."}
{"text":"Love this place....it's a hidden gem. Food is always fresh and well-prepared and the service is very courteous. Extremely veg. friendly too."}
{"text":"I went after a while and was so disappointed. The service was good, but the thai curry was watery and bland. The fried rice was smelling of some terrible oil and had excess water too. Sigh."}
{"text":"This place serves very tasty and quality thai food. Seems to be very authentic. Everything I've ordered is so good. It's a little hidden gem. Take out options available. Best Thai food I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Small but very comfortable for dining in.
Have a lunch hot table with most of their tastiest options.
ALWAYS fresh! I have never seen a sad vegetable here EVER!
Been eating here since the week they opened; sometimes 3-4 times in a week.
Their Basil Tofu tastes and smells like the big luscious basil you find in your dish.
Their curries are delicious texture and taste.
Nice variety in the dishes.
Never get half a plate of filler onion :)"}
{"text":"Gross, disgusting the most horrendous food I have ever tasted. 

Stay the heck away from this place. 

I had ordered the Pad Thai its was dry, it smelled like old oil, the noodles were soggy, the chicken tough as leather, I wouldn't dare try the shrimp for fear of immediate death from food poising. 

I only ate about 4 bites and had to throw the rest out in the trash. I hope the racoons don't get sick. 

How the heck is this place even allowed to call themselves a Thai Restaurant? 

God. I think I need a lawyer to represent me for the this horrendous taste in my mouth!"}
