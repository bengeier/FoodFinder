{"text":"Enjoyed a sampling of their taco selection on the terrasse this week. The food was great, service was courteous but a little disorganized. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Four of us had their Sunday brunch menu and each dish was delicious. Wonderful service. Interesting non-alcoholic drinks. Comfortable yet upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered a 12 inch burrito and it turned out to be more like an 8 inch burrito. False advertising! 

The burrito was too salty and also had mushrooms which were not advertised. 

There was only a small cup of salsa to go along with the chips. Anyone could have finished that amount of salsa with exactly 5 chips.

 I'm extremely unhappy with the food I received."}

On the night of February 27th 2018, me and my friends went out for food and drinks at borracho.
It was my second time there, I came back with people after my pleasent first experience. We ordered the taco tasting twice and it was delicious with some pina coladas and one of their signature cocktail that was perfectly mixed. My issue is with there customer service, and from what I remember is essential to a good a experience.
Nobody greeted us at the door we had to find our own table, waited 20 minutes before I could stop a server for an order. Food and drink came relatively quick considering how busy it was. In restaurants it is essential to greet your customer and most importantly take their order...
 that's how you make money..
Right before leaving my friend ordered shots at the bar for us. Went to the bathroom and came back to no drinks so decided to leave because it was taking too long. The server proceed to chase him out of the restaurant yelling \"thief\" and \"liar\" thinking that he had the drinks and not paid for them. What happened is the server left the drinks on the bar and someone else took them. As a server it's your responsibility to SERVE the drink tot he customer directly. My friend is in no way responsible to pay for these drinks even though he ordered them.
The server chased him outside grabbing and yelling at him, starting a scene outside attracting other low life customer of this poor establishment, who wanted to join the altercation. 
I decided to pay for the bill to avoid any problems, it's was only 20$.
The server who claimed to be owner should of disregard the whole considering I had already left a hefty tip and after offering to cover he should of done something for me. Not only starting a physical altercation he has no concept of how to deal with customer. 
I'm  very disappointed in how the owners handle things considering how new the business is and how hard it is to succeed in the city. 
It is essential to respect you clients,especially return customer in the industry. 
Regretfully, I will not come back. You've lost business for a 20$ bill."}
{"text":"Cute decor, friendly waiter, exhaustive menu. Everything was so flavourful. Waiting time was a bit long but it was so worth it. The prices are fair. So sad we were in a hurry and couldn't stay for dessert because these churros spoke to me."}

I read the negative reviews for this place, but seriously...that wasn't enough to deter me from the possibility of finding good Mexican food in Canada. 

I'm happy to report that we had a great experience here. We stopped in around 2:00 pm after a vigorous hike from our hotel up Mount Royal and back. 

We were seated immediately and ordered a pitcher of red sangria. It was tasty and not too sweet which hubby was happy about, but it cost $45. Wow, a bit pricey. Most of the pitchers of drinks were. This will account for the loss of a single star.

We both called \"sharesies\" and split chips and guacamole and a taco flight.

The chips were house made, NOT bagged crap and the guacamole with pico de gallo on the side was fresh & delicious and reminiscent of the authentic Mexican food we've had in the past. The taco flight was great! It came with 6 tacos, one of each type of meat (on proper corn tortillas) and each one a unique flavour. 

The fellow serving us was very good and took care of us without being too \"in your face\". 

I really enjoyed my lunch and if we lived here we'd definitely be back."}

Good service. Pretty cool event on tuesdays,they have a 2.50 taco night with techno music from 6pm
Their food though not so good.i tried 6 different kinds and only like 1 and half of them. The meats were cold and dry and it just was lacking in taste. The one with the fish was covered with a sort of spicy mayo sauce wihich was empowering the taste of the fish.The only Descent one was the chicken.

Would have been pissed if i paid full price for these tacos."}
