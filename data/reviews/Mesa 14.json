{"text":"Seriously tasty Mexican meal last night- we shared nachos to start, then for mains chicken fajitas and pulled pork burrito, and fried ice cream to finish.   The nachos were nice although a little dry, it would've been nice to have some dips or something included. The \"traditional\" are corn chips (props for homemade) with a slightly spicy tomato topping with melted cheese and are tasty but I think we should have gone for more toppings.   The chicken fajitas were really great, not too huge but definitely enough to fill all of the tortillas (and me) up. The other half reports a tasty, if pretty spicy, burrito.   The ice cream was goooood (definitely go for caramel and raspberry- best sauces) although the batter had gone slightly chewy. 1 was enough to share, the portions are pretty big.   Service was okay, a little short at first but I think the waitress was just busy. The cocktails were great, would recommend the raspberry mojito- made with fresh raspberries!   All in all, would probably come back."}
{"text":"Cute little spot. Great drinks and food with quick service. Complimentary salsa and chips and $6 margaritas!!"}
{"text":"The Fajitas we ordered were good. We found the margaritas and daiquiri less than satisfactory. Service was slow and sloppy."}
{"text":"I completely agree with the previous review, except I am not a big fan of Burritos in general. I've gone there on a couple of occasions and really enjoyed their enchiladas (try the Bandera), Tacos and Quesadillas. Also, the drinks are very well made, especially their Mojitos and Margaritas. They have a very private lounge in the back room with a fireplace that was perfect when I went there with a group of co-workers. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We made a quick weekend visit to Montreal last weekend and after our train ran out of food (??!!) on a 5 hr ride leaving us with nothing for 12 hours...we needed FOOD!! We decided on Mexican and this restaurant was a block or two away. It was not particularly busy on a rainy Friday night, and we were seated immediately. We ordered nachos right away (no freebies here) and were served a tiny (in comparison to most) plate with a single layer of chips and some salsa and cheese. They were tasty, for sure, but probably one-third the size of the nachos you will get most places, and no sour cream, no guacamole, no nothing. My one companion had eaten a big lunch, so just had tacos after the nachos, as did I. They were also tasty but under-whelming at $8 for two tacos. My other son had something I can't recall, sorry, but also thought it was \"OK\". Our waitress was very nice, and the fried ice cream was delicious, I have to say. At $100+ for the above for three people I thought it was outrageously expensive, but that does seem to be Montreal downtown pricing. Two of us did have one alcoholic drink each as well."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch, but it's a solid place to get good portions for cheap, and quick! I think dinner prices are a bit high, but there's a M-F lunch special where you get a full sized meal for $9-10 (plus free chips and salsa). You can order, eat, and pay all in about 45-60 minutes -- perfect for those on an hour lunch break. I've had the enchiladas, and the taco salad and have been dreaming about these items ever since..."}
{"text":"What a great find! We stumbled upon this place and had an excellent dinner. The margarita was tasty and the food was great. The guacamole was just ok, but the Bandera Mexicana entre I had was delicious. It was three different enchiladas, all super spicy and yummy.  My son had a custom burrito (they were very nice to do this) and he said it was \"perfectly balanced\" between the ingredients.  A huge win for us. All good, super nice staff too!"}
{"text":"A fantastic Mexican restaurant right near downtown.  The flavors in the tacos were authentic.  The fajitas were very flavorful.  Very kid friendly in that they would take any dish and simplify it for a child's tastes."}
{"text":"Great experience!  Excellent food with an authentic flair.  Growing up on the border, I always seek out Mexican food places in the cities I visit to see the local interpretation of the fair..This place took me right back home!  Service was excellent and head of the kitchen, Tim, is a gracious host.  Make this stop a priority on your visit to Montreal's downtown area.  They have one of the best up amd coming tequila's behind the bar as well.  Get a margarita made with Tequila Avion and You will look at tequila in a new way."}
{"text":"I have been going there for years, and have never been disappointed. They serve good food in a very cozy, no-frills and comfortable environment. I've gone there with groups, and with dates, and enjoyed it. I work in the area and find it difficult to find good, interesting and decently priced food downtown. Thanks Mesa!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the city!! Great drinks, food and staff! Dont let the construction on Bishop deter you, pop in for a Dos Equis and some delicious tacos!!"}
{"text":"I had the jalapeño nachos and the chicken enchiladas and they were both really good. The nachos had enough cheese on every chip and it was just perfect. The service was great, my friend and I had a booth to ourselves. Great ambiance. Prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"Discovered this place when it got too cold to keep walking, and we were like \"well, let's just eat here!\"  Pleasantly surprised by the selection of tacos for the lunch special - it was a tough choice, but we ended up with some amazing tacos.  The place was pretty dead, so service was very fast and attentive."}
{"text":"This is a great out-of-the way Mexican place that is quieter and more upscale than the Carlos + pepe's scene on St Catherine.   The margaritas are decent, nachos are excellent.  I haven't tried more of their dishes, but I will definitely go back again. Cozy and warm, would be a great cold weather place, too."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, Mexican food. Decor is ok. Waitress kept making mistakes, but that was not the issue."}
{"text":"I will try and keep this review short and sweet.  Vegetarian fajitas were very flavorful, with plenty of vegetables for two to share. They provided four soft tortillas and brought out two more when requested. Sour cream, cheese, salsa and lettuce were provided for toppings.  Soft shell fish tacos were ordered and they had a strange spice to them, I really could not put my finger on it. The hubby was less impressed with them as well.  We also ordered guac and chips. We got a huge portion of guac, which was tasty but it only came with approx 10 chips placed out on a plate.  Service was attentive, but a tad awkward and unprofessional since we were seated near the bar and one associate had her bf there and they were touching and flirting throughout our meal.  Not the best place for a date, but we went, we tried it, and we probably wont be back."}
{"text":"We all loved the food a lot. Everything was just delicious and we ended up in being food coma because of over eating. Margaritas were strong and great too. This place definitely deserves 5 stars from us."}
{"text":"Experience un peu décevante nourriture similaire au restaurant tex-mex tel que carlos and pepe et 3 amigos sans plus on est loin de la nourriture traditionnelles mexicaine, ce qui ne me derange pas nécessairement quand c'est bien fait et se demarque , ce qui n'etait pas le cas. J'ai mon ami qui a prit les fajitas qui avais l'air très bonne mais je n'y ai pas goutté... le service était lent même tres lent pour une soirée ou il n'y avait pas beaucoup de personne, je pense quily avait peu être quatre table à servir. Pas mauvais mais rien de special d'autre restaurants dans le meme genre  font mieux n'y retourneras surement pas bientôt."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Thursday night, and I was a little put off by how empty it seemed. My apprehension rapidly turned to glee as the night progressed, though, and honestly I can't decide what I like best about this place.  Let's start with the food. I had the guacamole entree, served with corn chips for dipping. In a word: yum. The guac was fresh, chunky and had a really authentic, homemade feel to them. The corn chips were equally awesome. And then, my fajitas came.  Now, I've had fajitas many times before - and in general, they've been just okay. But these were awesome. I chose steak as the meat, and it was amazing, super flavourful and juicy. The vegetables were just as great; surprisingly, I even enjoyed the tortillas. Couldn't quite put my finger on why, but they tasted really unique and good as well. I also got a plate of cheese, guacamole and pico de gallo... standard with the meal I chose in any place, but again, the guacamole deserves special mention because it's so good.   The services was pretty great, too. It was quick, and our server was laid-back but attentive, which I think contributed to the overall casual feel of the establishment. The restaurant gives off a very cozy and unpretentious atmosphere, which I loved.  All in all, the food, service, and atmosphere was great. I'll definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"A letdown. The sample platter was fried, fried, fried... When I ask for a sample platter of your Mexican cuisine you need to impress me with mole, asado de boda, whatever.  A decent bar and friendly staff nonetheless make me think I erred in coming here to eat. It would be good for nachos after work with margaritas, if you're in your twenties and have never been to Mexico in your life. Otherwise, give this a pass"}
{"text":"Nice seats- I like booths, good for my bum :) - We went for lunch after final, we were all happy after test, wanted to drink and eat together.  One of my Colombian friend chose this place.  He said he ate many time here.  Food was good - not excellent, well I am from SF bay area, I miss all my Mexican friends, I miss my taquería in Redwood city... It is not fair me to judge and compare this restaurant to my California Mexican restaurants..   Very expensive Sapporo draft.  I don't know why I chose Sapporo since it's not great beer at all - Even when I was in Japan, I'd never drunken this one.. Oh well but there was only dos XX and another bad beer I don't want to drink.  Here Canada, Booze are sooooo expensive.  The pint of Sapporo was 8.50$ before tax - same as my burrito ....  I usually cook my Mexican food at home but this place is decent.  I might go with my hubby someday if we are happen to be in downtown...."}
{"text":"Here you go Bob and Jerid. Great Mexican food in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"This is some of the best mexican I've ever had, and definitely should be on your list to check out next time you're in Montreal.  A group of five of us went, between the appetizers and main courses we didn't have a single complaint.  Oh, and their home-made salsa was absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"We had a really nice meal here. Not our first choice tonight but a lot of restaurants have extended closings for Christmas week. Visiting from NY. In spite of that we had a really good night with parents and older kids. Drink selection is weak but food was above average and service was attentive and friendly. Genny was great server."}
{"text":"Ugh. The worst fish taco I've ever had.  The place itself is nice and comfy and the service was decent, but the food was seriously lacklustre. My dining companions seemed moderately satisfied with their food, but we were ridiculously hungry. The fish tacos were full of freezer-burned fish sticks and limp, bagged lettuce.  No thank you."}
{"text":"Mexican on a quiet terasse is exactly what we were hoping for and that's exactly what we got.  It's located right across the street from McKibbins, note they are re doing that part of the street so you have to cross over on the left side and walk back. I know sounds complicated but it's really not.  The place inside is very nice, lots of wood and has nice decor. The place wasn't very busy so we decided to sit outside and enjoy the summer air. The only sucky part was that there wasn't any view because half the street has construction. Defs a killer for their business this summer.  Decided to get one meal but the waiter informed me that if I don't like spice there isn't much to eat which was a bit of a bummer so I let the man pick for me. It was still spicy so I switched with my friend for his meal which was fantastic.  Service was okay  Food was okay  Prices weren't that cheap for what it is."}
{"text":"Pros: food average  Staff friendly Salsa good  Cons: expensive for quality Mole has chicken stock (non veggie) Margarita was weak"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Popped in shortly before they were closing but the service was still great! Mega friendly staff, huge range of choices on there menu and lots of vegetarian options! Not to mention a cute, trendy looking place!"}
{"text":"Pour une raison ou une autre, j'ai un bon ami qui aime bien venir au Mesa 14 pour le \"5 à 7\". Pour cette raison, je me retrouve ici régulièrement. Les margaritas sont convenables, l'atmosphère est agréable et le service est courtois. Avec quelques chips (nachos) et de la salsa (trop douce et un peu sucrée) c'est quand même agréable de passer un moment ici avant le souper."}
{"text":"I ordered the salada monterrey (grilled chicked on lettuce w/ cheese & tomatoes) and my friend ordered chicken nachos.  The salad was boring and bland in every way but the nachos were out of this world good.  I found lettuce that was slimy and rotten.  The waitress was  very nice and took it off the bill.  I would actually go back for the nachos, but avoid the salads."}
{"text":"Don't let the place confuse you. . There are few people, but the food is really good! The menu selection is also not huge.. but everything I tried was good. Just missing potato skins!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. I once worked in a Mexican restaurant in Mexico. However, Montreal doesn't have a great variety of Mexican restaurants. A friend of mine who studied at Concordia told me about this place and I immediately wanted to try it.   We went around 4PM for a large snack/early dinner. The place was empty so we had a very large table just for us. However, I'm sure that on Thursday night, the place is packed. The seats were very comfortable and the music was good.   We shared a plate of nachos and I had the chicken taquitos. Both are appetizers. The nachos were really delicious and spicy with the jalapenos peppers. There was plenty of cheese, salsa and cream cheese. Yummy.   There were 4 taquitos in my plate, about the size of cigars. They were good, but maybe a little dry. They came with a side of super spicy salsa and cream cheese. It was okay.   We shared the fried ice cream for dessert. They had a good selection of sauces. We chose chocolate. It was big, but just enough for the two of us.   My bill came about at $16 just for me. It was good, and much better than 3 amigos or Carlos & Pepes (whose salsa has strawberries in it, by the way).   I'll definitely go back. Next time, I'll try the pork burritos, which my friend has strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Great service, menu selections and food prep. Awesome salsa and the bartender knows how to mix margaritas!"}
{"text":"Hey... Why not just go to Taco Bell and save yourself 30$  I can't be bothered to make an effort on this one. SH!T!!!  Lousy Mexican. It's a downtown place designed to impress the Anglo crowd. Should be on the west island. You might as well go to taco bell and sneak in a corona. You'll ave the same culinary experience."}
{"text":"I came here with a party of about 15 for my sister's birthday. It was disappointing because the drink service was very slow. It really impacted the flow of the night and made everyone tired. We were there for over 3 hours so I should have had ATLEAST 3 drinks when I was there, and I had 2. My sister had to order 5 beers at a time to ensure people just had a drink in their hand. The food was okay - nothing bad, but nothing really great. Our server was very nice. It's your typical mexican restaurant vibe, but good for large parties in terms of space. We were upstairs."}
{"text":"To start off- the food was good. However, I am a celiac and was purposefully given BREAD on my plate of fish. I told the waitress from the beginning that I could not have gluten and was told that the chef would not adjust any dish for me. Fine, I opted for a naturally gluten free dish. But when the food was delivered- I was given flour tortillas on my plate and the waitress said everything else is gluten free but the chef decided not to take these off. That's basically like spitting in my food. Warning- if you have a food allergy DON'T EAT HERE"}
{"text":"I don't ask for much. I know there's a dearth of Mexican restaurants in Montreal.  Mesa 14 used to be great but it's honestly just tired.  The plates themselves are gross and need to be replaced.  They look 15 years old.  The food is blah to bland.  The menu is uninspiring and the same as it was almost a decade ago.  Nothing changes, ever... Vegetarian chilli has broccoli in it which is just weird as its big pieces of it as well.  The enchiladas looked and tasted rather sad.  Most of it is obviously just reheated.  Just skip it.  Putting a chill vibe on something doesn't mean the food quality or taste is there."}
{"text":"I've came here twice. Both times I've gotten the chicken enchiladas and it has yet to fail me. The bartender did not skip on the mojitos. My friend got the beef tacos and did not like them. It came with three soft shell tacos and he did not finish the third one."}
{"text":"I love this place- mostly cuz no one seems to know about it. Solid tacos, great atmosphere, great 5 a 7 with a totally non pretentious staff. The food is definitely better than 3 Amigos and Carlos and Pépés and it's a lot quieter.  I tend to pick off their 8$ taco menu and haven't been disappointed yet. I've seen some of their other meals and the portions are great and it smells amazing. I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great service. Nice deco. Good music not traditonnal mexicain stuff. Food was good but all meats were over cooked and dry. Too bad."}
{"text":"Food was not as good as the last time I went, however my Son loves this place so I went to make him happy.  Prices are reasonable, just nothing special."}
{"text":"One probably doesn't think of finding great Mexican food when in Montreal, but it was late and we were hungry so we rolled the dice and tried out Mesa 14. It looked trendy and modern from the outside and a step up from many of the other options on block and after dining there I can happily say  we were pleasantly surprised. It was pretty empty that cold night and we were seated downstairs near the bar in a very comfortable lounge setup near the bay window facing the street. The homemade guacamole and chips were a great starter, and almost all the enchiladas, burritos, and tacos could be ordered with either a vegetarian or fish option which was really cool.  I remember the meal as being very tasty and well spiced. It was actually better than 95% of the Mexican food I've had in New England, so give it up to Quebec and Montreal for coming through with a very pleasant surprise on our vacation/trip!"}
{"text":"Family and I went there for dinner.  Service was very attentive. Seated promptly upon arrival albeit not very busy at 730.  Place was large with nooks with booths and upstairs seating.   It is nicely decorated for a Mexican restaurant.  Not cheesy.    I got the vegetarian fajitas with Portabella mushrooms which was actually an excellent dish when I compare to other places that have vegetarian fajitas where it's zucchini, carrots and other non-fajita related vegetables.  Tortillas were ample soft and the condiments for the fajitas were adequate.    Kids got the taco dinner plate with black beans.  Like means were somewhat spicy for them other when I took a taste they were actually pretty good too.    Wife wasn't too impressed with it two cheese enchilada plate."}
{"text":"I can honestly write that Mesa 14 is mucho uno! The waitresses are superb! As well as the food, atmosphere; Mexican cuisine has a new life here! Recommended by Rochelle a friend of mine. Michael Elman"}
{"text":"Bien caché rue Bishop, ce bar-resto mexicain offre une expérience confortable et agréable pour un 5 à 7 entre amis.   Les margaritas étaient bons (en tout cas, bien meilleurs que ceux de Carlos et Pepe) et il y a un choix intéressant de tequilas si jamais vous avez envie d'un shooter. La serveuse était très gentille et efficace. Je n'ai pas essayé la nourriture, donc je ne peux pas émettre d'opinion là-dessus.  Petit truc: le jeudi, pour le 5 à 7, c'est 6,00$ les margaritas et il y a un rabais sur la bière. Profitez-en!"}
{"text":"If they didn't make a decent margarita,it would probably not get a 3 star review. Clean & cute with a low key decor. They don't have the music jacked up so high like other similar restaurants. The staff are hit or miss. Chips & salsa offered when you sit.  The salsa has a weird texture & is heavy on the tomato which makes it too acid. It needs some hot pepper & cilantro. My friend ordered the guacamole & chips,the portion of guac was great but only came with a few chips. Don't be stingy,chips are cheap.  The Monday & happy hour specials have margaritas for 6$ a piece & that's worth a gold star. As a side note,on the rocks with salt is the way to go,you'll thank me later! While the 2 tacos for 8$ is appealing be aware that you can't mix & match,both need to be the same,wan wan.  I was honestly disappointed with them except for the pescado,it's got to be the best taco I've had in Montreal since I've moved back from Texas. The 1$ extra for the avocado is a complete hack.I got 2 small slivers that equate to 1/16 of an avocado,lose a gold star. Don't be stingy.   Go for happy hour,treat yo'self to a few margaritas & fish tacos."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews I will have to disagree with most of you that where not satisfied as I am writing this 15 minutes after destroying a pulled pork burrito I have had pulled pork in the Texas and Missouri area of the united states and I must say that this pulled pork can sit in the best of the mid west even though it's from Montreal I highly recommend this place and don't listen the the people that spit that Tom foolery about this place my stars don't lie 5/5"}
{"text":"Ok food, but nothing overly special. The salsa is terrible! It tastes like bland tomato paste mixed with water in a dish. The chips were better, thin and crispy. The meat was seasoned well and the portions were good.   The service was ok. I was quite bothered by the server I saw in the bathroom who used the toilet, blew her nose, adjusted her serving towel, and left without washing her hands. I think that is basic hygiene that should be practiced at all times by all staff at a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place could be alright, but there's a real laziness that goes on that makes it pretty bad.  Firstly, it's downtown, so it has that hallmark downtown feeling of being modern, slightly vacuous, eurotrashy (not trying to insult) but still cozy. But that was okay and kind of expected.  Secondly, the server was really nice, doing her best to always be around.  What was really pretty subpar was the food and drinks. I am really easy to please with tex-mex food, I even make it at home. But, the margaritas were pretty bad. It is 100% cocktail mix, and extremely weak. My gf and I had to order an extra shot with every drink, which my gf never would contemplate but she even felt she needed to. It was suuuuper weak, like I wanted to order two shots actually to add, but thought that would be a bit ridiculous.  And then, the food was pretty bad, to be honest. I mean, there was nothing terrible, but it was as if they didn't even try. The nachos we had to start were all overcooked, and just very meh, and then our taco main courses, the beef in mine was so dry it just made me feel gross so I ate the tomato/lettuce/cheese etc only. My gf had fish tacos, and they were fish fingers like the same frozen packs we buy at the supermarket. She enjoyed it though, but come on, if you're gonna mark up your prices and sell yourself as a classier alternative to Burritoville etc, then you have to try a bit.  Also, each plate came with a MASSIVE serving of black bean, which was just so dry and gross they both looked like cowpies. So much we couldn't stop laughing let alone contemplating actually eating it. It was hard to swallow without wetting it with water or sour cream or something.  I've worked in kitchens and everything felt like it had just sat under the heating lamp for a long time. Also, our server was attentive, but everytime we asked for a napkin, for example, she just brought one tiny square, even though our hands were covered in taco juice haha. And then when we asked for more, like 3 times, we said could we have more than one? And she brought two. haha. She wasn't trying to be mean or anything but it was just weird and kind of funny.  We had a good night, but mostly because it was dinner for my bday coming up this weekend and we were in a good mood. And the issue is that, nothing in the actual ingredients or whatever is that bad, there's just a huge lack of care and attention to detail. And so it just has that hallmark, empty, vacuous, meh, downtown feel. You can tell the people that opened this place were really into it once upon a time, they wanted it to stand out, and they just kinda gave up or something.. it feels as if its just kinda been left unscrutinized for a long time.  There's much better options in Montreal, especially for the prices."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday 7ish.  Place wasn't that crowded yet, and felt intimate.  There is an upstairs and a downstairs.  The upstairs by the windows would be very pleasant on a breezy spring/fall day if they opened the windows.    Our waitress was nice, but didn't really seem like she was a \"pro.\"  Nothing against that, just noticed it.  The margaritas there were really good - not too strong, not over powered with the mix...just right.  Sangria could've tasted a bit better, but the pitcher was a normal sized pitcher and did its festive job.  Got the chorizo nachos and quesadillas for apps.  The nachos were quite good - really crunchy.  The quesadillas paled in comparison.  Steak fajitas were really good and there was plenty of it.  Make sure you ask for extra salsa, as they give you a small small amount.  Went all out and got dessert too.  The leche cake was ok, not too sweet.  I wish I got the apple pie a la mode.    It was about $40 per person."}
{"text":"After eating at Mesa 14 I can say I've had great Mexican food in Canada without laughing. I think the morning after I ate all the leftovers from our group. IT WAS AWESOME.   Waitstaff was awesome. Can't remember the guy who served us but he came out with us after."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner my first night in Montreal and it was just the kind of place I was looking for!   I think the best part about this restaurant  was the drinks ... the raspberry mojitos were incredible!   Loved their guac and chips and tacos! Very reasonably priced as well!"}
{"text":"Très déçue! Plus tôt ce jour-là, soleil oblige, je me retrouvai sur la terrasse du Cactus, rue Saint-Denis, accompagnée de ma charmante amie Chantal. Je n'ai que du bien à dire de ce moment. De retour à la maison, je voulus étendre ce moment plein sud jusqu'au soir, même esseulée. Aaaaaaahhhh!!! Dans l'engouement, rassérénez-vous! Me laissant influencer par l'aspect proximité, je me rendis au Mesa 14. Je ne m'éterniserai pas tel le crépuscule ces-temps-ci, mais j'irai plutôt droit au but: 1) je ne mange pas de pâté pour chat (\"burritos\" très secs au poulet broyé, absence d'une quelconque sauce ou autres liquides humectant la mixture), 2) riz sans personnalité, sec, coloré en rouge, assorti de quelques pois \"d'origine\" surgelée, 3) le français est-il permis à l'ouest? Impression générale: j'ai été catapultée très loin, en région francophobe, pour bouffer de la pâtée  pour chat!"}
{"text":"A quiet, charming interior - more upscale than your 3 amigos or Carlos, you can actually bring a date to this place and cozy up in their comfy banquets complete with pillows.  Drinks are awesome, very strong, real margaritas that do not taste like a premade mix. Food is expensive, seems more authentic than anything else I've had but it did not make me drool. Their enchiladas were too spicy, refried beans were a let down, portions are small. Seems like it would be better to order many items and share, tappas style. Tres leche cake was delicious.  All in all, food is decent, drinks and dessert at the best. It's pricy for what you're getting though."}
{"text":"I come here every time I am in Montreal. I feel it is decent Mexican food and I would come here again and I do. I have had the TJ Chile, enchiladas and Tacos DF. Those are my usuals. I recommend them all. Although the TJ chili is a little saucy. But combined with the house chips and salsa it makes a good combo. The raspberry mojito is,meh, nothing special. Recently  I went there on a Sunday around 7 p.m. and the ambiance is quiet.  You are able to get your own booth in your own little Nook if wanted. Go there enjoy yourself and have some good food."}
{"text":"Very good and fast service. Meal was excellent. They have vegetarian options. Waitresses were very attentive."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and fun!  Better than any Mexican restaurant we've tried in Albany and surrounding areas, Boston and Jersey.  The menu is extensive, service was chill and the area is vibrant.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Rounding up from 3.5 for the prompt, excellent, friendly service. Food was decent Mexican fare, no surprises. Nice ambiance, but the frozen margs were truly disappointing at $6 a pop on Margarita Night. I don't know if the salsa that came with the chips is normal for Canada, but it was really more of a mild picante sauce than a salsa, and a little off-putting to me."}
