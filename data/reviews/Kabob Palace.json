{"text":"Best Gyros anywhere! Great family run business. They are always friendly. I really love the homemade hot sauce they have. Wish I could buy a bottle to take home. Also, the seasoning on the fries adds such a great flavor, you don't need ketchup. Although the are really tasty dipped in that hot sauce."}
{"text":"Good food. Very consistent in taste.  Excellent buffet at lunch. Nice South indian variety in weekends buffet.  -1 star: Service can be improved. I do ToGo's much nowdays.  Try their chicken sheek kabab its good here."}
{"text":"They definitely did not attempt to set the mood with their decorating or lack thereof; however, the food was incredible. $20 paid for two very large gyros (lots of meat with great flavor), two orders of fries, two drinks, and some of the best hummus I've ever had. I'll be going back for more!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for many years (though as I now live in Tucson, it is sadly not often).    I have always felt welcomed and loved by the staff - it didn't take long for them to know my order by heart and recognize my voice on the phone when I called in my order ahead of time. It always makes a big impression when staff remember their customers and treat them well, and Kabob Palace has excelled at this.  The food is delicious. I have never had anything I disliked. Their hummus is decent. I always order a gyro dinner or a chicken shawarma sandwich for my main. The portions are large and well-priced. They also have awesome tea!  I usually get my food to go, but when I have stayed for a meal, I have had pleasant experiences. Sometimes it feels a little odd being the only white blonde girl in the place, but I never felt unwelcomed!  Anyway, I highly recommend Kabob Palace. It is certainly nothing fancy, but it's a great spot to grab a delicious lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Tasty, healthy, and a friendly staff! I stopped by from out of town on a whim and the chicken kabob was delicious!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. The food is 5 stars but the restaurant can use some work.  Our food came out in 10-15 minutes once ordered. My husband got the chicken kebab served with rice and salad. I got the lamb gyro. We ordered grape leaves but we did not get them. No big deal, we had plenty of food. The gyro is one of the best I've had. The bread was fresh, lamb flavorful, everything came together as a whole nicely. Chicken was juicy and spice well. The rice was a good pairing for the dish. Salad was refreshing and the hot sauce given to us was very good. My husband wished he could bring a bottle home with us.  I think we went on a bad night, I don't think they were expecting more guests. The person who first took our order asked a few times what we wanted and wanted us to point to the items in the menu. There was a language barrier, it seemed most of the people working there are not fluid in English but the main person who took care of us was very friendly.  When we arrived one of the workers was in the middle of evening prayer so we helped ourselves to a table. The restaurant is very bare, nothing on the sandstone color walls and nothing on the tables. It's very quiet with the main noise coming from a TV in the corner that was fading in and out.   This restaurant is not for everyone. The culture difference might be uncomfortable for some. Walking into evening prayer was a bit of a surprise and I noticed that one woman had on the traditional hijab. Nothing fancy about this space. However if you like homemade food I would defiantly recommend this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"7pm Saturday Night--My brother & I wanted great Mediterranean food. We looked up & found Kabob Palace a few miles away on 27th Ave off Northern. We walked in, the new owner, Ishmael, greeted us with menues. Too bad there were no other customers, because this is one of the BEST Hidden Gems in Phoenix!. Ishmael has cooked for 20 years, recently moved here from Albuquerque. He bought the restaurant a few months ago from previous owner, who ran it 14 years. My brother ordered the Gyro Plate ($9.99), and I ordered the Lamb Shank plate ($12.99). We were served a Hummus plate appetizer, with 2 falafels and pita bread. The Hummus was extremely Fresh tasting, homemade, and the falafels had a bit of sweetness to them, perfect texture and delicious. Both of these were far better tasting than found at most Middle Eastern or Greek restaurants. My Lamb Shank had great aroma, baked long enough that you could see the meat falling off the bone. It was absolutely delicious, on a plate of fresh basmati rice. As we finished dinner, a Middle Eastern couple walked in, and sat across the aisle from us. That couple ordered, and a few minutes later, Ishmael brought us a small dessert plate, unexpectedly. On it were 4 small phillo dough 'rolls' stuffed with a custard filling, and topped with a brown honey and crushed walnuts. It was just enough of a treat, not overbearing or sickly sweet. My brother never eats desserts, and OMG...he loved them. We lingered a while longer, then rose to pay the tab at the register. This wonderful, gourmet meal cost us a whopping $29 & change! We complimented Ishmael on his outstanding, flavorful cooking, introduced ourselves, and told him we look forward to returning soon. We found a great new fave spot--delicious and affordable. Note: the decor and ambience needs work, and is nothing to shout about.  But go for the quality cooking, and discover it for yourself!  -- Harv"}
{"text":"hit the Palace last week with the roomie - it's 7 pm - we're the only customers.  ok, it's the holidays, the economy sucks, blah blah blah.  Amazingly, after being seated, it takes 3 minutes for someone to take our drink order.  After ordering a water and soda, the server rolls her eyes - i sense it was because we didn't order more.  Order the kabob combo,  geez i don't even remember what else, the delay in taking the order, the delay in getting the food, i really can't remember what the food was like - fuck this place !"}
{"text":"My goal to find decent lunchplaces (near the lowest pit of hell I call the environs of the MetroCenter/my office) landed me here this past Thursday afternoon. I once ended up driving by this place months back simply because I was lost looking for Cafe Sarajevo but handn't been back until now.   I decided to finally check it out because the thought of Chipotle or Sizzler was making me dry heave. I pulled into the little strip mall, which seems to be Middle East central - a sit-down restaurant in the evenings (complete with ubiquitous belly dancer), a Middle Eastern market, etc. And this place.  I walked in and a really friendly guy took my order. Slammed with work though, I browsed the menu (kabobs, gyros, falafels, etc. etc.) and got a chicken shawerma sandwich to go. I was offerred to make it a combo meal with a fries and a drink but I declined - I'm not McD'ing my Middle Eastern lunch.   As I waited, I surveyed the scene. Pleasant enough inside - wooden tables, random Middle Eastern knicknacks on the shelves, faux bricks painted on the walls, whatnots. No music, but hey, it is what it is.  I got my sandwich and headed back to the office. And well, it was decent - not bad by any means, but not great by any means either. The chicken's flavor was extremely mild and there wasn't much of it amidst the lettuce and other goodies. That said, I still inhaled the sandwich in no time.  Now, a simple pita sandwich eaten within the confines of my cubicle isn't the best of gauges of a Middle Eastern restaurant, so I'll definitely have to go back sometime to try some of their kabob platters, but for you folks wandering around west Phoenix feeling condemned to eat Whataburger or Taco Smell, this place offers some respite from the generic norm."}
{"text":"Dropped by after church. We were told that the Sunday Buffet starts at 1PM. We were just 15 minutes early so we decided to wait it out and ordered Persian tea.  The food for the buffet started trickling out after 1 PM and the last dish came out at exactly 2:11 PM, approx 1.5 hrs when we arrived. The food was tasteless and the gentleman at the counter kept telling us everything will be out in 1 minute! I tried the meatballs but there seems to be egg shells in them! I could hear and taste the crunch! We still tried what they brought out, but for the money we paid ($8,95 per), I would have rather gone to Zaytoon's on Durango at Twain. This place is a sorry excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Gyros, Chicken Shawarma, and hummus. Good food, food prices."}
{"text":"It's a small place with good quality, traditional food.owner is is a really humble person.we ordered chicken kabob, lamb shwerma, falafel. All dishes were tasty."}
{"text":"Excellent if you got a craving some something different. Staff is extremely friendly, portions are well worth their price.  The Combination Platter is an excellent starter cant go wrong with it, and any of kebob dishes are winners.  The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the Samosa isn't exactly what i'm used to and sorry to say but a bit on the bland side."}
{"text":"Ishmael prepared the most succulent fresh chicken kabobs I've ever had. Definitely a repeat!"}
{"text":"The place is small and simple, the staff is very friendly, and the food is good and reasonably priced. I got the chicken shawarma dinner for lunch and a can of soda for less than $11.00. I would have taken half of the dinner home for dinner, but before I knew it, I had eaten most of it.   I thoroughly enjoyed it and I plan on returning in the near future."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best gyro and chicken shawarma wraps I've ever had in Phoenix! The yogurt sauce is perfect and the spices are delicious. The wraps are packed with food, and the fries have a delicious seasoning added (that isn't too salty).   The owner is very nice, we always feel very welcomed when we come in. I'm excited to see what the rest of their menu is like!   Essentially, here you will get delicious middle eastern food at a very low price. :)"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place is no longer there.  It's closed and for a true lover of Middle Eastern food - it was a great place for me to go so I'll give 5 stars in honor of its memory! :)  The food was amazing - I ordered from the menu but they had a killer buffet with an array of stews....and one of my favorite discoveries, Bouranee Baunjan!  Eggplant stewed with tomatos and peppers in sauce and yogurt.  I now make this myself as this place used a lot of oil in their dishes (maybe that's why it was so tasty).  I hope they've just moved and really haven't shut for good.  Vegas does not have a large selection of Middle Eastern restaurants."}
{"text":"I drove by randomly and caught the Kabob sign out of the corner of my eye. I was starving, but decided it would be worth waiting for the food to cook. And what can I say, it was the best decision of my life!   I ordered the mixed kabob (chicken and shami - minced meat). The shami kabob was spiced just right and the meat is Halal to boot. The guy actually orders the meat from California. The prices were perfect as well. You don't need to spend a lot of money to eat well and have a good time.  The Persian/Afghani staff were very welcoming.    Definitely, try this spot when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very controversial here from the reviews I've read.  I've eaten here years ago with no problems other than the restaurant is always quiet.  I'm glad they're still open...  Our office had lunch from here & ordered 9 that's right 9 different items so we could share:  lamb shwarma, mediterranean salad, kebab combo, falafel plate, chix salad,  sausage plate, greek salad & 2 other unidentifiable plates that we ate (everyone put their order in & we all ate smorgasbord style).  Although some commented that some of the plates looked \"strange/unfamiliar\"  all agreed it was all good.  Main standouts were the hummus, baba ganoush, ground beef meat kebaby strip thing.  No complaints despite many being dye hard McD, Taco fans but of course I tell 'em change is good especially Mediterranean!!"}
{"text":"I give it a solid three stars, I don't see anything wrong with it. This place is painfully average. Decent gyro, good hummus, friendly and efficient service.  This is my go-to place when I'm in the mood for a gyro, plain and simple."}
{"text":"I went here based on a couple reviews and I was expecting something fabulous.  The food was really good! Four stars for the food but two for the service equals a three star review.  What went wrong?  It took about 45 min's for a couple of pita sandwiches and we were the only ones there, and when the order came it was wrong!  My friend had to get his to go while I ate mine.  Don't get me wrong the food is really good and I would probably go back but come on people please get the order right, and speed up the service a little! Maybe somebody should tell them or leave a Yelp card to let them know that we love the food, but the service needs to be improved!"}
{"text":"Are you freakin' kidding me? I can't see how this place could possibly get more than one star. In fact, if I could give it ZERO stars, that's what I'd do.  Terrible service. And someone was having a big screaming match in the back, so they turned the music up to try to drown them out.  Tough, disgusting, dry, overcooked excuse of lamb kabob with sides that weren't any better.   Decor = -1. Service = -1. Screaming match = -5. Food = -1  If you want good kabobs there are way better places to go.  Yuck.  Place seems to be under new ownership and the location looked different. I wonder if my past review was confused about locale or if this one is."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today and thought it was great.  Delicious chicken shawarma!  The atmosphere is genuine: every single person I saw in there was speaking Arabic, the TV was on a Yemen satellite station showing a soccer game, and the food was authentic.  Don't let the authenticity be intimidating, though.  I only speak English and everyone was very welcoming and also speaks English.  I will definitely be back to try more of their food, hopefully very soon."}
{"text":"I thought the food there was good for the price. I had the combination platter."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The food is made with love. We come here after church every Sunday. Great for vegetarians too!"}
{"text":"My husband & I were treated by our special Egyptian friend at this restaurant, as he knows the owner. We had never had any Middle Eastern food & we were not expecting such a feast! Everything was delicious & the presentation was beautiful & Ishmael was so friendly. From the lentil soup, to the freshly made hummus & to the other flavorful meats-lamb, chicken & beef..along with basmati rice..we will definitely be back..also just when we thought we were finished, out pops Ishmael with some delicious homemade baklava! While not a fancy restaurant, it was clean & the service was very good."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out to see what all the fuss was about.  Four reasons to not bother:  1. Despite being in a strip mall at the intersection of two major roads and close by several upscale neighborhoods, the \"Palace\" was completely empty at 12:30 on a weekday.  Never a good sign.  Guess this place doesn't do a lot of lunch business.   2. I had the lamb kabobs which were dry and gamey like overcooked deer meat.  Meh.  3. The decor leaves much to be desired, the food leaves much to be desired, and the service was slow and grumpy.  Did I wake them from their midafternoon siesta?    4. Even Olive Garden has more variety, more consistency, a more pleasant atmosphere and better value.    With so many better options in Vegas, why would you come here?  Oh that's right.  No one does."}
{"text":"The place is very average, but the food is good. I can get away with dinner for two under $30 with tip. If you're into atomosphere and trendiness, it's not for you. If you're not a snob, and want good food at a fair price, this is a good place.   I don't reccomend it if it's a \"first date\" and you're trying to impress."}
{"text":"This is now an Indian restaurant serving decent fare. The price for buffet is $11 pp. the buffet spread had a few of Indian vegetarian dishes and a couple of chicken and meat dishes. Taste: good, fresh Variety: Its ok. Have seen better for the price, esp vegetarian dishes"}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review, and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.  This time it was Poker Widows' Night, and I went with my two friends.  Two of us (I was one of them) had the Lamb Kabobs, and they were incredible - lean, tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned.   As on the previous visit, we ordered rice for one, salad for the other, intending to share both.  The waitress offered to have the kitchen divide it for us, and when the plates came out, it was if we weren't sharing at all - we each had so much rice (perfectly cooked) and salad (fresh and full of a variety of stuff), together with a substantial portion of the lamb, that we each took home enough for a second full meal.  The other friend is Israeli, and this is her comfort food.  She had a hankering for Liver and Onions.  If she hadn't been with us, it would have been another 5-star rating.  But her liver was way overcooked, and she didn't like it.  She did, however, love the hummus, which we ordered as a single side dish but had it as an appetizer.  It was a huge portion for $4.50.  (It costs more when ordered alone, but who'd go there and just order hummus?).  I have to agree with XX, when he/she said: \" You walk in and can't tell whether or not they're open...\"  We went fairly late, and were sure it was closed -- until we walked in.  I don't see it as a bad omen, though, just that the owner needs a neon \"OPEN\" sign.  This is Vegas, ferchrissake, there's sure no shortage of neon to be had!  I'll be going back to Kebob Palace, but I'll stick with the chicken or, especially, the lamb.  Kebob.  As in Kebob Palace.  And I sure won't be ordering the liver.  Not there - or anywhere."}
{"text":"03/06/10  I rarely find myself in this part of Phoenix, so when I knew I was going to be in the area, I had two places in mind for a late lunch.  I was hoping to dine at Bobby Q, but I found the prices a bit too steep to dine alone, so I headed here.  Found the menu uninteresting that day, perhaps bec. I was looking forward to good bbq fare, but I finally settled on the basics- hummus and falafel.  For those who care, the falafel were fried in soybean oil.  (Most places I've inquired at use corn, and sometimes peanut, oil.)  The platter looked very appetizing, but don't be fooled!  The hummus was very bland, and the falafel pieces weren't that great, either.  I had to ask for lemon to get some flavor out of the falafel, and the hummus' saving grace was that it lent the falafel some lubrication.  The pita bread was probably the best thing out of the whole meal, and that's not saying much.  Afterwards, I checked out the bakery next door for some expensive baklava.  I chose three varieties, and I found them all too heavy on soggy phyllo and lacking in honey.    $13 for terrible baklava and $7 (or more) on less than mediocre hummus and falafel made for such a disappointing adventure that day.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Not even to anyone that didn't like me.  (But then again, I'd never do that, anyway.)"}
{"text":"\"Kabob Place is Now Open with NEW ownership and management. Please come in and try our food!"}
{"text":"This is from 4/22/2009 and I had inadvertently posted this review for Kabob Express.  Had the qabili and yogurt with mint. Qabili was very nice though not much lamb in it. Was served with a beef and split pea stew which was warm not hot and a small bowl of cucumber and tomato salad. Yogurt and mint dip was rather thin. Service slow as always despite small number of customers. Good value though at $18 or so"}
{"text":"Tonight Ishmael made me a special gyro. With kabob beef and roasted vegetables   This was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food is great, try the falafel, it is soo good. I love the hummos too, if you mix the hummos with the falafel, you will love it. I ordered Chicken Gallaya, it was fantastic.  The prices are not too expensive, actually it is pretty reasonable."}
