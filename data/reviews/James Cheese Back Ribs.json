{"text":"Awesome place! Atmosphere was amazing, staff was friendly, and food was great! Me and my girlfriend went there to celebrate her birthday. We got the LA galbi and James cheese back ribs. We we're scared that it might not be enough due to what the other comments were saying, but we were stuffed when we finished! Only downfall is they don't take reservations for party under 6 people, but they are nice enough to take down your name and number to call you when your table is ready so you can roam the streets and explore!"}
{"text":"First of all, the service at this place was outstanding. Not only did they make you feel comfortable, but they teach you how to eat the food and have wonderful recommendations as well. They were very clear that everything in their menu was homemade!  We came here for dinner and tried: - Chicken Karaage - Sundae - Mild Pork Ribs - Spicy Pork Ribs  - Green Tea Cheesecake  The karaage was crispy and juicy, whereas the sundae was chewy and flavourful. Both were very good starters. At first we ordered only the Mild and Spicy Ribs, both were absolutely delicious. The corn cheese added even more flavour when it was wrapped around the ribs. The spicy ribs were not as spicy as we expected; however, after having a hilarious conversation with the servers, they offered to make an extremely spicy version for us. Reason why it is not in the menu is because of the amount customers from the past who could not handle the spice. The extremely spicy sauce made sweat and tears appear involuntarily, so they sure delivered! Order at your own risk. At the end of the dinner we tried the green tea icebox cheesecake which was very creamy and mousse-like, not too sweet and had a lot of green tea flavour.  Overall, I would 100% recommend this restaurant and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Pros: flavorful ribs, unique concept Cons: steep price, small amount of food  This is the kind of restaurant I go once and then only come back during special occasions. The food was good, but if it wasn't for the cheese concept, the ribs are just mediocre. Don't take this as your regular Korean restaurant. They don't have banchans and the sides that come with the ribs are just barely enough for two people. Service and ambiance is good but the food just doesn't stand out.   Also, although on their website it says that they take reservations, this restaurant in fact DOES NOT take reservations! Do plan your visit around a less busy time to decrease waiting time."}
{"text":"2 points for friendly servers although I had a hard time understanding what they were trying to tell me. It took more 30 mins for them to bring our food. The ribs were pretty bland ( we ordered extra spicy but wasn't spicy at all). We also ordered kimchi fried rice which was salty yet was lacking flavour. It also wasn't very hot either as if it was already pre made.. Overall, pretty interesting but won't recommend. $34 is too steep for 8 small pieces of ribs with some corn and cheese."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 if Yelp would allow me to have .5 star.   Though the line up was long and we had to wait for a bit, it wasn't so bad as the service was pretty good. Everyone working there was very nice, and they made sure to call us right away when the table was about to be ready. Also, they were very attentive throughout the meal. However, it took a while for the food to come out.. I understand that it's a busy location, but the wait was longer than the average.  When the cheese ribs came out, the server assigned to us was quick to come to us to help with the dish to be cooked, and he explained what each item was on the skillet as there were extra ingredients other than the ribs itself, including cheese. He was very helpful and I appreciated him not rushing through; he took time to make sure that ingredients were cooked enough to be eaten and that we knew what to do from there.   So here's my review about the actual dish..  If the ribs were good I would give them a solid 4 or even 5, but they weren't very impressive while the store's name has 'ribs' in them. They were pretty hard to chew, and it was really heavy on the sauce outside while the base meat is not properly seasoned. Other things on the skillet were decent, and eating them with ribs made the dish much better.      We ordered a Karaage (fried chicken bits) dish as well, which was mediocre. It wasn't fried properly; the texture wasn't crispy at all but soggy.  Overall, it was a fun experience to roll the ribs on melted cheese, but I don't think I will come back to this restaurant again. I feel like one time was more than enough."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp after studying at the library, and this definitely satisfied my cravings for cheese and ribs!  One order was good enough to share amongst two people, so I'm thinking the price point is okay for the meal. My only one comment is that the melted cheese would cook too quickly before adding it on the cheese, maybe consider adding some extra cheese on the side?  My experience was great because the servers showed us how to add the cheese to the ribs (just like in the blogto video) - I'm going to need to practice a couple more times to master the technique lol.   Shoutout to the great service and looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"To be honest I came here because of the hyped up photos on instagram within their first few weeks of opening. It just looked amazing and too good to be true. Ribs and cheese? Two loves!   Their servers were nice and attentive! Ambiance is super chill and I loved their decor. :) The restaurant was quite spacious and very nice.  Beer was good hehe ... cocktails were alright but they had very fun names.  While the ribs were tasty when the cheese was melted, the portions were quite small. You definitely have to eat everything within 5 minutes or the food won't taste as good! I hope their quality improves within the next few months! :) The appetizers and main dishes all had similar flavours and had simple flavours.  Tip: don't order the additional half order for $17. We thought we would be getting an additional grill with more toppings but we ended up just getting a few extra ribs. Not sure what the difference was between adding extra ribs for $12.5 vs extra half order for $17. No sprinkled cheese? The staff need to explain their menu better!"}
{"text":"it's a solid OK. since i've been once now, the novelty of it is gone and you realize that you can easily replicate the cheese ribs at home. cast iron skillet + cheese into broil mode in the oven. boom.  we also had the fried calamari which wasn't too special either- the sauce was what made it good and it was probably just a spicy mayo.  we had a good time here and the food was good but i probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"The food here is just all right and mediocre, but the service is very friendly and welcoming!!   The servers were very attentive to our needs, and accommodated my ask for both hot water and lemon. One even came over after, asking if I'd like a mix of hot and cold so that the water would be easier to drink at a warmer temperature! When I arrived, the waitress noted that I was carrying a cupcake and offered to refrigerate it for me. When I asked for it after, another server suggested bringing out two spoons for us!  We got the cheesy rib platter, which came with two half racks. We got one to be mild, and the other lightly spicy. I preferred the mild flavour, though the spicy rack ended up leaner and therefore tastier. They give you a plastic glove to eat the ribs with, to avoid dirtying your hand. That said, I still ended up using my other hand to assist me to properly tear into the ribs haha!  Since we came on a Friday, we were given complimentary fries with our order of the cheese platter. The fries were quite heavily battered, and, as my friend said, tasted like Costco fries! The platter had a mashed potato side (slightly too dry), buttered corn kernels (very dry and chewy), four small sausages (two tasted cheesier and were very bouncy to the touch), sweet potato mash (heavenly), and egg. Overall, my comment would be that the platter ended up too hard and dry. They turned the heat off, and the cheese and all the sides began hardening. In fact, the cheese formed such a crust that it was impossible to scrape off in the end.   Still an experience, and again, the service is impeccable!"}
{"text":"The cheese wrapped around back ribs was what attracted us to visit this restaurant.  This restaraunt is nice and cozy, it's also on the small side.  For people we ordered: - Seared pork belly - kimchi fried rice - 2 orders of James Cheese back ribs (1 mild & 1 spicy) We actually felt full when we left the restaraunt with  the above food.  The servers would come wrap the cheese around the ribs for you, and I must say the ribs tasted pretty good! You should try to eat it when it's nice and hot to get the best taste and experience.  The service is great at this restaurant, the ribs are good, but the rest of the items are average. It's worth to try this place out once if you haven't been here yet."}
{"text":"Location/Service - Along Spadina Ave (Chinatown), right beside the Matcha bubble tea - Parking available on the street or nearby GreenP near Kesington Market - Restaurant size is normal and can accommodate groups, better to reserve in advance if possible - Decor is modern and simple, I like their strong and sturdy utensils  - Staff are nice, provide recommendations, always on their feet to refill water or make sure the food plate doesn't overcook  Food - Shared a few items for 4 people  SIGNATURE FRIED CORN SQUID (~$9) - Kinda like calamari (battered squid) that's topped with sweet corn and chili mayo sauce - Good portion and ratio of squid/fried batter and not oily at all - The mayo sauce and sweet corn complimented well as a balance  TAKORAISU (~$9) - good fusion mix of steamed rice covered with seasoned ground beef, cheddar cheese, and sour cream - Reminds me a little bit of a Mexican taco feeling to it - Good portion to share and ground beef was not dry  JAMES CHEESE BACK RIBS (~$37) - one order is suggested to be enough for around 2 people, so we added another half order (~$18) - signature dish that also comes with egg, corn, sausage, sweet potato and regular potato sides - ribs are marinated in Korean-sauce (spicy level can be adjusted) in advanced - staff comes over and wraps the mozzarella cheese on each of the ribs; really like the combo that gives a bit of sweet and spicy feeling to it - portion wise was enough; especially adding it with the sides  Overall, I would say it lives up to the hype you often see. The ribs are great to taste (just a little pricey - but everything has inflated now). Recommend coming in as a group to share a few dishes - they also have daily specials on drinks."}
{"text":"I knew that James Cheese Back Ribs just opened up a few weeks ago.  When I first saw their cheesy ribs pictures, it made me mouthwatering.  Aww~ I wanted to eat those cheese on ribs!  I wasn't sure at first if it was good as I expected because I found some negative comments.  However, I went for it.  Different people have different tastes right!?    FOOD (3.5 stars) I went there with a friend from Yelp too. She loves food, same like me  (right Kerry!?) ^^.  We ordered the Spicy James Cheese Back Rib ($34.5) for sharing.  They have three different levels of spiciness, mild, spicy and Super spicy.  If you think an order of the JC Back Ribs won't be enough for you and your friends but two orders is too much for you guys, you can add on a half order for $17 or add extra ribs for $12.5.  Or you can get extra cheese for $2.5 or extra sauce for $1.5.  Check your menu or ask your servers. They are super nice!   We got a regular JC Back Ribs and two pints of Sapporo.  Who could forget a beer with ribs? Cheers!  Price (3.5 stars)  $$  Service (4.5 stars)  All the staff that evening were very friendly and attentive.  I got seated fast and waited for my friend arrived.  The first server came to take out our order after my friend came. They set up the table in few minutes.  We didn't wait too long for the food came out.  Then, they explained about food and showed us how to eat their ribs. \"Red\", was the waiter who came in and showed us how to wrap the cheese around the ribs.  It took a few minutes to do so.  He wrapped them all for us. He came few times to do it.  We weren't lazy to do it by ourselves but we were having a deep conversation lol.  We spent time there quite long, 4 hours approximately lol (from 7 pm till it was closed).  We were chatting till forget the time.  The staff came to check on us many times without any attitude.  Thank you ;)   AMBIANCE (3.5 stars) The restaurant looked modern and clean.  However, I felt like the tables were a bit small if you were a big eater lol. You need to ask for a big table if you know you will order a lot. I'm sure they will accommodate the best for their customers who love eating so much lol.  OVERALL (3.5 stars) Ribs were good. Service was excellent. And yes, I would come back again with my husband and friends lol.  I wanna try other things like pork belly, kimchi fried rice, especially the \"Korean MCRib.\" Awww~ Oh! And more JC Back Ribs but this time I want Super Spicy!"}
{"text":"Delicious ribs and great service! The restaurant is comfortably small and decorated quite nicely, contributing to the overall good dining experience. Had the mild pork ribs to share; portion size is okay for 2, but on the small side so if you're hungry I would probably add a few more dishes.  For the price point, I would've liked a little more meat--you're paying $35 for 8 small ribs. I mean they're good but not extraordinary! It would have been nice to have a little more cheese as well.  The sides were okay but got cold pretty fast (corn, sweet and regular mash) after the stove is turned off (to prevent cheese from over cooking) and the egg was a little disappointing. Otherwise the main ribs+cheese were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"YAAAAASSS. Cheesy Ribs!  I love this place, but let me start with some of the negatives and then I'll get to the awesomeness that is James Cheese Back Ribs  1. It's pricey, especially if you're looking to get full here! The classic James Cheese back ribs is $37. This is probably enough to feed 1.5 persons. If you want an additional half order to feed 2-3 people, that's another $18.50. 2. The sauce is one flavour with varied spiciness. The mild is only okay, but the spicy gives it another kick but can sometimes be too spicy. Wish there was a middle between mild and spicy (maybe there is? You can ask?) 3. I don't think they take reservations, and it is a small establishment so you may end up waiting a bit for a table.   The awesomeness 1. I love the concept, because who can go wrong with ribs and cheese. I don't think people order anything else. It's an unique concept, one that I don't know if I have found elsewhere in Toronto. It also comes with seasonal sides. The corn goes deliciously with the sauce.  2. The service. They prepare your food in a relatively reasonable amount of time, but are always quick to refill and make sure you're taken care of. They cut the ribs and wrap the cheese around it.  3. FREE FRIES ON FRIDAY W/ RIB ORDER"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. I've never had any Korean grilled cheese dish, this was the first time.  I didn't know what to expect when we ordered a dish (little do we know that it is for 2 people). The server would come to our table and prepare the dish in edible form (after the cheese is melt). The server would wrap the black ribs with the cheese and serve them on your plate. So to me, that's a premium service. Aside from the ribs, you can eat corn and vegetables. The only problem I have is that the portion was too little. I was hoping for more food."}
{"text":"Really great services, waitresses are all extremely nice and sweet. The ribs and chicken are pretty good. We ordered both the mild and spicy ribs and chicken, chicken is significantly more spicy but I couldn't tell the difference of the ribs. In general a good place for people to try out cheese ribs and have a fun time."}
{"text":"I really like the cheese ribs here. They are good for two people with lots of small and delicious small side dishes. The ribs are pretty good as well.   The service here are excellent! The servants are warm and nice. When me and my friend talking to each other asking about what's is in the rib, they come and answer the question without us asking. The came twice to ask if the food is good and asked for advices at the end. We had some leftovers, because we were too full, the servant asked us if the food was bad so we did not finish it and asked for advices. I am really impressed!"}
{"text":"We got the rib platter that comes with 5 sides, kimchi rice, and a side of pork belly. The platter was nice and very filling except that the ribs weren't that hot and it was hard to chew. Servers are nice and attentive, but I would have preferred to eat the cheese and ribs on my own. The server basically stood at our table and put the cheese on the ribs for us, which was nice of her, but once the cheese got cold on the ribs, it wasn't as appetizing anymore. Decor in the restaurant is nice as it well, a modern look."}
{"text":"Cheese and Ribs.. you cant go wrong with this combo. The amount of Ribs you get in the $38? Service is good enough for 2 people max if you add in some additional appetizers. We order the green salad which was fairly good with nice mixture of things and dressing. The chicken wings was the special for Tuesdays (they have a special every day) and I found it okay not amazing but not horrible. The Corn Calamari was pretty good. I liked the fact that the food came out in a timely manner and that the servers cut the ribs for you while wrapping it in cheese. As you only get chopsticks as well as 1 glove for eating I found it hard get additional appetizers (corn, egg, mashed potatos, etc) overall not tol messy, smelly or greasy. Overall a good experience but for the price I dont think it would be somewhere to go on the regular!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty new - about months old and has a great vibe. It's different from other more traditional kind of restaurants in Chinatown. It's more of a Ossington feel if you know what I mean. We only ordered the cheese back rib dish and it's filling for 2 people. The server will come to your tables and serve the ribs in melted cheese in front of you and we took some great pictures and videos. We do feel despite the novelty and good flavour, it's a bit on the pricy side. Also the side dish is a bit bland."}
{"text":"After stumbling upon this place when walking in the area, my husband had been dying to try this place for months. We finally tried it and were not disappointed.  THE FOOD- Obviously you come here for the cheeseback ribs. We shared them between 3 people and also ordered the sliders and the sweet potato croquette to share. The croquette was a big ball of deliciousness with a whole runny egg in the middle. The sliders were juicy and tender. And then came the main event, the cheeseback ribs combined perfectly with the corn, scrambled eggs etc. The ribs were tender and perfectly cooked and sauced and the cheese just added the perfect balance to them.  THE SPACE- it's a cool looking space but we were seated at a booth three-quarters of the way to the back directly under several vents so it was pretty chilly and not the most pleasant spot to enjoy our ribs.  THE SERVICE- The servers are very helpful and cut up the ribs and melt the cheese for you if you ask them for help. They definitely know how to milk it for Instagram!   This place doesn't provide the greatest value ($34 for 8 ribs) but you're definitely paying for the experience of a fun hands on meal."}
{"text":"Tip #1: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A RESERVATION. This joint is super popular and also has like 10 tables built for ants. But seriously, the tables are small.  Tip #2: Don't be on a diet.  Tip #3: Don't be lactose intolerant or vegetarian. (I'm both of those things... most of the time. Womp womp.)  Begin Review: Who knew that cheese and ribs would go together so well, but, as it turns out, it's a match made in heaven (or possibly hell, depending on how hot your ribs are).  Who doesn't love cheese?! Who doesn't love the base of bacon?! Fat pairs with more fat to create a crazy bastard supernova of fatty goodness. Frankly, the cheese and ribs are so good, you'll find yourself audibly going \"mMmmm\" and shamelessly scraping cheese off the bottom of the pot. Maybe save this place for the second or third date. Or for post-marriage. Don't let your partner see you like this! Yikes.  Oh, you like vegetables?! Let me suggest either the Kimchi Fried Rice or Grape Soju. Grape isn't a vegetable, you say?! It's not? TOO BAD. You're going to drink your soju and you're going to love it.  Anyhoo, try to make it here and try Korea's hip new trend. If you decide you don't like it, you can always just eat the cheese."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Recently came here after seeing so many pictures of this infamous cheesy ribs. It's what everyone orders pretty much when they're here. The ribs came on a heated pan filled with cheese of course, mash potato, mash sweet potato, egg, corn and some veggies. Be aware if you're a big eater the ribs might not be enough for a big group. However, if you're just with another person then a half rack I think would be enough.   To be honest, the ribs tasted good but nothing special. I think it's partly because we chose mild so there's literally no spice. I wish we chose a medium spicy so at least there's some kick to it. Also be careful of the cheese..they turn cold fast so you better eat the ribs quick before it turns into a blob.  Service is great with the servers always refilling your cup and helping you twirl cheese on your ribs."}
{"text":"The best bar in town , sapporo pint is only 5.9$ , 15 different type of sake , soju with fruit flavour , also the sake cocktail, 4$ bar rail . Good food , welcoming atmosphere. Their pork belly is really tasty and also the ribs ."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good spot to eat, catch-up, and capture Instagram-able (Instagrammable?) moments, this is the spot for you.   The signature dish is their namesake, BBQ back cheese ribs. What are they? Baby back ribs smothered in a tangy bbq sauce (spicy optional), wrapped in stringy mozzarella cheese, tableside. At first, it's a bit mesmerizing watching your server approach the table with tongs and scissors to stretch cheese. But the fun of watching cheese pulls is pleasantly followed with bites of tender ribs and chewy cheese. A unique but delicious combo. They also have a newer chicken and cheese platter which features dark meat chicken in a saucier sauce... Not as obnoxious as wrapping ribs in cheese, but the chicken is juicer and less messy to eat.  Also on the menu, appetizers like pork belly, wings, baos, etc. and bowls of udon or kimchi fried rice. Plenty of choices for anyone part of your group.   James Cheese is easier for walk-ins on weeknights but often crowded on weekends (reservations are wise) so plan accordingly.   Overall, it's certainly a good option when your dining with a group, are in the Chinatown area, and are looking for a dinner and a show."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The food portion doesn't look filling but it is due to the cheese. The ribs can be pricey but they're very good. I would recommend it. The waiters help cut the ribs and wrap the cheese around them. Good service."}
{"text":"As a protein lover, you really can't say no to a place like this.  Melty cheese? Check Marinated ribs? Check Tasty corn? Check A bunch of other things I don't remember but tasted good as hell? Check, check, check!  I arrived here in the evening after work hours and it was pretty busy! I believe you can make reservations here which is great and saves the hassle of waiting in line.   If you're a fun of cheese and meats and a whole bunch of random things mixed in a fiery cauldron brewing a mouthful of tasty delicacies, I'd highly recommend this place!   10/10 would re-visit again.   Warning: come here on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Err I had tried a lot of korean food in North York area maybe that's why my tongue had been very picky over good ones from bad ones This experience had been a bit disappointed not gonna lie about it... And I wouldn't want to come here again and won't really recommend my frds to come try this out..."}
{"text":"Best back ribs in Toronto!!! Short rib is my favorite! And cheese perfect match with ribs!!"}
{"text":"The James cheese back ribs is good especially with the sweet corn stuck on the cheese. But the ribs could use more bbq sauce. I got the wings as starters too. It was okay. Well cooked and crispy but the taste just isn't there. Overall, it was a good experience and very photogenic food."}
{"text":"This was the last stop of a mini food crawl my friend and I did so we were super full by the time we got here. We only ordered the cheese back ribs, but that was what basically everyone was there for. Make sure to reserve in advance because the restaurant is not very big and there is not a lot of big tables for larger groups.  There were three different levels of spice to choose from mild, spicy, and really spicy so we decided to try spicy. The dish came with 5 side dishes on the hot plate itself which is usually corn, sweet potato, steamed eggs, vegetables, and mashed potatoes. The side dishes did not have as much flavour or uniqueness as we liked, but on the menu, it did say seasonal side dishes so hopefully, they will improve.   As for the ribs themselves, the server will show you how to wrap the cheese around the ribs for the first few servings to allow for pictures and videos. The ribs itself were quite tender and came off the bone quite easily. The cheese complimented the ribs quite nicely but after a while, the cheese became quite heavy to eat and got us super full."}
{"text":"The service here was great but it felt kind of weird eating with the workers looking over your shoulders. They help you with wrapping the cheese and the ribs but my partner just felt uncomfortable. We asked for a pitcher of Sapporo and they wanted to charge $25. Like whaaat. So we got pints instead. I ordered the chicken karage which was pretty damn dry lol sorry. The only things that made the dish edible was the ton of mayo on top of the chicken. The cheese and ribs was OK. Nothing that we would really ever return for. But it was nice to experience it."}
{"text":"We and my friends went to try it for dinner and I would say that it was pretty good. We ordered cheese with ribs with crispy onions rings and Tokyo rose cocktail. When we got our order they gave us a lot to finish as there were sides that came with it (eggs, mini sausages, corn, mashed potato, and mashed sweet potato). The price to split with friends is also pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Note: this review is not about the cheese ribs. I bet the ribs are really good and maybe I should've got them, but this review is based on their lunch special I had   I went there around 12 on a Monday for a bowl of gyudon. Having been to a lot of Japanese restaurants, I expected gyudon to be a rice bowl topped with soft beef, onions, and pickled ginger. Instead, I got 5 slices of beef shank that were very hard to chew--they tasted practically like beef jerky. The beef to rice ratio was very poor: very little beef and a whole bowl of rice.   The miso soup was the saltiest thing I've ever had. I've had Japanese miso soup and I've had Korean miso soup (black bean soup), but what I had here was legitimately the saltiest thing I've ever had. I couldn't drink it after two spoons.   Maybe I should've come for the ribs, but I expected this place to have lunch specials too. Maybe I'll be back for the ribs with friends, but never again for the lunch special."}
{"text":"Came here during their soft opening as they called it.  The concept sounded ok but when we went it was nearly deserted, save for a table that was given VIP service at the back.  It emptyness of the restaurant gave an uncomfortable vibe.  Anyways, the menu states that the signature cheese ribs has a minimum 2 order.  This stipulation meant that we were limited to just ordering that.  It was later on when another table came in that a customer inquired and the server said you could order one order of the cheese ribs but that it wouldn't be very much.  Well, it would've been nice to be given that option!  The presentation was nice, you get a large plate that has the cheese and corn, then the ribs on top.  The side dishes were small and not enough for two.  Imagine a spoonful of mashed potatoes spread thin, that's what we got.  The sides were: boiled sliced carrots, mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, corn and one egg.  While the serving of cheese and corn (mixed in) was good for two, the other sides were very small.    Each serving had 4 ribs which were alright but expensive for what we got.  There was one male server with glasses, he was pleasant and helpful.    I got annoyed that the neighbouring table was checked and asked frequently how they were enjoying their meal and feedback was given.  We weren't asked how our meal was until the end.  Oh yeah, that table that the server was keen to speak with to get feedback, they got free desserts as compensation for their feedback and she was unhappy with her meal.    I expressed the same comment, it was expensive for what we got and the fact that theres a minimum 2 per order for the cheese ribs is a setback.  But we didn't get a dessert.  Oh well.    If you go this week during their soft opening, there's a 10% discount.  We ordered two pops but the pricing was different.  When I asked, the response didn't make sense, but whatever.  Supposedly, the menu may be a bit different when they get the knots worked out."}
{"text":"\"Ribs make everyone happy\"   Cute motto  We didn't have a reservation but got a seat within 10 minutes for two people.   We ordered:  Full rack of ribs (mild) Pork belly Sake Mojito cocktail  Tokyo rose cocktail  Cocktails that are $8 are $6 on Sats  Servers were friendly. Place was clean and brightly lit. Washrooms were clean!  The verdict:  The ribs are nicely seasoned and tender. I didn't find the cheese added much taste because it didn't have any taste. It gave it a cheesy texture, but it wasn't anything special. Kind of reminded me of cheese fondue. In my opinion, this is a novelty, but not worth $35.  Mashed potatoes, sausage (put cheese on this), and corn were really good. Flavourful.  I found the sweet potatoes too soggy. Egg was overcooked  TIP: they give you a glove to wear when eating the ribs, put it on your non-dominant hand so you have the other to use the spoon and chopsticks with.   Pork belly: It wasn't as soft as I would have liked it but nicely seasoned. The presentation was nice too.   Sake mojito: I like this! It was light but good Tokyo rose: orange juice with sake or Soju -  it wasn't the best  For a total of $70 including tax and tip, I didn't think it was worth it since my husband wasn't full. But it is nice to have a new experience.   Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Wrapping BBQ ribs with cheese seems like such a unique, fun and delicious idea...however, my party and I found it underwhelming at best. The portions were quite small and expensive for the quantity. The ribs were not the fall off the bone ribs we were expecting. The sides on the platter were bland and not plentiful. What was the true saving grace was the kimchi fried rice. Oh my goodness, that kimchi fried rice is simply spectacular. Also we loved the pork belly."}
{"text":"Innovation: wrapping mozzarella around ribs in front of your eyes! It is not your typical traditional korean food.  We tried:  James cheese back ribs ($37): The mozarella is really tasty but I wish the ribs were juicier and hotter.. ribs were kinda cold and meat wasn't fall off the bone. Thats basically where I would minus one star.   Sweet potato croquette ($6): reminded me of a scotch egg with the gooey egg inside. I recommend this, it's really good.  Service is great, price isn't cheap. Overall a nice, unique experience. I would go back and try their other meats."}
{"text":"Really fun experience! We had the James Cheese Back Ribs. Took a little long for staff to bring our plate considering the only item that needs cooking is the ribs.   I wouldn't do it again but worth the try!"}
{"text":"the presentation of the food probably counts for more than the food itself. it's not horrendous but once you get over the cheese wrapping around the ribs it's actually sort of meh."}
{"text":"If you are like me, always in hunt of newest food creation in town, this is the place to go!   The idea is simple, ribs wrapped in melting cheese!   James Cheese Back Rib is a well-known franchise Korean restaurants.  Owner of this place is Chinese, he went to Korea and brought it back here to Toronto.  The regular size of ribs is for two people ($34), you can order additional portion for $17.  You will get 8 ribs, and side dishes that also cooked in the same pan (baked egg, baked corns, mashed sweet potato, steamed carrot and broccoli).  The ribs: they are very tasty, since it's franchise I believe the sauce is from Korea.  However, it is not cooked to the degree that meats fall of bone. At least that's how I like my ribs to be... The server will come to your table to wrap cheese around the ribs. And you are supposed to eat them together.  Both me and my friend love it so much!   As for side dish, there are LOTS rooms to improve... They taste pretty bland.  I would like to see something like kimchi fried rice in the future."}
{"text":"Great tasting ribs and awesome table service.  Environment: Located near the Spadina/College intersection, the restaurant is located at a vibrant neighbourhood with many shops, and it is easily accessible by public transit. The store is quite small however, with only enough tables to sit roughly 10 parties. But they can accomodate large groups for the big tables at the back.  Food:  They have daily specials available and when I went on a Friday the daily special was one order of free fries, which were normally $2 each. The fries looked and tasted like McDonald fries, which I kinda liked and it was so addicting. For main, my friend and I shared the cheese ribs between the two of us. We ordered the medium spicy and it was actually too much for me. My eyes were tearing, my nose was runny, and my was aching...it wasn't a peasant sight. So I would suggest that if you're really not good at handling spiciness you should totally get the non-spicy option, because the ribs were actually really good otherwise.  On the hot plate there were mozzerella cheese which was used to wrap the ribs, some steamed eggs, butter corn, mash popatoes, mashed yam, and a few weiner sausages. The rest of the sides were quite tasty as well, but the best part of the dish was definitely the ribs!  Service: One thing that makes this place stands out is its personalized table service. The servers would come to your table to cook the ribs for you and help you wrap the cheese. They only work on a few pieces at a time so you can enjoy the ribs while the cheese was still soft and warm. The servers would come back to make a few more once they realized that your current batch was finished. The servers were super attentive and totally deserved the added tips  Overall, the meal was fantastic. Food was tasty and one order of the cheese ribs was enough for 2 people, which cost roughly $15 per person. The servers were skilled at preparing the cheese ribs and were attentive to our requests. I would totally come back again and try their non-spicy ribs"}
{"text":"Cheese and ribs, who can resist that!  Service at the resturant was great, but quality and quantity fell below expectations for this price point.  17.50 for half  a rack of ribs and some vegetables and corns for the side.... I definitely don't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Based on the thread of reviews here, it looks like you can either love the ribs here or ... just feel indifferent about them. I'm with the latter.   While the servers were polite, helpful and attentive, the food itself was just okay to me and my family. We ordered the cheeseback ribs, korean McRib and miso cod, and no one was really blown away by the flavour or the slightly warm temperature of the food. I guess everyone's taste buds are different.. just dont have too high expectations if you're coming for the first time!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time going back. It was my friend's birthday and thought he would want to try something different and cool. Prior to our dinner, I spoke w one of the servers, and told them it's our friend's bday and if there's anything they can do In terms of dessert w candle. They said we can order a dessert, and they would have a small candle with it. So we did.  We ordered the well known back ribs, as well as the chicken cheese platter. As the second order came to table, one of the servers already brought out the dessert, and eager to put on the table.  I stopped them immediately, and asked them why they would bring out the bday dessert now, when we haven't even begun our dinner ?!! Obviously the surprise was ruined. My friend saw the cake (and actually without candle), and we were disappointed.  I spoke to the manager at the end to address this common sense issue we encountered, and also asked them to cancel the cake order.  We ended up going somewhere else for dessert."}
{"text":"Came to try a few days ago while travelingbto Toronto. Must order the cheese ribs. The ribs have alot of flavor and they provide wraping which is very Instagramable. Also love their pork belly. Something you cant find any where else. One downside is that there are only fee dessert  options, but the server said that they will have more options after soft opening. BTW the servers are relly nice and welcome."}
{"text":"I really love the idea of this restaurant (meat and cheese... my two favorites together) but it was a pretty average dinner meal. On a Friday night this place was packed, and we put our names down to wait for a seat. I just walked around Chinatown for an hour before they called us to come inside. Of course we order the cheese ribs, and the food takes some time before it arrives.   It's a really big and pretty pot of cheese, half rack of ribs, some corn, egg, and vegetables. The service was super nice and the servers helped us with wrapping the cheese and taught us how to do it ourselves. They turn off the heat after the cheese is completely melted, but then after a few minutes the cheese hardened up again and it basically tasted like lukewarm pizza cheese around the ribs.   I'm kind of a carnivore as well and I think the portion was kind of on the smaller side for two people to share, so definitely order more ribs if you come with 2+ people. I don't think it's worth the hour-long wait, but it wasn't a bad experience either."}
{"text":"We ordered the signature James' Cheese Back Ribs, which came to ~$40 after tax and tip.  PROS:  -Prompt and courteous service -Ribs are tender  -You can choose your spice level; we chose 'Mild', which was an ideal amount of spice for those who don't usually enjoy spicy food -You are given gloves to eat the ribs -Washrooms are clean and modern -All-gender washrooms, if that is what you look for -Staff are attentive with refilling your water, which is a plus because the majority of items contain spice  CONS: -Flavour was not anything special -Each person only gets one glove rather than two -Because the gas range is turned down, the cheese hardens easily  We went on a packed Sunday at 7:30pm. They had an ample number of staff present, which helped with the speed and degree of customer service. Although we did not have reservations and had to wait for a table to open up, we were free to sit at a quaint 4-chair seating area. Once we ordered the ribs, we were given a forewarning that the ribs might take a while to come, but our order came quicker than anticipated. Your server will turn on the gas range, let the cheese melt, and wrap the cheese around the ribs for you. As others have mentioned, the ribs come with 5 sides: corn, small sausages, mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, and eggs. Contrary to another review, I did not find the mashed potatoes to have too much butter. In comparison, it could be due to your palate; if you enjoy American mashed potatoes (e.g., with butter and milk), you will enjoy this side. The ribs are enough to fill one very hungry person, or satiate two people.  The important take-away from this review is that I did not come into the restaurant with expectations, hence the 4 stars. However, the signature dish feels gimmicky. This place would be great to try out (and to take a video), but not to continue visiting."}
{"text":"This place was great for a group birthday celebration. They were happy to accommodate our group of 8, and helped serve a cake we brought in. The staff was super helpful and never rushed us even though the restaurant was quite busy.  The food was overall decent. The ribs were tender and the cheese was amazing, especially the bits at the end that stuck to the pan. The sides were pretty normal, nothing too special. I especially didn't like the egg part, it was difficult to spoon out and a bit dry. The portions were a little small, but overall a great experience because of the helpful staff."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday after seeing all the videos and being a cheese lover, I was intrigued! The place was super cute and insta-worthy. Given it was a Friday, we had to wait a bit given we didn't make any reservations and the place was already packed. However, throughout the wait, the servers were all super nice and attentive in assuring we would get seated as soon as possible. We ordered the Cheese ribs (mild) and then a kimchi fried rice. On Fridays, you also get free fries with the ribs and option for $5 beers. Honestly, the free fries really wow-ed me. They were fried to a perfect crisp, slightly seasoned (not sure what it was tbh) and the cut was like McD fries. The ribs came with corn, sweet potato mash, egg, regular mash potatoes and  a veggie medley. I liked the idea of the ribs wrapped around cheese but for me, I would opt for spicy ribs next time as the mild was a bit sweet for my liking. On the other hand, the kimchi fried rice was alright, the spam in it was good but I don't think the rice came out too hot. Overall, it is a bit pricey but I liked my experience here and would say you atleast have to come try it out once."}
{"text":"This review may seem harsh but I recently came back from Korea. Last week I ate the James Cheese Back Ribs location in Seoul and it was great. So I was very eager to compare it with the one in Toronto but was greatly disappointed. I went with a group of four and we ordered kimchi fried rice, cheese & ribs, and the Korean McRib, plus the complimentary free fries on fridays with the cheese rib order. Everything we had was mediocre at best. The cheese was plain mozzarella (I think) and didn't add much flavour or wow factor when wrapping it around the rib. The sides that came with this dish were eggs, mashed potatoes, sweet potato, corn, and hotdogs. The kimchi fried rice was bland with what looked like pieces of spam? Couldn't taste the kimchi to be honest. The Korean McRib is basically a bao but we found it soggy and bland as well. The fries was our favourite dish which doesn't say much.   The good? The staff are very friendly and helpful. They mixed the cheese and wrapped it around the rib for us. The atmosphere is nice.   Overall, there's a lot of improvements that can be done with the quality of the food. It's nice to experience the cheese being wrapped around food but it wouldn't hurt to go to other restaurants for it."}
{"text":"Everything is bland and the cheese ribs were expensive for what we got (some bland eggs, mashed potatos, and sausages). We did get a table right away and the servers were nice in doing their jobs, but I would not return. Food was very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Conceptually, it's salivating - tender and meaty ribs wrapped in layer after layer of gooey mozzarella cheese. In practice though, it's great for the first couple ribs, where the cheese is hot and gooey, and easily wraps around the ribs. While hot, the sweet corn sticks easily to the soft cheese (and in fact, the server will even prepare the first one for each person). However, after they're gone and the heat is off, the cheese starts to get hard, doesn't wrap very well and corn stops sticking... you'll also notice (in sadness) that some of the cheese and fat has burnt and clung to the bottom of the hot plate.  So make sure you eat fast! Fortunately, they're more than happy to help you reheat your cheese and wrap more cheese for you, but it gets quite difficult to find someone once it starts to get busy!  For some reason, they insisted on squishing 8 of us into a booth, and we had to split the hot plates at 3-3-2, instead of letting us have 4 burners and 4 orders of cheese back ribs. With the extra half order, there was definitely 50% more cheese and ribs as far as I could tell, but I'm less convinced for the other sides. At time of review, an order (for 2) was $34.50, plus $17 for a half order.  The other sides were hit or miss. We liked the mashed potatoes and corn, but didn't think the egg was very good at all.  If you're in a large group, be sure to arrive early or wait a long time. Seating is limited and they cram a lot of people into the smallest spaces. They take credit card and will do split bills. No WiFi.  What's missing: the side dishes that Korean restaurants typically give you with your meal. It wasn't missed, it just seemed like a strange omission."}
{"text":"FYI: This isn't like a super helpful tip but they give you these tiny hard candies with your check that I found were adorable lol.  Yes...I saw this place on a video on Facebook, and yes the necessity of me going here was urgent. Like life or death people.  WHAT I GOT: Cheese ribs  PROS: Repeat after me. You can NEVER go wrong with meat and cheese. EVER. And my goodness, James Cheese Back Ribs is winning the restaurant game. You get a pool of gooey cheese that the server wraps around each rib along with extra corn, two different mashes (sweet potato and regular potato), mini sausages, and scrambled eggs. The ribs themselves were coated in this beautiful and super flavorful sauce, and the meat was super tender as well. Literally fell off the bone with one bite. They also give you scissors and some plastic gloves to keep your hands clean, along with the option to choose the heat level of your ribs. We went with mild, which honestly is not spicy at all, so if you're looking for even a little bit of a kick, I would suggest the regular spicy option.  CONS: Ok well the price is pretty hefty. Not gonna lie. And the sides aren't exactly the most tasty things ever but combined with the cheese, usually anything will taste good. But be warned, the server will turn off the gas stove that melts the cheese once all the ribs are wrapped so the cheese will start to get hard again. If you wanna dip your sides, eat those first. And the ribs are a bit on the small side so this meal won't actually fill you up, if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Been meaning to go to this place as a cheese lover; I had the signature fried corn squid to start, and of course the Cheese platter, this is a good amount for two people.  Picked the ribs for the platter over chicken. The combination was innovative. The meat was tender and mellow with cheese. Beware: do not cheese-wrap the ribs all at once because the texture of the cheese will become very hard and chewy after leaving the pan for just a few minutes.  The fried corn squid was the best part. Crispy and crunchy corns were refreshing and the spicy mayo goes well together. It reminds me of deep-fried soft shell crab.  My experience was overall good and unique. The ambience is modern and trendy. Shout-out to the servers for being super friendly."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service was spectacular. I absolutely loved the way the server helped to wrap cheese around each rib... This was a great place to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"Love the cheese and the rib. The concept is great. Friendly service !!!! Great wrapping skill"}
{"text":"This review and rating is purely for my Uber Eats food experience and I didn't order their ribs.   The ribs seems more worth to eat in person and with company. With such good reviews, I thought that their other food items would reflect the taste quality of their best seller. I was sadly mistaken.  I ordered the braised beef soup udon and fried chicken wings. Blandest soup noodles I've ever had in my life. There was no flavour at all - I would have been at least satisfied if it was salty enough. You would think with all the ingredients in there it would have some taste. The chicken wings are the saving grace of the meal but not by much, the portion is a little smaller than I expected and it was pretty average tasting.  To be honest, I wouldn't bother leaving a review if the food tasted mediocre - I would just make a mental note not to order again. But I'm leaving this review because I do hope that the restaurant will not neglect the quality of the rest of their menu even though I'm sure the ribs are excellent.   I do hope to visit the actual restaurant and will be open to changing my review. For now though, I would advise against ordering those two food items for delivery."}
{"text":"Overall rating: 3 My friend and I came to this place with pretty high expectations, with all the cheese pull and all. Sat down, and that day they had a special of Signature Fried Corn Squid, so we got that. And as well as the main, we got the James Cheese Back Ribs.  Food came decently quick. The ribs had a gas range underneath melt the cheese right in front of you. With the ribs, you get mashed sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, a few sausages and corn. Of course the cheese as well. Once we got the food, the server will start the range. THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART.   Our server turned the range all the way up, and the cheese melted really quickly (since there wasn't much cheese to begin with), but it basically burned the cheese too. The servers would help you wrap the cheese around the already cooked ribs, and by the time she was half way, we told her to turn off the burner to avoid any more drying of the cheese. And also because of that we ordered an extra order of cheese. But since we had the burned cheese on the bottom, it didn't help in anyway. The ribs were not all too special, and the extra cheese portion was not a good amount. I'm comparing it to the cheese we get from Kinton up in Richmond Hill, and for the same price, James only provided us with about half the amount. The mash potato had a sprinkle of lemon over it, which made it taste weird. And both mash had WAYYY too much butter in it.  The signature fried corn squid was nothing special, basically calamari with corn.   The price and the service made it a 3, if the food could be improved (mashed potatoes) and to not have the sever burn the food, the score will be higher."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting fusion concept that melts Eastern and Western cuisines.  Here's what i love about James Cheese Back Ribs: * Big enough to share for 2 people * The ribs were meaty and tender * You can choose the spice level.  We chose medium spice, and it was fairly spicy.    * Came with a portion of free fries that was the promotion of the day. * The associates help prepare the meal for you by wrapping the cheese around the ribs.  * Great service - always attentive and personable * Clean environment Been there twice already and no disappointments yet."}
