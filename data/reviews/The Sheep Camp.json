{"text":"SHEEP CAMP Downtown Buckeye Home town feel.  Simple menu with great variety and generous servings.  Lots of locals  and farmers, not modern or fancy or big, but great home style cooking, open until 2 pm.  My wife pretty much only eats breakfast two places, The Sheep Camp in Buckeye  and Ronnie's Cafe in Phoenix on 43rd Ave.  Friendly service and good food in a relaxed non-commercial setting.  Try it I think you will like it."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday morning with my wife long story short we had a bad experience with our sever and decided not to leave a tip so I specifically crossed out the tip portion of the receipt. I received my banking notifications from the weekend on Monday morning and noticed that a 19% tip was added anyway. I will never set foot in this place again the food was mediocre at best, the service was horrible, and I was charged an un-authorized amount of money without my permission. I DO NOT recommend you waste your time or hard earned money at this run down \"family restaurant\"!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service.  Waitress was slammed but still was attentive and checked with kitchen for my food allergies. My husband had a biscuit the size of his coffee cup.  He loved his chicken fried steak.  He said it was fresh and tender.  My steak and eggs great also, however I ordered steak rare and it came out medium."}
{"text":"The food was okay.  I have been to great hole-in-the-wall establishments and this one is not...but, it is a friendly spot.  It definitely is an older restaurant that needs to be updated.  Because it's old, it seems to be dirty.  The food selection isn't vast but the prices are pretty good.  It's worth a try at least once or twice."}
{"text":"Im writing this review the day after my expierence here.  After eating here i developed the worst food poisoning imaginable. It did taste good, but not vommiting 10 times in 3 hrs good (not a joke).  I had the breakfast burrito,  hash brows, and some scrambled eggs, not sure what i got it from, just know i got it from here as it was the only thing i ate this day"}
{"text":"So my wife and I stumbled upon this place. We followed the advice of some dude yelling to us from across the street. I must say, it quickly became our Saturday morning tradition. I recommend the \"Sancho\" omelet. Take the ordinary \"Pancho\" omelet and add chorizo instead of ground beef. \"For when Pancho isn't giving you enough chorizo, its time for Sancho\""}
{"text":"I got out of class early, and decided to head home with my friend when he told me about this place. Well I missed it, and came back around to find a quaint little hole-in-the-wall place. We took a table in the corner, the server was out in about two minutes, they were busy with a fire truck squad. We got water and ordered omelets. I had the sheep omelet, he had the chili and bean omelet, both of us got the biscuit as well. I'll say this, the biscuit was huge! Probably as big as a coffee cup. It was moist, and not too crumbly. The omelet, warm and steamy. It came with green bell peppers, chillies, olives, tomatoes and sausage. It was exquisite. It came with hash browns too. Just crispy enough while still being moist. My friends omelet looked like a bowl of chili was poured on his, and it looked yummy! I enjoyed every bite. It totally beats fast food, and it's not too expensive. I will definitely be coming back for more when I can!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted a good home cooked breakfast and we live in buckeye so we thought we would give it a try. We were very pleased with the portion size and it was truly a good meal and there staff was very nice. We are definitely  coming back"}
{"text":"I am giving the Sheep Camp 3 stars based on the fact that it was a true authentic Buckeye experience. A hole-in-the-wall establishment, looking outdated and forlorn, it was exactly what i would expect (and hoped) to find in downtown Buckeye. Food was very average, but about what i expected. Just wanted to grab some greasy breakfast, and i achieved that. Service was friendly, and i would definitely go back again if i'm in the area and need a cheap place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendation of a guy who has lived here all his life. I think he needs to get out more. So-so food at a high price."}
{"text":"This place is so good. We come here every Sunday and I love it everyday. It's a homey kinda vibe. Everyone here is super nice and the service is great every time we come."}
{"text":"Great mom and pops there able to do eggless pancakes for those allergic . My picky 2 year old who doesn't eat much loved the food here"}
{"text":"Great family coffee shop.  Friendly service. Very good food.  Clean place.  Very reasonable prices.  Can't go wrong here.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wonderful vintage breakfast spot. It has that simple and classic feel that is becoming more hard to find. The food is average, but the character of the fellow customers and the ambiance is priceless. I recommend you stop in if you're looking for a unique piece of Buckeye."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try a new place for breakfast for my birthday.  I ordered a grilled ham and cheese sandwich and he ordered a burger.  Well, it was almost the hour when we got our food. My husbands burger was plain and the cheese was not even melted. My sandwich was ok.  It's a small place with not enough staff. The server was rushing back and forth and overall not a good ambiance."}
