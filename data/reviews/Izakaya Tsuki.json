{"text":"I love this restaurant! Great tasting food, amazing service and good quality. I have been to the restaurant many times now and always find the food I order to be good quality, fresh and worth the price.

Will definitely come back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I keep going back to the restaurant! 

This reviews over here are so honest because they reflect the truth! I went there twice already and planning to visit more times! Their sushi are so fresh and good in quality, and i love how they use a different kind of rice.  If you like fresh raw food, this place is amazing! And i love their cheesy chicken, and squid! Yum yum! Its not the cheapest you can get but you are paying for the quality. The only thing is food can come quite slow during weekends. Other than that its amazing!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place. Although the parking is a bit inconvenient as it IS on Yonge the food and the choices definitely made up for it. With the free wifi, this place became one of my must go's if I am in this area. In general the food quality is worthy of the price. Notably I find the Russian Roulette roll the most entertaining. Essentially a tuna avocado roll in 6 pieces (i believe) with a nice creamy sauce on top covering the ingredients, this order earned the name by replacing one of the roll to be a wasabi roll instead. I felt pretty bad for my friend which took the bullet (kinda bad but kinda glad I wasnt the one with it) and created a fun dish. Also, I was impressed with the okonomiyaki as well as the katsu which was in soup base for a while yet it retained its crunchiness."}
{"text":"Environment - not too loud tonight - probably cause it's Canada's day.  It is actually perfect for us.  

I think the food was much better than Guu.  

Favorite:  
1) Buttered Squid
2) Warayaki Salmon
3) Beef Tongue

4 oz hot sake was perfect for me tonight!!! 

We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times.  Every time, I have to say, I am very happy about it.  I see many photos are their signature dishes!   In general they are all excellent.   The other thing that I will highly recommend is the OX tongue.  I think it shall be one of the dishes in all Izakaya, but I am so surprise NOT many Izakaya in Toronto has it!  Tsuki  is one of the very few that serves.  Make sure you order it!!"}
{"text":"Their sewer system overflowed and as I went down to wash my hands before my meal, I lost my appetite. Menu doesn't have a good selection either."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, it feels like an izakaya should.

The food selection is good, they could expand their drink menu though, only two draught beers available (I believe sapporo and okanagan spring) and a couple cocktails. They do have a larger selection of higher priced sake. The prices are reasonable.

The food comes out on proper Japanese dinnerware, a small detail but it's nice not having the same generic corelle eggplant design dishes as every other 'japanese' restaurant- you know the ones.

We tried the creamy croquettes, yakisoba and a chirashizushi type dish which I believe was called tsukidon. The food was tasty and fresh. They gave us a complimentary dish of agedashi tofu.

I would give this restaurant 4 and a half stars, but since I can't I've rounded it up to 5.

Recommended, definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very authentic and atmospheric Izakaya. The food was delicious! We had the unagi kabayaki, ebi fry, and creamy croquettes.

We received a complimentary Hiyayakko tofu which was refreshing.

The unagi was cooked nicely and the sauce was a good complement. The ebi fry was super tasty and we were given more than the 5 pieces shown on the menu.

Definitely recommend the creamy croquettes - very flavourful with the potato and onion. If they also had corn inside, they would be even better!

Also had a small hot sake which was filled to the brim. The little sake cups were cute! The quality Japanese dishes that our food was served on were a nice touch.

A little pricey, but quality food. Recommended! =)"}
{"text":"Went there last night and was not dissapointed!

The food was good, we ordered the buttered squid (this is a must try! The sauce was heavenly), the chicken with cheese was just ok for me but the wife liked it, and the california don was good as well (just a bit too much on the mayo, but it was good overall). 
The service was good as well! They were very patient with our one year old's occasional nagging and seemed sincere in providing the service. 

Overall, we would definitely recommend this place to our friends and can't wait to go back to try their other foods."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere. Very dim. Good for couples and close friends. The food is good. Actually better than I expected lol. Anyway we kept ordering more and more so it's end up a little pricey....

Service is also good!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night and it wasn't very busy. It was near 8pm and there was only about 3 tables or so. I really like the atmosphere here, the restaurant is very dark and it feels very relaxing. 

Favourite items: 
Hamachi Wara - I reallly liked this, it was so good! I was so sad that the dish doesn't come with a lot. I liked it so much that I didn't mind ordering it again, however I wanted to try other items too so I didn't end up ordering it for a second time. 

Buttered Squid- I'm always a fan of squid dishes , and this was good

Items I would not order again:
Okonomiyaki - This was reallly bad! I know that okonomiyaki is usually oily, but this one was just way to greasy for my liking. It was greasy, and it lacked taste. I ate a piece only because the grease made me feel very uncomfortable and bloated. Everyone else who tried it said it lacked flavour and it was way too greasy.


Service: service was good since there weren't many tables there that night."}
{"text":"I ended up here because Kinton Ramen was packed and this restaurant was close by---good thing too because the food here was wonderful! The lighting was dim, the music was good and the crowd seemed nice and casual. I felt really comfortable here and the servers were nice. Butter squid and beef tataki were the tastiest of the night! I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Overall: Solid sushi with fresh fish, also purple rice.

I visited on a Sunday dinner and it was pretty quiet. The server was helpful and expedient in his service and the menu had a nice variety. I'm giving this place a 3 star because well...most things came down to about average. The ambiance is nice but nothing special, the price was slightly higher than average which accounted for the quality fish. Some people might like purple rice with their sushi but I didn't. I found it to be too dry for good sushi rice and lacked the flavor I've grown accustomed to for sticky sushi rice. Especially for this area this place doesn't really stand out above the crowd."}
{"text":"This place was good, however, I don't think it's as good as other izakayas in Toronto and for that reason I gave it a 3.  If you are looking for something in the Yonge/Sheppard area, then by all means give it a shot, but if you are willing to venture downtown, I would try Guu or Hapa.

Some of the stuff we ordered included:
Buttered squid - was expecting this to be amazing based on what others have said. It was good.
Cheese buldak - spicy chicken was okay, the cheese did not add anything special to the dish
Poutine - now I know you may think it's weird to go to a Jap restaurant and order poutine but this was my favourite dish - the fries were just the right amount of crispiness and the gravy had some sort of teriyaki type flavour to it - yum.
Ebi mayo - I've had better
Beef balsamic steak - my second favourite dish the sauce is really good."}
{"text":"1. cute tea cups
2. nice environment, which might seem too dark from the outside but its veeeery nice inside with cubicles that seperate different tables and give much more privacy
3. waiter was cute but would recommend not to greet in Japanese because we do not know what exactly he was saying (if by any chance he sees this comment)
4. I had sushi and sashimi. They are very fresh and soft ! 
5. Friend had ramen with pork, which I found too pork or egg taste. He liked it a lot. 
6. menu was kind of confusing with both English and Japanese. 
7. Drink menu was really long, but we did not drink.
8. Could try something different next time."}
{"text":"Being a fan of Izakaya-style restaurants, I decided to come here for a casual dinner with friends on a Friday night at about 9:30pm. I've been to Guu (both the Izakaya and Sakabar) and Don Don several times already and really enjoy the unique dishes.

The location is convenient with lots of parking on Yonge St. (which is free after 9pm!). There was no line so we didn't have to wait to be seated. The ambience is very relaxing, comfortable, and intimate with dim lighting. The service was excellent - the waitresses came around several times and we never had to wave them over.

Top items that we ordered and my rating:
Tsuki Don - Excellent and a must-try
Beef Sashimi - Excellent and a must-try
Buttered Squid - Good
Tako Yaki - Good

Overall, the uniqueness and tastiness of the dishes were not at the same level as Guu however, Izakaya Tsuki definitely gives you a great bang for you buck. The portions were much larger than I expected without compromising on quality. I would definitely come back again with friends to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Buttered Squid!

Best Thing I've EVER Eaten...I think..

Honestly I'm not even kidding I just simply am in love with it! 
I got introduced to it when I was pretty drunk and it tasted amazing that time i felt that the service was very fast!
We went there again  and it still tasted AMAZING!
And the service was still fast when I was sober :P
We tried a few other things and many are still on the list to try out.
My friend really liked the salmon wara yaki..I really didnt like that..
I really want to try the unagi kaba yaki but they never have it :(


I have come to the decision that I no longer want to share my buttered squid even with YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service. Definitely worth a visit when in Toronto.  The exterior is misleading. Give it a chance and you will be impressed."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much on the outside, but the inside has beautiful decor, great service, and excellent food. One of the better izakayas in Toronto. Extensive sake selection too!

Food comes out fast! Butter squid was indeed delicious, but alot of protein for one meal. Wish they had more veggie options, though they do have the classic edamame and seaweed salad, both of which are well flavoured.

Service was super on point - waiters and waitresses are always quietly scanning the tables and are ready to help you at the first sign of anything being needed, but don't feel intrusive at all. One waitress noticed that I was making a bit of an effort to squeeze the last drop of lemon juice onto my butter squid, and promptly brought me a bowl with more lemon slices. THAT's attention to detail!

Would definitely recommend as a great place for a group dinner or a cute date."}
{"text":"Since I'm the current duchess of this place, thought I should write a review.

I love the variety of their menu.  There's always new things to discover when I want to venture outside of my typical spicy salmon roll or california roll.  However, they also serve these staples.

My favourite items:
Hamachi Wara...WOW, WOW and WOW!
Ox Tongue...MMMMMMmm

I would go back just for these two things and build a meal around them!

The service is great and so is the ambience.  I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"My friend had really enjoyed his time here so when we wanted to meet up, he had recommended this place.

It's true - you always walk by this restaurant without another glance - it looks almost dingy with no one ever there. WRONG! When you enter, the space is huge and black.

It's best to order a couple of dishes here to share, but most of them are fried, greasy, and covered in Japanese Mayo. We had the Japanese pancake which was really yummy, but when we finished it, I could see all the oil on the plate. 

Prices here are quite reasonable - with a glass of decent red at $4.99!!! Probably it's no chianti but it did the job. What you really come here are for the Sake's - there is a whole page (with pictures) dedicated to all the glorious Sake's you can order. It's a fun place to go with groups.

Seating is pretty spacious. Bathrooms are down a precarious set of stairs that look like you're going to get jumped when you go down."}
{"text":"I've neglected this place for the past few years. COME AT ONCE. It was packed on a Friday night, with cool young Asians getting their buzz on. Come here for a nice date night or for a night of fun. Didn't drink however, but here's what I ordered. 

Tsuki Don: Sashimi bowl, it was so amazing! Coming back for more and it's topped with melt in your mouth salmon and tuna, avacado. 10/10 13$

Butter squid: infamous butter squid, flavoured with butter and soy sauce? And a spicy mayo for dipping sauce. Amazing. Would order again. 9/10 9$

Beef tataki: pretty good raw beef- first time having it at an izakaya and it was served with a salad with balsamic vinagrette. Would come back for this. 8/10 13$


Sashimi salad: amazing salmon and tuna pieces in a salad. Nowhere IVE been to in Toronto has tuna sashimi this good-and IVE had otoro in osaka. 8/10 10$

Ox tongue: I would stick to raw fish for this joint, it wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again when I come back. 7/10 9$

Come for the raw fish. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food and another star for the terrific staff 
The butter squid, Tsuki salad, and seafood pancake were very good
The portions are more than generous
The staff was helpful, friendly and very professional  
I mentioned that I was staying at hotel nearby and was told that they offer a 10% discount to the hotel guests"}
{"text":"Decor was unique at Izakaya Tsuki with nice red wood walls and lighting.  It is very dark inside as well if that is what you like.  Food quality was good and service is decent.  I got the Spicey chicken Ozen platter as well as the Tsuki Don.  Both were good and fair portion.  Will go back to try the seared tuna and the squid.  Place is in North York so expect to pay for parking most days."}
{"text":"This place is nice. Relaxing ambience and good service. I think most of the salient points have been covered by the previous reviewers, so I just wanted to add that anything on the menu with a word \"tsuki\" in it tasted amazing. The beef salad, the seared tuna sashimi and the humongous truski rolls (that my date appropriately compared to Russian style stuffed cabbage rolls) with tuna and salmon were all great. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the drinks menu should be expanded. After all it's supposed to be primarily a  drinking establishment."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh big sashimi.  Even the sushi (just fish on rice) is tasty cause they give you a big piece of fish on there. I've tried the bibimbap and it's delicious (they use fried egg instead of raw here).  I love the purple rice for everything. The sashimi salad bowls are delicious and filling on their own. Still haven't tried the rolls. Will need to experiment more.
Minus 1 for not having an option to order just sashimi with no sushi. And cause the sushi/sashimi plates are only available in large sharing sizes, not individual."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and it was pretty empty. 2 or 3 other tables when we arrived and only 1 when we left. 

The layout and service was great. The food in general was really good and portion sizes were good for the money. I do need to recommend stay away from the sushi and rolls as they are not as good as the other dishes. 

Ordered:

Buttered squid: really good and I will be back for this
Sashimi salad: also good. Dressing was nice and they are generous with the sashimi pieces. Good variety of greens too
Tongue appetizer: nice but pieces were tough. Won't order again
Seafood pancake: huge and delicious. Great value and this will also my be in my go to order 
Sashimi 18 piece: only ok. There wasn't enough variety. The pieces were cut too thick too. Taste was decent. I won't get this again mainly due to lack of variety. Mainly salmon and tuna which gets boring 
Rainbow roll: ok. Taste was decent but I'd have to say below average compared to what I'm used too. Too much rice
Fried sampler: this was great. Even though these were fried it was pretty light. 

So overall a good meal apart from the sashimi and roll. I'll definitively be back but will stick to the other stuff"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant really late at night and the food was delicious. My friend and I needed to eat a really late dinner and we were both satisfied. I tried the Tonkatsu Tamago Toji (Korean Egg Soup) and it was amazing!!!  I had never had an egg soup until this point in time and I was miraculously surprised at how good it was. I loved it!  I'm actually going to try and cook it at home. If I don't succeed, I will definitely be back to eat some more. 

My friend ordered sushi and a meat. They were also very happy with their meal. 

I gave this restaurant three stars because I didn't like the ambiance too much. 

The waitress was a doll though. :)

It's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Nice uptown Izakaya. This may be my new Izakaya go-to uptown, although I'm not sure if they can replace my don don. 

My only complaint is that it was a bit dark in there even during day time and they kept playing with the lights. The music was a bit loud I couldn't even hear the person across from me. The food was decent, my Izakaya favs/standard bars are salmon warayaki and takoyaki. The salmon warayaki was flavourful, full of smoky aromas, on the pricey side. Combined with a pinch of sea salt it was good texture and taste overall. The takoyakis were nice and small, I like it better than bigger ones that just have more air inside. The piece of octopus inside was then proportionally bigger. There was lots of fish shavings on top and decent amount of mayo and okonomiyaki sauce. Each bite had a good proportion of octopus, warm potato mash and sauce. Since there was only two of us we only tried two other things. Cheese Buldak: hot BBQ chicken with cheese, basically pieces of grilled chicken with hot Korean sauce topped with melted cheese. This dish was okay for me, I don't do so spicy. It wasn't too flavourful and the cheese didn't complement for some reason, I've had better. Also had the Tonkatsu Tamago Toji, fried pork chop with egg in broth. This was interesting to soak the Tonkatsu in broth and went well w the egg. Seems like a pork chop rice without the rice. 

The service was okay, I really like the interior decor, was a good bar atmosphere. It was spacious and can accommodate larger groups. Will definitely come back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Always great food and drink. Perfect place for dating, friends hangout, some snack and drink few"}
{"text":"great butter squid! had the sashimi salad, fried calamari cheese chicken thing and udon noodles. Great food and proportions. Had soju for the first time here, it was heated, and it tasted a little weird. Overall love the environment at night, however it could be a bit noisy. (PS. The waiters and waitress are hot!"}
{"text":"...i have dined at guu izakaya in vancouver, the one on church and the one on bloor in toronto. this place is a sigh of relief from the extreme guu noise and shouting, and the food is quite comparable and has a wide menu selection. SUPER BONUS: there's a picture for each item on the menu - i love pictures :)

we ordered:
saba mackerel grilled with salt, good.
gyu beef tongue, good texture, slightly lacking some flavor.
buttered squid, excellent.
octopus balls, good.
deep fried chicken, mediocre.
tsuki don, excellent. 

portions were decent and so are the prices, and will definitely go back again, love the tsuki don!"}
{"text":"Makes sense that they have a chain of restaurants.
I came here last month with a friend around 8pm on a Thursday. We ordered a couple of things: buttered squid (I have tried it in the past and loved it), sushi roulette (I think this is the name where there are 6 makis and one has an insane amount of wasabi), green dragon roll, and a chicken dish with cheese and a spicy sauce. 
The only let down of the night was the chicken dish (in my opinion). Portions did not add up to the price I was paying and there seemed to be too much happening on the plate. However, this may be because of how I prefer more \"traditional\" Japanese dishes. I liked how they used purple rice for the sushi. 
The wait time for the sushis did take a while but might have been due to the place being pretty packed (no line up still). 
Overall, I would recommend this place for its appetizers and sushis and probably lunch (what I had during my first visit).
Employees were polite as well.
Another con - small bathroom but this is common in Willowdale restaurants. 

Note: I heard this restaurant along with the plaza its in will be shutting down soon."}
{"text":"Visited on a Fri night around 10pm, got a table for 2. The place is a bit dark, and also a bit too noisy for my liking. It was tough to talk to my friend. The servers were tough to get a hold of even to get water. The place was busy with every single table taken. We ordered Unagi Kaba Yaki (Grilled Eel) $15, Buttered Squid (Squid grilled with butter and soy sauce $8 and Spicy Snail (Bai top snail with vegetable in spicy sauce, served with noodle) $15. The Spicy Snail was really spicy, which I personally didn't really enjoy tasted like kimchi. The food was good, but I wouldn't have made a trip to come here. I've been to Guu Izakaya where the food is much more unique, and Don Don Izakaya which was also quite good. We only ate here because we walked by."}
{"text":"Service and price was good and the sushi we had was pretty good as well. I'd go back.  PS they use purple rice for their rolls."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp, Jap foodie fanatic that I am, decided to try this place out. 

It was well...em...not going again kinda place. 

The Warayaki as previous reviewers recommended was really good, but the sashimi, sushi were not very fresh. I've definitely had better. 
I ordered, or tried to, a bottle of organic sake to try but they were out. That was the response for quite a few things ordered that night. 
Perhaps I'm being rash, maybe it was a bad night for them, but meh I've had much better for much more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday to get take out.  Bought the bib in bop for $9.99 and it tasted okay.  The amount wasn't that great but I was hungry.  Was going to give it 3 stars until I woke up in the middle of the night and had diarrhea.  I didn't have anything afterwards the same night so I'm sure it was the food that caused it.  Had diarrhea this morning as well.  A bit surprised since the place had pretty good reviews.  Won't be going there."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service. One of the best sushi places around and unlike many they offer some variety and unique dishes you won't find elsewhere.."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and us 2 girls can pig out! It costs more to order these little dishes than at a AYCE place, but the food was different and unique, so it was ok. I say the prices is on the higher side, most of the dishes we ordered was $9-$16 ish and they are pretty big, good for sharing. We ordered 6 dishes and was just right. 

The rice dishes was small, little rice but lots of toppings so thats good. sashimi was fresh and the squid was good, tuna dishes are also delicious, but i would skip the chicken and deep fried stuff,

I like the menu has pictures and lots of selection, I would return again.

This place is small, you can kind of hear conversations near you, it's not good for private chats.

There is parking lots near by, expect to pay around $5 for parking."}
{"text":"Wara Wara Wara Warayaki!  If only the diners could actually see the Straw Fire BBQ that would make the night for me but obviously it would have been a fire hazard but I would have been happy to sign a waiver like they do for Armaggedon Wings.  Seriously, Straw burning speaks excitement and outdoor festivals.  What's not to like?

Deep worn dark wooden tables along with deep reds of the wall panels set the tone for this evening.  If memory serves, the seats and the unused LCD screens are from it's predecessor.  Not only that, but the table setup stays the same without any remodelling whatsoever.  

No more MLB watching while Izakaya-ing I guess, but then what is the sole point of an Izakaya?  Alcohol!  Beer, Sake, Cocktail, Wine, Shochu, all on offer here but this Sunday night seemed a bit quiet.  Well, it seems that we find out from the friendly apologetic waitresses that it was quite a Saturday night the previous evening.  A few selections on the Menu were not available.   3.5 *Star*

Okay  -  Oden Nabe($9.99), Maguro Yuke($8.99), Tako Yaki($6.99), Tako Wasabi($3.99)

Good  -  Ankimo($8.99), Black Cod Yuan Yaki($9.99), Maguro Tataki($9.99)

More Please  -  Hamachi Wara($10.99)

Yes, first and foremost the presentation on every dish was simple-beautiful-unique and no single serving plate was duplicated which shows dedicated investment.  Observation is how most people consume Food first and it was quite pleasant both Food wise and waitresses too is a BONUS.

Secondly, Warayaki! That is as smokey as Bincho Yakitori which I'm obviously a Fan.  It's too bad that only Gyu Tongue, Salmon, and Hamachi are offered for Straw BBQ.  It's not cheap for the portion served but it's definitely something NEW for me to enjoy."}
{"text":"Service was good and price was reasonable. But don't think I'll come back. The food wasn't that impressive.. Got the deep fried oysters.. And it was all watery. The karage chicken was not what I had in mind. The only items I enjoyed was the squid and deep fried potato but it wouldn't be the factor that would make me go again. I also went to the bathroom and it wasn't that clean and the smell of the dirty washroom was so strong it made me sick."}
{"text":"Tried the squid and it was ok...a bit too salty for my liking. Bf ordered some dish w meat (can't remember which one) but he thinks they got the meat wrong.
I ordered the california don which was pretty good however not enough fish and the portion was too small for the price. 
Overall, really not worth the price of what I paid for that lunch. 

Environment was nice, and easy to talk to whoever you are with."}
{"text":"We all want to come for the Buttered Squid but it is not available at lunch time. If you ask Lia the wonderful waitress they might just yelp you out. Thanks because they did. The squid is marinated in soy and mayo.

They have Asahi Black beer but kind of crazy at $10 a bottle

The specialty rolls are large and very very good.

The Kaki Fry is Deep fried oyster served with Japanese tartar and salad

The  Green Dragon Roll is  Avocado on dynamite roll and the Red Dragon Roll is Salmon on dynamite roll.

This is really japanese pub food at its best and for those that want a korean twist they have that on the menu as well.

I found the rustic style of the space to be inviting and charmful. When the restauranteur takes the time and effort to make the place a great experience for its diners you know it can be a good time.

The best surprise was that they will package up any leftovers and I was TOTALLY THRILLED to find chopsticks, a knapkin and a packet of soy included. I could just take the bag from the fridge to my office and be all ready to go at lunchtime.

it is these little things that makes Tsuki a great place to eat

Good thing i dont live within walking distance because i would just eat there every night"}
{"text":"Decent food here. Prices are similar to other izakayas. We had the ramen, wasabi octopus, tako yaki and maguro tataki. Ramen will not be as good as the ramen restaurants but there were plenty of noodles. Would have appreciated more if they went lighter on the sauce for the tako yaki and maguro"}
{"text":"So I must compare this one against the one in Richmond Hill. In short, this one isn't as good as the one in RH. The staff is quite friendly but the food is not as good.

What did I have?
Sashimi Salad and Salmon Tataki - they almost taste the same.
Chirashi Don - The sashimi on this dish is quite fresh and tasty.
Buttered squid - A go to here but rather forgettable

What was good?
Chicken Teriyaki - While this is like eating in a foodcourt, it tasted really good.
Okonomi Yaki - I don't think this tasted too traditional, but it still tasted good.

There is parking in the back though it is pay. Their prices are a bit cheaper than a more famous izakaya counterpart and with the moving in down the street, it'll be tough. But they are cheaper I'm pretty sure.

Also good about this place is while it's not quiet, it's not as noisy either. It s a good place to get on this snack craze in T.O."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant based on the yelp reviews and it was a pretty good choice!  Loved the atmosphere - not too noisy like Guu.  Servers were attentive and the food came out pretty quick.   Portions are decent size and good for sharing.

Overall, I would definitely eat here again :)"}
{"text":"Delicious indulgence.

Be it squid, hamachi, mushrooms or sushi it is an absolute delight for your tastebuds!

Every time I go in there I feel that it is a true festival of flavours and everyone is invited. I love going there with friends and ordering as many different appetizer dishes as we can eat.

Food -
My favourites are tuna (I believe there are 3 different tuna dishes on menu, it is all good) and taro ice-cream. And I am not a desert person. Their taro ice-cream is that amazing."}
{"text":"It is Friday dinner time! What shall we eat? Let's eat at Izakaya Tsuki!

ENVIRONMENT
It's Friday night and it is very loud in there.
But it's a \"Izakaya\" after all, so the level of noise was expected.
The servers were friendly and often came by to check our table.
This place is not actually Japanese, as the food has mixture of both Korean style and Japanese style.

FOOD
Me and my friend ordered three things
1) Buttered Squid
2) Tsuki Don
3) Bibimbap

First of all, Buttered Squid very delicious! Though it didn't really have butter flavor in it. It was more like soy sauce flavor and mayonnaise flavor. But yeah overall it's very good! Get this when you come here. It's just $9

Second of all, Tsuki Don was delicious, but for $13 it was small portion. By girlfriend who can't eat a lot wanted more after she finished one.

Third of all, Bibimbap was just typical Korean Bibimbap. For $10 I was expecting decent portion, but it turned out to be pretty small. 

PRICE
I think this place is a little bit over-priced. Their food was not really authentic Japanese food, yet they charged quit a bit.  Also beware that their food portion are small. So one person might even need to spend more than $25 to get full.
This place is more suitable for getting some snacks and liquor rather than getting dinner."}
{"text":"Went last weekend with a friend and had a lovely time!  The waiter we had was very friendly and when we asked him about some things we had to try, he suggested the buttered squid, tatakis, and some fried plates.  I wasn't feeling too well that night so we tried the first two and some other Korean styled soup bowl he suggested.  The buttered squid and beef tataki were AWESOME.  Korean styled soup was ..interesting.  It consisted of a very thick soup with some seafood in it (squid, shrimps, and mussels).  I was a little bummed out about the fact that the mussels weren't fully open (aka fully cooked) and the soup lacked a bit of flavour.  I think I was expecting it to be like an udon so I was completely thrown off by it.  However, everything else was delicious!  Would definitely go back and give it another try!"}
{"text":"Love this quaint little Izakaya restaurant in Willowdale!

I've been here approximately 4-5 times and it has never disappointed me! The wait staff is friendly and the atmosphere is dim, so it can feel a bit \"romantic\" but it's great for a group of friends as well. It's not a loud environment, so you can have a clear conversation while enjoying and sharing your food with others.

I've been here with my partner as well as a group of coworkers. I've ordered the following and all have been very flavourful and cooked well.

Tako Wasabi (8/10)
Tuna tataki (8/10)
Ebi Mayo (10/10)
Sushi and sashimi (9.5/10)
Yaki Soba (6.5/10)
Udon in soup (8/10)
Spicy sashimi salad (10/10)
Grilled buttered squid (10/10)

As for pricing, it's a bit more expensive to come here  vs. a regular sushi restaurant or AYCE place. However, I would highly recommend coming here at least once in a while to get away from the mediocre and to try something fresh and better quality!

BTW..they recently promoted this polar/frozensapporo beer with extra slush on top. I don't recommend it and I don't recommend paying an extra dollar for it.  My partner and I tried it and you're basically getting more \"head\" (i.e., frothy part of the beer) than the actual beer itself.  Only get it if you like that part of the beer... Otherwise, you're just waiting for the head to dissolve, which could take a while because it's frozen! :P"}
{"text":"I love the location, because many of my friends reside in downtown and this is a great place to meet halfway. It is minutes from the subway station and very close to the 401, making it easy for the suburbans to meet up with their downtown dwelling friends more! The place how ever is medium sized and has cute intimate setting. Great for groups six or under, although I am sure they can accommodate larger groups. The have a cute patio in the front, which is closed for the winter obviously. 

After reading reviews on YELP! I decided to try the wasabi octupus, and it was delicious! I absolutely loved it , for many reasons . It was something new and unique that I hadn't tried before, it was very tasty, and it was under $5. I liked it so much that we ordered it twice! The bibimbap pot was good, tasty yet simple. We also ordered the Maguro Tataki (tuna), good but the pieces were very thin in my opinion. The teriyaki fries were nice too. 

Overall the meal paired with a Japanese beer did not disappoint at all! In fact the food made the night very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I visited here on a slow weekday at a slow hour, which probably explained why the service was really quick considering we were two of the only customers there.  Unlike the larger izakayas like Guu or Don Don which would cater to groups better, I think this is more for parties of two if you don't want your food super delayed

Beef Tataki - Tasted so fresh with the spicy radish!  9/10 I usually don't like beef tartare/sashimi for the raw taste, but this one was just right :)
Pork Kimchi Duruchigi - Very flavourful mostly because of the spicy kimichi, standard Korean dish taste but it helped fill us up since the rest of our dishes had the reg. small izakaya portions!
Gyu Tongue - It was cooked well but seasoning was really lacking, we finished it by dipping the tongue with the pork kimichi sauce per above... 
BC Tuna Herb Yaki - My favourite at the dinner, it was semi-cooked and the buttered soy sauce made the tuna melt in my mouth :3  Highly recommend!

Would come back again to try other items on the menu in the future :)"}
{"text":"Everything tasted fine but nothing to write home about. We shared the smoked hamachi, tsuki don, hot BBQ chicken with cheese, squash poutine, and takoyaki. I would recommend skipping the chicken (definitely not worth $16) and poutine (more like tempera squash in curry sauce). There are other options on this street with better tasting and more attractive menu items. Service was what you expect from a bar - forget a few items or requests here and there. although no major complaints - it was simply mediocre."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner recently. It was AMAZING!!!! It was a saturday evening but it was not busy at all. Most patrons probably come here for drinks I guess?

The food and service was exceptional. Gorgeous presentation and we liked the intimate setting.

We ordered...

Tofu Steak - nice tasty and soft
California Don - this was my favourite. It's got avocado, crabmeat with rice.
Spider Rolls - 11 pcs fo $11 ? Def not bad :)

I forgot what my friend ordered. It was delish too! 

Price is a little higher than what I'm used to paying (cuz hey I'm Chinese and I love to score deals at AYCE). But it was totally worth it! 

Can't wait to be back soon!"}
{"text":"My friends and I (party of 8) came here on a rainy Friday night for a birthday celebration. 

This particular izakaya stood out as it offered reasonable prices on the menu and wide selection compared to some other izakayas such as Guu. In addition to traditional Japanese choices, there were also some key Korean dishes. We ordered a the buttered squid, octopus balls to share as well as chirashi, rolls and bibimbap for entrees. The selection is perfect for sharing with a large group. Overall however, the service was poor which resulted in only 3 stars.

Food:
The chirashi was small, with purple rice and only a few slices of fish. However, I thought the fish was very high quality. For only $14 I would say this is a reasonable price for a nice light meal. The buttered squid was larger than I expected, and very tasty. Overall I was the food was reasonable for the price but you may want to order a few appetizers with an entree due to smaller portions.

Service:
This is where the restaurant failed in my opinion. All the dishes came at random times (over the span of 15 minutes) for our group of 8, resulting in some of the food getting cold. Maybe they were not able to handle such a large crowd, but the buttered squid also arrived very late, when everyone was already done their meals. On the bibimbap, they had asked if we wanted an egg, but the dish arrived without an egg. The waiters rarely visited us to refill our waters and were generally not attentive to our needs. 

If you're looking for a reasonably priced izakaya place, I would recommend trying this out. Otherwise I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for Valentine's Day and made reservations about an hour ahead. We've driven by this place quite often but never really thought of stopping by to try it. Glad we finally did though! 

Right as you enter you are greeted by all the staff in the restaurant. We didn't really like the seats we were given as we kept feeling the breeze. Thankfully the restaurant wasn't packed yet and our waitress gladly switched us further away from the door. We were offered tea right away to warm up and started looking for what to order. I really liked the fact that almost every item on their menu had a picture to represent it visually. The only items that weren't were the maki and sushi that I guess everyone is used to seeing. This made our picking items that much easier.

We definitely decided to try the grilled squid, as so many people have yelped about how delicious it is. I decided to get the ramen soup, he got a massive seafood noodle dish (with shrimps, calamari, etc.) and we also ordered a spicy salmon roll (which I think was made with brown rice). One of the waiters came up to us so happily to tell us that they were serving a special Valentine's Day drink for only 4$. It was a lemony slushy drink that tasted really yummy. The table next to us saw them and decided to order them too!

The food was incredible. The ambiance was very romantic, even though it is a small place. But, the best thing about this place was hands down the service. We were made to feel very special. All the waiters were very attentive and ensured that we had a wonderful time. Always smiling and asking if everything was okay.

I will definitely be back here and bring my friends and family to try the food here. If you like Korean and Japanese food, this is definitely a great place to go."}
{"text":"Everything tastes really good!! My favorites are the bbq chicken with cheese, the beef sashimi, the tako wasabi, takoyaki and the sashimi. The quality of the sashimi here is really good.

the service is also really good!

The reason it's only 4 stars instead of 5, is because I've tried both the cocktails, the cassi (?) and the sawa, both of which werent tasty at all. I would definitely not recommend the cocktails. 

Otherwise, it was a pleasant experience. I went for a birthday gathering and they even played a cool happy birthday song on their central speakers which was great!! :)"}
{"text":"Great & attentive service - the hostess was ready with our menus as we walked in.

Korean BBQ Pork Ozen Platter - Good portion of fresh salad accompanied with a nice tangy dressing. The purple was cooked perfectly and not too soft, and the korean bbq pork was tender and has a nice kick to it.

Bulgogi Ozen Platter - Again great salad and purple rice. However the bulgogi was a bit overcooked, otherwise it would've been great.

I would definitely come back, for the decor was nice and the service was great!"}
{"text":"More Korean than Japanese, still this place is a nice little joint with great food, and open late too! I'd eat here again, and I'd bring a dat me here if I had one."}
{"text":"The menu has a little bit of Korean and a little bit of Japanese including plenty of sushi and sashimi options. There are pictures for every item on the menu, which is helpful. 

The piece de resistance is the Buttered Squid. The taste and consistency is typical of what you would expect from calamari but the presentation is quite unique. The whole squid is seared and horizontally cut. This was one of the more interesting things I've eaten for under $10. 

Yaki Soba with bacon is oily and bland. Seafood nogorooni was also quite bland. Udon was very good."}
{"text":"I love Izakaya! I love Japanese food! I love having a drink and hanging out with friends! I love nice dark atmosphere! 

I am glad that Izakaya Tsuki opened up at North York.. the previous restaurant Ehwa has sub-par food and services.. and Now Izakaya Tsui has excellent food and services. 

Tako Wasabi ($ 3.99) 
- presented nicely in a martini glass.. looking closely the raw octopus does look like something straight out from Fear Factor... 
- but of course it tasted 100% much better than it looks.. nice chewy fresh with a hint of wasabi 

Black Cod Yuan Yaki ($ 9.99) 
- I love Cod Fish! Yuan Yaki is style of cooking with fish first marinated with yuzu and soy sauce then grilled 
- great to enjoy some sake with! 

Hamachi Wara ($10.99) 
- Hamachi lightly cooked supposed to eat with a pinch of salt, fresh onion and garlic and wasabi 
- hmmm My friend's eyes just lit up just tasting that! I know that it is good stuff!! 

Services here is wonderful and attentive. And the atmosphere is great for a date or to hang out a bit before or after dinner... Prices are on the more expensive side.. but for the quality of food it is well worth the money!"}
{"text":"I would eat butter squid here every day if I could.  It's by far the best grilled squid I've tried...no idea how they make it but I'd steal the recipe if given the opportunity.  You should go here just to order it.  

Izakaya is on our weekly rotation.  It's always consistent, and we've never had anything bad here, or even off the mark really.  The sushi is pretty uninspired, but it's fresh, the portions are large, and the prices are very reasonable.

The bi bim bap dolsot is good, but the egg is fried and placed on top, rather than cracked on top as is the traditional method.  Probably a food safety thing, but, in the words of Austin Powers, I like to live dangerously...

They're open late, they have beer, wine & sake, and good food.  Can't beat it."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday night. It was a beautiful and quiet place. The waitress is nice and looks cute lol

We ordered sashimi plate, boiled mussel, and Takoyaki (octopus ball). The sashimi was great. Very fresh, and good value for the price. Mussels taste good too, but in a different way than those roasted ones served in bars as they don't put much strong flavours in it. The Takoyaki is not as impressive though, I think it would have tasted better if they can make the balls' surface softer.

Overall it's a cute and chill place! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I was hungry and it was late.
 
Tried it out and it was good.  Not sure if I would go again.
The restaurant is amongst many good restaurants.  
It doesn't stand out, but does the job when you are there."}
{"text":"After watching the performance of Memphis at Toronto Centre for the Arts (mind blowing), we came here for dinner.

It was about.. 6ish, we were the only ones there. Three people came in at about 7:30. I love the dim lighting and empty sake bottles as decor.

Darn! They don't have their menu online.... So my apologies, I don't remember at all what we got. But I remember we had soba noodles and it was soooooooooooooooo good. Sashimi pieces were thick too!

Absolutely enjoyed it here! Service was excellent. $50 dinner, for two.

I also poured tea straight onto my boyfriend's hand completely missing the cup, luckily it wasn't boiling hot."}
