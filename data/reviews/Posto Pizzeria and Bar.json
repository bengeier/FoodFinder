{"text":"I fist-pumped the air when Posto was voted as the best pizza in Calgary. While there are some consistently good and great competitors out there in YYC, this is up with the best of the lot from my pizza-lover travels, including Flatbread company's Mopsy's Kalua Pork pizza (in Paia, on Maui), and a few excellent pizzas had while backpacking through Tuscany. I only take good friends and good people here because it is my favourite place to eat in all of Calgary and what will probably be either what keeps me here or what I will miss most (beyond friends) if I ever had to leave. The crust is perfection in texture - light but crispy, moist but hardy. I love sitting up at the bar, basking in the ambience of this intimate restaurant and watching the pizza wizards and witches work their magic with the dough. They work with precision and deftness to ensure a beautiful and flavourful work of pizza art that glistens in the dimmed electric dazzle of their retro lampshades. Everyone I bring quickly converts into a Posto-lover as well, and I would highly recommend this as a perfect place for a special date -one that feels like fine-dining without quite the fine-dining price tag. Also, it's worth it to order more pizza than you think you can eat because you'll probably want to take extra home for later!"}
{"text":"A very cozy place to relax and enjoy good food.
Extraordinary friendly staff who care about their guests and go above and beyond to make sure they're having a pleasant time. Thank you."}
{"text":"Went here for valentines day dinner after reading good things and it lived up to the reviews. The pizza is amazing, better than any of its kind of tried so far! I had the one with egg, squash and rapini my boyfriend had the all meat number 4 and both were delicious. We ate half for dinner and half for breakfast the next morning! The only thing that could make this place better is if they installed 2 person booths along the wall and put there server station at the back as it interferes with an otherwise excellent seat right at the window. I will be back to try a main dish!"}
{"text":"Best traditional thin-crust pizza in Calgary. Very unique flavors and interesting combinations of ingredients. I always get the gorgonzola-fig pizza or the potato-leek one. Both are excellent. The crust is slightly salted which gives it an extra savory taste. Never had a bad pizza from here yet!"}
{"text":"Always consistently delicious thin crust pizza and wine. My favourite is their mushroom pizza with an egg on top! Service is consistently good as well."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! Excellent food, very high quality, and the service was friendly and fast. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place as it had good ratings.  I will never go back.  First off... Charging 10.00 for a gin and tonic, that's just a little ridiculous.  Second off the special for the night was horrible.  They said lobster risotto was the special...so I ordered it and got lobster broth. Again just a little ridiculous.  My boyfriend order a pasta dish and substituted the mussels with more vegetables.  When it came out it was pasta with some vegetables with no flavour and to top it off the pasta was swimming in water. Again just a little ridiculous.  When we mentioned this to the bartender she shrugged it off and said well that's what the kitchen calls the food.  Hahahaha I'm sorry what? That's your response? Not a sorry... Nothing.  This place is way over priced and not worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city! They serve most delicious pizza - it is hard to say which part of pizza is better: dough or toppings. Service is spotless: welcoming staff (and they are not tiresome!), fast and professional. Posto simply feels like home."}
{"text":"We live close by and typically drop by for a casual dinner with our toddler. He loves sitting at the bar and watching the pizza chef in action.  The staff and pizza chef are always very friendly and he loves coming here.  The pizza's are light and delicious. It is a little cozy but they always seem to find room.  The patio is a plus in the summer!"}
{"text":"A group of us showed up on Halloween Friday without a reservation and the posto team happily rearranged tables to accommodate us. The service was outstanding and the food even more spectacular.  We were treated like kings and beyond.  All of us in the group work in the service industry as well and have a tendency to be hyper critical but in this case every one of us left delighted.  The tomatoes on the prosciutto pizza tasted canned and over powered the overall dish but other than that the food was phenomenal, spot on, simple and tasty.  We were recommended the pumpkin mezza luna (perogies basucally) and were not disappointed. The lamb pizza pop was delicious enough to inspire a person to \"smoke a little\" just so I could munch put on a few more. Also the fact that there is a \"pizza pop\" on the menu is incredible.  The desserts that were brought to the table were divine.  Mini \"doughnuts\" with a chocolate days and a tiramisu with the perfect balance of soggy to not soggy and so incredibly flavourful. 
I have definitely found my new favorite spot for pizza and will be back sooner than later.  Thank you posto for a truly excellent experience."}
{"text":"First found this gem on the App .... \"It's Date Night\".   Decided we wanted pizza and a glass of wine after a rather long work week. Arrived at the restaurant about 6:00, no reservation. They sat us at the bar - which was kinda kewl. We chatted with the bar tender (Christian) he was most helpful and knowledgable.  I had pizza (their number five) and my wife had the housemate tagliatelle. Both were fantastic!! Without a doubt the best pizza I have EVER had. The crust was light and jam pack full of flavor. Then add the chicken, pesto, red peppers, goat cheese and a drizzle of spicy oil. Be prepared to ohhhhhh and ahhhhhh. My wife wanted a recommendation on a white wine, Christian offered her several small sample tasting sizes and she found the perfect wine. We both loved our meals then we had a fantastic ice wine plus amazing deserts. Not going to share what we actually had ..... That is something you must discover for yourself.  Enjoyed the meal so much ... They have a \"thank the kitchen and buy them a round\" for $20. So we did. Felt great!  We will certainly be back to Posto. You are our new favorite pizza place, and thank you \"It's Date Night\"."}
{"text":"Went there for half price pizza Sunday, this place is very busy so luckily we got a table! I would definitely ring in advance.. Pizzas here are superb real fresh ingredients, delicious and very friendly service too"}
{"text":"Yum. Too many delicious looking choices but did not disappoint. Salad and pizza were excellent. Service and atmosphere also fab. Check out parking out back for when you come for lunch."}
{"text":"This one is in contention for the belt.  Pizza is damn near perfect. You can tell when a place takes pride in their ingredients and imports what is necessary to get the right flavour.  The prosciutto and olives just seemed on another level.  

I like how the pizzas are just listed from 1-10...no fancy names required and it means that they can change the selections regularily if one doesn't seem to work.  I got the #3 with garlic, shallots, chanterelle mushrooms and spinach in a light cream sauce and I added prosciutto for 2 bucks. It was insanely good and the only reason I didn't crush the whole pizza was because everyone else only ate half.  

Will definitely be back with a vengeance!  As long as they don't get too trendy and wimp out on making quality pizzas...or sell the joint to some hipster...either will not go over well"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and great service.  I am vegetarian and they always take care of me.  Nice wine list too!"}
{"text":"Posto Posto Posto.....you are doing something right.

My friend brought me here...he's becoming a bit of a regular and has been talking Posto up for quite awhile. He's usually a good judge of these things but I wanted to see for myself.

Well...the food was fantabulous. We split the kale salad to start. It was amazing...great texture, huge flavour and aromatic to boot. I had the scallops and my friend had the beef cheek dish. Both were lovely. Well plated, well constructed and flavourful. The service was awesome - friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. And the wine was fine. They have created a great environment that mixes special, well thought out dishes with a comfortable environment. It seems to be a great spot for a date or for catching up with friends.

I will certainly be back to try other things soon!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in calgary! Great service and awesome wine selection. Havent had anything on the menu that we didnt like! Also amazing specials!"}
{"text":"I've been to Posto several times and this place never disappoints! I usually get pizza and 1 is enough to feed 2 people. If you can't resist the amazing flavours then go ahead with 1 each, but be warned, your future self will curse your life if you finish that whole pie alone! (Not because of the taste of course, just based purely on volume.) But hey, that's future you's problem, am I right? ;p

The last time I was at Posto (for Sled Island music festival 2016) I had their festival feature:
A pizza w/ roasted red pepper pesto, Alberta lamb merguez sausage, goat feta and topped with fresh arugula. Yum!!
(Their blog has a nicely lit photo of it)

I love this pizza very much! The sausage was my favourite part. It wasn't dry, you can taste the lamb, and it's packed with flavour. Whatever spices they put in that sausage worked so well with the lamb; complementing the flavour without overpowering or masking it. My date really loved the goat feta, it's a soft cheese sprinkled over the pizza with the fresh arugula. There might also be some baked on the pizza but I'm not sure about that. Either way it was delicious!

The crust was spot on. It was thin but not super thin, stayed crunchy on the bottom, and not soggy or droopy at the tip of each slice. It has good flavour and just the right amount of chew (for me anyway.)

If you're still hungry after the pizza, get the $6 Happy Ending dessert. It's several individual desserts all on their own beautiful little plate. That's about the price of 2-3 macarons at any fine bakery for 6-8 individual amazing little treats of equal quality at Posto!

Alright, we all know nothing's ever perfect so even though I'm giving this place a 5 star rating here are the lows of my last visit:
I do NOT recommend the Grana Frico Chips to start. They cost $8, you only get a few, and more importantly, they aren't as good as any old cheese cracker/chip! That includes Doritos and Cheetos. Poor comparisons maybe since both Doritos and Cheetos are probably more artificial addictive drug than real food, but for the price of 2 bags of either, the cheese chips at Posto fall short! :(
Save that $8 and put it towards their antipasto board or meatballs, both are for sure worth a try!

Bad news #2
This one is purely subjective (not that everything else I've said is purely objective but you get what I mean.) For all the cocktail lovers out there: feel free to skip the Old Fashioned at Posto! It just didn't agree with me. I've tried many, many versions of this classic cocktail before (home made and in restaurants/bars) but something about this just doesn't jive with me. My date also felt this way and the Old Fashioned is his favourite cocktail!
I did LOVE the 2nd cocktail on their list though: Eau Claire gin, elderflower water, mint, lemon, lime, ginger and bitters. My perfect mojito! Yes, gin instead of rum! *shock* ;)

In summary:
I love this place! Any pizza is a good choice, it's enough food for 2, and in case you have room at the end order the Happy Endings dessert! If you want starters I recommend the antipasto board or the meatballs.
Enjoy a drink with dinner, great wines of course but also some nice cocktails (maybe skip the Old Fashioned though.) The staff is warm and friendly, service is great, this is a staple favourite of mine! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is awesome. They make fresh sourdough everyday for the crusts. Awesome."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Service not so great for such a small restaurant. Overall ambiance was really quite nice. Big fan of the pizza, we had the spinach / mushroom / shallots but every pie that came out of that oven looked awesome. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Posto is the newest establishment from the Bonterra group and serves artsey Mediterranean/Italian and pizza creations.

Attached to Bonterra (possibly sharing the same kitchen) Posto is intimate and modern with a menu full of hipster-like descriptions of rabbit stews, pastas and flatbreads.

The margarita-style pizza I got here is quite good, flavorful, thin while still being tender crust, well seasoned and a good size.

The dinner menu falls a bit short of the pizza menu with portion sizes that don't match the price tags; however, if you aren't too hungry, what the dinner menu lacks in portion size, it makes up for in unique combinations. The Halibut my dinner partner ordered was well prepared and presented and served with a peas, cheese and capers-stuffed pastry which was nice. 

Interesting selections abound at Posto and I would recommend it if you are looking for a tiny adventure into Mediterranean-inspired artistic food; but stick to the flatbreads if you want to feel full.

T."}
{"text":"The. best. pizza. Posto makes the best pizza in Calgary, and dare I say it, Canada. I understand that saying that is bold and that everyone has different tastes but their thin crust pizza is topped with amazing ingredients, the crust is crisp and chewy at the same time, there is a hint of sourdough and the homemade chili oil that accompanies it is the perfect compliment. I always get the number 10 (prosciutto and arugula) but have also had their mushroom (number 3), pesto chicken (number 5) and daily special pizzas. They are all amazing. I come here every time I am in Calgary, and when I lived there, it was a twice a month habit. One of the places I miss the most about Cowtown."}
{"text":"Very cozy restaurant.  Both pizzas we tried - the sausage, apple, frisee, tomato pizza and the pineapple, gorgonzola, pancetta, fresno chilies - were fantastic and had great flavor. The pineapple was the group favorite.  However, the wine selection, antipasto platter and service left something to be desired. Wine selection: most bottles of wine are quite expensive and did not appear to be the best selection for a pizza place.  Antipasto platter: while the cheeses and meat on the platter were excellent, the amount offered was quite sparse for the price. Service: We had a 9pm reservation but we were not seated until 9:30 and the staff seemed quite frazzled."}
{"text":"A true disappointment.

We made reservations for four in anticipation of a nice, relaxing meal at a good restaurant.

As you can already tell, it didn't work out that way.  We sat on the patio, which was fine but a little close to a dumpster that was full and was not better for the sun all day.  This is something they should look at.

After being seated and ordering drinks - 3 beers and a water - they took 20 minutes to arrive.  The service, while friendly, was simply not good.  That was consistent throughout the meal.  The restaurant was not crowded, which made the poor service even more difficult to understand.

We had two appetizers, which were tasty - the meatballs and the arancini.  

Then came pizza.  We ordered two pizzas at the same time.  Once came out burnt, and the other showed up some time later.  There appears to a be a quality control issue with the pizza, as well as a process issue.  Bringing dishes when they are ready is fine if the dishes are being shared.  It is a touch awkward when they are not.  While this may ease the pressure on the kitchen and servers it is a poor way for four people to enjoy dinner.

We walked away from Posto with a vow not to return.  It is too bad, because it has the potential to be quite good.  Before that happens though, they need to take a hard look at their processes and training."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time at Posto!  Great food, great wine, the service was a tiny bit slow, fantastic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Made a point to have lunch at Posto on my way to Banff, and boy was I glad I stopped in. A very nice atmosphere, with friendly, helpful (and enthusiastic!) staff. I had a glass of Village Brewery beer, which was a great way to start. It only got better with the goose prosciutto with pistachios as a starter - it was fantastic. For the main event, I had the \"ten\" pizza, with prosciutto, fiore di latte, arugula, grana padano, and it was amazing - a great flavour combination with fresh and bright ingredients. Loved everything about this place, and would love to go back when I'm next in Calgary."}
{"text":"Overpriced, somewhat boring, mostly just really bad food.  It's not the worst you'll ever eat, and it probably won't make you sick, however you should still keep some extra money after you eat here so you can go to McDonalds and get something better."}
{"text":"Tried the number 4. It was great! My two other friends got 3 and 5 and I think they were even better. Service was great and overall mood and atmosphere was suiting."}
{"text":"Great hospitality here! We rolled in at 10:20pm, and had amazing service throughout our visit.  Great pizzas and combos. Highly recommend this place for later in the evening dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely great value for your money. Food is definitely 5 start quality. Reminds me of the great restaurants you would dine in such as Hawksworth or West. Ambience is dressed down and service more casual. Food was divine. Appy - figs wrapped with proscuitto perfect portion. Well, well worth it! Entree - spaghetti bolognese is not your typical ragu. great mix of meats. some smoky flavours and a bite of black pepper. Absolutely perfect. Desert - canoli had the right blend of pistachios and orange essence. Why did not not come here sooner. My go to next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Posto was a most unexpected and delightful dining experience. Let me just start with noting that we did not even have one of their unique and artfully assembled pizzas. Instead, chef Ben spent a few hours wowing us with the most unique and flavorful small plates that one could never anticipate. 

I'd be remiss to recount the dishes as I am certain I could not do justice to the description of these wonderful Italian tapas. Suffice to say they ran the delicious gamut between breads, vegetables, cheeses, poultry, sausage, prawns, and lamb, all with complex and delicious flavor profiles. 

And as if that were not enough, he finished with an encore of lovely desserts ranging from infused white chocolate, zabaglione, strawberry panna cotta and chocolate mousse with hazelnuts and cherries. Bravo to Chef Ben and to all the servers who made us feel like we were part of their family. 

Go to Posto for their fabulous pizzas, then go again for this one-of-a-kind experience for which you would otherwise need to travel to Italy."}
{"text":"Rats.  Been once and loved it.  Tried to book (2 weeks ago) for 8 of us and they don't take reservations for more than 6 but was told to just 'show up early and it shouldn't be a problem'.  So i left work at 4 to get there to grab a table.  All the tables were booked - for sets of 2 and 4's.  I had to call my 8 friends to redirect them, nothing was suggested as an alternative, even Bonterra was booked.  My issue is, why not book for 8?????  It's just 2 tables of 4 - i could have just called and booked 2 tables of 4 under two different last names!  It seems ludicrous!  What a frustrating evening.  It was really disappointing and i won't be back"}
{"text":"The pizza is quite amazing, I definitely recommend it. There's a lot of unique flavors. Only downsides are is that it is quite expensive for the size of pizza, and drinks are expensive as well."}
{"text":"Let me just go ahead and curate the perfect evening for you at Posto.

You walk in and you're greeted by Sammy, whose whole face lights up as if you're a long lost friend. He's so delighted to see you and you know you've made the right decision to come here this evening. Good job, Anastasia B.

Once seated, reward yourself with a drink. You can share a bottle of wine if you're civilized or keep the whole thing to yourself if you're not. Have a cocktail or three. They make 'em good.

Start with an order of perogies. \"But my family grew up making homemade Ukrainian perogies,\" you weakly protest. Your grandma doesn't make them this good, and she would agree. Also these come with bacon jam. So maybe get two orders; they're big but there's only three and it's probably unlucky to split a perogy.

Order a salad. There's a truckload of carbs coming your way so you'll want to cut that goodness with some greens. Or more alcohol. 

Order a couple of pizzas. Yes, there's a wait. The pizzas are lovingly made to order before they're placed into their wood-fired oven. That's why we ordered the appetizers whilst your pies are grilled to fruition. Get the pizza number 3: spinach, shallot, garlic, wild mushroom, and grana padano. Pretty orgasmic. By now you've had a few to drink and you're feeling pretty good so you add prosciutto and an egg. Sammy knowingly smiles, maybe there's even a wink. You bask in his approval. Order this pizza again and you'll need a cold shower afterwards.

Speaking of happy endings, there's dessert! For $6 or $8... I forget, it's pretty hazy after a bottle. Anyway. For a nominal fee, you can leave your dessert fate up to the Posto Gods and they'll create the perfect ending to your perfect date. 

Fin."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Sometimes a bit pricey, but reasonable if you look at their specials ahead of time. Overall, been there several times and it is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a great little place.  Very Italian, but then when you are going for the experience, that is perfect.  I like that they stick to the Italian food, wine and style.

We had the Antipasto plate for $24 shared. It was amazing....great food and presentation. A nice basket of bread for $2. Wine was great at $11/glass.  Would suggest this place anytime."}
{"text":"Omg you have to try this pizza. The dough is perfection!  Service is great too. Very ffiendly staff. Ordered pickup."}
{"text":"I work close to Posto, and have been a few times now. Posts is the more casual side of the wonderful Bonterra restaurant located just next door.   The decor is warm - lots of woods, and darker but warm colours.  Along the one side is a small bar top ( where you can sit and eat as well) and the open kitchen where you can see the team working on the food.   Every time I have been in, it has been busy, which brings me to the service.
  My first visit, the service was great - and we were even greeted by one of the owners who was super nice and seemed genuinely interested in how we were enjoying our meals. My second visit, the service was quite bad - our waiter never seemed to be around, and seemed to be moving in slow motion- it was frustrating, especially considering it was over the lunch hour. My most recent visit was good - great service, and I was glad I returned, to give it another shot. 

So onto the food - as a vegetarian I always am on the lookout for stuff I can enjoy. I had the basic pizza - a great gauge of the quality of the sauce and crust. I have to say, the pizza is wonderful. The sauce is simple yet so fresh and vibrant. The cheese is beautiful too - simple fresh mozzarella. The crust is excellent - Not too thick or thin, just right with a hint of sweetness and great crunch. 
On another visit, I had the wilted kale salad, which was great. Walnuts, cranberries, kale and peccorino cheese topped with puffed fallow ( reminiscent of a tiny puffed grain.  Although I enjoyed the salad - at 12 bucks for a fairly small ( but beautiful) dish - the pizza is a better value. 

Th vibe in posto is bustling and urban- lots of other business folks there, slightly upscale young professionals enjoying good food.  Its great to watch the kitchen crew at work , small kitchen but they work together very well pumping out a ton of food in a very small space. 

All in all, I like Posto - the service so far has been good with the one exception. I will return."}
{"text":"Posto is my new go to place for girls' night. Service is excellent - friendly, knowledgeable and courteous. Food is amazing, particularly the pizzas, burrata, kale salad, and veal cheek/bone marrow. Wine list has a range of inexpensive to more pricey, which means there is something for everyone, no matter your budget. Speaking of budget, you can make reservations at the bar and just order a pizza and some wine/beer, and it won't break the bank. The prices for the pizza on par with Una, but in my humble opinion, even more delicious. The entrees a bit less than Farm. Posto is definitely a must visit for any food lover."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of this place. It's small and cozy, and I've always had really good waiters / waitresses. The chicken pesto pizza is my favorite, but I really enjoy there spinach salad as well. The tables are a bit small if you are in a group, but they do a good job of timing the arrival of the food so that they can fit it on the table. This means sharing makes it easier, which I don't mind at all as I like trying a piece of every pizza."}
{"text":"A-List. Some of the best pizza (yep, better than Una) and service you'll find in town. The food is wonderfully prepared, service is friendly and smart and the customers keep coming. One awesome place after a hectic day. One of the best kept secrets downtown. Treat yourself. As always - for real. You decide."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place!  Very nice, but not so fancy that it's snobbish.  The waiter was very helpful for us first-time diners.  I think we tried just about everything on the menu (my husband was very hungry).  We tried the pizza that was on special, and it was the BEST!  Just reminiscing has my mouth watering.  You must try the Tiramisu - very moist!"}
{"text":"Went here a second time after having a great experience the first time and felt it only fair to downgrade my rating a bit. I was rather disappointed after having such a good experience the previous time. This time I found that the pizza pretty much the same as the first time, but the service was not very good. We had an inattentive server and he came off as arrogant and I did not appreciate that at all. He was pushing more drinks on me in an aggressive manner and sneering when I ordered. I also realized how \"hipster\" the place is. Part of being a hipster seems to be jerky attitudes to your patrons mixed with smug superiority. You're a server, not a world renowned surgeon or something. Get over yourself!

Still, food was fine, but did not like the behaviour of the staff."}
{"text":"I have been reading about Posto for months and due to circumstances beyond my control I have had to cancel two reservations. I was finally able to keep one this week and I met my friend Ro for lunch. I was a bit disappointed because they have changed the menu recently, eliminating two of the three dishes that I wanted to try, but there were still several that sounded delicious.

We decided to start with the small antipasti board which had duck prosciutto, salumi , swordfish bresaola, gorgonzola, burrata and other things that I can't remember. Since cheese is my desert island food (you know... What is the one food you would take to a desert island?), clearly I loved it. Ro also loved it and at the end of the meal said that the board was her favourite part of the meal.

For our entrees we shared the clam dish with garlic, pancetta, leeks and garlic crumbs and the pizza with spinach, chanterelles, and shallots. The clams were delicious! We asked for some bread to sop up the juices from the clam dish and we ate every last bit..... So good! The pizza crust was thin and crunchy but still chewy in the middle. They added truffle at the end and I am so glad that they did. It was rich and had so many different flavours that complimented each other so perfectly.

Not an inexpensive lunch but delicious and totally worth it. I will definitely go back and am eager to try some other things."}
{"text":"As I am next door, I have been to Posto countless times since my last review. I am updating my review because my latest experiences have been nothing but absolutely pleasant service and food wise. I always go for half price after 10PM, and lately I have found that not only are the pizzas consistently phenomenal, the staff have been way more chatty, friendly, and helpful. 

The non-pizza items on the menu remain to be hit and miss, but it is without question that Posto is one of the greats in my book - I've been there a million times now and will probably go a million more."}
{"text":"Surprised that I haven't reviewed this place yet as it is one of my favourite spots here in the city.  Posto is delicious.  We have had many of the pizzas on the menu and they have all been quite impressive.  

Insider tip - I'm a fan of prosciutto so I always add it on as an extra topping.  So worth it.

The ambience of the restaurant is intimate and great for a date night.  Just a heads up that the restaurant is not the largest, so I would recommend getting a reservation if possible.  

5 stars."}
{"text":"Thursday lunch with a coworker at noon. We had a friendly and helpful waitress. There was only one other table occupied but it is -28C and the holidays so might be a factor.

Ordered the pumpkin perogies. We had a bit of an issue with this first appie but they fixed it immediately. They were yummy tender pockets filled with the smoothest pumpkin purée topped with seeds and I think biscotti crumbs. There's only 3 so the waitress offered us 4 to even it out for our party of 2.  Next, we shared the humboldt squid with arugula and berries. Tender and flavourful, it was small to share but glad we tried it. 

Next up was the pizza/ a basic margarita with tomatoes cheese and basil. It was our error as we wanted the potato leek n bacon but ordered a #1 not the #2. Either way, the pizza here is spot on! Chewy with a thin crust, but the quality of the ingredients really shine through. Thoroughly enjoyed this pizza and will be back again when I'm in the area. Do not that this is a sister to Bonterra next door which I've eaten at for stampede events for several years. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Posto is awesome! I walked in trying to get a last minute reservation for 8 people (that I forgot to make a month ago) and Christian was SO accommodating. He did everything he could to make sure that we got in. We sat at the bar and had great pizza, amazing dessert and had Christian take care of us all night. The service is unparalleled. It's a great go-to place!"}
{"text":"Foods is amazing!!! People are so friendly!! Many foods could choose!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I am in Calgary 1-2 times a year.  And I really like this pizza.  The ingredients and flavours are very italian.  The pizza crust has a hint feel of American.  Nothing like this in Toronto.

The wine selection is not huge but unique and mostly focuses on affordability/quality.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near MEC (Canada's REI), Posto is a great lunch option in the area. We didn't know what to order so our helpful and friendly waiter, but possibly owner since he wasn't dressed like the rest of the wait staff, recommended a pizza with prosciutto and potatoes, which he said was what they were famous for. I ordered a cocktail with Pimm's, which was refreshing that hot and muggy afternoon, while my husband  got a Guinness-like beer on the house! The drinks were great and the pizza was outstanding. I don't remember eating a pizza as creative and delicious as that in recent memory. 

I texted my cousin, who lives in Calgary, telling her how awesome this place was. She already knew that though :) I'd gladly return next time we're in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here! I also love tapa style meals and am always up for sharing. We took a seat at the bar considering how busy it gets on the weekends and we rolled in on a Friday. We were able to discuss the menu with the bartender, along with any recommendations in regards to drinks. We will definitely be back to enjoy some drinks and good eats. 

One thing you need to know , is that you should either try to make a reservation or be prepared to wait. It's quite small and you don't wanna miss out."}
{"text":"A great find in Calgary!  The pizza hype is definitely in!
We visited Posto for dinner and booked a reservation through Open Table (love Open Table!)  The restaurant was quite busy but a great vibe throughout the cozy dining room.  Our server walked us through the menu and explained the \"share\" plates idea which I appreciated.

We had decided to start off with the small antipasti platter which was quite large!  An awesome selection of meats and cheeses.  I would have liked additional veggies and maybe some breads to accompany the platter but all in all enjoyed it.  The swordfish bresola was to die for!  AMAZING!

We also ordered two pizzas and the duck arancini.  Our first pizza that came - chicken, almond pesto, goat cheese, red peppers - was perfectly cooked and full of great flavours. Our second pizza - gorgonzola, figs, potato, radichio, rosemary was a bit overcooked for our liking and had some darker burned pieces underneath.  Although we did agree that the flavours of this pizza were very enjoyable!  The combination of all the flavours were very unique and we would order it again.  The duck arancini were good but weren't memorable in my mind.  I didn't care too much for the sauce that accompanied them at all.

We couldn't resist the in-house made cannolis!  They were awesome and definitely worth it.

I will tell you the best part of our meal was the service!  DAMARA was an awesome server and she was genuine and offered great suggestions.  Her sense of humour was a great touch and we will definitely be back because of her great service!

Cheers Posto and we will see you soon!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here it was only ok...I think they had just opened and were still working out the kinks. Also, it was my performance review for work and my boss wanted to try it and we all know that you don't really want to rock the boat when you're about to find out if you still have a job amiright?

First visit spoiler: Food decent, service good, performance review good (I still work there...hehe!)

Well, my new boss and I went here for this years performance review and again...didn't want to rock the boat. But my visit was just SO good (she suggested we have wine and I'm not one to refuse a lunch time libation if my boss insists). 

Our server was excellent and recommended the pasta special. Now, I am not normally a pasta eater so she must have really romanced the hell out of that special because I ordered the pasta and it was amazing. We also had calamari as a starter and my boss had a salad (one of us is more responsible in the healthy eating department...haha).

The best part was I couldn't eat all the pasta so I took it home and reheated it the next night for dinner and it was still amazing.

Bottom line - Let your boss take you here, listen to the servers, and order the pasta!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, bad ambience, and slow service. 

Sat at the bar. The 1950s version of Godzilla was playing on the TV which was completely out of place and distracting. This set the tone for the service that was slow.

It's too bad because the pizza here is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Horrendous service. Felt like I was in a bad dream. My pizza took 37 minutes to arrive...I know cause I just text my friend when I was seated (45 minutes)
I ordered prosciutto on my pizza and when it finally arrived, there was a couple of pieces, I asked the server, he said that is extra.
I took my fork and lifted on piece and then a quarter of the pizza was bear. I showed the server and he reluctantly brought me more....
100% with the other reviews here....this place is hit or miss, which is sad because the pizza was really good."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The duck confit was heavenly. The restaurant decoration is very nice and the waitress attention was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Hello Posto!

You were a delight, thank you for the amazing service, food and wine.
I really could write a review that would go on for 8 pages, but instead, you need to experience it yourself.

And I love the boar, who has an italian name, but our server called him Harvey, so Harvey he shall be.

My only regret was I was too full so I couldn't try dessert."}
