{"text":"Best pizza in the area and perfectly priced. I love this place. My coworkers at gamestop showed me this place and I can say the only thing it is missing is a delivery service. Let's all spread the word cuz they need to stay in business and thrive!"}
{"text":"Yummy, is all I can say.  Pizza was superb and the price was right too (dinner 2 slices and a drink for $6).  This has recently opened.  It was bright and cheery.  My son is in a wheelchair and had no problem getting around in it.  I don't even live close, but I would go there again."}

{"text":"** UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP, New Name:  La Roma's **  My husband and I stopped by this week before shopping at the WalMart and were sad to see that Lubrano's is now under new ownership and called LaRoma's.  We ate at Lubrano's several times and were never disappointed by anything we ate there.  They also had sfogliatelle pastries sometimes, which were excellent.  Sorry to see it's changing.  La Roma's seemed okay, but I want to try it a few more times before writing a review for it."}
{"text":"When I see family as little as I do- it's nice to get the food right.  My husband and my eighty one year old grandmother agreed that this was some of the best pizza they'd ever had.  Fast, artfully crafted, and extremely tasty...we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Even the guys that work there are Italian. Truly authentic pie. Great ingredients plus great preparation equals excellent pizza. it's that simple, yet so hard to find.  These guys nailed it"}
{"text":"Friendly! Good food. Great quality. Good prices for a big family of 7 stopping for a quick lunch during our soccer tournament."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we decided to eat here. The staff was very friendly BUT...we should have known it was nothing awesome with plastic \"silverware\" and cheap paper plates.   The wings were spicy but Ok. The pizza was awful. We got the bacon ranch pizza and it was swimming in grease. Had to use 3 plates because it kept seeping through.   The white pizza did not have much flavor. To top it off, we had to clean up the grease mess when we left. We are just passing through.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"So far the best pizza I have had in the four months since I moved to Concord.  I traveled a lot , New York, Chicago, Philly.  This pizza will hold it's own against any that I have had in those cities.  Prices are good, pizza is great and tell Raphael, you saw them here."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner before heading to Walmart to buy groceries, we wanted to try it after reading the other reviews on here. The atmosphere was perfect for the occasion.  We got the special which was a 16\" one topping (bacon, can't go wrong with bacon) and a dozen mild wings for $20. We waited about 15 minutes until our noses aromatherapy session.  The first bite was amazing! The second bite was better!  Our server could've used some potholders, but she was great! Overall a great place to eat. Need to get the Cheerwine fountain fixed before I go back! We took our leftovers to the car and went to Walmart.  Ended up spending a bunch of time and money in the garden and home area, didn't buy any food and came home ready to eat the leftovers.  Should've got some canolis to go!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times. The pizza is awesome, as well as their spaghetti and subs. Garlic knots are a must. Great couple who own the place as well."}
{"text":"Wow, great pizza.  Had the white pizza and a reg cheese.. Both great and will come back again to try more.  Very friendly people and the prices are awesome"}
