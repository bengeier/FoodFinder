{"text":"Vero has come really far in a short time. It is not nearly as awkward as it had been in the past when they were first opening. The food is always incredible, you can't go wrong with any of your selections.   A few months back we ordered a cheese and meat appetizer and there was honey made from blueberry flowers WHAAAAAT?? Delicious! I inquired where to get this honey and apparently it comes from the dishwasher's uncle's apiary. I guess what I'm trying to say is these people don't mess around with their ingredients.   Don't ever go here if you are in a rush to go somewhere, they will probably make you late. Settle in and enjoy your experience at Vero."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here! I had the house wine, Margherita pizza, and cardamon Gelato! Everything was absolutely delicious and it definitely reminded me of when I was in Rome! Very fresh ingredients and definitely the most authentic Italian pizza in cleveland! I suggest making a reservation so you don't have to wait, but it is worth the wait if you have to!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Small quaint and fresh food. Would definitely recommend. The prices are reasonable and they locally source their ingredients."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a long time! Although you sometimes have to wait a little longer than other pizza places, it is totally worth the wait. The crust is cooked perfectly and every pizza I have tried is full of flavor.   The crostini we ordered a few times a few months back is also delicious! The most recent time we went last week it was no longer on the menu which was disappointing, but I am hoping they bring it back soon!  Finally, the gelato is a perfect treat to end your day! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Deliziosa! I have been twice & the food was great both times.  I brought my mom who is from Italy & she likes the pizza there a lot, which says something since she normally doesn't like pizza in America.  The pizza is the perfect size for one person, especially since you have to save room for the gelato.  I had good service, too.  The neighborhood is very cute too, you can sit outside & enjoy your gelato on a bench."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Pretty legit Neapolitan style. Nice flavor combos without being guy fieri. Service is slow af. Saw waitress check on other tables around us twice before I got my credit card back. Sad!"}
{"text":"From the beginning, it was clear this restaurant has some issues to work out. The waitstaff was exclusively tending to the gelato counter leaving us to wander with no sign saying to wait to be seated. I ordered a pizza and my friend ordered a salad. The salad came out as an appetizer, and the pizza didn't come out until the salad was finished. When the pizza finally came, it was burnt. And not tastefully charred, I'm talking backyard BBQ  briquettes. The next pizza they brought out was better and quite tasty. The salad was well prepared also. We did t sample the gelato, worrying that it too would be burned or come out of the kitchen the next week. The food was generally very good, but they have to work out some kinks before my next visit."}
{"text":"We went to Vero for a birthday party last weekend with a group of 9 people. We were crowded in a back corner on the upper level, which was a recipe for inattentive wait staff and poor service. We waited with empty wine glasses for the majority of the meal, and I wholeheartedly believe that no Italian would appreciate THAT situation.   The best aspect of the meal was the appetizers. The brussel sprouts were on point, and the cheese board was paired really nicely. If I was forced to go back I would just order apps. For real.   The thing that was even more disappointing than the wine was that there were very limited pizza toppings. The only meat choices came from pigs, and there were very few vegetables to be seen. We ordered several pizzas because we were a larger group, only to learn that there is only room for three pizzas in the oven at a time, so we couldn't even get served in unison.   This was an all-around disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza. We've been wanting to go since they opened but never really got motivated because its smaller, parking not great and seems a little pricey.  We visited last night and now I will tell all not to miss a morsel. The bread is from On the Rise! Outstanding! The EVOO was perfectly infused. The salad was unique and surprisingly refreshing. Then the pizza came. Wow, the way it tasted surpassed my previous favorite, MaMa Santa's (sorry).  The aroma, the tastes and the service brought me back to yesteryear when there were neighborhood pie shops and great old fashioned great service. It still is a little pricey, but worth every cent. Overall, it was outstanding. We'll see you next week! Thank you."}
{"text":"I lived in Napoli for six months, and this was the closest I've had to true Italian style. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and inviting. The good was bellissimo! And the atmosphere was spot On. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Wow.  Just had their pancetta and egg pizza for lunch.  Eye-closing, thrill-of-pleasure inducing good:  A delicious napolitano pizza, with the crust nicely blistered and charred.   The egg was locally sourced, which is a nice touch.  The tomatoes in the house salad were fantastic.  The espresso that I finished with was fragrant and just right.    Service was polite and attentive.  As for the ambiance, it was nice and mellow, with some decent music playing not too loud.    All in all, a perfect lunchtime experience.  I'm delighted to have this place in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"There is food prepared with the best of intentions and there is food such as that at Vero where the craft is king. And the craft, and mastery, of a glowing wood fired oven never fails to draw me in (I admit this might be partially a nurture aspect of my upbringing).  It is a marvel to eat here and to witness the behind the scenes preparation on Instagram. The pizza is perfection, the vegetables out of the oven sublime, and the gelato a perfect ending to all that lovely char. Buyer be warned though as when the dough is out, the day is over. No going into the freezer for Vero!"}
{"text":"The bread and oil for $4 supposedly would serve 3 people according to our server. It is two small pieces of bread with some olive oil. Something that other restaurants would include as complementary table service.   The pizzas themselves are ok. The cornicione of the pizzas are too large though. Half of the slice is the crust...Good leopard spotting, good char and fresh ingredients though.   I would not recommend this restaurant for large groups as the pizza oven can only fit a limited amount of pizzas, so it takes a while for everyone to get their food."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the city, hands down.  Every time I've eaten here, the pizza has been amazing.  The crust, the sauce, cheese, and salami have all been exquisite.  My only complaint is that I don't live closer."}
{"text":"Good stone oven baked pizza.  Fresh ingredients, delicious, good service. Everything was good, great.  (I'll refrain from 5 stars because I give that out grudgingly. You have to really knock my socks off.)  My only complaint is price.  We had 2 salads and two personal pizzas-- NO DRINKS-- and the total with tax was $44 and change.  I had the arugula salad. Delicious. Truffle oil. Everything fresh. But not that big.  $44?  With drinks or sodas the price would have been easily over $50.  Just incredibly disappointing price-wise.  4 people with deserts and drinks could easily go over $120.  What in the everlasting f*ck?  Not sure why it has only two $$ in the listing.  If you get just two personal pizzas for 2 people, no drinks, no desserts,, with tax,  you're in the $31 to $60 range.  Are the dollar signs per person?  No one goes out by themselves..."}
{"text":"I'm not even a huge pizza fan but this really blew me away! Just had a plain cheese pizza but there was nothing plain about it ;) definitley give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very expensive for a small amount of food.  The pizza itself is very thin, and the underside is very much sooty and burned.  Some people say that such a char gives pizza a pleasant bitter flavor, but there was so much soot that it coated my fingers and bombarded my taste buds.  The bread was very crunchy and nearly impossible to tear apart, which is something some people may like, but was not pleasant for myself.  For a $4 bread and oil (yes, no free bread here, heh) you get a small dish of oil (which tastes the same as what is already available at your table) and a skimpy bit of bread.    Wait staff didn't come by nearly often enough, and small requests such as bringing a menu took about 10 minutes.  That being said, they certainly were friendly and knew their stuff.  Very kind.    To be frank, I'd go for dessert and nothing else.  It's loud and packed, and the chairs are small, metal, and uncomfortable.    But it is 110% worth it JUST for the gelato.  Absolutely scrumptious, worth the price for the amount you get, and, best of all, you don't need to sit down to order it."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!   I stopped for Ice-cream at the recommendation of a friend.  It was wonderful.  The staff are nice and friendly.  Later, after realizing the ice-cream wasn't really enough for a meal, we ordered a pizza.  Best I've had in a long time.  Small, straightforward, simple.  Great crust, wood-fired stove, simple toppings."}
{"text":"Good pizza! It is thin crust pizza. When I went, we got the Best, Milk and Honey, and Picante. The Best pizza was amazing and I would certainly get it again, but I'm not much a fan of thin crust. The place itself is a bit small, so we had to wait around 20 minutes on a Tuesday night for tables, but it was worth it! Tip-Â the small gelato is plenty!! The small size is a LOT of gelato (great deal!) but they ran out of speculos that night. My recommendations are Speculos and banana dolce latte. The Milk and Honey pizza is what they're famous for, but just know that the milk and honey pizza gets a bit soggy so eat it fast! Overall, decent food and good service that was a bit on the pricier side for thin crust pizza. Stop by for the gelato though when you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent food. A little pricy but worth it for the uniqueness of the pizza. Extremely under staffed. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the East side! I love the egg and the arugula. We go with our kids and we have a ball. End with gelato and what could be better? A lovely Italian beer! Fine ingredients and wood fired make a perfect combination."}
{"text":"Too expensive for hardly any cheese and way to doughy for brick oven.  Think the chef needs to go back to school to learn what real pizza dough is....  Shame, as I wanted this place to be good!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience, the staff was great and the pizza was one of the best I have had in a long time.  The only down side was the gelato machine was down, but this is not terrible as it means I will need to go back again for the full experience."}
{"text":"We had a lovely and delicious dinner here recently. They now have a wine list (previously, it was BYOB). We ordered two pizzas (Calderone and Diavalo) and an appetizer (salumi board) for three people and had plenty of food. The pizza is excellent with a perfect wood-fired crust. The menu recommends that you eat in instead of taking out and I can see why. The pizza is served hot and with all the fresh ingredients, I think a drop in temperature (such as a trip in your cold car) can make a difference. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Cleveland by far!  The pizzas are freshly made and always amazing.  They have the best gelato ever!!!! Cute and cozy atmosphere. My only qualm are the hours of operation and I wish you could carry out:("}
{"text":"The pizza and gelato were delicious, but I was especially impressed with how quickly the food came, even though it is made to order. Fast and delicious dinner experience."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE pizza place in Cleveland. It's a small cute restaurant with nice staff and really good pizza. It's a bit on the more pricey side but I think it's definitely worth it. I also love their gelato"}
{"text":"This is not your average pizza place... It is so much better! The menu is pretty limited but the options are straight out of a pizza place in Italy and they are just as good. Artisanal cheeses and meats make this place extra special and the very friendly staff are the cherry on top! Hubby and I had the Salumi pizza and it was delish! The tomato sauce is a has a very fresh and slightly sweet flavor (which I love) that compliments the slight saltiness of the Salumi making it a perfect combo. There was just enough cheese to bring a little mild creaminess to the palate and mellow everything out. We loved it! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Cleveland.   Everything tastes fresh, deliberate, and well thought out. The atmosphere of the place is so fun; fun but calming. The menu is fun, and lets be honest, super tasty. I have a hard time not asking to go back every week.   Their pizzas are more like personal pizzas, so you are going to end up spending a little more then you would going to a fast food pizza place. But its worth it."}
{"text":"I am really picky when it comes to Italian food, especially pizzas. After unsuccessfully trying so many pizza places, one of my italian friends recommended Vero. I will be forever in debt lol, their pizzas are delicious, the crust is just heavenly made. Hubby and I tend to go there at least once in 2 or 3 weeks. We have made it our mission to try everything on the menu. In the end don't forget the gelato, the pistachio flavor is one of the best I have tried by far."}
{"text":"Really nice little pizza and gelato spot. The food was excellent and fairly priced and the service was great. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pros: gelato very good, nice decor, pleasant waitstaff. Very small, well thought out menu. Pizza quite good and wines by the glass good.  Cons: our pizzas were half crust. Mind you, the crust was chewy and delicious but if I wanted that much bread I would have ordered some. Servers were attentive but the food came out soooo slowly; we were there for over two hours and all we had gotten were salads, three pizzas, and gelato.   Summary: worth a try but we will probably hesitate to go back. Try crostadas in highland heights or better yet, biga in Kirkland if you need great pizza but don't want to wait forever..."}
{"text":"Wood fired, stone oven, the freshest of authentic ingredients and a true master of pizza. This is how pizza SHOULD be made!! Salads are and now a wine bar!! Service is attentive and involved as well as helpful. Above all try the Margarita DOP!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza in Cleveland!!! The milk and honey pizza is amazing! And the affogato with stracciatella gelato is one of the best I've ever had. Vero has strange hours and is pretty small so the wait is usually pretty long, but it's well worth the wait"}
{"text":"This is exactly what the east side of Cleveland needed. For years there has been a drought of gourmet pizza in the Cleveland Heights area (even places in Little Italy have been disappointing).  The pizza is made in a wood-fired oven. There are several delicious options to try and the list rotates over time. I have never had a bad pizza from this place and have been a patron on at least 5 occasions. They combine unique flavors like salami and honey. The crust is thin and crispy.  To top it off, the gelato dessert is more than filling. Generous serving sizes of this delicious treat make a fine end to the dinner.  Of note, this is not a great place for large groups (there are relatively few tables that don't seat many people)"}
{"text":"I didn't know what real pizza was until I went to Vero's.   My friend had her birthday there. We had the house salad, roasted cauliflower (amazing!), and I had the farmhouse pizza. My friend ordered the saluma. Everything was super fresh. Everything was excellently made. The dough was thin in the middle and fluffy on the crust. It had a bite to it while still being a bit chewy. I don't know how they do it. But it's to die for. The garlic butter with the starter bread is insanely addictive. This place is not for dieters. Lol also the dressing for the house salad is made in house as well and if I could by it in store I would.   The portions are generous. I would say if you ordered a pizza alone, most would have leftovers. They reheat well in the oven, too.   Oh and the gelato. Holy moly! So good!   I plan on returning over and over again. We've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I'm teetering on the brink of four stars, but can't bring myself to do it due to the weird atmosphere and service. With some improvement, though this place could definitely earn another star or two, since the food is already there.   If you like unique pizzas that retain their classic pizza foundation, come here. The flavors are unique and fresh, but not too crazy to lose the \"pizza\" title.   These pizzas are delightful! We got the regular pepperoni and the pancetta and egg by suggestion from our server. The pepperoni was definitely good and had a good authentic homemade taste to it. No doughy, greasy waxy cheese mess. It was like the homemade pizza you make at home, except the work part was cut out. Perfect! The pancetta and egg was a definite stretch for me at first. I'm not a fan of the \"put an egg on it\" fad. Eggs on burgers, eggs on hot dogs, eggs on pizzas. I like eggs. I like eggs on eggs (hollandaise, what?! YES.). But eggs on top of anything else? With oozing yolk all over the rest of my dish? Ehhh...But, I put our second pizza choice in the hands of our polite server and he said that was his favorite. I figured there's no better time than the present, what with the end of the world near and all, so we went for it. WOW. I was pleasantly surprised and immediately converted (to egg on pizza...the others will have to wait). The egg added a great burst of flavor to the rich pancetta. It was wonderful!   I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try. Upon walking in, it can be a little off-putting and confusing, though. The service seems inconsistent. While our server was nice and gracious, when we walked in, it was unclear whether we were to seat ourselves or not and we had to wait a LONG time for our bill, then a long time to pay it and we ended up walking it downstairs...completely unsure of whether this was what we were expected to do or not. Very confusing and strange set up. I definitely got a slow and cold, but not quite \"depressing\" vibe from the interior as well. The space is way too big for their quaint little mod-pizza parlor theme they're going for. They need to close up the empty wall space and perhaps get rid of the cold metallic decor and atmosphere. Really, I think the place could use some sprucing, but the pizzas are delicious enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"I wish they would have a better waiting list system like using Nowait or accepting call-ins. Showing up around 6:00-7ish, expect to wait about 45 min. Kudos to the hostess for being right on the dot about the estimated wait time.  There's only 12 tables instead and it can get frustrating when the Winosaurs hog tables. I'm going to get hangry dang it! But at about 8:30, this place was EMPTY on a Saturday night. Recommend showing up later in the evening than earlier if you don't want to wait.  Food: - Roasted Cauliflower: GET THIS. I was worried there wasn't much veggie focus on the menu (everything had cheese and nuts and I was looking for something lighter) and this was perfect. These babies had the perfect char from the wood fired oven and the vincotto sauce was perfect for dipping the pizza crust in (shout out to our waitress for the suggestion!)  - Best Pizza: the chile cream was fantastic. My SO was skeptical with Kale on a pizza, but the flavors were perfect. We added a farm egg for an extra $2. I'd get this again and again.  - Margherita DOP - sub regular mozz for buffalo mozzarella. Slightly bland, and I wish there was more basil. I have been spoiled by Lucali in Miami since they literally throw the entire plant on there. Maybe I'll ask them next time. But I probably won't get this again.  - Gelato: they do not make this in house, but their supplier specializes in Gelato so I still recommend. Were mostly out of flavors, but the banana dolce latte and Peanut butter chocolate chip hit the spot.  Service: our hostess was a total doll. Thanks for keeping our waters full and not pressing us to buy drinks.  The receipts are pretty cool; they precalculate 15%, 20%, and 25% tip and totals so you don't have to :)  All in all, I'd come again, but I'd probably not wait in line. The pizza is true Italian thin crust with only a slightly cruchy crust. And don't walk away without Gelato!"}
{"text":"Vero Bistro came highly recommended by a few friends when I moved to this neighborhood. After a while here I noticed that they were going under renovation and decided to visit once they are open.  I found the lady at the counter extremely unhelpful when I was ordering my food. She was looking at me like I should have done my homework before entering this prestigious bistro and should not waste her time by asking questions. When I sat down and launched my Yelp app; there was a check in discount offer. Up on mentioning that to the lady, I got a cold shoulder again and she said the discount will be applied to the final bill. I did not see it at the end.  The ambiance is nice. Actually a perfect place in the neighborhood for a quick and nice pizza and some gelato. I would have loved to sit there for a while and enjoyed if the server was not so rude.  I ordered Pizza margarita and it was very good. I really liked that the flavors. Mozerella was fresh and basil was nice. The base had some burnt parts from cooking in the stone oven. The whole thing was just very yummy (or I was so hungry at 3 PM).  I would go back again just for the pick up."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday night with a friend because I purchased the Groupon, and I would not recommend it. The service was extremely slow (it seems like they can only cook one pizza at a time) and the food was only average. We ordered the bruchetta appetizer and the beet salad for starters, both were only ok and the salad was very small. The pizza took another 20+ minutes and when it arrived it was tiny and burnt on the bottom. We thought we could split one because they were $12+ but I would not recommend sharing a pizza from here. They do have some interesting pizza toppings, and the place does have potential, but I will not be returning any time soon.   FYI-it is BYOB"}
{"text":"Great Place, as far as I am concerned the most authentic pizza in Cleveland"}
{"text":"great atmosphere, good service, place a bit small and limited tables and overall appetizers, salad and pizza okay..will def visit again. a must try at least once."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Best part: the dough. Pizza was gone before I could even take a picture of it so here's the gelato to make up for it! I had the margherita and my boyfriend had the salumi."}
{"text":"Wow, great pizza.  I almost hate to call it pizza...I almost want to call it, \"piazza\" *(pronounced pee-ATZ-uh) or some other way more upscale version of the word because it is deserving of it.  We got the Salumi pizza and the Fungi pizza and everything about them was great.  Crust...wow, chewy deliciousness.  I have to say...the arugula salad was disappointing.  Very small and only a small heap of arugula with a few parmiagana reggiano pieces on it.  And about 2 Tbsp of straight up olive oil as dressing.    I am sure the piazza tastes better when dining in. vs taking out like I did.  Hey, no problem, because the interior of this place is chic-ly understated that I would eat there anytime.  Prices are a little steep but after I took a few bites I didn't care.  2 piazza and a (very) modest arugula salad...$34."}
{"text":"Went in for gelato but after standing in front of the gelato counter for 5 minutes received no indication from the staff that they were interested in selling us any gelato. Left very unsatisfied and with no gelato."}
{"text":"The pizza was average at best. The dough was not 100% Neapolitan, not chewy, just soft and inadequate.. The ingredients however were excellent and the sauce was on point! Now, the service... If I wasn't hungry and didn't have my heart set on pizza I would have walked out. They don't offer carry out yet everyone I saw walking out was carrying a box. Overall the place wasn't horrible but I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland. Hands down. I could eat the picante pizza all day. And the servers are cool, too."}
{"text":"Love the pizza & salads here. Even though I try to make myself switch it up the \"salumi\" is usually my go to pizza here, such a great pizza it is! Properly made & stretched dough cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I love Vero. I didn't feel the need to review bc so many people had said what I felt , but now with Hanna Z's review... I had to speak up.   A) The food here is fabulous. We come here weekly to stuff our faces with guaranteed deliciousness. High Quality cheeses and meats. Roasted cauliflower brings the joy. Great Service to boot. AND GELATO! Love traditional flavors and flavors like Cereal Milk!  B) Dear Hanna, let's talk science. When you say \"scientifically proven\", please provide proof. No, the crust is not going to give you cancer.  Food being burnt does not mean it is carcinogenic. It is MORE likely with burned meats, this is documented here: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cooked-meats-fact-sheet.  But what's being burnt here is the crust, carbohydrates. Here's an actual science article about possible links, saying there is no significant proof about the statement. http://tinyurl.com/BurntCarbohydrateNotCarcogenic  TL;DR : No the amazingly delicious pizza here (and awesome apps/gelato) will not give you cancer."}
{"text":"So far, this is the best pizza I have enjoyed in Cleveland so far! We ordered 2 pizzas, both came to our table hot and freshly made with a perfect thin crust, excellent toppings and flavor combinations. They tasted like the real wood fire grilled pizzas from the authentic Italian pizza ovens that I sampled during my Italian travels. Of course, it's on the pricier side, but this typically comes with great quality and service. To me, the prices were fair. The restaurant had a clean, new, updated feel to contrast the old brown buildings of the Cleveland Heights shopping area where it is located. I will definitely return and will be craving their pizza until the time I do!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many haters for this place.  My wife and I came to visit at the recommendation of some Italian friends and really enjoyed this place.  Great crust, simple, good ingredients and a nice gelato chaser.  We also enjoyed a fresh, simple salad.  The young man who was serving us was friendly and attentive.  This is one of the better authentic pizza places in Cleveland, I think.  I will be back.  My only complaint is that I wish that there were more fruit flavored gelato choices, like back in the Gelateria days.  Oh well, maybe there will be more next time."}
{"text":"Great service, food was excellent, pizza crust is very tasty (and i'm an east coast girl). Can't wait to come back with a bottle of wine (they are still pending a liquor license)... But, no corking fee"}
{"text":"Great place and very nice atmosphere. Food and service was great. Make sure to reserve a table ahead of time. Small place and gets filled really quickly. Got Margherita and it was one of the best pizza's I've ever had. Don't forget to try gelato, which was deliciously good."}
{"text":"Make sure to get gelato.  Best part of the meal.  Pizza was good too.  But, the gelato was better."}
{"text":"Wonderful thin crust pizza with a great variety of toppings...and then gelato!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker I am particular with pizza. Vero shone tonight, pretty good pie. A little overpriced as one pie (which essentially ate like a personal pie to me) was about 13-16$.  Ingredients were lovely, crust a little too chewy for my liking and def too thick of a crust. But a great brick over char all around. And deliciously good hot oil at the tables.  Overall, I would go back but with more money!!!!"}
{"text":"We finally found delicious pizza in Cleveland. I'm not going to say it's the best pizza I've ever had, but it's the best I've had in Cleveland. The honey is so genius and delicious. I was weary at first but the first bite eased all my worries! It's sit down only, and pretty small so go early! They do not do take out or pick up. If they did, they'd probably be the busiest restaurant on the east side! The servers are all awesome young hipsters that definitely make good recommendations! Great food and quality service!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST neopolitan pizza Ive ever had. One bite left me speechless. Service was also great, plus a great atmosphere pumping some of my fave music like thievery corp, wax tailor, rjd2. Love. This. Place."}
{"text":"Great pizza. truly napolitana style. We had the potato, mushrooms and the margarita and all were great  The sides were great as well (broccoli and cauliflower)"}
{"text":"So disappointed.  After reading many positive reviews we headed over for pizza.  Restaurant closes at 10.  Arrived at 940.  Was told ovens shut off for the evening.  If you're open til 10, serve customers til 10- or at least tell people you can't order after 930 on the menu or somewhere on your website!"}
{"text":"OH MY PIZZA. Let me start by saying I could pretty much eat pizza at Vero and only Vero for the rest of my life and be happy (okay that's a bit of an exaggeration). Every pizza I've ever eaten here has been fantastic, my favorites being the margarita, the salumi, and the capua. On my most recent visit I noticed they had updated the menu and added a few new pies, which all sounded great. We started with the parma board, which is a board of Parmesan cheese, prosciutto, local honey and fresh bread. OMG so delicious. We scarfed that sucker down. Then we split the salsiccia (italian sausage, roasted peppers, candy onions, gar lic, ricotta, caciocavallo) and the margherita (tomato, mozzarella, basil) pizzas. Both were exceptional, as usual.  You really can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here. Be mindful, these are more personal sized pizzas. I would recommend one per person, because you can always take leftovers home. And save room for dessert, they have an awesome gelato selection."}
{"text":"I read a good review about Vero Bistro and I love the Cedar-Fairmount area, so I decided to check it out. Very disappointed in the pizza. I ordered a pizza with artichokes, mushrooms and proscuitto. It was undercooked and the crust was soggy.  Sadly, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and gelato and the service is always friendly and helpful. Must try if you're on the east side of CLE!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza spots in the Cleveland area. They specialize in Napoleon style pizza with a fluffy crust and solid ingredients. You almost can't go wrong with any of the choices - be aware though that some have a sweeter flavor (honey). The salads are pretty large portions and so we typically will share a large salad and one pie for two.  This place is consistently busy so be prepared to wait 30-45 min when you put your names down; no reservations either. We'll usually stop by some of the other shops in the meantime as we're waiting.  Cozy and trendy spot with a solid atmosphere."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how perfectly chewy and delicious the crust is here. I had the Verde made with kale, Chile cream, and cheese. Heavenly delicious. And they serve wine so, a winner already. The menu says pizza serves 1. While I did indeed eat all but one piece, it isn't a personal size. Half a pizza is probably the appropriate serving size for one. Especially if you combine with a salad or an appetizer. Or, better yet, if you intend to eat some amazingly smooth and perfectly sweet gelato afterwards.  And you should. You really, really should."}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza in Cleveland. I recommend getting a reservation as you'll have a long wait otherwise. They also have some solid gelato as well."}
{"text":"This review makes me very sad. My husband has been a Vero lover for a long time and he used to go to lunch there when he worked on that side of town. Over the years, we've had wonderful experiences there but after this weekend, sadly we are done. We had planned to take friends there for a holiday dinner over the weekend. We had been telling them how amazing Vero was & couldn't wait to share. We arrived at 5:08, which according to all Vero sources, was 8 minutes after they opened. There was one table seated we could see when we arrived. We were told a 45 minute wait due to all the large party reservations for that night. Husband was ready to go some place else at that point, but I stupidly decided we should wait. Had a couple of drinks at a bar next door, returned 40 minutes later. At this point, a table of 4 was seated at a table that was empty when we arrived and we were then told there was an additional 20 minute wait. When we came back 20 minutes later, still no table. Waited an additional 15 & were finally seated. At this point, we were all pretty annoyed, we did receive two glasses of comped wine for our trouble which was nice. We were just happy at this point to be seated & were preparing for our awesome pizza. So. The food. Our apps were fantastic. Garlic bread was good, burrata was awesome. Then the disappointment. The pizza. The pizza that we loved & touted to our friends as the best thing ever was surprisingly underdone. One member of our party had eggs on their pie that were seriously underdone to the point it made my stomach turn. When it was all said & done, we had a very expensive check & the majority of it was spent on awful pizza. We could have sent it all back, but after waiting over an hour just to be seated, we didn't have anymore patience in us. To sum it up, horrible organization of large party reservations versus walk ins & a very expensive check for underdone pizza. A special holiday dinner with friends ended up being a pretty lousy experience."}
{"text":"So sad! Went here tonight and the hostess said that there was an hour and 45 minute wait but that there would be no pizza dough by that time. Then a man came up and she seated him that second. I said how would there now be pizza dough for those on the list now that she gave their dough to this guy who just walked up and was seated at that moment? We would have sat there if it were offered!!! So sad that the hostess was so rude!!!! We just moved here and live less than 2 blocks away....so wanted to experience but this kind of service and major rude attitude will not bring us back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night.  My guest ordered 1 margherita pizza with buffalo cheese, than another since it was so good.  Arugula salad that proceeded the pizza was fresh and with just the right amount of shaved parmesan cheese.  Lemon wedge was a great addition to the salad as well.  A pretty good wine by the glass at only $7, but probably a better bargain would have been to buy the house wine at $15 for a carafe.     Service was great and that was despite the fact that our attentive waitress had to serve us in the upstairs section.  If you want a great, classic, thin crust, Neapolitan style pizza, this is your place."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Cleveland. Excellent staff,decor, and  great gelato. Everyone needs to get over the price, compared to other cities the prices are not out of line - unless you're comparing it to that \"cheesy cheesy\" place."}
{"text":"Kudos to Cleveland for having not one but at least two genuine Pizza Napoletana pizzerias.  The criteria are pretty strict (very high oven temp, \"OO\" flour, hand tossing, etc.) and Vero Pizza (and Citizen Pie in N. Collingwood) have stepped up to the challenge. We had the Margherita, Blanca, and Diabolo pies.  All were excellent.  We were so stuffed that had to pass on the gelato although it certainly looked very tempting (based on our neighbors' bowls!)  It's nice that they have a generous selection of wine and beers as well.  The only complaint would be the time it took to serve.  The restaurant wasn't even half full and these pies take only a few minutes to bake.  Yet we waited for close to half an hour for them to appear."}
{"text":"Great Pizzas - wood fired ovens! Really creative options and real good stuff!  But the portion sizes are small...  The service is quite slow...and I am not sure if it is a great place for big groups coz of the extremely slow service..."}
{"text":"Vero is easily my favorite pizza spot in the heights.  It's kind of hidden away and the wait for a table can be long but well worth it.  The house salad is simple but delicious.  I haven't had a pizza yet that I have not enjoyed.  I love the atmosphere this place has and the music is always on point.  Make sure to get here early to get a seat."}
{"text":"every meal at vero is excellent. service is always friendly, even when they are swamped- but most importantly their food is always SO SO SO good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland.  Avoid little Italy at all costs,  that whole area is a tourist trap.  This place has a wood burning oven and is perfect.  There is typically a wait for a table but there is a good bookstore next door to occupy your time."}
{"text":"The pizza at this place was amazing. With that being said after we did our initial order of three pizzas for a party of 6, we tried to order two more but were told they ran out of pizza dough ! Are you kidding me , a pizza shop runs out of pizza dough RIDICULOUS ! We spent well over 2 hundred dollars on appetizers, drinks, and pizzas . I don't know how you can run out of pizza ! After we checked out we went to use the restroom were the kitchen is actually located. They were still making pizzas !!!!!!!! So I am not sure what communication our server had with the kitchen staff but we will not give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Such delicious food.  The house salad is simple but most likely the best salad I have ever had.  The pizza is spectacular.  Get the mozzarella cheese ball as an appetizer, not sure the best way to explain it but it will not disappoint you.  I loved every minute of it and have been back already and planning my next outing to go again!   My new favorite."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good wood fired pizza place in Cleveland for awhile.  I tried Vero Bistro last night and was happily surprised!  The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious.  I had the salami pizza and the fresh taste of the tomato sauce stood out and really was wonderful with the occasional bite of salty, cured meat.  Always a fan of an affogato espresso and gelato, I had an espresso with gelato.  It tasted great but it seemed that their selection of gelato flavours was a little narrow, and it looked slightly soupy in the display freezer.  But the taste was great!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza Napoletana in Cleveland and the area! We keep going for more, but the service is so slow...there was one waiter serving the whole restaurants which is spread on the two floors...then he was standing behind the gelato counter for more than 20 mns. Overall we waited 2hours for our pizzas... yes i will go back and be patient hoping that they will improve their service"}
{"text":"Still the best pizza in the area  Vero Bistro is as authentic as you will find pizza in the University-circle/little italy area, and there is definitely something to appreciate about that. Having been to Italy where I was fortunate enough to experience the fine art of pizza making by master Italian chefs, I can say that the pizza fired up at Vero Bistro takes me back to the summer of 11'.  With their one of a kind wood-burning oven, Vero Bistro provides a unique rustic flare to their Napolean pizza that is not offered elsewhere in Cleveland. Crispy yet chewy crust, with a gooey center, and just the right amount of burn marks all around, just the way pizza is in Italy.  Ingredients:  Red sauce: San marzano tomatos (a type of plum tomato that is known for their intense flavor) are used, and an added plus, the ones used at Vero are shipped from Italy! The sauce is kept relatively simple to preserve the tomato-y taste that should be pizza sauce. 4/5  Cheese: I've had their margherita before. Small balls of mozzarella decorate the pizza. Although I personally prefer fewer, but bigger pieces of mozzarella, it's nothing to hold against them, but I've definitely had higher quality mozzarella. However, the parmesan reggiano used on some of their pizzas (asparagus special) is delicious. 4/5  Crust: Need I say more? This is the way pizza crust should be. What you want in a good pizza is a rustic, smokey crust where each bite is slightly different from the last. It may take someone who has eaten real Italian pizza to truly appreciate this crust. In my mind, this is easily the best element of Vero Bistro's pizza. I also like the light sprinkle of salt on the crust. 5/5  Vero Bistro is newly renovated restaurant (formerly La Gelateria), and the new chic interior design is the perfect setting for enjoying their pizza. With their heavy duty metallic chairs, and beautiful thick wooden tables, the decor complements the rustic feel that is Vero Bistro perfectly.  Overall: 5/5  I almost forgot to mention the gelato. Creamy, rich, delicious. I especially enjoy the pistachio. Support a young restaurant! Give Vero Bistro a try, I promise you will not regret your experience.  Additional note: they very recently changed their menu to a smaller, more pizza-focused one. Restaurants with smaller menus tend to be more consistent and use fresher ingredients.  Food: A- Atmosphere: A- Service: B+"}
{"text":"Last time I ate there was 7 months ago or so.  Love the place each time...sometimes service can be a tad slow.  I hear they have a wine list and am heading there right now.  Great authentic pizza."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizzas in the Cleveland area. I love the chewy crust! The milk and honey with pancetta and the salumi are my favorites. Their roasted cauliflower is AMAZING! And they have a great selection of gelato with huge scoops!   My only complaint- we went last Friday and put our name on the list around 8:30. At 8:45 we got a call they had run out of dough. They open at 5pm so in less than 4 hours on a Friday night they were out of dough. Very disappointing. With their business model I thought they could've planned ahead for the a busy weekend a little better."}
{"text":"If I had to choose a word that would sum up our experience at Vero Bistro it would be slow. If I had to choose two words to describe it they would be agonizingly slow. I'm pretty sure that time actually slowed down while we were there. It felt like we were eating in Matrix bullet time. Allow me to elaborate.  We arrived at the front door on a Saturday evening within minutes of their 5pm opening time. There were two other couples in the doorway with us. Things started out well enough and we were immediately seated at a table at the bottom of the staircase that leads to the upstairs dining area.  Not a bad atmosphere. There's a gelato bar and small seating area downstairs and a larger dining area upstairs. Not huge, but it didn't feel that crampt either. Now here's where things went downhill. We placed our drink orders. 10 minutes passes before we receive them. Mind you, the place isn't all that busy and we were among the first three couples that entered the establishment that evening.  We placed our food orders during the drink delivery process, two salads, a meat/cheese board consisting of a single meat and a single cheese, and a pizza.   45 minutes.  That's how long we waited for our first item to be delivered to our table. I honestly couldn't remember the last time we had to wait so long at a restaurant that wasn't bodies to the walls busy. We were within five minutes of walking out and probably would have had they not finally brought something out. What made it even more annoying was watching the dozen or so pizzas go past our table while we waited. I was so pissed that I didn't order a second beer. Speaking of beer, there are only two on their list and they are both from Italian brewery Monebrea. Decent beers, though.  The service was pretty C-. When the server dropped off the charcuterie he didn't bother to explain what any of the items on the board were. Just dropped it on the table and ran off. It was tasty, the nduja was well-spiced and the beer-washed Siberian Night paired well. The board also came with some crackers, cornishons, some type of spicy jam and sliced baguette.  The salads were pretty lackluster. The radicchio salad - which contained very little radicchio -  was quite oily and completely lacked acid of any kind. My wife opted for the house salad which was essentially a few leaves of romaine lettuce dressed with balsamic vinaigrette. We ended up combining the two salads on one plate. The sum was definitely better than the parts.  Now for the pizza. It was good. Not \"holy shit I'll be counting down the days until I can have this again\" good, just good. We selected the cavaletto & speck variant. The brussels sprouts added a nice bitterness, the speck was a bit tough to chew through while the balsamic reduction brought a welcome sweetness to counter the salt in the goat cheese. The crust, a great combination of crispy and chewey, had a nice char from the wood-fired oven. At $16 I thought it was on the pricey side for what amounted to roughly 4 slices.  Did I mention that we were there what seemed like forever? I think less time passed between sightings of Halley's Comet. I think less time passed between Meatloaf albums. Anyway, you get the picture. Our dining experience took 1hr 45min from in to out. Damn. For a place that requires us to drive all the way across town to get there, I just can't think of anything from our experience that would have me making the trip again.  P.S. The way the servers and kitchen staff run up and down the staircase in this place is something like watching a NASCAR race. You know there's bound to be an accident and that's really the only reason you can't stop watching it."}
{"text":"Vero really gets it right! We stopped in for dinner on a Friday evening a little before 6 and they were already busy. They don't take reservations but suggest you call if you have a party of 6 or larger. We were there early enough to grab a table for 5 no problem. We stayed with bread and olive oil flavored with spicy peppers and fresh rosemary, the bread is locally made from On the Rise. We shared a large (family size) house salad which was simple romaine taken up a notch with a fabulous complex dressing with a touch of honey and a crispy topping. We then shared 3 pizzas, which were more than enough, seriously we all left stuffed. We tried the margarita, spicy salumi, and \"the best.\" They were all fabulous, with \"the best\" a white pizza my favorite. The crust was fabulous and the cheese and tomato sauce clearly fresh and well made. I love that they try to use local and seasonal ingredients as much as possible. They also offer a great wine selection and delicious looking assortment of gelato, though we ate too much pizza for ether. Vero is my new go-to for family in town and for date night! (Note: as one who takes photos of most of my food, the presentation was lovely but we dug in to quick for photos!)."}
{"text":"I've been hearing good things about Vero Pizza since it opened, and was excited to try it. We arrived a few minutes before 5pm on a Friday and were seated right away as a group of 5. There was only one other group waiting when we arrived, but by 6pm the were pretty full. There also isn't much room for waiting, so just something to keep in mind if you have a larger group or are coming at a burger time and it's cold outside.   We started out with some drinks, and our server was nice enough to help us navigate the drink menu. They only have 2 type of beers (bottled) and they were out of one of them.  We tried their salumi, soppressata, bianca, and best pizzas and all had delicious flavors! Their pizzas are thin crust that's slightly chewy (probably a bit too chewy for me, but everyone else liked it). They cut the pizzas into 4 pieces right at your table, which is a nice touch. They recommend 1 pizza per person, but, as a group of 5, we probably could have split 3-4 pizzas and perhaps tried one of their appetizers. It did take about 20 min to get our food, which seemed like a while given that they weren't particularly busy when we first got there.   We ended with their gelato, which was also delicious (and servings are big enough to split)! They have about a dozen flavors to choose from. Having eaten a pizza and a big bowl of gelato, I definitely left feeling full!  Overall, a great addition to the Cedar-Fairmont area. Their pizzas are unique and definitely have a more authentic feel to them. The crust was a bit too chewy for me, to the point where I might call it soggy, but that's just me. Would be happy to come here again, especially at a time where we don't have to wait. Can't go too wrong with pizza, wine, and gelato!"}
{"text":"Just went here tonight and it was wonderful! They make their dough fresh every single day and it tastes amazing. But mid-westerners be warned -no ranch."}
{"text":"I found this place to be the perfect place for a first date.  The pizza's are on the light side, which is ideal when you are going on that first date.  You don't want to over stuff your self.  We ordered two pizza's, Margherita for my date and I went for their sausage pizza, which they call the \"la diavolo\".  It was spicy and quite tasty.  They use Fresh Mozzarella on there pizza's, which is really refreshing with so many of the local pizza makers using Provolone or Shredded Mozz.    I liked the modern aesthetic they have and really thought the wood tables were really cool.  The place is not that big, which makes for a nice intimate setting when you are trying to get to know someone.  IWe brought our own bottle of Cabernet and the server took care of that for us, which is nice.  It's nice to be able to go to a nice restaurant and not have to pay 3x retail for a bottle of wine.    I got Chocolate Peanut Butter and  my date went for the Banana  Dolce Latte.  We both got smalls and the serving size seemed fair enough.    I'm from the New Jersey area and good pizza is so hard to find in Cleveland, so finding Vero was really refreshing.  I would recommend this as a solid place for an affordable date."}
{"text":"We went here with a Living Social coupon; we'd spotted it before and thought it looked interesting.  This used to be a gelato parlor, and in many ways, it still is. There are few tables. The depressing atmosphere really kills any sense of the space (which is high ceilings and vintage detail) -- it is painted battleship-gray. Dark and depressing.  The tables are unfinished oak -- looks pretty, but has already absorbed a LOT of olive oil....who ever thought this was a good idea, needs a serious re-think. The high ceilings make this noisy and unpleasant.  The good points: the pizza is tasty....chewy crust and interesting toppings. They are VERY small -- about 9\" I think. Not enough to share unless you just want a snack. At $10-14, this is a lot -- you could get a big X-large somewhere else. But it was tasty.  The bad: everything else. Antipasto was basically a de-constructed pizza -- same dough as bread, same salumi, same proscuitto. It was good but like eating the same thing over again! The olives were pitted, jarred Kalamatas, which was disappointing.  As someone else said, they seem to be barely set up to serve pizza and a few salads. They appear to be baking the pizzas ONE AT A TIME in a teeny tiny brick oven at the back. SO this takes forever. We spent almost two hours there, mostly waiting for our food.  The worst: the help was just terrible....distracted. The table service barely exists. Most people order their pizza at the gelato stand. At these prices, this seems unfair. Also: we found two hairs in our antipasto, which clearly came from the server. EWWW. They disappeared around check time as well, and we had to pay at the gelato counter.  Gelato is very good, but honestly, you don't expect a \"bistro\" to be an ice cream parlor that serves pizza half-heartedly. Which is what this is.  In short: good pizza, but know what you are getting into. This is a downbeat, unfriendly place for a date that feels like you are eating in the laundry room of a basement."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. It's very reasonably priced and offers delicious wood fired pizza. Great vegetarian options. Excellent beer and wine selection. It's also located next to a great little bookstore, so on the rare occasions that there is a wait for a table at Vero's, you can hang out there and read in the meanwhile. Very good service, never had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"I love this place! Have been here several times and have had reliably good food and service. Metered parking is located behind the building and isn't usually an issue to find an open spot. The place itself is cozy and comfortable. Wait can sometimes be an issue and there aren't reservations. We usually go to the Starbucks next door to wait but we haven't waited longer than an hour before.  Food is awesome, some of the best pizza I've had and I've had plenty! I love their cured meat plate and salads -- everything's always fresh and flavorful. For pizzas, salumi, milk n honey, and amr are awesome -- crust is a little charcoaled and their chili oil goes well on everything. Their gelato is tasty and they have tons of flavors.   Only con: it's only open Tuesday-Saturday and only for dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent Napoletana Pizza! Both my teenage boys loved it as well. The Caesar salad fabulous. Get there early as the space is tiny. Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The burning oven they cook there pizza in is legit! Unique toppings (try the pork belly) and they have great gelato! Customer service is friendly and the layout is pretty cool! Definitely a must see in Cleveland Hts!"}
{"text":"When I brought my Diavola pizza back home, I was a little struck by the pizza to price ratio, as it is a pretty small pie. However, the ingredients tasted very fresh and high quality, the crust was perfectly wood-fired and I wasn't disappointed at all. I observed that their menus has more veggie options than meat. The service was friendly and my food was prepared quickly. It is a quaint little space with gelato served as well. I'd prefer to take it home, and while I won't buy this every time I want pizza, I could imagine stopping in once a month. A must-try if you live in the neighborhood and a wouldn't hurt to try if you were driving through."}
{"text":"It's an absolute joke you can't take the pizza to go. Additionally, it takes FOREVER to get your food despite the pizzas are only cooked for ~ 90 seconds. I think I had to wait ~ 45 minutes after ordering and about a 90 minute wait to get a silly table since you're not allowed to carryout Americas number 1 carryout food. After you waste a lot of time, their pizza and gellato are pretty good. I'd say if you have a ton of time to burn and don't know what to do, try going here. If you go there hungry, you will be greatly disappointed. Pizzas are kind of small and price is kind of high. The waiting is what really ruins this place for me"}
{"text":"It was a religious experience in an unassuming space.   My second bite on the milk'n honey pizza with hot coppa, rendered myself speechless. I shall never forget the blend of the farm egg with the basil and honey.   I also sampled the ramps and apricot pizza, which was also divine. Authentic and not fussy, and genuinely respecting the ingredients.   #bestpizza"}
{"text":"This was easily our sixth trip to Vero in the last six months and we were shocked at the poor experience.   During our previous trips the service was good; young staff but given the price point and atmosphere it was cool. We even met a wait person who also works at the Starbucks down the road.The pizza was not great but good and their menu has a nice combination of pizza, salad and charcuterie.   This trip started out bad with a ten minute wait to see anyone for a drink order. It was frustrating when another couple sat down two tables away and were waited on immediately. Ok, move on they did not see you.   We ordered our drinks and then when they came, our pizza. Thirty minutes later after everyone around us had been served I asked our waiter about our pies. He looked confused and said I'll check. Ten minutes later, he can back after I waived another wait person down and said geez they had a large party and were backed up. He said after my question that they would not charge us for the pizza.   We finally received our pizza, my wife's was under cooked but we were happy after an hour to eat. After easily one of our worst dining experiences, we asked for and received the check; he charged full price for the pizzas! When I asked to see the manager, he said he was the manager!!  I said you need to discount this bill, he said ok and took off another $10. If it was just poor service, give them a pass and try again but they are incompetent liars.   If zero stars was an option that would be my rating. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Order the house salad and bread!! The pizza's are made in a REAL authentic wood fired oven!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Vero! My significant other and I are practically regulars, when our schedules sync up! Get these pizzas as they are meant to be...uncut! The prosciutto, salami, and margherita pizzas are all fantastic, and I plan to try many more! Their appetizers are always changing, but always have something good. I do miss the mushroom topping they has for their bruscetta early on when they opened, but they make up for that in other great tastes. And if you dont want pizza, then they still serve the great gelatto you knew from La Gelateria previously!"}
{"text":"A crust that is delicately crisp and slightly burnt on the outside yet still soft on the inside sealed the deal for me putting Vero on top of my other Cleveland pizza destinations (Pepper's, Sweet Basil, Marrotta's, Crust, Angelo's, Dewey's, and Mama Santa's).  Fresh toppings on the Pancetta and Farm Egg Pizza further highlighted by the cracked pepper and occasional saltiness of the pancetta rounded out this fantastic pizza.  Do heed the menu's warning that this is a pizza to be enjoyed fresh out of the oven in the restaurant instead of at home as take-out."}
{"text":"Their pancetta and sunny side egg pizza is SO good. The pizza comes out of an oven with a light and crispy crust, with really good tomato sauce and melted cheese. The pancetta and the gooey egg makes it a really nice rich bite of delight. Also the dash of cracked pepper on top finishes it perfectly. This may be my favorite pizza in CLE"}
{"text":"We were visiting the Cleveland Clinic and were so glad to have found this place. Our favorite was the funghi pizza. The garlic flavor on it is amazing. Add hot coppa (meat) to it- so good. And you must put the hot chili oil on your pizza! End your meal with their awesome gelato- banana latte dolce, espresso, and lemon crunch were our favorites. They tasted amazing and were so creamy.   I cannot describe how good Vero is! It was a little noisy but it didn't bother us."}
{"text":"Vero serves Neapolitan pizza with a super thin crust and quality ingredients, fresh from the oven. I tried the Margherita, Salumi and Egg and Pancetta. Best pizza I've had in Northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"I came for the Napoletana pizza and stayed for the gelato and my tummy thanked me for it.  I visited Vero on a Friday night after a wonderful concert by the Cleveland Orchestra and pianist Murray Perahia.  After the concert I looked on Yelp for food nearby and saw that Vero, a place I bookmarked a while back, was right around the corner.  I got to Vero around 10:30 pm and thought, \"Oh boy, they're going to hate me for walking in this late and ordering food.\"  Not the least!  The waitress went out of her way to make my first experience of Vero a totally rad one.  I didn't know what pizza to get so I asked my waitress if she could tell me about them.  She definitely knew her pizza and could describe each pizza in such detail and clarity that I almost got a taste test listening to her description.  Top that off with her friendliness, kindness, and excellent service and she gets the best waitress award!  It gets better, believe me.  I love Napoletana pizza and found my Vero pizza experience to be well worth what I paid.  Like a true Napoletana pizza my pizza had a thin, thin layer of crispness to the crust.  The interior was moist and poofy with good, stretchy chew. Yum :))  Also like a true Napoletana pizza my pizza had a good charring that looked like a spotted leopard, not an even browning.  If you don't like skinny then Napoletana pizza is not for you.  The best Napoletana pizzas have a thin, thin layer of tender crisp crust.  Sometimes you won't be able to eat it without a fork and knife.  My Vero pizza, on the other hand, was not so skinny that I couldn't pick it up and fold it to eat.  To top the evening off with a cherry on top my waitress gave me a free single scoop of gelato.  After I finished my pizza my waitress asked me if I wanted Gelato and I asked her about the serving sizes. I had just finished a whole pizza myself and told her that I could not have more than dixie cup serving of gelato.  When she offered me a single scoop of gelato I couldn't resist. It was amazing.  I didn't ask for the price of a single scoop serving when she offered it to me.  And when I looked at my bill for the price of the gelato there was no charge.  Wow!  She received a nice tip.  Vero has my heart."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza in Cleveland. Some of the best food and service of anywhere, actually. Love the small, cozy environment. Servers are always nice and, wow, such wonderful food!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is surprisingly good. It's cooked in a wood burning stone oven (you can sneak in a peak if it's not busy and you ask).  If you haven't tried it,  I would highly recommend it.  It would be interesting to see if there was a dipping option for the crust (the house dressing was interesting).  While currently the meat options are mainly pork so I've stuck to the veg options (and they're really good), there should hopefully be a beef option on the spring menu (fingers crossed).  Looking forward to returning again."}
{"text":"A successful conversion of the former La Gelateria in my opinion.  Kept the gelato and added very authentic Napoletano stye wood-fired pizza.  I'm not a fan of dining in here; however it is always an option for carry out or a table outside."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  Ingredients are local and fresh.  Pizzas are anywhere between 13 to 16$.  I can easily finish a pizza by myself.    There are 8 small pieces.  Thin crust.  There's metered street parking in the Cedar Fairmount area.  There are probably at the most twenty tables, so I'm certain there would be a wait on weekends.  Looking forward to trying their whole menu eventually."}
{"text":"The salad is great, The pizza is awful  Everything is too much burned, Couldn't eat it because of all the bitter taste from burning, Folks, pay attention, it's those black burning pieces that causes cancer, Scientifically proven to be significant high risk for cancer!!!"}
{"text":"High quality pizza. Truly wonderful homemade crust. However, at $12-14 per personal pizza, it is a bit pricey. If you're not on a budget and looking for some wonderful Neopolitan-style brick oven pizza, this your place!"}
{"text":"Looking for Gelato in the area?  Don't bother with other locations, we tried one near the restaurant we ate at and it was shut down!  The Gelato is true to its Italian roots, if you love the authentic stuff, you will be happy.  The pizza also looked fantastic!  Stracciatela and Pistachio among all of the best Italian flavors.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza I've had outside of Italy. Perfectly cooked, simple but delicious, wood-fired pizzas that cannot be beat.  That said, if you like Pizza Hut-style pizza with 2\" thick crusts, dripping in cheap cheese topping, you simply will not like this. This is pizza as it's made in Europe - fresh, light, and mindbogglingly delicious.  The pizzas cook in an oven that's 700-800 degrees - so they just cook for a moment. The bottom of the thin crust was crisp, while the top had just the right amount of sponge to soak up the delightful tomato sauce... it's that sensation of dipping your cookie in your glass of milk or coffee until it's reached the perfect point of saturation, where it still delivers the crunch but also has soaked up the liquid. Absolute perfection.  The service was good but not exceptional, which I'm sure will improve with time. Sitting upstairs is great because you can eavesdrop on the kitchen, watching each perfect pizza emerge from the stove!  In response to a previous reviewer who thought they could share a pizza at $12 - at my trip last week the pizzas were priced $8-10, which I would consider completely reasonable for a dinner main course. They may have adjusted their menu somewhat since opening.  Remember to BYO wine... for now!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! I have been searching for a good thin crust pizza since I moved to Cleveland 11 years ago. I had the Salumi pizza. I could eat this all day long. The crust was perfectly cooked with a satisfying chew. The salami with a hint of honey was perfect. My friend got the Capua which was fantastic. They perfectly balanced the prosciutto, arugula, and black pepper.   We ordered a carafe of the house red which was surprisingly good, especially for the low cost. We finished with gelato--delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Look no further, Vero has the best pizza I found in Cleveland yet. Let me start by explaining I come from Europe, so I'm a fan of a neapolitan pizza, with a simple non-fatty dough, which is kind of difficult to find in a lot of places in the US (even some with good pizza, but not the traditional Italian kind). And that's the kind of pizza (yes!) you'll find at Vero Bistro.  This restaurant was perfect all the way. The bruschettas are delicious (try the sampler to have a little bit of each), the pizza is perfectly baked in the oven, with a thin crust and a divine flavor. If you still have some space left in your stomach, go for the gelato, you won't regret it.  The service is also outstanding, everybody is as nice as the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Trying to rank a pizza shop on the Eastside comes with a few disclaimers. First off --fair or not-- the bar of excellence is raised. All things marinara and cheese are not created equal on this side of town. Because you're in the proximity of so much greatness, what might pass as above average in other parts of town are merely passable over here. That's just the way it is and always will be.  Don't come to this side of the Cuyahoga and think you can just turn out some thin crust dough topped with fresh mozzarella and cook in an oven without a pan and think you've made it. Oh no, oh ye of little pizza making experience. Mastering the art of pie is much more than that. Soul and comfort can and should also play a role in the overall experience.   At first glance, Vero Bistro should be so much greater, but sadly falls short. It has so much potential and with a few tweaks could be improved immensely. The bistro is located in a chic storefront in the Cedar-Fairmount district. Two story glass windows give way to a modern and minimalist interior. The space is unique to the city. It's almost Manhattan-esque. Inside there's a few tables on the first floor and even more seating up a flight of stairs. The walls are decorated with pizza box art. Abstract surrealism sketches on white pizza boxes hung on the walls. Odd, but fitting for the contemporary space.   The service was my biggest gripe. Vero Bistro seems to be struggling with its identity. Is it take-out or an eat-in shop? Do you order at the counter and take to your table ala a coffee shop, or does it require table-side service? It all seems very confused. Upon entry, behind the glowing gelato freezer is a staff member asks if you'll be dining in or carrying out. When dining in, they'll allow you to select your seat and promise to be with you shortly. On this Friday night, spread through two flights of seating, there was just two servers to handle the register and all of the diners. Wait times added up and it took us at least three requests to finally get water. As most of you can attest, shoddy service can ruin a good experience very quick.   As for the menu, it features pizza and a few starters. Each menu item with an asterisk next to the locally sourced ingredients. Localvores are sure to swoon at this amenity. Once the decision was made to order, we started with the bruschetta which was anything but your typical diced tomatoes on crusty bread. This version consisted of a variety of toppings that ranged from a tapenade spread to a roasted pepper puree along with the familiar diced tomato and olive oil. A nice start to the meal.   Next we opted for two pizzas: the Margherita & the Pancetta & Egg pizza. Each pie on the menu measures apx. 8\" across and ranges $8-$13 a pie. Very reasonable by many standards, especially for this quality. The pizza was in fact, very good. Crispy charred crust, chewy dough, minimally invasive ingredients which properly allows the pizza shine on it's own. A very well done pie I must admit. It wasn't Crostatas good, but it was good enough.  It should also be noted that they don't-- at this time-- serve alcohol, but I saw others come in with bottles of wine to which they were supplied wine glasses. Pretty cool. I can see coming back to this place and hanging for a while. Perhaps bringing our own drink would alleviate the stress of worrying about the servers filling our glasses.   When it was time to go, we just walked downstairs to fulfill our tab and grabbed a gelato to go. $3.50 for a small dish which was more than enough to share. Rich, milky, Italiano goodness. A perfect compliment to a very good pizza.   In summary, the staff was apologetic and even seemed to realize the kinks of this still somewhat new venture. And for that, I'm willing to forgive. We will certainly be back again. I look forward to them figuring it out. Because this place certainly has the potential to be great, but without adapting an identity, it'll unfortunately just be another of a long list of slightly above average pizza shops on the East Side."}
{"text":"Love the pizza!  Perfect Neapolitan pizza!  Service a bit slow, but we didn't care.  Add this to the repeat list!"}
{"text":"This place was a fun find! Small and cozy inside, with only a few tables over two levels, and a few counter seats. They don't take reservations but on a Saturday night we were able to get a table within about 40 min (can get a glass of wine and wait in a small waiting area, or we went two doors down to Parnell's Pub for a pint whilst we were waiting).  Menu is pretty simple though all looked delicious. Drinks were beer and wine, and their wine bottles were interesting and very reasonably priced. We started with the olives & almonds snacks. Pizzas are sized to have one per person; the two of us split two (the margarita and the one with sauteed leeks that I can't remember the name of). Half have tomato sauce and half are white pizzas. We made delicious choices!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is good and their gelato is good. The atmosphere is nice but it can feel a bit cramped when it's a busy night. There also isn't any area to wait to be seated so people are forced to stand in the door/gelato area and that can make the diners feel kind of rushed."}
{"text":"OMFG this place is ridiculous.  It is hands down the best pizza in Ctown.  I must go back and edit my other pizza reviews in Cleveland downward.  This is truly Italian style pizza, with fresh ingredients, a crispy yet chewy crust and amazing taste.  It's probably the best pizza I've had outside of Italy and Zachary's in Berkeley.  If you haven't been, you need to go.  Bring your patience if it's busy, because the service can be slow.  No matter, the food is well worth the wait.  We started out with their bread and delicious butter spread, which is from On the rise I think and it was great. I had the Piccante pizza (with pepper oil, chiles, tomatoes, mozz, peccorino and garlic) and I added a farm egg and arugula.  It was just divine.  The husband had the capua pizza I believe and he loved his as much as I loved mine.  We shared the side of cauliflower and another of brussel sprouts (we seriously pigged out).  The brussels were good, but the cauliflower was amazing.  The food here is so simple, yet so delicious.  They have a good wine list.  Only 2 beers, one white and one amber.  I had the amber which was good.  The server gave us free drinks because of the wait, which was a very nice but unnecessary touch.  I am considering moving to Cleveland Heights so I can be closer to Vero."}
{"text":"I love that this place is right around the corner from home!! I also never realized it has an upstairs so more room than you see looking in the window walking by AND Bonus it's an gelato/Italian Ice bar!!! Score!! Went with my son on a Friday it was busy, but got lucky with an open table right away. The server was great, she asked if it was First Time, made some suggestions and got us set up right away. We both ordered pizza's of course and I loved the lightness of the crust and great flavor/freshness of the toppings. We of course indulged in the gelato/affogato something I have missed in life, it's gelato with espresso over time top!!! Holy Moly it was good. This place is a gem on Cedar Hill and I will be back often."}
{"text":"Accepts Case card. Salumi is very good (their pepperoni pizza). Their wood fire pizza is great! Gelato is excellent. Service is good. Large groups may take a little while. Very good ambiance and location. Music can be somewhat loud, if you're looking for library quiet, but I like everything they play. As others have said, lots of unique choices including salads, pizzas, etc. I tried a pizza with kale on it one time, it was good."}
{"text":"I love Vero! They have amazing pizzas and gelato.   I like my pizza simple so I always get the margarita pizza, but I've heard great things about the others as well. And if you go, you MUST end your dinner with gelato! Lots of delicious flavors and they let you taste test before choosing.  The restaurant opens at 5 and does not take reservations. It is a small and intimate space, so make sure you get there around when it opens because it will fill up quickly. If you have to wait, they suggest going across the street to the Fairmont for a drink or to the Starbucks a few doors down."}
{"text":"cleveland is really getting it's groove on with neapolitan wood fired pizzas, and vero may be my new king of the hill, maybe even besting Kirtlands gem Biga, although at this level it's less about rankings and more about nuances, you can't go wrong with either place or Flour in moreland hills for that matter, less consistent but still worthy are 3 palms in hudson and crostatas in highland hts.  Vero starts you off with a few worthy apps, crositini that's made with real bread, toasted to perfection, the goat cheese with pistachios and honey hits the mark.  the salad with celery root was well chopped and perfectly topped with a house made buttermilk dressing.  And finally we tried the litmus test of neapolitan pizzas the margherita dop, perfect char and leopard  spots on the puffy, chewy yet slightly crispy handle, great san marzano tanginess to the simple sauce and the sweet creaminess of the buffalo mozz, charred basil, what else is there to ask for?  Also, save room for their gelato,"}
{"text":"I love this place - I can eat here everyday!  I used to frequent Punch pizza in Minneapolis and they were great but Vero's is a notch above!  What's great: - I love Neapolitan pizzas and their Margherita pizza is absolutely fantastic! What I really like is that they know the ingredients in their cheese. Strict vegetarians do not consume cheese with animal rennet and they have cheese option available with microbial/vegetarian rennet. Make sure you let them know before you order :) - I always get my pizzas with a side of their balsamic vinaigrette. Dip the bread in the concoction of the spicy olive oil and the vinaigrette - divine, I tell ya! - Gelato: best pistachio I've had...period!  As for take-outs, \"no can do!\" Considering their small sized restaurant, this may be an advantage for those dining it. They get busy and if they received a lot of take out orders - it would impact their in-dining service level. Sure, they offer take-outs for the gelatos but that is all ready to go! Besides, Neapolitan pizzas are to be enjoyed fresh off the oven!"}
{"text":"First time wife and I ever tried this place, we came for dessert after having a nice dinner. Waiter didn't ask us \"dinner or dessert\" just sat us. There were about 8+ open tables, server came by and we mentioned we only wanted dessert, she said we could move to the bar or we could eat at the table until she needed it. Completely insulting.   We left.  Heard the pizza is good, will never know."}
{"text":"Seriously, the pizza here tastes as good as it does in Italy!   The house salad was fresh and tasty, just like my dad used to make.  I was bummed the gelato was not available because the machine was not working, but I really was full, so no problem.  The owner told me wine and beer is coming in the spring.   For sure I will be spending more time there!   I will try the antipasti next. By the way, the cleanest bathrooms ever! Service was fine."}
{"text":"My parents go here as a treat to themselves about once a month and they finally decided to bring me. I am so thankful that they did. This was the best pizza I've ever had ever. The atmosphere when you walk in it's so cozy. It also helps that you're greeted with a gelato bar. It's a very quaint place with brick walls covered in art by a local photographer. The brick oven is where these fabulous pizzas are made but you can watch. It has a variety of meats and cheeses and specialty pizzas all cooked right in front of you. The best type of meat and the best type of cheese are combined on top of delicious though and Drool-worthy the sauce. This is not your standard pizza. It makes you feel like you are in Italy with all the taste that it has. I cannot eat dairy so I was a little scared to go to the new pizza place where I had to ask for a pizza without cheese but with all the flavors that they put into every single ingredient that's on their pizza it was mind blowing and my taste buds have never been happier. I cannot wait to go back to this amazing place in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Went to Vero when it first opened. Great Pizza that has organic and fresh ingredients. Great place for a nice lunch or a quaint dinner! I love it!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pizza in Cleveland (which is hard for me to admit because I typically like to avoid the east side). It's extremely casual which makes it easy to pop in after running around town. Haven't had a bad bite yet!"}
{"text":"Coming from the greater New York area, I have been very disappointed in the pizza selection in the greater Cleveland area. It's a staple for us! Most of the pizza out here is taste like frozen pizza you can buy at the store. On a mission I stumbled across Vero, and I can't tell you how happy I am to find some good pizza here. The pizza is thin just like I like with fresh ingredients (and that is what makes all the difference in pizza) The sauce was perfect! I wasn't a huge fan of the Char around the crust but to each there own. Overall a great spot to get a personal pizza. It is a little pricey but then again this isn't dominos or pizza hut. It's an upscale pizza place."}
{"text":"If the first thing I see when I walk into a restaurant is a wood-fired oven, I'm a happy lady! This restaurant is quaint, aromatic, and just an outstanding choice for thin crust delicious pizza in Cleveland. Honestly, it's probably the closest to real Italian pizza you'll find for miles around, and the best part about it is all their ingredients are locally sourced. Any place that supports local businesses is an establishment I immediately respect and have no problem handing stars to hand over foot!!   My chomping buddy and I started with a selection of 4 appetizers for $16 (pretty damn good deal)! From the cured meat selection, we had the prosciutto di parma and hot coppa. I appreciated that the menu listed the locations from which all the meats were obtained (prosciutto from italy and hot coppa from san fran). Both were delicious! Creamy, well sliced prosciutto is an art and these guys have mastered it! The hot coppa was peppery, spicy, and just salty enough to make me want to move on to cheese, but not so salty to make me guzzle gallons of water all night! The shot rock (sheep milk cheese) was funky but not TOO funky, you know what I mean? Sometimes you just want a chunk of good ol' stinky cheese, but you don't want one so stinky that you can't taste the rest of your meal. Finally, the chevre---I love goat cheese to the end of the earth and back and this one was great. So much better than any chevre you can buy from Whole Foods haha. Warm bread with chevre and honey= me slapping the boyfriend's hand away for every last morsel!   But what about the pizza, you say? Well, let me tell you.  - Salumi: We ordered the salumi and honey pizza at the recommendation of fellow Yelpers and were not disappointed! Every bite really features the flavors of salumi, honey, oregano and tomato. No one ingredient over powered the rest. The balance between sweet and savory is so perfectly achieved, that I could have eaten that entire pie myself. Next time, I just might!!   - Carbonara: The carbonara is an equally good choice. The egg was cooked to runny/solid perfection! This pie was creamy and decadent mozzarella bliss with just a hint of spice every now and then- fantastic!! My only qualm was that bits of the crust were burnt, but that is to be expected with a wood-fired oven.   We washed everything down with a bottle of sweet and simple Bracchetto- the perfect sweet sparkling addition to pizza. I recommend you buy the bottle, because just one glass will not suffice!!   Tip: There are very few tables, so make a reservation. The servers were really great about coming over and checking in on us as we waited by the door for a table. Although, the ambiance is not amazing as there are very few tables and the servers can be a little teenage-growing phase awkward. But I don't think I'll detract a star for that! Also, check in and you'll get $2 off your order!!!"}
{"text":"Where is the option for 6 stars? This is my FAVORITE pizza place yet in CLE!  Wood fired pizza: the dough blew my mind.  Wood fired pizzas can tend to be dry.  In contrast, Vero nailed it: crust was thin with robust perimeter, a bit doughy, moist, dense, and delectable flavor.  I ordered the Best pizza (ricotta cheese, caramelized leeks, sesame seeds) and holy moly, amazing flavor and eating experience.   Went on Friday night.  Very small location, they creatively built a loft for extra seating.  If you can make a reservation, I would highly recommend.  Seating is practical and modern, not incredibly comfortable.  Better for smaller groups.   Friendly staff.    Parking isn't super easy around here, some metered and free lots around but be prepared to walk a bit."}
{"text":"Great Italian style pizza. Would defiantly go back. It's a quant little restaurant. The pizza does take a while to come out at the beginning of the night, but you do miss the rush if you go around the time it opens."}
{"text":"I would give this place a five star review except 1/2 times they're closed when they should be open, for a million reasons: out of dough at 7 (even though they open at 5), on a random vacation that doesn't get promoted online, or like today where there was a weird issue with the dough--it's super frustrating. Many times I've brought out of town guests there to find out its inexplicably closed, but it's too good to completely write off. So If you're going to go, call ahead--ALWAYS because there's a reasonably good chance they're closed for no good reason.  On the bright side their pizza is the best in North East Ohio in my opinion. The atmosphere is great. Modern/industrial but cozy. Great place to bring friends/family or a date. I love their starters and gelato. Their specialty pizzas are all unique, some experimental and all delicious. So, aside from being inexplicably closed at times, it's still the best."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!! The crust is a delicious wood oven thin crust. My favorites are the salumi, funghi and the one with the egg on it (used to be pancetta and egg, on the current menu its the carbonera). The salads are also good. Nothing special but fresh ingredients which make a world of difference. They don't allow take out anymore...but its worth it to dine in!  Some of my favorite specialty pizza in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good and smells are great. Prices seemed pretty typical, maybe a tad high for the quantity but spot on for the quality. Had the Bianca white pizza and others at the table had the Salumi, Best, and Soppressata. Crust is doughy on the edges but thinner and fairly chewy in the middle. I'd prefer more thinner or more soupy in the middle but that's just me. Was a good personal size since the dough is overall thinner and more rustic Italian style.   Sidenote - the ceiling tile velcro'd to the ceiling is pretty awful but I guess it keeps the noise down? Ha."}
{"text":"Coming from New York, I was utterly disappointed in the pizza selection in the greater Cleveland area.  The bulk of it consists of prefrozen, fast food style pies.  However, Vero Bistro is the only place to go if you want fresh, authentic, flavorful pizzas made from local ingredients.  Their pizzas top some of the best I've had back home and make it easily the best pizza I've ever eaten.  You can always expect a slightly different menu depending on the season, paired with an equally impressive selection of italian gelato.  Vero is reasonably priced for what you get. ( I also recommend the Bruschetta appetizer as it's always phenomenal.)"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent. Service was ok. Atmosphere is loud and seating is a bit uncomfortable. Its just not for me although I don't regret trying it."}
{"text":"After running with my roommate, we came across Vero Bistro. What's this?? I exclaimed. Having driven past this area every time I go to work, it surprised me that I hadn't noticed the place before. And behold- they're new, and have been open for only 5.5 weeks.  It's the same location as La Gelateria- same place, just different owners. The menu boasts Italian made pizzas- mostly all napoleans and some non-traditionals. They have make your own pizza and bruschetta.  I called up a friend and off we went to Vero Bistro for lunch. It was so empty- perhaps because it's new? We chose a table upstairs and got the La Diavolo. Very thin crust pizza with Italian sausage. It was strange...they got the pizza, grabbed a large old tomato can, flipped it over, and set the pizza on top of that. I wanted to be like, \"uhh...really?\" And there wasn't that wow factor to it...the pizza was thin and floppy..although the sausage was good, there wasn't that \"fresh mozarella\" taste I was hoping for either. Meh.  And then, as they advertised their gelato, I wanted to get an affogato. Yet, upon ordering it, they said they didn't have it yet because they didn't have an espresso maker. What?!! Then why did you put it on your menu!! I was sad.  I chose to get the gianduja gelato instead. It's one of my faves because of the nutella flavor.  The portions were BIG..and the gelato was ok. Not the creamiest, but okay.  I think this place has potential..once they get going and get their act together. Until then...I think I'll wait until their affogato emerges......"}
{"text":"I love this cute place! I especially love the upstairs where you can just find your corner and enjoy some delicious pizza. Their pizza is very thin crusted and a little pricey but the flavor was pretty good. They could improve a little bit on the pizza though I think to match their market price.   Downstairs, I love their gelato selection! It's like a hidden treasure land and I was so happy that I found it! The dude who gave me gelato was really funny and he gave me a FULL CUP of gelato it was so much that I almost couldn't finish it, yet I was so happy that I got so much gelato for just $3~ !!"}
{"text":"This is great pizza. Real Italian true pizza. I hear they only do 1-3 pizzas at a time. It's worth the wait to get pizza this good."}
{"text":"Vero is one of the best pizzas in Cleveland. I like Crostatas a little more but the drive to Highland Heights is awful. Vero is a good Neapolitan style pizza in a cute little restaurant on Cedar. The service is excellent."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy. Food is delicious. If you are in the mood for an authentic thin crusted, wood oven pizza, that's the place to go."}
{"text":"It took me years to make it to Vero and I'm glad I finally went. Definitely  the tastiest  pizza on the east side. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite dinner spots in the university circle area, and this is coming from someone who isn't overly fond of pizza in general. Very easy to miss if you're not looking for it, as it's unassumingly wedged next to the Starbucks on Cedar, but absolutely worth checking out. Particular standout items include the house salad (just get it, trust me) and the milk and honey pizza, but I've honestly enjoyed everything that I've tried here. The pizza dough has a wonderful soft, chewy consistency with the just the right amount char from the wood-fire oven. It's a fairly small restaurant and seats fill up quickly so I would get there soon after they open if you don't want to wait. Great spot for a casual date night, with the added bonus of some great gelato for dessert"}
{"text":"Vero is a fascinating spot I have came across during my sampling of authentic Napoletana styles pizzas. It lies not far away from the Little Italy of Cleveland, a city that I did not excite me thus far in terms of culinary experiences.  Enter Vero pizza on a weekday evening, one of our companions was sick, we decided to take out a couple of pies from here. As we ask for a take out menu, the hostess announces that they are a strict dine-in restaurant only. When I urge them to consider the fact that we have a people waiting back home, would love their pizza, she refuses to budge. On inquiring if they do not have boxes, she says we can box pizzas only after eating our share of the order. We  refuse and leave the place for the day.  A day after, we plan our dinner only with people who can physically be present in the restaurant. Quaint little place, pretty packed with seating on 2 levels. Got their cauliflower and olives for appetizer, average and nothing to rave or complaint about. Their milk and honey pizza with a farm egg was brilliant. Their margherita pie was great too, authentic crust, quality ingredients, tasty sauce, and exactly what a smashing Napoletana should be. 4 star for their pizzas. Got a pistachio gelato (to-go) at the end and that is something I thought was one of the best pistachio gelatos I have ever had. Bump up to a 5-star for the pizzas and gelato. Down a star for the stupid no 'take-out' policy. Down another star for not just conjuring stupid policies but enforcing them on the citizens of the free word craving an authentic Napoletana. Come on guys, heal the world and let out pies in a town with patients (think Clevand clinic) and university students. Its not enough if you do good, you gotta box it up, if not deliver it to the world !"}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of pizza in my life, and I think it's safe to say that this is the best pizza I have ever had. Perfectly seared, with a soft and chewy crust. The piccante was fantastic, the milk and honey was unique, but the classic margarita was the best by far. We're already looking forward to returning for more options. Bonus? They still have gelato, a vestige of the former gelateria that occupied this space."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but not great. Service was good. Olive plate was good however I would have liked to have seen more than two varieties of olives.  There was a 25 wait for dinner which was absolutely fine, but there is no place to actually wait. So you either have to go buy a drink somewhere else or wait outside. Would go back, but not in a rush."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and so happy we came and tried this place out while visiting Cleveland.   We started with the arugula salad and shared two pizzas, the cheese with an addition of pepperoni and the white pizza! All of the above were excellent and really loved the arugula salad!   The gelato is so good!!!! Very yummy!!! Can't go wrong with any of the flavors!"}
{"text":"Finally, an authentic Italian pizza in Cleveland. It is delicious. Period.  We could not stop talking about how much it reminded us about pizza in Italy.  We also had Burratta and house salad which were very impressive.  We will definitely be back.  Only negative might be the gelato, but that probably has more to do with me picking \"cereal milk\" flavor than anything else.  Chocolate and vanilla with chocolate chips were much better than what I picked...I should have known to stick with the tried and true favors.    I'll be back.  No question"}
{"text":"I think the restaurant is great. I love the food. The only issue i have had is that sometimes they like to over-char some dishes (sometimes the pizza but for sure the Brussel sprouts).   If I could change one thing it would be that they take reservations. They do not take reservations and I have always had to wait. It makes me hesitant to go there and also to invite other people as I do not know how long the wait will be. It has been up to an hour long."}
{"text":"Small quaint place for great Napoleon style pizza. We had three kinds and loved them all. Reminds me of a place in Chicago called Dinotto."}
{"text":"On suggestion from Scene mags, very positive review or Vero, we tried it one Saturday night.  One key point the article missed, was that in lieu of the fact that they don't currently have a liquor license, you CAN bring your own wine! And they provide the glasses and corkscrew! NO CORKAGE FEE! Now on to the pizza....it was delicious!  We had  two, (as they are only about 11\" pies) The pancetta with egg, and the Capriciossa.   The pancetta with egg was our favorite, but it's a weekly featured pie, and not always available.    The dough is sweet and delicious, not a pan pizza, and not over loaded with cheese.  These are authentic Napoletana pizzas. They have a distinct  way of being cooked and served, and  as the owners will tell you, best consumed on the premises.  There are salads, and other small plates available on the menu, which all sounded mouth-watering.    Definitely going to try next time.  And don't expect to get a huge pizza, loaded to the brim, with cheese and toppings.  Think Quality vs Quantity!  You'll be very satisfied!"}
{"text":"They have the best wood fired pizza in Cleveland. They use high quality, authentic ingredients and their crust is absolutely perfect. Just the right amount of crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. And I love that they use fresh seasonal ingredients like ramps in their specials. Seriously, their chef is a genius in the kitchen. If you haven't checked it out yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype about this place is all about because the food is just ok- wasn't bad and wasn't amazing. We started off with the garlic bread which was a total waste of money- $6 for a piece of garlic bread. The pizza is very doughy and not crispy which I didn't like, although very flavorful. I was not impressed. Also, pretty expensive. $45 for 2 medium sized pizzas and some garlic bread."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a late weekend dinner in Little Italy, there are sparse locations to choose from since many places close at 9pm or 10pm. After noticing that Vero Pizza was open late, I decided to stray from my usual Little Italy favorites and give it a try. I was surprised to find that this restaurant isn't really in Little Italy at all, but rather in the Coventry area. Either way, it's easy to get to if you're on the East side, and given that it's away from the hustle and bustle of Mayfield Road, it's a little easier to find parking.   Entering the restaurant, I noticed it has a very trendy feel to it, perhaps even Scandinavian in its design. The design details are well thought out, and the space definitely is understated but also modern. There was a short wait for a table as the restaurant is small, probably about 5 tables on the 1st floor, and another 5 or 6 on the 2nd floor. No worries though, because there's a VERY short bar (2-3 seats) and a gelato cooler to choose from. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have mixed drinks, only beer and wine, but we ended up trying out a pistachio affogato instead (eating backwards anyone?). It was fantastic, and I'm glad we ended up getting this first because I definitely wouldn't have had room after the pizza! They had a lot of unique flavors to choose from in the gelato cooler, and the espresso was done well- strong but not bitter at all. The service while we were waiting was great, all the servers took turns attending to those waiting for tables or those strolling in for gelato.  While you're waiting for your table, you can take a gander at the large brick oven in the kitchen, as the smell of toasted pizza crust fills the restaurant. The loft where we were seated was cozy, intimate... albeit a little warm given the heat from the oven and the small space. The menu here is small, but impressive. A lot of their ingredients are sourced locally, and they even list the farms that supply the restaurant at the bottom. You'll find a few tapas/appetizers, salads, and a few vegetable sides. We ended up just opting for one pizza each, and tried some of their sparkling sodas to pair. The pizzas range from about $12-$15, a little bigger than a personal pan... I would say it's a generous size for the quality of the pizza. I have a decent appetite and I wasn't able to finish mine. Although the pizza I was looking for was no longer on their menu, they were able to whip up something similar (egg and cured meat) while my friend got the Piccante. I would say the wait time was probably about 20 minutes for the pizzas. Both of the pizzas were absolutely fantastic, I've never had crust quite like this locally. It's thin crust, but more chewy than crunchy. The toppings were perfection, egg has to be my new favorite pizza topping. There is a good ratio of toppings on the pizza, so you get a perfect bite every time. Some people might not enjoy the slightly burnt crust from the stone oven, but I personally loved it. Overall, my first experience here was great, and I cannot wait to return. It's a perfect stop for a date night or an evening to share some appetizers and pizzas with friends, perhaps as an alternative to the nearby crowds of Little Italy."}
