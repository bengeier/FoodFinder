{"text":"A rare good Korean restaurant outside of the main Korean neighbourhoods!  The Ja Jang Myun and Beef Ribs were highlights, while the pork stew and mackeral were solid as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Upon entering this restaurant, we were welcomed into what seemed to be a warm, hospitable Korean environment; We could not have imagined a more horrifying experience. With what began as a simple misunderstanding with the order we placed (they mistook an \"S\" for a \"5\") and a polite request for them to bring out the dish we had originally wished for, we were taken aback when the waiter rudely mentioned that we must pay for the wrong dish as well! Never have I ever heard that we must be entitled to pay for a faulty dish! When we asked to speak to the manager (that having taken multiple requests before she finally arrived to our table), we made her aware of our dilemma, and she denied it straight off the bat by saying it was OUR FAULT and that no language barrier was involved. As our last little retaliation, we told her we'd never eat at her establishment again. Her response? \"That's okay\".... Needless to say, we were highly unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Very reluctantly went back with a church group on Sunday, February 24, 2013. Was not my choice, obviously. The only thing I felt like eating was the Jjajangmyun (in spite of the former experience here with Jjajangmyun being a depressingly bland letdown). I actually enjoyed it this time! The portions got a bit bigger/saucier, it's still 2 for $10 & they don't allow me to give half stars on Yelp, so being the really awesome person that I am, decided to give this place 4 stars. Did this place make me a tad crazier? Perhaps. Oh well!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Sharon's Garden on May 2nd 2013. First time eating here after hearing my friend rave about this place. She was recommended this place by an old Korean grandma that lived in her condo building. (That means it must be good.)  There are two entrances to this restaurant. I arrived to the entrance that was located in the plaza. There is another entrance facing the parking lot. The restaurant inside has an interesting layout and this place is huge since they lease the lot that use to be a supermarket. The layout of the tables are by rooms and each room sort of like a garden maze of table. After entering the restaurant entrance from the plaza I past by a room that can house a party of approx 60. They had disco ball on with karaoke system on and tables all set up. Lol I never saw a karaoke set up at a Korean restaurant.   I arrived at 6:30pm. I followed the waitress to our table which was situated in the main central area of the restaurant. I past by 4 rice cookers and the kitchen was half open concept so you can see what's going on back there. I didn't understand why so many rice cookers till I saw their menu. They had so many different options of rice! Regular white rice, white mix with brown rice, white brown bean rice and I think one more I don't remember. There was probably 10 to 15 tables occupied. You had regular height chairs and tables and on one side there's tables where you sit on the floor. They did not have buzzers for a place this large. Yet you can easily flag the waitress down since they normally stand near the kitchen monitoring all tables from all rooms.  The menu had the typical Korean dishes and the typical Korean prices so its reasonable.  Side dishes was a bummer. We had a plate of fresh kimchi which scissors was given to cut on your own and a small dish of yellow dyed sour daikons.  My friend ordered one of the bibimbap (mix rice) in a stone bowl. I ordered a combo size jajangmyun (black bean noodle) that came with 6 gyoza (fried dumplings).    I enjoyed my noodles and dumplings very much for the price of $7.99 (I think it was $7.99 or $8.99. I could be wrong) but I like the option to have a small bowl of noodle with a side instead of just have a large bowl of just jajangmyun. Because it can be too much noodle. They had other options of jajangmyun combos with other sides like sweet and sour pork. The food was great and it fed my hunger.  The restaurant was clean. There were many TVs on the wall playing Korean singing shows. The waitress was nice always came to refill tea. Tables and chairs were made of wood. Decor was very woody and garden like feel. Casual setting. I didn't visit the washrooms so I don't know how clean it was but heard from the friend that it was a maze to get there.  I would come here again to try other dishes. Minus one stars because I like Korean food because of the side dishes."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch frankly because there was nothing else in the plaza.  With pricing as it is was we figured there wasn't much to lose.    There are a lot of lunch specials to choose from and I chose a bento box of sorts that includes bibimbap and jajang noodles.  It also included a drink and for a hefty price tag of $8.88.  Hubby had the Tuesday special of kalbi tang for $10.00.  Sadly his soup wasn't remarkable and he said the meat was tough.  My meal was fine, not fabulous but decent considering the price.    So we won't rush back but our lunch wasn't a complete miss.  I'd definitely give it anothe shot."}
{"text":"Really good Korean food in Scarborough.  Really happy with the food here... Had the black bean noodle and sweet/sour chicken combo.  It came out perfectly.  Next time will try the desserts :)"}
{"text":"All the dishes are great especially Spicy seafood udon is my favourite.  And they have a lot of menu option to have combo meal.  That was really cool thing.  Price is very reasonable and  staff was friendly, too. I am gonna try other food next time."}
{"text":"Sharon Garden is one of a few restaurants part of a chain.. ie. Song Cook (located at Yonge and Steeles). This one is located at McNicoll and Victoria Park hidden at the back of a plaza.   It is a nicely renovated restaurant with a large space which holds probably about 100 guest if needed. They have private rooms, floor sitting dining as well as regular dining tables. The far back of the restaurant is their massive restaurant which holds and displays everything from Makgeolli (korean rice wine) to take out food displays.   Once you walk in you get greeted nicely to a space that is fully equipped with utensils, table mat (menu) and an actual menu. Each spot has a buzzer button where you can press when you need attention. if you feel like having fun then try pressing it as many time as possible (joking).  The food portion are huge and so is the selection. The food is fresh, hot and delicious. Every order comes with side dishes which is common in the Korean dining culture. Pricing wise i think it is a tad steep but for the comfort then it's worth it.  Parking is a bit ugly and tight so beware of this on weekends.   Give this place a try, it's not too bad to go here every so often to enjoy a nice hot bowl of Kam Ja Tang (pork bone soup)."}
{"text":"First time here so we ordered many different dishes such as soon tofu soup, black bean noodles, fried chicken with sauce, and a hot sizzle beef plate. Although portions are huge, their quality honestly isn't comparable to any Korean restaurants I've had in Toronto/GTA - it seems like they use spice to mask their quality of food. Their prices are higher than many Korean restaurants I've been to - at least the $13 mark for a soon tofu soup with rice. Would not come back for the second time."}
{"text":"This place was terrible!  Banchan was limited to uncut kimchi and a really small plate of yellow pickled radish.  Main course took almost 40 minutes!!  They charge for rice when you order any stew.  What do they expect you to eat the stew with???!! If you ask for anything else like refilling your tea, good luck.  Ringing the button didn't help either.  You would be better off going to Gumi on Lawrence and Pharmacy, or Makalchon on Warden and Lawrence."}
{"text":"Huge place, with nice interior, suitable for a party I guess. I saw a catering menu so I think they do that. They also have traditional Korean seating which is pretty cool if you got flexible legs. Food presentation is nice as with Korean restaurants in general. Offers a large variety of combo dishes which is great for people who don't know what to get.   Only thing I didn't like was too many menus, took me a long time to look through and make a decision. Pictures in the menu were small and not very clearly matched with the menu items. Over, semi-pricey.  Liked the genuwine service and the seafood pancake for being nice and crispy. Would like to try more items!"}
{"text":"This place is now under new management and   EVERYTHING has improved. So much that I increased my rating from 1 star to 3. The menu is huge with tons of specials. The deals are so cheap that 2 people can eat dinner for under $20. There is a dish that can satisfy everyone whether you like spicy, sweet, soupy, meaty, or vegetarian. For those who don't prefer Korean food there are some Japanese and Chinese dishes. The restaurant is huge with tons of seating so big and small parties can all be accommodated. There's also a party room for private events. Only bad thing is that the waitstaff can get rammed during busy times and sometimes forget orders or will take longer than normal for service.  Overall: great bang for buck  Bonus: menu is in Korean, English and Chinese"}
{"text":"The food here is cheaper than song cooks and exactly the same thing.  Ample parking and tons of lunch specials for those that want to visit with coworkers.  The menu is vast so there's always something for everyone.  It is a Korean-Chinese restaurant so don't expect side dishes. You'll only get kimchi, radishes, and onions with black bean sauce to dip in.   I recommend the jang jjang myun and kang poongi. The noorungji is really good too. I also enjoy the fried rice although it can be greasy sometimes."}
{"text":"Yeah.   I guess I expected a bit more as I heard from sources say that this place had everything shipped in from Korea. (Like all the kitchen equipment are from Korea and such...)  When I walked in, wasn't any welcome, the guy just direct me to a table. I thought I got some bad / non-service, but later I saw that he treat a couple of young girls the same way, that's when I know everyone got the same treatment.  As stated above, of course no one offered me anything or let me know if there is any special. So I took some time to read thru the menu, yet I couldn't find anything has squid as main ingredient. Ended up choosing a combo meal for one.  The cucumber in the side-dishes were the best thing of the night. The cabbage kimchi was bland. The pancake doesn't have any seafood, nor enough vegetable in it to be called a vegetable pancake, just some green onion and very few strips of carrot, again, no taste at all.  The steamed egg, was full of the main ingredient, egg. And nothing else. The kal-bi? Was barely cooked through, but really tough, one of the worst kal-bi I have ever had in a restaurant. (Even taste testing counter in the supermarket does a better job.)  Will I return? No."}
{"text":"First time I ate here. I love the authentic Korean atmosphere and their decorations. When I was there I just order kamjahtang, I love how they made it. More tastier and the meat not over cook..   On the downside, their kimchi was too hot for me. I almost choke because too spicy and the seaweeds was very chewy.. Other than that I love everything. Oh their crew were nice too.."}
{"text":"Trusting Jennifer K., I've been to Sharon twice in the last week.  Being a Korean food novice, I'm still working myself through the menu, but very impressed so far with the food and service.  Very nice large space which can be sectioned off to more cozy settings.  Very glad to have this restaurant in the neighborhood to add elegant variety to the many Chinese/Hong Kong choices.  According to internet chatter, this restaurant is affiliated with the Song Cook in Mississauga, but not the one at Steeles & Yonge in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Warm welcome, we were approached with a friendly smile and an inviting tone! You have to call them to serve you. A good thing is they have a call button at each of the tables. They come right away as soon as after hitting the button. Food was great. Price was average. Ambiance and setting quite nice. My friend and I sat on the floor seat, Japanese style!! (I guess that's traditional Korean way too) loved the experience. Floor seats are heated.  I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times with family and I've had one take-out lunch special.  The food here is always really delicious and the atmosphere is nice. The decoration and furnishing of the restaurant is, from what I'm told, a very traditional Korean design. The staff is also very friendly.   I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Recently came back for lunch and I ordered my usual Soondubu combo and they definitely bumped the price up by A LOT. It's now $22 or 23!! Ohmygoodness... You get their soondubu + rice + the side of choice and now you get salad instead of a steamed egg? At least that's what I got when I was here. It was a Western salad but it had a Japanese like sauce in it. Almost like the ones I had at Shiso Tree Cafe. I can't even decide if I like the steamed egg more or the salad... The salad tasted pretty out of place compared to our dishes.  We were also given orders that weren't ours (somehow this always happens???) and the bill took forever to come - we had to ring in 3 times and it wasn't that busy either.  I wondered if they changed owners since I hear the servers speaking Chinese instead of Korean. The lady who served me food is Korean but the host and another lady is Chinese.   We got full of our meal but our lunch totalled up to like $50 (+tips)... which is a pretty expensive lunch. Not sure if I would come here during lunch again at this price :((("}
{"text":"I wish i could give them minus stars. I called in advance to see if they're open since it was Christmas day. They answered saying they are open as regular hours. We had 4 adults and 3 kids 5(7yrs, 2yrs, and a 1 yr old) we finally got to the restaurant and. they gave us the menu and gave us time to look over the menu. as we were ready to order one of the server tells us that their manager told them to close the restaurant. How rediculous is this? So  We call the manager over to our table and she says I'll give you 30 minutes to eat. Seriously?? Do you think anyone can finish eating in 30 minites with 3 kids? She offered us an hour but how can you eat and enjoy food in an environment where you know everyone is waiting for you to leave?? We drove at least 40 minutes to have some food now we have to drive back an hour. This is a terrible way of doing business to begin with and the way that the manager handled the situation was absurd and unprofessional. I would NEVER EVER come back here again."}
{"text":"The black bean noodle was a bit of a disappointment which made the noodle combo seem like a waste. Their spicy cold noodle was quite good as well as their apps. They also make good mackerel"}
{"text":"It's huge inside so you will never have to wait. However the price is on the higher side and the taste is only average (or maybe even below average...) they have a hugeeeee menu so no shortage of variety. The service is pretty quick as well which is good. There are definitely better Korean restaurants around tho."}
{"text":"I live around the neighbourhood and I have never came here. So my group of friends (20) decided to come here. I was like sure, let's try it. This restaurant is quite big with many hidden rooms as their core design. Having a quiet conversation with a small group of friends is very possible. So we sat down with our group of 20 with no reservation, we were divided into 4 rooms/stalls. That's cool.   So I ordered the lunch special chicken teriyaki + ja jeun meen lunch bento box. First time ever I had the ja jeun meen. This tasted quite good, not too salty. Chicken teriyaki was alright. I know their prices went up a bit. But this was still worth it.   I liked how the restaurant has better air circulation compare to other Korean restaurants I've been to. I am certainly going to come back and try other stuff. One good thing, I didn't come out smelling like food. Overall experience = 3.5/5."}
{"text":"First time here. Lot of private rooms. We had a group of 12 today. Order 12 different dishes. The beer at cheap but only one kind Is Canadian for $2.99. The appetizer is not good and only 3 different kind. The food is very average. Food are not very hot and it gets cold quick once it's served. The service are very good. It's good if you just drink and snack."}
{"text":"I came to this Korean restaurant located on the southeast corner of Victoria Park and McNicoll with my brother, as him and his partner has tried their takeaway a few times and they thought it was decent so he decided to take me and my mum here on a Saturday.  First of all, parking is scarce, especially meal times. Parking spots are also extremely tight, I guess they tried to squeeze as many spots on the lot as possible. This isn't Sharon Garden's fault though, so no stars deducted for this, but it must be pointed out as a warning. There are two entrance to this restaurant, one from the outside, closest to the further regions of the parking lot, the other is an indoor entrance from the adjoining building.  We were seated just after noon time and it wasn't very busy, but as we sat, people started to come in. Sharon Garden has many TV screens on their walls playing Korean shows and music videos.   The service is not bad, but also not great. They bring you a cup of tea automatically, but because they also don't give you a teapot per table, they're not very good at refilling these cups. Even with service buttons at each table, it is still a bit slow.   Their food is ok. Pretty good kimchi (seriously though, you mess that up, you're pretty much out of business), their japchae was hard, their pajeon (seafood pancake) was decent but not worth the price, their gamjatang was pretty good (mum was a fan), and their bibimbap was up to par.  The washrooms are very cold, but they're pretty nicely decorated, it also has mouthwash so you can have that fresh mouth clean.  Go give them a try and judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and I'm definitely a fan! The food has been consistently good and there is fantastic variety.   In terms of free appetizers (banchan) the usual dishes are kimchee and picked radish. The last two times we also got glass noodles (jap chae) and an eggplant/broccoli combo.   They have daily lunch specials that are very good deals! On Saturday its pork bone soup for $6.50. The every day lunch deals include bulgogi, pork cutlet, sushi rolls, or chicken, each with black bean noodle, salad, dumplings and rice. Large portions and amazing tasting food.  I've really enjoyed the Kalbi Jim (beef rib stew), the mackerel, sweet and sour chicken, even the beef teriyaki is delicious!   If you come with a larger group, you will likely get seated in one of the rooms for large parties. Lots of space and doorbells beside the tables to signal the waiter when needed.  On the topic of waiters, I find the service inconsistent. I've had some pretty spaced out waiters but the most recent visit my waitress was very good. Here's hoping the service continues to improve!"}
{"text":"Despite the mediocre reviews, I decided to come. I'm glad I came. The majority of their menu is in English, Korean, and Chinese. Their main menu also has descriptions of most of their dishes, which helps for those they've just spelled in English. Their main menu is more expensive than a lot of Korean restaurants I've seen, and I don't know the reason for this given that their location isn't particularly expensive, but their specials are very reasonably priced.  Had:  Naengmyun - Noodles in cold broth. Arrowroot noodles. Fairly thin noodles. I would say slightly more underdone than I'd like (I prefer my noodles on a slightly more cooked level), but definitely still good. Toppings in included a few slices of radish, some shreds of cucumber, a few thinly sliced pieces of cold beef (slightly dry), and half a boiled egg. Delicious broth.The broth was delicious and refreshing, slightly sweet, but also slightly tangy, but still savory as well.  It was also adequately chilled (note the really good amount of frozen broth slush).   Ual Eum Cham Pong - Seafood and noodles in cold, spicy broth. It really wasn't very spicy. Unless your spice tolerance is maxed out at pepperoni, you can probably handle this. That being said, this was lovely. The noodles were more like jajangmyun white noodles, and they had a good bite without being undercooked. The noodles were topped with shredded cucumbers, half a hard boiled egg, a few shrimps, a handful of finely sliced squid, and perhaps radish?  Something like that. I forget. The broth was similar to the naengmyun one (also with the delicious slushy broth), but there were two dollops of some kind of seasoned hot sauce on top of the noodles as well.  These two noodle dishes were $16.99 total (you get to choose two of the three: naengmyun, ual eum cham pong, or beef jajangmyun). It was my first time having naengmyun, and I can say I really enjoyed it. Oh. The two cold noodles were served hot mustard and wasabi on the side). Those gave the noodles an extra kick that I quite appreciated. Seriously great dishes to eat in the summer. Super refreshing.  Jajangmyun + spicy pork ($12) - Jajangmyun was the best I've had in Toronto. I've never met a jajangmyun that I didn't want to put chili powder or something into, until this one. I usually find jajangmyun very one-dimensional. This one, for whatever reason, wasn't. The noodle base was quite good too. The spicy pork was quite tasty as well. Spicy soybean paste? Something like that. Served on a sizzling plate atop sliced onions, the portion was quite reasonable as well. I thought it was cooked well too (not dry and overcooked, but not tenderized within an inch of its life).  One thing I'd say about the noodles is that it would be nice if they cut their noodles down in length. We had to get scissors.  Grilled mackerel (2 pieces for $10, or 1 for $6) - We got 2 pieces. Served on 2 separate plates, both with a thick slice of lemon (not a wedge). Really good sized pieces. Lovely, crispy brown bits. Cooked so the insides were still juicy. Totally worth the price. Definitely will be coming back for this.  Banchan was not particularly diverse (kimchi, yellow radish in big slices, sprouts and japchae). Asked for a refill on sprouts. Were told they ran out, but they did bring another dish of japchae out with their apology, so all was forgiven.   I believe they're actually Korean owned. Our server was Korean and they were playing a Korean music show on TV (MBC Show Champion, anyone?)  Oh. They have patbingsu (Korean shaved ice). Small is $4.50? I'll be back to try it (hopefully) before the summer ends."}
{"text":"We came here one night after getting to Toronto and it was a second choice as our first choice was just too heavily packed.   The table was odd as it was unbalanced and they didn't do much to fix it. So had to eat carefully or watch the table unbalance while worrying of food will drop.  We ordered a plethora of choices but overall I found the food a little high on the msg side and was feeling thirsty right after eating. Portion sizes were rather medium and the flavour was there.   Not wildly impressed with this place but I won't visit again it's a one time thing for me."}
{"text":"First place I've had really good cold noodles, but given it was winter, we got a beef and veggie pot for 2. It was decent but didn't really enjoy their brown rice. It was slimy and sticky.. The pot had a lot of veggies, but the picture is deceiving."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Very big and pretty, has tables where you can sit on the floor  Food: 1. Stewed beef stone pot- 2/5 disappointed, there wasn't that many pieces of meat, the stew was overly sweet, and overly priced  2. Soft Tofu soup: 2/5 portion was tiny, have had much better  Overall: Probably be back to try other stuff, food wise, i would say its pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT. Waitresses are decent/whatever. But the quality of food was very poor.  Every single dish including side dishes were either extremely salty or bland. The main dish tasted like soaked oil.. like stale oil.. ugh. My visit was just not pleasant at all.  Felt like absolute waste of money, time and energy."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a quick lunch with my mom so we decided to stop by here. The decor is quite nice and gives you a welcoming and open feeling. Service was alright and they have the bell system by each table so you can indicate you need a server or the bill.  I had the dumplings and black bean noodles. Tastes pretty good but I think could have had a bit more flavor. Everything we tried tasted pretty good but not anything really special. :)"}
{"text":"Sharon Garden has been around for a few years -- I remember when the spot used to be a Chinese supermarket in this business centre at Victoria Park/McNicoll.  Finally got around to trying it today since my dad was up for checking it out.  Parking in the plaza is always very tight - the spots are smaller than normal, so be careful when you're driving in/out.  We were confused about the entrance into the restaurant itself since you have to walk a bit further in before you can actually see anyone there.  We were seated promptly and were given a stack of menus.  They have lunch specials that are of a bento box kind of variety that includes side dishes and a drink (water, pop, or miso soup).  The dad got a bulgogi lunch box and I got the sashimi lunch box (both are pretty much the same: salad, rice, 2 gyoza, small portion of jajangmyeon, bulgogi/salmon sashimi).  The interior of the restaurant is very interesting: traditional Korean setup with hot pot / KBBQ grills on the tables.  When we got there, the main eating area was about 70% full but it was pretty quiet.  The wait staff appeared to speak both Mandarin and English, which was a bit surprising -- however, given the area, I wasn't too surprised.  The woman who seated us appeared to be one of the owners and spoke Korean her to kitchen staff.  The food came pretty quickly after ordering and was hot.  Our meal came with four small side dishes.  The bulgogi was pretty good, seemed like the sauce was a bit too watery.  I liked the jajangmyeon sauce so I might come back again and just have their jajangmyeon.  The salmon sashimi was a generous portion but I would've preferred if they didn't cut up the salmon into cubes.  The gyoza wasn't too special since it was only two pieces and seemed pretty standard.  Overall, a good place to come in for lunch that seems like it's worth the money (and careful parking)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my new favourite Korean restaurant in Toronto. The interior is spacious. You can choose to sit in a regular table/booth, or seated cross legged on the ground. It's fancier and kind of fun.  I ordered a seafood tofu soup and it was really delicious. The soup was $11.99 for a small and comes with rice. My meal came with 3 sides: chap chae (rice noodles), kim chi, and bean sprouts. They let you refill as many times as you want. The meal is served with corn tea. At the end of the meal, you get a cinnamon/ginger tea."}
{"text":"I come here when I know that there is a large group of people that needs to be accommodated for a meal. They have an enormous nicely decorated space, and they are always willing to open the side rooms if needed. Buzzers on the tables ensures that there is a waiter to help you no matter where you end up being seated.  The food prices has steadily crept up over the years, but a typical lunch meal will set you back around $15 these days so it's not too bad. I usually get the Jajangmyeon, which is a large bowl of noodles slathered with a black noodle sauce. It is slightly sweet and mainly just noodles, but having a large bowl of carbs is just comforting sometimes. Another recommended dish would be the Naengmyeon cold noodles, which is a unique dish you don't usually find. Ice cold broth (there are ice cubes in there) with noodles and veggies. Perfect for a hot summer day!"}
{"text":"Good Korean restaurant with a HUGE menu. You want K barbeque? They do it. You want soup? They got lots! Stone bowls? Bim bam bap, katsu dinners, black bean noodles? dumplings? They have it! They also do purple rice with the set menus.   Some menu items seem high in prices - but then they do offer a lot of combo meals that I think are quite reasonable. What I like most is that they have combo meals. My go to is The black bean noodles paired with dumplings. I think it's about $10. I always have leftovers.  I've also had the tofu soup and it's tasty and good amount of spice.   They have the free apetitizers at the beginning of the meal - an assortment of mostly cold apps, such as kimchi, bean sprouts, noodles and others. You can ask for refills if you desire.    Everyone is super friendly - Always a cheerful greeting when you enter. Nice and cozy and they have the TV set to Korean programming as well.   Parking can be dodgy at times, it really depends on what time you go, since there is a seafood/banquet Chinese restaurant a couple of spaces down and a small plaza with other eateries and small shops/offices in the plaza."}
{"text":"Side dishes (cucumber, kimchii and glass noodles). With only 3 side dishes its hard to be impressed when other places like Nak Won offer 8 side dishes.  Pork bone soup $8.95 - I took one look at it and I knew something was wrong. Usually there is pork bone overflowing from the bowl like a mountain of meat but this bowl I got here was not even peaking above the bowl. I only got 2 pork bones. I have had countless numbers of pork bone soup and I'm use to getting about 4 pieces of pork bone. The soup was good at least and wasn't overly salty in taste. Still I was really disappointed and sulked throughout my meal at how little pork bone there was.  Also got the combo black bean noodle with sweet and sour pork $14 - The noodles were good but came in smaller portion because of the combo. The sweet and sour pork were just okay. They were a bit soggy because of all the sauce and did not have any crispiness to it.  Service was excellent and is about the only compliment I can give this place."}
{"text":"My experience here is probably not going to be your average experience. We were a Christmas party of nearly 30 so we got a room with catering for a private function. I loved going into a place where they had a sign for our party. I've always wanted to be one of those people! Made me feel extra special!  Staff: They were very nice and helped serve and clear plates in a timely manner for a catered event. They also brought a button to us to use to call if we needed anything else. Also generous enough to provide a lot containers to take away left over extra food. Every staff we walked by also greeted us on the way out so that left a great impression on me.  Ambience: This room was huge! I think the sign said max 60 people but we were half that size. We had two long tables going. At the back was all the food in party trays and drink dispensers. One side even had a karaoke machine and sound system with an extensive list of songs (but we didn't get around to it). They also had coat hooks to hang our jackets too. The restaurant itself was big as a whole. I saw lots of rooms and tables as I went to the washroom.  Food: A lot of the food was really good. I always love the glass noodle dishes and this restaurant didn't let me down. They also had the juiciest chicken legs as well. Great vegetable tempura with the right crispy batter too. There were a few dishes that were duds for me. The radishes were very plain for me. Some dishes were heavy on the spiciness and didn't have any other flavour, so I couldn't really appreciate that. Because of those dishes I had to take away a star.  Overall I think it's a great venue for large parties. I'll have to come back and try their regular menu too!"}
{"text":"First off, the parking spots are SUPER SMALL....You or someone could easily slam his/her doors right into each other's doors and make a dent there....However, there are tons of empty parking space, so if you want, you can park far away....  This korean restaurant is huge, but free appetizer dishes are small. We had 4 people but only had 3 appetizer dishes with only kimchi, beans sprout, and glass noodle. I remembered other places have more and more selections. Also, I think prices are kind of expensive.  A wonderful part about this restaurant is that they have this calling bell (with \"call\" and \"bill\" buttons on it), but it doesn't work all the time even you hear a \"ding\" sound after pressed. The waitress will not come over, so you might need to press it few more times. On the other hand, if you pressed the \"bill\" button, they will come super fast with the bill."}
{"text":"Came on a busy Saturday afternoon - always a good sign.   The decor of this place is pretty nice. The service is great, they always fill your tea and will check up on you.   One thing I really enjoyed is the Kimchi. The portion is extremely generous and its pretty tasty. I ordered the pork bone soup, bf ordered the chicken katsu and we ordered a small kalbi to share. My pork bone soup is pretty good, there's layers of flavors from the pork and the heat is perfect. They don't serve you white rice with the soup, it's the healthier version with barley. BF's chicken Katsu is pretty good, chicken stays moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. Portion is pretty generous. Kalbi is my fav of the three. Juicy tender meat served on a hot plate with onions.   I'm so glad I can enjoy authentic Korean food with nice decor around this area. Lots of parking space! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A nice and quite place, we had bibimbap and pork bone potato soup, the bibimbap not hot enough so my egg didn't really cook, pork bone potato soup only have one small piece of potato, also the soup was very salty. Sides dishes were so little.... Service was nice, nothing much to complaint."}
{"text":"Good and simple Korean food. The food isn't great but it's good enough. Service is prompt and friendly. And attractive.   Good place for groups and a change of pace. I wouldn't really recommend it to someone that wanted a really good Korean experience. I'd recommend the place to sample a lot of different dishes"}
{"text":"At first I thought this restaurant wasn't so bad.  Until I encounter the worse experience from the owners. The owner (male) was really rude to me and very unprofessional. I had told him that there was a piece of hair in my food and he got upset and started to yell and deny that there was hair in my food. The place is not at clean as I thought it was and I was very disappointed. I didn't appreciate the way he was talking to me nor the he way he treated me. I felt really threatened by his tone.   In conclusion, I would never recommend this place to anyone. The food is very oily and the cleanliness in the kitchen really makes me think twice about eating here again. It was a simple complaint and he made it a very big issue. Unprofessional and not a restaursnt I would spend my hard working money at."}
{"text":"friendly staff & nice ambiance. If u want to try their pork bone soup, better go thursday or weekend."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Scarborough. This place is an authentic Korean restaurant with your typical korean dishes, shabu shabu, and kbbq. It's clean and spacious (even their washrooms, complete with mouth wash!) and staff are friendly and efficient. For those that don't know, it's actually a sister restaurant of the one at Yonge and Steeles, which is a tad bigger than Sharon's and even has a karaoke section. Yes, karaoke.   Dishes are a decent size for what you pay for.  Their kam ja tangs are SUPER meaty (at least the one that I got) and flavours are on point. Their pork cutlets however are a bit on the week side, a bit thin but not dry; still tender.   Def worth a visit (or more) if you're looking for homey korean food."}
{"text":"This is a place i often frequented when i worked nearby.  It was mostly for takeout but i did dine in once. I love pork bone soup, and realistically, you can't mess up such an iconic meal. so let's move on from that.  I've ordered a couple the options on their takeout menu. pork cutlet and fried dumpling. they were not bad for the price. the only thing that stuck out to me in a negative way was the cold noodles it came with are very very sweet. i would prefer the filler to be less flavourful. plain rice is a good example if i aren't making much sense right now.  the restaurant itself is huge and can sit many people. they also have seating where you kneel. i don' t know if that's a korean thing but i know it's very common in japan especially in a home setting.  for the dine in experience i had, i wasn't blown away. quite standard, and i wished that there were more options with appetizers. desserts look bomb though, i didn't get to order any because noone else wanted to share with me :(  i'd definitely go back and give this place a second chance on the dine in aspect. it wouldn't be hard to take the customer experience to the next level so it may have already been done by now."}
{"text":"I thought that this restaurant provided excellent food and customer service, hence the 5 stars. The kimchi had a refreshing taste in my opinion, definitely Korean-made. I asked for more and received it shortly. When I asked for ice water, I got a jug. When I asked for a small box to pack up a bit of food at the end, I got it without any negative attitude. The waiter seemed genuinely grateful to receive just $6 for a tip (about 15% of the bill.)   Now about the food: the spicy seafood jajangmyun was the best I've ever had. A large plate for 1 was $11.95, for 2 it was $19.95. Quite an excellent deal. The shrimp fried rice was probably one of the best I've ever tasted as well, and I have eaten a lot of fried rice. It came with their signature black bean sauce.  I came here with my family but will definitely bring my boyfriend for spicy seafood jajangmyun.   I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The K bbq hot stone plate design was just awful. Oil keep dripping to the bottom, where the fire kept flaming. They don't offer eggs and cheese on the side of the k bbq anymore, which was disappointing! Food was ok, just that it was not a memorable experience dining at the Sharon Garden."}
{"text":"Sharon Garden Korean BBQ & Grill newly open at Victoria Park & Mcnicoll has this familiar sign... SONG Cook!   One of the most nicely decorated Korean Restaurants in the neighborhood. Service is friendly and attentive.  Menu is similar to Song Cook, with a selection of Korean and Korean staples. Just love the combo for 1, great for solo diner like me.  Grilled Mackerel ($5) and Soya Braised Beef Rib ($13) both exceeded my expectation in presentation and flavour. The ingredients used were good quality and prepared with care.  I am excited to have Sharon in this Scarborough neighbourhood. I definitely will be back soon.  The dining area are divided into sections so you can book a section for a private event."}
{"text":"I walked in and noticed the place was filled with Koreans (mostly older ones) and the restaurant design is VERY Korean. I thought: is this a good sign? The answer is no, at least in my case.  Like the atmosphere and clientele, the food is very traditionally Korean and authentic. Unfortunately it wasn't to my tastes. The banchan was mostly kimchi and I just can't like it no matter how hard I try. The mackerel was decent. The jjajangmyun was plain and nothing impressive despite all the praise here. I usually don't like jjajangmyun though so I guess it's a good thing. Finally, the bibimbap, which is usually my favourite dish, was mediocre because they use some weird large pieces of lettuce which ruins the taste and the hot sauce was very weak"}
{"text":"service was solid, but the food was the worst thing ever.. every dish my family order was super bland. no taste. added so much soy sauce and salt just to make it bearable. my mother ordered some seafood thing for a good 14$+, and it had like 2 pieces of tiny shrimp.. and the rest was onion.  waste of money, not worth it."}
{"text":"Food is nothing exceptional, service is brutal, the owner was unaccommodating to a group of 30 people refusing to give out separate bills."}
{"text":"I had dinner there with two of my friends. If you are  looking for a quiet place to eat or to have a date. I highly recommend this place. It is a very exclusive, it gives a lot of privacy to the customers   We ordered a BBQ combo. It said was good for two people but for girls I think it was good for three people. The manager was nice too. He came and helped us to cook the meat and the cut them. He also shared how to eat the meat in the best way. It was a pleasant experience.  We also tried the fried dumplings and it felt home made because of its dough.   Also they filled up our side dishes very fast! Ahah I love Korean side dishes. They gave us so much too!"}
{"text":"Sharon Garden recently open near our house on Victoria Park Ave & McNicoll Ave and it the sister location of one of my fave Korean Restaurant Song Cook's (see my post here). I already have been twice since December.  Same decor as Song Cook's  Just as Song Cook's, they don't serve you as much side dishes as other Korean restaurant and I would say that's the only down side. But I do love their Kimchi here which is not very spicy or sour at all. Love how they serve you the whole big piece and you can cut it yourself.  Ja Jang Myun ~ veggies, beef and black bean sauce on noodles ~ Same as Song Cook's and definitely still the best in Toronto. See my previous comment here and it's definitely a must order   Bi Bim Bap ~ This is a perfect bowl of stone pot rice with so much veggies on top... I would say the same amount of rice and topping  ~ with the perfect crispy crust at the bottom.. on of my fave thing to eat in the world   Kam Ja Tang ~ This is one of the dish that I would not recommend ordering here, their pork bone soup is not very spicy at all and not the type of bone that I like (very dry, no soft bone or fatty part to nibble on).  ~ But I do like the amount of bean sprout the put on top, not only does it look pretty but also because I like it in a spicy dishes.  Korean Sweet & Spicy Chicken ~This was not that good compare, the sauce was way too thick and gooyee while the fried chicken is not crispy anymore  Spicy Sauce Pork Ribs ~ There was a choice of regular sweet Korean BBQ sauce and spicy sauce... and of course we order the spicy one but when it came it was rather sweet than spicy so I'm guessing they gave us the wrong one but it was very good nonetheless, it was super tender and flavorful and love how it is served on a mini charcoal grill   There was another room on the side with this sign, I would expect it to be for lunch during weekdays with a more limited lunch menu (aka quicker service).   Verdict : ~ I think you have to now what to order here, a lot of their dishes are really good  although there's some misses. ~ The Ja Jang Myun and Bi Bim Bap are must try here. ~ And I'll def come back for the cold buckwheat noodle here since Song Cook's one is my fave."}
