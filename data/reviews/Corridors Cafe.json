{"text":"Place is pretty good. Food is good. Just a little high priced. $9 for a 6\" wrap, chips, and small drink."}
{"text":"Best office park cafe west of the Mississippi! So friendly, so good  all the breakfast, great. All the lunch great."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast after attending the LDS Phoenix Temple. We ordered breakfast burritos, French toast, and a breakfast quesadilla.   The food was fast, hot, and scrumptious. One of the French toasts was a bit eggy, but it was still wonderful for a quick breakfast. And the quesadilla was perfectly golden with some cheesy eggs!  The service here was excellent! They were very attentive and kind. They even gave us some free cookies! Would recommend to anyone in the area. It's a small, casual little cafe which is great for a short cheap stop!"}
{"text":"Just ordered food to go with some co-workers and it is AMAZING!   We found them on Yelp and wanted to try them after reading the other great reviews. They don't have a website so we didn't know what food they had, so we called them and they sent us pictures of their menu. Very accommodating!   I had the Ken's Chicken Blast wrap...very delicious! We will definitely be eating lunch here again. And probably breakfast as well. I'd highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"A Solid literal hidden gem. It's a cafe attached to the north west part of a seemingly uninteresting business building. I work directly in the area and thought the only nearby food places were 2 miles up the rd. My first time there I got an egg sald sandwich and a cup-o-chilli for around $7.50. It was all super delicious on toasty bread and warm flavorful beans. The security guard recommended the chilli and the cashier was super friendly. Overall I'd say it's worth a visit during lunch. I think anyone would be surprised by the quality of such a low key joint."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from Yelp, so my Co worker and I decided to Try it out. By surprise it was very delicious  and Fresh. Tried the Tom's Wrap, that was delicious and so fresh, my co worker got the Hot Pastrami sandwich and it was Great as well. Tried the Potato Salad that was great.  We will be back. The owner was very nice. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"I had the meatlovers omlett. Wifey had a veggie bliss... Great coffees.  Columbian, and  Jamaican blend. Flavored creams available,  too.  Located in the corporate office building.."}
{"text":"Located in a corporate office building...  Nothing fancy.. just good food.. Flavored creams are always a plus.  Guy is a transplant from the north side of Chicago!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little deli / bodega inside of an office building. First, I have to gush about the owner, Ken. He's a very friendly and nice guy and it's great to be greeted by name (and that must be challenging given how many customers Ken has ... and he knows his regulars). But onto the nitty gritty. This is a simple \"office park\" type deli, but this description doesn't do it justice. The wrap I ordered today tasted great, and was put together very well.   Corridors has also catered some lunches for the place I work, and he has done a stellar job with a nice assortment of sandwiches and chips to suit almost every taste.   Altogether, a great place to get a quick bite to eat (either in, or to go). Way to go Ken, and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I have been working in the building for almost six months and everything I have tried has been so delicious.  If I ever stop working here I would stop by just for lunch, especially when they have the sirloin burgers.... Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"I just realized that this place is on yelp...   This café is located in my office building. I have been going to this café since they open. The owner \"Ken\" is amazing!!!!  He is so welcoming and as picky eater as I am, he is alway ready to fulfill my needs by making sure I get what I want.   This place is very cozy and welcoming and food is decent!   Did I mention that owner Ken will remember you and your name from day one. He takes a pride in his little café and puts whole family to work.   Everyone is so nice and if you are ever in the area I would recommend you swing by for a quick lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! This place used to be called \"Better on a Bagel\" but is now under new ownership as Corridors Cafe.  I would have no idea it was there if it wasn't for the \"Better on a Bagel\" review popping up when I searched yelp for breakfast.  It's located on the northwest corner of the Chubb Group building (Southeast corner of Pinnacle Peak and 23rd Ave) and can be accessed from the outside of the building.  There is no sign.  Once you walk up you can see the BoarsHead sign in the window.  They are open 7am to 2:30pm M-F. I'm usually there between 7 and 8am and there is plenty of parking right in front of the door.  The cafe isn't very big.  It has some indoor and outdoor seating.  They have a small range of normal convenience store items like candy, drinks and office supplies, but their food menu is quite extensive.  I go there about 3 times a week for breakfast and get the same thing, eggs with cheese and bacon.  The owner greets me by name and knows what I order.  Every time I go there he is very pleasant, the food comes quickly and quality is consistent. Prices are very reasonable.  If I get the same thing at another nearby deli, it costs nearly $8, but less than $5 at Corridors.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden gem!  Food is delicious and fresh. The owner and staff are very friendly and accommodating. I recommend the daily specials!  They are always good!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! My friends and I wanted to go out for brunch and we saw reviews on this place and decided to check it out. Little did we know that this wasn't a free standing cafe, but it was inside of a business building. We were about to leave, because it wasn't exactly what we expected, but decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm so glad we did.   The food is great and the prices way more than reasonable. You get very filling portions for less than 10 bucks! The food being great and cheap was only the icing on top, the true treat was the customer servicing.   The owner stayed after he closed, and let my friends and I just sit and talk for a good hour after. He was one of the sweetest men I've ever met, AND AFTER ALL OF THAT HE HELD THE DOOR FOR US! A true gentleman indeed."}
{"text":"A nice little Mom & Pop place that I've been meaning to stop by for some lunch after reading an article about them.  You have to walk down a long corridor from the lobby of the office building to get to the cafe. I ordered a Hot Turkey sandwich with potato salad and a soda. The turkey sandwich was okay, it was topped off with some tomatoes. The potato salad was okay as well. But it looks like they charge for soda refills, no bueno in my book.  I would definitely go here again and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I went to Corridors a few days ago. What an experience. The food is exceptional!  The spicy chicken wrap and the baked potato soup... The BEST. I'm serious, and I lived in the Midwest for a few years.   Besides the food being very, very good, I will say this about the customer service. I watched the owner great customers by name. Everyone was smiling, and you could tell was enjoying themselves. The customer service I witnessed is something that I wish more establishments could mimic, or learn from.  Ken, the owner, has a good thing here. Support this place- because it is really something special!    So do I recommend it?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Sandwiches full of meat and great burritos! It's a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place located at the bottom floor of an office building. Seems like it was designed for the people who work here but also lets them outside customers through a separate entrance. Not only are there price is awesome but the food is pretty good and there is also lots for sale at the counter, like convenient store items, breakfast bars Chips snacks and yogurts and salads. 10 out of 10 will be back again. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast while vacationing in Phoenix, Arizona. Other reviewers are correct - it is cleverly hidden in the corner of an office building!  You drive to the front of the building, then see a sign pointing to the right!  Small area with the morning shows on the TV - Full Blast, and a radio - also at Full Blast! Small food selection, but the Thursday breakfast sandwiches were delicious!  Fun for a time or two, but not every morning! Good for the office workers."}
{"text":"A great little cafe in the middle of a business park area.  Located on the northwest side of the Chubb Insurance Building its not visible from the road. Caters to office buildings in the area.  When you walk in you're not too impressed with the setting but the owner is cheerful and will quickly know your name and call you \"brother\" or \"my friend\" until he does.    Good quality food at a reasonable price.  I get tired of the Happy Valley Road chain restaurants but I can come by here a couple times a week and it never gets old.    Inside and outdoor seating available.   Work in the area?  If so, try it out."}
{"text":"I'm updating this since I finally made it there on a Saturday. The food was pretty good and has a homemade taste. I didn't realize till I was there it's more of a place for people who work in the building, but nontheless they won't turn yout away and the guy was very nice.     I'm only giving this one star because the place is literally never open when I try to go. I understand places close on Sundays but today is Saturday and when they are open, they close earlier then a lot of other places. If your hours change. ..I'll redo my rating."}
{"text":"Good breakfast joint... Fyi- this is in an office building and is the cafe probably intended for the employees so the ambience isn't really a restaurant per se but the food was good, fast & inexpensive. The man at the counter, who I assumed was the owner, was extremely friendly and accommodating. I would go again."}
{"text":"Great little spot inside an office building. The owner Ken is very friendly and knows most of the customers names... I was surprised he knew mine after only the second visit! They are open for breakfast/lunch and have a great selection of drinks, snacks and misc items to purchase. Definitely recommend dropping in or calling in an order to check it out!"}
{"text":"Great place!  I frequently come here for lunch and the food is always great.  We also have him cater for our company parties and the food is excellent.  The owner Ken remembers everyone by name and their recent orders.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Nom-nom-nom-NOM!!  I love this place.  It is a small corner restaurant in an office building so it doesn't stand out too much -- but it worth looking for!    I have been there 10+ times with co-workers and I have tried everything from the wraps to the salad to the chicken shawarma; it all delicious and made to order.  The place is cute too because they have little extra things you can buy in case you need something kind of random, but don't want to go to a second place on your lunch break (think sides of hummus, slim jims, canned soda, candy, snacks, gum, advil, heartburn tablets, an office item or two, etc).  They also have breakfast, but I have not tried it yet (due to no fault of theirs; I am just not a breakfast person).   The owner, Ken, is ahhhh-mazing, so sweet, and remembers people after the first or second visit! The food is consistently good, tastes home made, and the prices are very affordable.  It is a perfect place to stop in if you forgot your lunch, only have a few minutes, or want something satisfying - you can also call ahead your order so it is ready to go!    It is right beside my work and, while it took me about a year to find out about, I am glad I eventually found it!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best food in town for great prices. The owner is so friendly and so is all of the staff. We have used them for regular lunch orders and large catering orders for clients and never had a bad experience. If you are looking for quality food at a great price with amazing service this is the place!"}
{"text":"Very good customer service! I got the French toast and it was nothing special, just how my mom would make it. my friend got the burrito sensation and it was very good and I will get that next time! You can't beat the prices, it's so cheap and you get a decent portion:) definitely wouldn't have gone if I didn't read about it on yelp, it's a hidden place."}
{"text":"Read about this place in a local small newspaper so I had to try it. I had the meat omelette and it was fantastic and for the price it was a steal. You also get a side of home fries with it that were very good too. Definitely will come back to try a sandwich."}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch! We could not decide what to eat today and were starving! My boss found this Cafe on Yelp and said we should eat here, to look at their reviews. We looked online for a menu and unfortunately there was not one. I called and asked if they could send me one. Right away, I assume the owner, sent me a text of pictures of the menu. Our food was ready right away! They were very friendly and the place was clean and nice. He told me we would love the chicken. He was right! The chicken in my wrap was delicious! We will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"So I had been hearing so much about this cafe across from my work so finally i tried it.... I must say i absolutely LOVE this place, not only is the food great but the staff is very nice and make it a point to make a personal interaction with you even when its busy. And a special thank you to the owner Ken he is so nice. Also side note they offer a great selection to vegetarians their ultimate veggie wrap is amazing and their food is very well priced.:)))))"}
{"text":"awesome food, nice people, great price.  food tastes as good as stuff you have at home. you can tell all the food is fresh.   the little girl in the front is very nice and goofy.  the chubby guy in the back is pretty cool as well. over the past month I became a regular customer at the coridor cafe."}
{"text":"Hands down, friendliest place I've ever been!!!  The food was amazing, large selection, everything's fresh, and the owner was super nice and asked us multiple times if there was anything else he could do for us.  Then, about a week later, we went back, and the owner recognized us!!!!  Same great service, amazing food!!! -J-"}
{"text":"First things first. The restaurant is a little hard to find. It's in the tallest building (business/office complex) on the far west corner. You can go in the main entrance then walk to the right. The food was very good and affordable. $4 for a bacon egg and cheese sandwich. It was very simple but tasty!"}
{"text":"Perfect for what we wanted! Delicious, fresh, lots of options, and the great place for breakfast, lunch, or brunch. It is in a random office building, but we were leaving the LDS temple and looking for some food before getting back on the freeway and found this place on Yelp. It's worth finding it in the office building :-) we enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots, must try the chili.  Love the Owner so friendly, customer service is on point.  Daily special change weekly."}
{"text":"Vegan friendly. And just plain friendly as well!  Got the Veggie Bliss...hold the eggs...and put in a wrap. Yum. The rest of the menu was impressive and the chef is great!  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The owner, Ken is very nice.  The food itself was pretty decent too.  I had the blast wrap which was a little spicy but nothing you can't handle.  It came with a choice of side and I added a large iced tea for under $9. Not bad.  Just a tip, this place is in an office building so it's a bit hard to find, unless you work there then you probably know where it is.  Not sure if it's worth going out of your way for, but a decent little meal nonetheless.  When I was leaving there was a giant line from all the people on their lunch break (around noon)."}
