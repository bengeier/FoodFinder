{"text":"Taamia (Egyptian falafel) was beyond delicious and the owner could not possibly be more lovely and inviting. I can't wait for my next visit so I can try the cauliflower shawarma and the tahini shake!!! A great addition to the Northwest part of the valley!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and super friendly staff :)

We had the pickled eggplant, charred babe ganesh, cauliflower shawarma and koshari. 

Everything was delicious, but the koshari is a must have. It was a pretty big portion so it was enough for me and a friend to share!

Definitely stop by if you are craving vegetarian/ vegan food"}
{"text":"Cute place & Very clean! The food was filling & delicious! We had everything Egyptian Street. The staff was very good @ explaining what was in every dish we ordered..I'm vegetarian headed to Vegan! The lemonade is $6.50 and it's worth it! (So good)"}
{"text":"Exceptionally good food!
Honestly, this is the most excited I've been by a new restaurant in a long time.

Yes, the menu is all vegetarian, but this is no bland California salad shop. The dishes here are rich in flavor and texture - beautifully spiced and prepared combining family recipes and traditional street fare direct from Egypt. 

This is an order-at-the-counter place. Then they bring your food out to you. Super casual, but clean and bright.

I *love* Baba Ghanoush - the classic dish made with roasted eggplant and tahini. When I was deciding whether or not to order some here, the owner/chef said \"If you don't like it, I won't charge you for it\". (And then with a big smile) \" ...but you're gonna love it!\" she was absolutely right!   Beautifully smoky and rich - just a little chunky, with lots of vegetables - it is among the best that I've had. The pita that came with it was hot and fresh. 

The Cauliflower Shawarma -topped with  vegetables and  a thickened yoghurt dressing called labna - was hearty and filling. I loved it! It is sure to become a regular thing for me. I could eat it every day. you can also order it (like most things on the menu) as vegan, which substitutes a tahini sauce for the labna.

I am excited to start working my way through the whole menu.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Our family has a new favorite spot and it's POTs! Where has Egyptian street food been all my life? The owner and staff were incredibly friendly and helpful with explaining the menu and making recommendations. The decor is super cool and there's a nice, chill vibe. I got the Koshari and might have a new favorite food. The macaroni was cooked to al dente perfection, and wasn't all mushy. My wife got the ful mudammas and loved it. The drinks were amazing too. We got the karkadeh (hibiscus) and lemon na'na (minty frozen lemon drink). Everything was spiced and super flavorful. You can tell a lot of love, thought, and skill went into the food. The only upsetting thing was remembering we paid more for a bunch of garbage at Red Robin the other night. Never again! Thanks POTs!"}
{"text":"My friend and I just discovered this place. We both ordered cauliflower shawarma and shared Egyptian fries. They let us taste little bit of Tahini shake and that was super good that we need to order them next time. The dukkah spice is home made and that is super good!!! We will be back for sure. It is healthy and very filling!!"}
{"text":"The food did not live up to the reviews.The Egyptian fries were great  but the rest was about average"}
{"text":"Absolutely YUM. All Vegetarian/Vegan, Egyptian/Mediterranean inspired dishes with great pricing. The owner is adorable, super friendly, and so hospitable. Everything we tried, we loved. The mint lemonade was delicious and refreshing. We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Pots is a good place for healthy Egyptian Street Food. It is further away from The Strip and the food serve here is Vegetarian and Vegan. There are a few items on the menu that is definitely worth trying. The Charred Baba Ghanoush ($6.99) is made with flamed eggplant mix with tahini and roasted pepper. It's delivered as a chilled eggplant dip serve with two freshly baked pita breads, and it's like having a little side snack. I've tried the Koshari ($9.99) which comes in a serving bowl filled with layers of rice, lentils, elbow pasta, chickpeas, tomato sauce, and caramelized fried onions. It's very tasty and so different from having Italian pasta. I can see why it's most renown as one of their popular Egyptian Street Food. The food I was most drawn to is the Cauliflower Shawarma ($6.99), I like this one the best. It has crispy cauliflower that's tossed in shawarma spices, drizzled with labna dressing and topped with arugula and the salata baladi includes tomato, cucumber, onions, and it's all serve in a pocket pita bread. The cauliflower shawarma is delicious. It has so much flavor, I just wish it comes in a bigger pita bread so I can have more of it.  

Regarding the soup they offer, I've tried the Orzo Mixed Vegetables Soup ($5.99) which has seasonal vegetables, zucchini, carrot, yellow squash, and orzo pasta. I feel the broth is missing some seasoning, the soup didn't have any flavor. The orzo pasta taste like it isn't fully cooked and the vegetables in the soup are still crunchy. It's like having bland soup and it's not what I'm accustomed to. Most likely I will not order this soup and I gave my honest feedback to the owner. It's good seeing how very kind the owner is, she is so positive even when receiving comments about how food taste. 

I tried a different order which is the Lentil Soup ($5.99), it's a creamy blend of cooked vegetables, there's a hint of tiny noodles that makes the soup thick, and it's topped with caramelized fried onions. I feel like I've found a new favorite because their Lentil Soup taste fantastic! They serve the soup fresh and piping hot, it's so hearty and creamy, there's amazing spices in the vegetables, and remarkably there are no potatoes. I love how the crunchy contrast of caramelized fried onions complements well with the soup.  

They do offer complimentary drink: lemon and cucumber slice water which is refreshing, and the hibiscus tea looks like pomegranate juice and it taste similar to acai. I tried the Tahini Shake ($5.95) which is a coconut milk blend with medjool dates, cinnamon, chia seeds, tahini paste and shredded coconut. The Tahini Shake taste okay, it's very light but not as sweet as I anticipate. The only downside I notice is the paper straw. I understand how they are environment friendly but when it comes to drinking in a paper straw, it just doesn't work. The paper straw gets soaked and squished. I think plastic straw is a better choice as it's more durable in sipping and slurping drinks. Overall I feel the quality of service is great. The owner and staff are friendly, very attentive, humble and down-to-earth, and I like how they take really good care of their customer."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegan food. I'm absolutely blown away by the baba ganoush , the hibiscus drink, and the cauliflower pita sandwich. Everything was unique, fresh, and delicious. Even the bread was yummy! The staff is friendly and really takes pride in their food. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Considering I have never had Egyptian food, this was a great experience. Service was awesome and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I Read through the reviews and decided to check it out, a lil different then what I'm use to but i decided to try it out anyways and I'm  so glad I did very nice vibe, everyone nice and up beat, food was so good wish I would have of took pictures."}
{"text":"Great new Egyptian-Vegetarian (Fast-Casual) restaurant. Some of the best Middle Eastern food I've ever had! Warm, friendly service and the owner brought me some items to sample (including a baklava that was the best I've ever tried, waaaay less sweet and stuffed with dates). I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok.  This place is so good, and yes, they are all vegetarian with vegan options--most anything can be made vegan.  

I had the Koshari, and at first it looked kinda simple--like most koshari--but, this koshari was excellent.  The secret, I think, was in the sauce.  Ask for the hot sauce too; yum.  The fries are fresh, fat, and nicely spiced.  Even the ketchup had a lemony flavor, which went great with the fries.  The lemonade and hibiscus drinks were five-star. They serve good size portions.  I ordered baba ganouch, but after having the koshari and fries I was done...lol... will have it later.  The cauliflower shawarma was really good, I was told, since it was vegetarian--it can be made vegan tough.

The laddies who own the joint are nice and attentive.  It's apparent that they make the effort in preparing fresh and great-tasting food.

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! We were excited when we heard that an Egyptian restaurant was opening so we had to go try it out! The staff was incredibly nice! The owner would come out and ask how our food was tasting and asking for feedback. Diana  was very nice and helpful as well! We are definitely coming back to try more of their delicious food! We went around the third week they opened and I'm so glad that they are doing so well! We will continue to support small family business!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy. My roommate and I got the shawarma, baba ganosh, tahini smoothie and the kashari and everything was amazing. We can't complian at all. We definitely will come back. Highly recommend. The owner was super warm and friendly as well. Even if you are not vegetarian or vegan, still a must try. I left feeling so satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Excellent Egyptian food! My husband is Egyptian so he would know : ) They use fresh ingredients. Healthy vegan food."}
{"text":"Finally made it to pots it wasn't all what I expected. The pictures posted & comments had me so excited to try the cauliflower shawarma & Egyptian fries. First off fries where already cold they was really too fat and no flavor.  The pictures I saw of the cauliflower shawarma showed this white sauce covering over the Pita but when I got home mine looked dry . I even asked 4 extra sauce on it when I ordered lucky I asked 4 an extra sauce on the side just in case.  It was good but with more sauce it could of been the bomb. The extra sauce was only enough for 1 pita u get two. I will go back but next time I will double check my order for the sauce."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Loved the owner Eman. Surprised at the way they keep the food totally vegan and still taste wonderful!!"}
{"text":"POTS has been on my radar for months, because I work out at the park nearby. Their \"nutritious, delicious!\" signage went up but gave no clues to the menu until they opened and began maintaining an active social media presence. TLDR: Egyptian street food, vegan and vegetarian. Rejoice!

Meatless Mondays are mandatory in my house, and I've long had a love affair with chicken shawarma, so the cauliflower version was my first venture into the tasty eats at Pots- and I was not disappointed. Ample portion, fresh ingredients, lots of tasty textures. Good option for first timers, vegan version available with tahini. If you're dining with a group, add on an order of Egyptian Fries, seasoned with dukkah. Portion is a little much for one, wish they had a combo option for solo diners. 

Looking forward to my next visit to try the Taamia (falafel) and Koshari, along with some of the desserts. Note that the pricing is a touch high (lunch for one was $20), but you can get a 25% off discount by signing up for their email group."}
{"text":"Ive been waiting for this place to open for almost two months!

Iman, the lovely owner and a really awesome person just opened today and Im excited to say, you will not be unimpressed.

Here is why I gave it 5 stars...

Environment: Laid back, very lounge like. Really gives off the aura of an Egyptian/Arabic kickback. Really cool to see the original pots used in cultural/traditional Aravic cooking (Hence the name, Pots)
Also when you look in, the first thing you see is the drop-in for food preparations and also the kitchen.

Staff: Very welcoming, very diverse and extremely well dressed for the occupation. I know it's the first day, and usually staff is gonna be extra happy and excited but personality always shines through and shows a person's true color.

Food: I wish I could have more details on the names of the various dips and breads I have sampled ( Just stopped in to say congratulations and give a look around) but the dips each had a very prominant and distinct taste of different spices, I am quite familiar with majority spices, due to working in Pakistani and Indian Restaurants, so my spice palette is very broad. Its very fresh and exotic.

Creativity: I, personally do enjoy eating meat, but also I enjoy having an alternative that is nutritious yet plentiful. It is labelled as an Egyptian Vegan Restaurant, I dont think you'll be able to find anything like it in Las Vegas. The idea itself is intriguing yet awe-inspiring to take such a risk to open up a business that might attract a whole new tier of intrests and favorites.

Overall: I have yet to give a more detailed review on the food itself, in which soon, I will have a part two of this review when i actually sit down and try a variety of their entrees, but I feel this will be my new spot to try when I need a lunch spot to head down to during break. Overall, I say, dont knock it till you try it, this new approach in Las Vegas is something to reckon.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent customer service. We were greeted warmly when we came to pick up our food. Everything we got was delicious and made us want to go back. We got the cauliflower shawarma, khosari, and Egyptian baklava. So glad we took a chance to try new food! Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The owners & the workers there are so amazing and nice. I would come here every day if I could. The second time I was here, they were running behind on my food (they really weren't but they kept apologizing for it taking a long time) and they gave me some extra goodies with my takeout order. The food is so good and they are so welcoming. Cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Great overall experience of hospitality and combination of fresh ingredients flavoured with traditional spices in a contemporary style.  Cauliflower Shawarma - date baklawa - fresh bread - kosher beer...very fulfilling...happy!.. I really felt good after eating....also the hibiscus tea....refreshing. cozy seat up and a good vegetarian meal at genuine POTs!"}
{"text":"What can I say? 

I don't give out 5 stars lightly or willy-nilly. 

My husband almost cried tasting the food...
He hugged the owner twice. 

My 10 yr old said he couldn't believe we hadn't taken him to eat Egyptian food before and now it's his favorite. We are on our way back today, at his request and with my other kids, after being there only two days ago. 

Even if you are not vegan/vegetarian, try it!!
It would be a shame to deprive yourself of sampling this Egyptian gem. 

We had the cauliflower shawarma. Pita, so fresh, filling so flavorful with the right combination of ingredients/textures to make your mouth do a happy dance. 

Lentil soup. Im surprised my son didn't burn his throat scarfing down the  creamy, golden goodness in his bowl. Only complaint is that there is only a \"cup\" size and not a \"bowl.\" If you like daal tadka, you HAVE to try this! 

Baba ganoush. Came with two small, pillow puffs of delicious, piping hot bread. Had to order more bread for 1$....and then like that, the container was empty and we were scraping down the sides with our fingers to get that last little bit. 

Koshari. My husband was skeptical at first, I think because he is not a macaroni person, but ended up with tears in his eyes while eating this Egyptian street fare staple. The sauces were spot on and intensified the experience that is dancing on your palate. 
I liked that the tomato sauce was not so sweet that it tasted like ketchup and it had the right amount of acidity to bring all the components together. The spicy sauce and vinaigrette just level it up. 

Egyptian fries. Thick, steak cut fries cooked in peanut oil and sprinkled with special spices. Served with harissa ketchup. They were good and my son and husband enjoyed them, but still, they are just fries. 

Vegan brownie and ice cream. Chewy on the outside and soft baked heaven on the inside. 
Going to try the other desserts today. 

The mint/cucumber/lemon water was refreshing. 
Sampled the fresh made hibiscus drink and even my husband, who doesn't like my hibiscus tea at home, kept slurping down the ruby liquid. 

The only thing that I can think of that would cause me to dock a star would be if they really messed something up. The owners attention to detail in all aspects of the experience of eating here tells me that isn't going to happen. I would love to be able to snag her for an afternoon/evening to come and cater one of my events! 

I have high hopes and expectations that they will do well here. Try it for yourself and see. Even if it turns out not to be your cup of tea, your body will be one day healthier and happier."}
{"text":"I happened upon POTs while waiting for a smoothie from the little açaí bowl place in the parking lot. They had me wait behind the building for my order. To my unknowing benefit, the only spot open was right in front of POTs. The building and the name don't clue you into what's really inside. I had to google them to really figure out what was going one. But let me tell you, it's magical. Cute and quaint, little couches and a beautiful wall color. Their menu is bright and unique and full of delicious Egyptian inspired vegan and vegetarian options. After much deliberation, I ordered the cauliflower shawarma and pickled eggplant. 

Shawarma - 5 stars. Full of flavor and different textures. The pita was soft and tender and the tangy yogurt sauce brought it all together. It was the perfect portion size and I the spices on the cauliflower. Currently craving it whil writing this review. 

Eggplant - 4.5 stars. I'm only docking a half because there was nothing pickled about them. I got a lot of garlic and herb flavor but I was missing the acidity one is to expect from something labeled \"pickled\". I would say \"marinated\" is a better word. Nonetheless these things amazing. Packed with flavor. The texture was perfection and the fresh tomato sprinkled on top only made them better.  I could eat a bucket full. And! They come with the most adorable little pita breads I have ever seen! I made a weird noise when I pulled them from the bag... haha 

Overall, this place was fantastic. A real accidental treat. I will be back and I can't wait to try a dessert! They look amazinggg"}
{"text":"Very fresh and flavorful vegan food. Staff are friendly and helpful. Place is super clean. The only thing I wish they had was more seating options."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my experience here. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It is obvious that they take pride and care in the food they serve. 


The food itself is delicious. Care has obviously been put into each ingredient of each dish. I had the cauliflower shwarma and It is something I would defiantly come back for. The flavors are very vibrant and dynamic. Even sauces that come with each item has been personalized for the dish they accompany."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing from the first course to the last! Don't skip out on their Vegan desserts! The brownie with ice cream has me obsessed! So delicious!"}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised by this restaurant, it has such brilliant food and spectacular vegetarian options. As with most places the vegetarian options consist of salads and, if you're lucky, a veggie burger, here I had the roasted cauliflower in shawarma spices. It was amazing and there was no calorie guilt afterward. To top it off, fresh brewed hot tea. Simply wonderful."}
{"text":"This is is exactly what Vegas needs more of: reasonably priced, healthy and amazingly flavorful vegan food. And not only that, but the service itself was on point. 

The Cauliflower Pita blew my mind. The deserts were interesting too, in a good way. Definitely gotta stop back to try the smoothies as well. Overall a really good experience."}
{"text":"Never had Egyptian food before and was excited to find a spot that offers it so close to where I live! This was my first time at Pots and the owner(?) working here must've been able to tell by my blank stares at the menu. She was really helpful and explained the menu- everything here is vegetarian/vegan which is great! We ended up ordering the koshari, cauliflower shawarma, and konafa cup.

Koshari is apparently a very popular snack in Egypt, but I've never heard of it until now. What a great find as it's a bowl of carb heaven! Tender mac layered on lentils, chickpeas, and rice, topped with a tomato and crisp and salty fried onion (best part!). The koshari can be ordered spicy or non spicy and we chose spicy. It's actually pretty spicy so fair warning to those who can't handle heat. A different chili sauce is served on the side for those who want it even spicier. I found the sauce a bit bland, but the side of garlic vinegar was able to help elevate the flavor up a notch.

Cauliflower shawarma was my first veg shawarma ever. I was initially skeptical since I love my juicy meat fillings too much. The cauliflower was well seasoned and provided a texture nothing short of meat. The soft pita pocket, refreshing tomato/cuke topping, and creamy sauce enveloped the cauliflower nicely. I recommend fellow carnivores to give it a try as well, you just may be converted! 

The konafa cup was delish. Not too sweet, which I love. The shredded pastry was so delicate and crispy and worked so well with the shredded coconut and raisins. I wasn't too big of a fan on the pudding, however. It was bland and had a weird runny texture that made the shredded pastry soggy quick. Would be elevated if made creamier. Would have loved to see nuts added as well!

This restaurant is located in a small space but feels spacious with the cozy couch corner. Minimal seating but the menu is very takeout friendly. Healthy food at great prices. +1 for the refreshing mint infused water!"}
{"text":"Very good koshari very authentic Egyptian style Koshari vegan and very healthy ,,,, give it a try I definitely recommend this place 
Very nice staff"}
{"text":"I just visited this restaurant with my family and I have to say I am there #1 fan. The food was so amazing. I really enjoyed how polite the owner was and how she went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Just moving to Vegas this was quite a surprise. I looooooove this place!!!!!! I'm so excited that I live just a few miles away and can visit often!"}
{"text":"Very excited about this place. The cauliflower shawarma is perfectly seasoned. Fries cooked in peanut oil. Tahini shake is delicious and full of protein and healthy fats. It's authentic Egyptian, with a simple menu. Try it, you won't regret it. Owner is very friendly. Excellent for vegans. I'll be back soon to try the desserts."}
{"text":"Cauliflower shawarma was so well balanced and tasty that every bite was devoured.  Owner was extremely friendly!  Don't be afraid to try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is VERY TASTY.  I have had the cauliflower shwarma, chard baba ghanoush and Barbican malt beverages (peach & pomegranate flavors).  I was a fan of the cauliflower shwarma at first bite and the baba ghanoush is delicious.  The drinks are refreshing.  The staff and owner were great.  They took time to explain dishes, checked on me throughout and were very easy to deal with.  The sitting area is very relaxing and will suit all needs.  I will be a frequent customer and now my coworkers are sold too! :)"}
{"text":"What a tasty addition to our melting \"Pot\" of flavors in the city! The Egyptian cuisine prepared by lovely Chef Iman is unique and delicious. And, she and her staff are so hospitable! One stop and I'm hooked! Don't miss the Koshari and a Tahini shake...mmmm"}

My daughter and I eat here at least 1x a week! Give it a try! My favorite so far...Taami & the Cauliflower Shawarma"}
{"text":"Ants, flies, roaches. It was disgusting. Not just the bugs but as well as the food! I recommend not going there! Big mistake to go there! Need to be seen by health department!!!
And don't believe all this good reviews it's her friends and family!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal Egyptian cuisine.  Had the taamia sandwich (falafel) and it tasted exactly like my mom's.  Egyptian Street food as it's meant to taste.  Can't wait to go back and try the koshari."}
{"text":"I love trying new cuisines! So, when I saw that there was an Egyptian spot that had recently opened, I had to try it out. POTs is vegetarian Egyptian cuisine with a ton of Vegan options. The staff is very knowledgeable about their ingredients, and their menu has a very helpful dietary guide.

The food was amazing!! I had the Koshari and the Charred Baba Ghanoush dishes. Both of them were very flavorful! The Baba Ghanoush has a lot of veggies mixed into it and is delightful. And I was told that the Koshari was a traditional and popular Egyptian Street Food dish. I am stuffed from eating the whole bowl, but I just couldn't put it down!

I will definitely be back to try the soup and a dessert, soon!"}
{"text":"I really appreciate a healthy restaurant with a different take on flavor.  The cauliflower shawarma was very good with fresh ingredients and a interesting texture to the gyro.  It comes with two small pockets of pita filled with the cauliflower, cucumber, yogurt sauce, and greens.  Not the biggest, but tasty.  Adding a side is probably the best option with this meal, but it does start to get expensive at that point.  I added the hummus, which I did not like at all.  Harder than I'm used to and too many spices.  Might be good for some people's taste buds, but very different from the typical Mediterranean varieties in town and lacked the creamy goodness I typically look for in hummus.  The bread was fluffy and warm, but I wish I got some veggies as well for dipping.  Overall, I am very happy I tried POTs.  Unique for Vegas and offers healthy and more animal friendly options.  Service is fast and they specialize in takeout orders.  They offer free tea as well for dine in or while waiting for orders.  Nothing wrong with POTs, just not my type of cuisine."}
{"text":"I went to POTs with a vegan and a friend from Cairo, so I'm not the one who should be writing the review, BUT. . .

Fantastic experience.  We loved every dish, especially the koshari and ful mudammas.  Oh, and the baba ghanoush. And the cauliflower shawarma.  Our vegan said it was some of the best vegan food he's had in Las Vegas, and our Egyptian friend took one bite of the koshari and got that twinkle in his eye and said \"yup, that's just like back home.\"

We also loved meeting the owner/chef Iman.  She's energetic, funny and clearly has a passion for what she does.  It was really a pleasure.

If you love middle eastern food, eat here. If you're vegan, eat here.  If you're an omnivore, eat here.  We will many, many more times."}
{"text":"Literally loved everything about this restaurant. First of all the customer service is amazing. The employees all are happy to be there and are very welcoming and attentive. The food is soo good. Everything is healthy and delicious. From the drinks to desserts it's all good."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! I absolutely love the concept of vegan/vegetarian Egyptian food. We ordered the cauliflower shawarma with a salad and side of sweet potato fries. It was all so good! Even the ketchup for the fries had a nice twist of flavor. Usual middle eastern/Arab restaurants offer falafel and hummus as their only vegetarian option, so it was nice to actually try something different and unique! I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Exciting new spot for lunch! 
Never had Egyptian food before POTs, and I love love love to try new foods. Been here twice, definitely will be back more. It has a bit of a mediterranean vibe to it. Love it.

The place is small but cozy, clean and trendy.
 
Food is mostly vegan (score!) with some vegetarian dishes too. Flavors are new and unique compared to what is typical in this town. 
Second time came here with our office staff for lunch and we decide to share everything to try different foods.
Best sweet potato fries ever, seasoned perfectly! Egyptian fries are great too with tangy spices. Khoshari was delicious and very filling, if you are very hungry definitely get that, it's got noodles, lentils, veggies, very interesting dish. Must try the pickled eggplant, it has a strong garlic seasoning that is amazingly flavorful, the eggplant is best eaten with their pita bread.

Desserts! The baklava is made with dried fruit and is quite amazing! The dough just melts in your mouth. The other favorite was the coconut flake dessert. Crunchy, and sweet complimented by coconut yogurt, sooo good!

The owner completes the whole thing with her vivid, bubbly personality! Very attentive and warm to her customers, definitely draws people to come back and have more of the delicious foods and pleasant atmosphere!

So glad this place opened here! Skip the old saggy burgers for lunch, be adventurous and go give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great Egyptian cafe! Great service, delicious and healthy food. Will be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, first step in greeted by beautiful people. The aroma is amazing, they attend to you making sure everything is good. The food is amazing, the lemon nana is refreshing. This spot, I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Vegan! The cauliflower shawarma can be made gluten free over greens with a tahini sauce. Delicious! The koshering is excellent as well...waiting for this to be available as gluten free  Owner and staff very friendly. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I just started a new job around the area and as I'm also eliminating a lot of animal products from my diet, it was getting difficult to find options around me. I found POTs and I'm so glad! I had the cauliflower shawarma after all the reviews on here raved about it and it was amazing and filling. I also got the Egyptian French fries and they were exceptionally seasoned and delicious as well. To top it off, the two ladies that were there today were super sweet and welcoming and I look forward to trying out more of the menu in the future."}
{"text":"Lots of flavors & I really enjoyed learning about the dishes from the cashier. Great customer service! The non alcoholic malt beverage was surprisingly delicious. The dishes all stand alone very well. My friend & I ordered a couple things to share & there wasn't anything we didn't like. Even the salad wasn't boring or bland."}
{"text":"First visit to POTs with my omni friends. It is a mix of vegetarian and vegan but the staff and owner are really knowledgeable and will gladly help you order.  We all really enjoyed the food. We had koshari, falafel, hummus, baba ganoush, ful, cauliflower shwarma, and salad.  The food was very flavorful and not spicy at all (they did have a hot sauce that you can add if spicy is your thing).  The flavor combinations were a delight to my taste buds and authentic Egyptian fair. For dessert we had a toasted coconut custard and an apricot custard. Both were a wonderful finish to the meal and not overly sweet.  I highly recommend this place to anyone and especially if you have omni friends who are looking for a great veg place to eat."}
{"text":"I went there with my brother and we had the Koshari, Ful Mudammas, Baba ghjanoush and the Konafa cup.  The food was AMAZING.  Tons of flavor and absolutely delicious with every bite!  The service was great, if you have question about the menu or any of the ingredients they'll answer them in detail.  YOU JUST GET THE KONAFA CUP, it was by far the best pastry I have ever had.  I'm glad this place opened, it's a new fav!"}
{"text":"I went to Egypt last year and fell in love with the food out there. Their national dish, Koshari, which is naturally vegan is the best thing I have eaten! So when I found out we had an Egyptian vegan/vegetarian restaurant opening in town I was thrilled! Let me tell you the Koshari does not disappoint and dare I say just as delicious as the the Koshari I had in Egypt. There are so many other delicious dishes on the menu like the Egyptian fries, cauliflower shawarma and the dessert is to die for! Not only is the food amazing but Iman the owner is such a sweetheart. Absolutely love this restaurant and so happy we finally have Vegan Egyptian food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! There are vegan and vegetarian options! 
We ordered the Koshari which has rice, lentils, elbow pasta, chickpeas and tomato sauce. Great flavor. You have to order that! We also ordered the Cauliflower Shawarma which is also good. To finish up our meal, we had  a Qahwa which is their version of a turkish coffee. Will come back to try other options!"}
{"text":"I've ordered take out from here twice now, and both times the food was AMAZING. Loved the koshari, it is one of the most delicious dishes I've had from any restaurant, and as a bonus, it was filling enough that I ate it for lunch and dinner that day (a big deal for me when I'm on-the-go). The taamia is also excellent, it is Egyptian falafel made with fava beans inside pita bread with tahini and some veggies. It's a nice change from the traditional Mediterranean falafel made with chick peas. I will undoubtedly be coming back here many times!"}
{"text":"We read the good reviews and decided to try Pots and we weren't disappointed. We started with the charred baba ghanoush then had the cauliflower shawarma tahini, koshari and the Egyptian fries. All were equally delicious and Heman the owner was very delightful to speak with. Highly recommend if you're seeking authentic Egyptian cuisine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend picked up some food to go and he was amazed by the friendly staff and inviting environment. He saw this restaurant on yelp and decided to pick some up. We met at the park to eat and I was blown away by the quality of food. They have hand cut sweet potato friends and their food is high quality. Amazing flavor and fresh taste. You can tell it is handmade food. The menu is small but not lacking anything. It is vegan and vegetarian friendly which is super important.

{"text":"Wow is all I can say, had two friends tell me about this place and I was so excited to try the food i spent $40 just so I could try a little of eveything. I called ahead and my food was ready by the time I picked it up. The restaurant was clean and the customer service was amazing. The girl up front explain the menu to me no problems just wish they were open pass six so I could stop in after work. Let's keep this place in business."}
{"text":"thank you for the positive vibes & engaging menu! definitely coming back again! looking forward to later hours :-)"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant ! Great authentic Egyptian food homemade. Variety of dishes for everyone. The staff is awesome and friendly (Egyptian owners).
Very clean, large parking 
I recommend this place..."}
{"text":"This vegetarian Egyptian restaurant makes you want to become vegetarian. So much flavor in their dishes. The owner is amazing, customer service amazing. Very welcoming little hole in the wall..everything about it makes me keep coming for more. I've had their hummus with freshly baked pita which is delicious. Their tahini shake is \"Bombtastic\" not to mention their cauliflower shawarma OMG! Best food I've had since being out here in Vegas. And I've been living here for almost 3yrs. Never gone back to a restaurant so much. By far my favorite spot and I'm not even vegetarian. But after eating here, i probably should!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Egyptian cuisine. Very fresh and refreshing during these hot summer days in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had the Taamia, similar to a falafel and it was so delicious! I highly recommend checking this place out. Their customer service is incredible as well, they were so nice. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend about this place!
The food are super fresh! Very tasty! And the most important planet based!
You won't regret when you will come here!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to eat Egyptian street food ever since visiting a few years ago.. POTs was a delightful surprise for us when visiting Las Vegas! My boyfriend and I are both vegan and they had so many options to try for us. The staff were also such a delight and were knowledgeable about their impact on the environment with earthly products. Definitely must try!"}
{"text":"Very good traditional Egyptian street food! Try the koshari and taamia, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for authentic Egyptian food for YEARS and never could. I accidentally stumbled upon the Yelp page for this restaurant and from the pictures alone I knew I had hit the jackpot. The owner is a sweetheart and she makes you feel at home from the moment you walk in. I am just so happy that I found a place that makes koshari (and makes it right). I will be a repeat customer, even if I ever move away from Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Walking in I was immediately greeted with a smile from a person who I found out later to be the owner. She offered me great recommendations along with a little history on Egyptian street food that I found quite interesting!  Listen, I'm a sucker for great customer service and so I was immediately sold prior to even trying the food lol
I ended up trying the koshari, cauliflower shawarma, egyptian fries AND the lemon na'na. Everything was amazing to say the least!"}
{"text":"Excellent Middle Eastern cuisine. They have a small menu, but everything we tried was great. I will definitely be back. I would suggest that you stop by and try the food."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!!!! The food somehow tasted better than I had even thought and the entire experience exceeded my expectations. 

A quick run down: 1) The place is clean and very cute. 2) The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. 3) The food tastes super fresh, super flavorful and super delicious. 4) People who don't normally like vegan or vegetarian food will still love this!!!!

If I had three hands, I'd give this place three thumbs up!! Definitely going back. I recommend you take a break from your usual spots and try this place out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yummy healthy joint! Lots of lentils on the menu... so if you're into beans you'll be in good company! Staff was also super friendly."}
{"text":"You've got to come eat here.

I'm normally a carnivore and I love coming back here for the lentil soup, cauliflower swarma, and konafa cups (dessert).

We discovered POTS as one of our coworkers is vegan.  We have been back 3 times since in the last 3 weeks.  The flavors are unique, delicate, and authentic.  My husband lived in Egypt and said that the flavors here are legit Egyptian street food, except less oily and more healthy ingredients.  The pita here is light, fluffy, and baked locally.

The falafel swarma is also finger licking good.  

My personal favorite is to enjoy a konafa cup here and order an extra one to go for a snack after dinner. 

The owner who is also the designer of the recipes is named Imam.  She is warm and positively friendly to personally greet her customers and get their feedback on her food."}
{"text":"I usually don't care for vegan food but this is something else. We got the fries and cauliflower shawarma. They were unbelievably tasty and had tons of flavor. We finished with a konafa cup that was sweet toasted coconut shreds with coconut cream. Loved every bite of everything!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great new spot for vegetarian food!   Cauliflower Schwarma was absolutely delicious, and the tahini shake is fresh and a new experience .  The baba ghanoish  was about the best I've ever had.  Very friendly owners , just a great experience- can't recommend them enough - and a great addition to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Pots for a few weeks now, and we finally tried it today. The koshari was incredible! I had it with the spicy tomato sauce which I found to be just right - enough heat without being punishing. We also had the baba ganoush and the cauliflower shawarma (we had that \"deconstructed\", aka as a salad). Both were delicious. The owners were very friendly and asked us how we enjoyed our food. We told them we loved it and we'd be back - which we will!"}
{"text":"I am so in love with POTs and will make sure to pop in anytime I'm visiting Las Vegas. I discovered it on Yelp as a popular new option for vegetarian/vegan meals and was really excited to try Egyptian food in America. POTs did not disappoint! 

The restaurant is quite small and is casual. I felt like I was being hosted in my friends home in Cairo. It was super cozy and I really enjoyed it.

I went twice and had the cauliflower shawarma; koshari  and Lemon NaNa. I've had Koshari before when I was working in Egypt and this was the same, filling and comforting dish I had in Cairo. It's carb paradise and accidentally vegan, but very tasty, especially with the spicy sauce they give you. The Cauliflower Shawarma was my favorite and was super flavorful with a tasty labna dressing. 

The owner is delightful and it's just an awesome restaurant! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I wish I could give you 10 stars! So unbelievably friendly and kind from the second you walk in the door till you leave. They were very helpful with questions I had. We tried the Ful Mudammas, Taamia, Cauliflower Shawarma, Egyptian Fries, and Charred Baba Ghanoush. Everything was sooooo delicious! I'm in LOVE with the Ful Mudammas and the Egyptian Fries. My Vegan belly is very happy! Thank you so much and I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous lunch yesterday with my family. Met the owner and chef who was warm, friendly and welcoming. She really cares about the ingredients she uses in her dishes: organic, fresh and unique ingredients.  The food was absolutely delicious and would highly recommend coming by to have a bite to eat! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The Cauliflower Shawarma was flavorful and light. Will definitely be back to try more items"}
{"text":"Recently generating some buzz on South Rainbow north of Oakey it was for dinner on Wednesday evening that two guests entered POTs, the owner and one employee immediately emerging from the back as another party followed and explaining the concept as \"Authentic Egyptian Cuisine,\" a novelty to the Las Vegas market despite several other restaurants presenting various dishes originating in the Middle East.

Bolstered by good word of mouth since opening in February, owner Iman an affable sort who hangs out in the dining room asking guests their impressions and offering details about POTs' concept, it is from a limited number of dishes featured on an overhead menu that guests make their selections before paying at the counter, prices including $7 Fries and small containers of various Spreads for $8.50 decidedly steep based on Ingredients, though there is no doubt of the kitchen or staff's commitment to serving a quality product.

Pleasant in terms of décor, a bookshelf featuring various knick-knacks set next to two couches while steel chairs and light bulbs suspended from rope add to the ambiance, it was shortly after spending nearly $50 including tax and tip that first items arrived, the Egyptian Fries blistering hot and crispy beneath spices including Cumin, Sesame and Mint while fried Sweet Potatoes were served room temperature and more subtly spiced but excellent in housemade Ketchup brightened by Citrus.

Offering no Meat on the menu, most items either naturally Vegan or possible to prepare as such, it was while eating Fries and sipping a thin Shake with mild sweetness that two Pitas arrived next, one called Taamia and described as Egyptian Falafel well prepared but marred in its flavor by too much Mint while Cauliflower \"Shawarma\" fared better in terms of taste with an even lighter and virtually oilless texture.

Finally served Dessert prior to finishing Pitas, a minor issue only since one included Ice Cream, it was here that POTs suggestion of \"by mixing the familiar with the unfamiliar, we produce a taste like NO Other\" rang most truthful, a dish called Mahlabeya offering the texture of Panna Cotta beneath Apricot Jello studded in dried Fruits while the Brownies were much like many similar Sundaes except that the Chocolate contained salty Tahini and bits of melted Halwa which rendered it sticky and sweeter in parts, much like Salty Caramel but without the Butter or Milk thus making for one delicious Vegan treat.

THREE AND A HALF STARS:  Unquestionably a niche Restaurant, fast-casual concepts featuring healthier options a continuing trend that should be embraced, POTs adds something new to The Valley and does so with honesty and passion, but considering the simplicity of their Ingredients prices trend a little higher than need be while such a brief menu does little to demand return visits save for those with specific dietary needs."}
{"text":"POTs is a welcome addition to the Las Vegas dining scene. The restaurant adds much needed culture to Vegas that you'd typically find in the most diverse neighborhoods of NYC, Chicago, and San Francisco. 

You enter the restaurant a small takeout counter. Walk just a few steps around the corner and it feels as if you've been transported into your Egyptian friend's home. And that's before you even get your food.

The owner of POTs is a delightful woman named Iman who can educate you in all things Egyptian. Be sure to check out the Egyptian cookbooks and the century old pots.

Egyptian food is new to me, but I found the menu to be inventive and pleasantly priced. I'm so glad that it wasn't just another Mediterranean restaurant.

If I could have ordered every item on the menu, then I would have. Instead, I opted for the following dishes:

Chard Baba Ghanoush: I'm usually not a fan of baba ghanoush, but loved the smokiness of the eggplant.

Hummus: I love hummus, but my daughter does not. Please tell me why she's been craving Pots hummus?!

Egyptian Tzatziki: The flavors of the yogurt based cucumber and mint dip were super-intense and flavorful. 

Pita Bread: The warm pillows of pita bread were the perfect accompaniment to the mazzas.

Koshari: It's going to sound odd, but trust me...it's good! There's a base of rice, macaroni pasta, chickpeas, crispy fried onions, and a special tomato sauce (in mild or spicy versions). My prediction is that Koshari will be trending in 2018.

Cauliflower Shawarma: Bomb!! The fried cauliflower had the consistency of fried fish. I found myself inhaling it. 

French Fries: These ketchup paintbrushes are not to be missed! They are reminiscent of chips (fries) in London. Perfect crispy shell with soft innards. Don't forget to try their spicy ketchup.

Chef Brian is passionate about his craft and everything is lovingly made.

Thank you Iman and Ayat for treating my family so well! It was nice to find a vegan/vegetarian option that we all can agree on. I wish POTs the most success and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, but if all vegan food tasted like the cauliflower shawarma I just ate I would have no problem converting.  It was so good.  They make their own pita bread in house and it shows, it's amazing.  I will be back.  Frequently."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was such a pleasant surprise on my trip back to Vegas. The food was delicious and flavored perfectly! You can tell there was a lot of thought out into the choices to insure they are healthy, vegan, and delicious! I always love trying new foods and especially ethnic with new flavors and spices. I will come back here every time I am in Vegas! Egyptian food is my new favorite food group  And to have wonderful people like Iman and her staff to make you feel welcome and make sure you enjoy your meal to the fullest! Thank you"}
{"text":"This place was such an awesome little place. The menu is very brief, so our little group was able to try a good portion of it and everything was delish. Two non vegetarian and one vegetarian people and all were satisfied and happy. We will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"This is the best Egyptian food in town (and that I've had in the U.S.).

The atmosphere is amazing and the food is to die for. Flavor is on point"}
{"text":"We come 15 minuets to closing, and they were very polite and helpful....
Good atmosphere and good people work here."}
{"text":"I tried the Koshary and Belila. They are amazing. We met the owners, they are so nice the whole ambiance is so welcoming. Definitely this place will be on my to-go list every time I visit Vegas"}
{"text":"My first foray into Egyptian food did not disappoint! A lot of the ingredients/flavors remind of things I've seen in Greek or Mediterranean cuisine. I love that most everything is vegan or can be made vegan. 

The Koshari looks like carb overload at first, but for some reason the mix of pasta, rice, lentils, and more just work! There's a fun balance in texture, too. I got it with the spicy sauce (featuring jalapenos) and it was delicious.

The baba ghanoush was chunky, with veggie bits. Still good! I just wish it came with more of their delicious, homemade pita. (Only 2 pieces? Blasphemy!)

The Konafa cups for desert are a MUST-HAVE!

I got my meal delivered, and it was packed perfectly, with everything still looking beautiful and the right temperature. I can't wait to go in and visit the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice Egyptian vegetarian restaurant with healthy, clean and flavorful dishes.  Prices are right and service is good.  Great hibiscus ice tea and vegan substitutions available.  I liked the cauliflower pita sandwich, lentil soup and salads.  I hear the hummus is yummy too.  You leave full."}
{"text":"I saw \"POTs\" announced on 'VEGANS BABY' FB site.  This is a new place in Vegas that offers:  Vegan/ Vegetarian / Gluten Free Egyptian dishes.  I chose the Koshari meal plus Orzo & mixed vegetables soup plus Arugula salad ..TO GO. I have eaten some of the Koshari and Orzo soup..Both DELICIOUS!  Have packed away left-overs and salad for tomorrow. I have never eaten Egyptian food and had to call them so say how delicious it is.  Owner and front lady both so friendly and also offered samples while I waited.  VERY GOOD and Healthy."}
{"text":"Wow! The food here is amazing. Very fresh and the quality is out of this world! I had the Taamia and Egyptian fries. My friend had the cauliflower shawarma, we traded halves of our sandwiches and feasted. We also had hummus-best hummus I've ever eaten. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely want to return and enjoy more! Great seasoning on the Egyptian Fries. The Taamia was very filling and flavorful. I'm a big fan of falafel, and this version was soft and yummy. I also got Konafa Cups for later, and it was such a treat!"}
{"text":"Forgot to mention how ecologically conscientious the owners are. They have different receptacles for recyclables and use paper straws."}
{"text":"Delicious Food. Great to see a vegetarian/Vegan Egyptian restaurant.  Great service, food, and very clean. 
West side location. Rainbow & Oakey 
I met the owners, two sisters, and they were so kind. It was obvious they love what they do and care that people are happy. The girl at the counter was very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. 
The Taamia, Ful Mudammas, Hummus, and Egyptian Fries were all delicious. And the best Lentil Soup I've found.
Everything is fresh and homemade including the pita bread.
I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Dig the music and the positive vibes... I ordered the cauliflower shawarma along with the Tahini Shake Today I'm going ..."}
