{"text":"We like it; we've been back several times over the 7 years we have lived in the neighbourhood. It doesn't rank as our favourite though, as we've had some so-so meals over the years & there are dishes I avoid. There was a period of about 2 years when we didn't come here at all, but we've been showing up more regularly lately as things have improved. 

We find it a comfortable place, & now that we've started showing up more we do get recognized by the staff, & the chit chat is welcoming. 

Worth trying - the vegetarian minestrone soup, the tomato & bocconccini salad, the salmon with tapenade, the turkey Thanksgiving dinner. There is something about the minestrone that reminds me of soups by my (Italian) aunt, & a friend of mine with an Italian background also had the same experience with a few dishes. 

Hit or miss: the cheese & mushroom appetizer, the Linguini Vegetariano. Sometimes the mushrooms are just bland & fatty, & taste like they used processed Parmesan; other times they are awesome.  I used to like the vegetarian linguine but lately it has been oily, the veggies are overcooked, & the green peas have staged a coup, dominating every bite. More peppers & tomatoes, please!

They show a cheese platter photo on the website but I do not remember one on the menu. & shockingly, I have never tried pizza here, maybe because the vegetarian version has artichokes & I hate artichokes.  

Bonus points - back in Feb. 2010, my friend was in town & we had dinner plans elsewhere, but then realized the Olympic playoff hockey was on, & I scrambled to think of a place we could get a decent meal but still keep an eye on the game without going to a sports bar - Fiore fit the bill as they have 2 tvs over the bar that are usually tuned to sports. I made reservations just a few hours before the game, & although they laughed over the phone, they obliged & sat us within a good range of one tv. (Many seats are nowhere near the tvs & since they don't turn the sound up, the tvs don't have a negative impact if you don't care for them) Final score: Canada 7, Russia 3. 

The patio is nice in good weather as long as it is not windy - oh wait, we are in Calgary. Since it isn't deep or well sheltered, you can easily end up with plate full of dust if there is more than a little breeze.

Accessibility: the front entrance might be a bit tight for some wheelchairs, & you will probably need help due to the two doors in close proximity. Seating inside is manageable in most spots. I have not used the washrooms there in years but I believe they are downstairs, so this is another restaurant that is only partially accessible. 

I will definitely be back to Fiore, & would suggest it if you are trying to serve the diverse interests of a large group, as they do have enough options on the menu to keep most groups happy."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and have never been disappointed.  Not the best pasta in the city, but for what you pay its probably the best value in the city.  Carbonara is my favourite dish and they make a fabulous creamy carbonara.  It's what I order 98% of the time I am there.  They also have great fresh buns.  I'm from Saskatchewan so some nice bread with butter before the entree always warms my heart. 

My only negative feedback would be the very limited beer menu.  I love beer, but find their selection in both draught and bottle very limited."}
{"text":"Went to Fiores today and I was so impressed with the service and food. Had a beautiful served and delicious crab cakes for appetizer. For the main I had the pasta with chicken in between (can't remember the name) but that was heaven. All at a cheap price. The waiter and waitress were ready and willing to service you. I am glad I celebrated my birthday at this place. Just what I needed."}
{"text":"I've gone to Fiore a lot over the years - mostly because its in a convenient location, the food is not expensive and its decent, and you can almost always get a table. But the service has definitely been inconsistent. Sometimes its ok, and sometimes its just straight up awful.

This past week I made plans to meet a friend there for dinner. Since I was running late I asked her to see if we could get a table on the patio since it was a beautiful day out. When I arrived, however, I discovered that she had been informed there were no tables on the patio, and the host had instead seated her... in the very back corner booth by the bathroom, despite the fact that the restaurant was only 30% full and there were plenty of seats closer to the windows. My friend is too polite to argue, but when our server came I asked her if we could change to a table closer to the windows. She replied with, \"OK, you can just go find a seat.\", and leaves us there with all of our menus and water glasses. I have both served and hosted and I would have never, ever been allowed to just abandon and table and let them go wander around in search of a better seat. Well, whatever. We collect all of our things and tentatively make our way to find a free table. At this point the host wanders up to us and goes \"Are we moving?\" to which I answered, \"Yeah... our server told us to just go find a spot.\" \"Ok,\" he answers, and saunters off to the kitchen. Facepalm.

We pick a new seat by the window at last and our new server appears. Ah, that explains it - our previous server was jilted by some unfair section assignments. Our new server was fine and friendly. Our food was good. When we asked for the bill, she brought it without offering to split it. That's fine - I have a calculator. I figured out the cost of my meal plus tax and tip - and I'm not a lousy tipper. I told her how much I wanted to charge on my debit card. After that my friend wanted to pay on Amex so our server took her card off to the front register. When she brought back the bill, we noticed my friend had been charged a liquor tax despite not having any alcohol. Well, ok, maybe because we didn't split the bill  by item that's unavoidable. But then we get down to the total.. and the server had automatically charged my friend well over what was the remaining balance of our bill (including tax), meaning she had taken it upon herself to add a tip. Since it came out to more or less what we would have tipped her (perhaps a little bit less, because at this point my friend was so irritated) we decided just to leave it.

While I could've asked to see a manager and have a very uncomfortable conversation regarding the behaviour of his or her staff, in the end it probably would've been more trouble than anything. But if a table of two receives poor treatment from 3 separate staff members, that's a problem. In my time in the service industry I've been reprimanded for much less. In 7 years in hospitality and customer service I have learned how to treat paying customers, and so should they."}
{"text":"I went to Fiore's for brunch recently. Walking in, I didn't have high hopes for this place as I've been there in the past many years ago and always had mediocre pasta experiences. However, to my surprise they actually did a decent job for brunch.   I ordered the raisin french toast and it came with crumbled blue cheese and maple syrup. The combination of flavours turned out to be quite tasty to my amazement. The service was decent. I'd definitely give it a try again for brunch."}
{"text":"We had lunch here, good portion sizes and they even offer smaller portions for a lighter meal. My husband had fusilli salmone piselli (14,5$) and I had the spinach fettucine mare monte (15,5$), both very delicious. Their bread is very good, too. All in all, great good and great service."}
{"text":"Up until about 5 years ago, I lived in the neighbourhood and would come in almost weekly to Fiore's with friends. The pasta specials were great, the service was good, and it had a nice, casual atmosphere.

Then I moved out of the neighbourhood, but every time I came back, my experience at Fiore's got a little bit worse - until tonight sealed the deal - I won't ever be coming back.

My partner and I came in at about 9-ish. There was a party of about 6-8 girls who were finishing up, and two two-tops in the restaurant. We were seated with nary a word but, \"You can sit where you want\" - no specials, no nothing. Yes, we got to sit where we wanted, but we got to sit there for a LONG time before anyone bothered to take an order. 

There appeared to be 3 people on shift - the woman who seated us, a woman who was clearing the tables around us, and a male waiter. 

The girl clearing tables came by us twice - totally ignored us. Another couple came in, she sat them, gave them a rundown of specials, and offered water. Then she went and helped a fellow who placed an order to go. She came by us a third time... now going on 15 minutes, and I managed to ask if anyone could take our order.

The male waiter came over finally, and by that time we were more than ready to order food and drinks. And then we waited for food, and waited, and waited some more. He came back twice to double check about what I wanted on my noodles. Apparently \"the lemon sauce\" meant \"mix lemon sauce with pomodoro\" to whomever was working in the kitchen. I wasn't sure where the confusion was.

Finally we got our meals. I had a plate of cold pasta and chicken that had either gone off or was undercooked - or both. It was grey and pink - it tasted - and looked - absolutely unappetizing. Even my partner commented on it.

Our waiter never returned to check on us. My partner had finished his penne and I had taken two bites of chicken and two bites of pasta when the waiter returned and cleared our plates. I literally could not force down this awful food.

Know this about me: if a meal is even remotely palatable, I will choke it down and say it was fine. I hate making a scene or being an inconvenience as a customer. But I simply could not in good conscience say that meal was fine tonight. So when our waiter asked how the meal was, I told him honestly that the chicken was quite obviously off and undercooked. He apologized and said he could have the kitchen make me something else. That wasn't something I really wanted to wait for - or subject myself too - even further, so I said no thank you, assuming he would comp the meal or at least give us a discount - again, I'm just not the type to demand a discount, and it's the obvious thing a restaurant would do in this case. 

He cleared the meal and took my plate to the two girls working - one of whom I'm assuming is the manager? Customer service obviously being top priority there, she exclaimed within earshot, \"No, it looks fine!\" after the waiter (I'm guessing) asked if there was anything he could do for us. 

He returned with the bill and as my partner was paying, again asked what was wrong with the chicken. I told him again. He said he could check if his manager would comp it - but by that time the credit card had been approved and I just wanted to get out of there, I was just so disgusted with the whole experience - especially with the behaviour of the manager.

I've been working in the service industry for almost 20 years. Even in the crappiest restaurant I've ever worked at, if you're clearing an almost full plate of food when a customer is done their meal, then something is very obviously wrong with their meal and you do your best to fix it. You do not talk about your customers returning food - or about your customers at all - ESPECIALLY within earshot. You offer them another food option or you comp the meal. Simple as that. Though our waiter was very friendly and somewhat apologetic - we should have been checked on within the first few minutes of receiving our food and avoided this altogether - the restaurant was nearly empty, there was no excuse for us being left unattended for as long as we were.

Sorry Fiore, we had some good times in the past, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great pasta at a reasonable price.  On 17th ave but has parking in the back which is nice.  Atmosphere is casual and not uptight."}
{"text":"When I say we ordered everything on the menu.... we really tried.  There were four of us in our party, and we sampled 9 dishes.  

The great thing about Fiore is that you are able to do half orders of most of the pastas, which we took full advantage of.  We had crab pasta, clam pasta in a white wine sauce, tomato basil gnocchi, curry tortellini, manicotti, pasta with salmon and peas, butternut squash ravioli, and spinach artichoke pesto pizza.  

I'm not a fan of shellfish, so I won't comment on those, but everything else was really good.  The butternut squash was my absolute favorite.

The service was great, and it was one of the few restaurants on 17th Ave that doesn't think it's a nightclub.  We tried to go to National and Ming but I'm not joking when I say they had bouncers outside telling us they were \"at capacity\".  I don't need a velvet rope to eat dinner.

Fiore FTW."}
{"text":"The waiter was amazing and super friendly and prompt insuring our drinks and food was delivered promptly and refilled.  I ordered the creamy carbonara it was all carbonara like a greasy sausage gravy.  It turned my stomach I will try again on one of my visits and try something else!  I really had high hopes but hopefully the next visit will be spectacular!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night for dinner, by accident actually. Was walking by, saw a sign that they had a pasta deal and thought, hey why not. It wasn't very busy, we had our choice of seats which was nice. We ordered a couple beers, the waitress was new-ish, had been there a month and a half and didn't even know what beers were on tap. Couldn't pronounce grolsch properly, and that was their beer on special. Anyway, no big deal. So they have 10.99 pasta on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. We ask for recommendations from the waitress, once again, can't pronounce the names of the dishes properly. And she spoke so quietly that nearly everytime she walked away my boyfriend and I looked at each other and said, \"I have no idea what she just said\". Okay, so we figure out what we want and order some food. While we wait we get some bread to the table, literally 2 dinner rolls that you could buy at Safeway. I should have known by the paper napkins on the table that this wasn't going to be a classy meal. If I have to pay over 8 bucks for a pint of beer, they can afford cloth napkins. Anyway, the food comes annnnd, they made me the wrong dish. I ordered chicken and received sausage. So as soon as she put it down I told her this isn't what I ordered, she apologized and took it away. So now I'm waiting, I dunno how long, for new food while my boyfriend eats alone (because I didn't want his food to get cold). Okay, he's finished now, my food comes out so I eat. It's okay, nothing that I couldn't get at olive garden or east side. The portion size was small, if that's the portion they serve normally at 15 bucks, then damn that's a rip off. Now the waitress must have apologized 4 times by now, which is getting annoying. I already said it was fine, mistakes happen. So she comes back with the bill and said due to the error they've discounted 10% well, that's nice, I thought. Except they didn't discount the whole bill, just the one meal, and they discounted it at regular price LOL. So I don't get my whole $1.50 off the 10.99, I get it off $15. Sounds like a deal, doesn't it? So my boyfriend takes it up to the guy and complains that they put full price and that honestly discounting one meal at 10% is kind of a slap in the face. Now, I'm not expecting anything for free, but we didn't have a good experience here. Any other restaurant would at least take care of a round of drinks or something. So he comes back like 10 minutes later and had discounted the whole bill by 50%, which was very nice of him. In the end, it was nice to have the discount for the errors, but we didn't get it without complaining, and at regular price this place is absolutely not worth the money. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but food was horrible. Nice patio, great for people watching on 17th ave, but I say you go for drinks, NOT food."}
{"text":"It's great pasta for really reasonable prices. If you're doing a huge shopping trip on 17th ave, it's right in the middle so it's a good place for a break or you can just sit there on the patio for a while and people watch. The food is great, and they have awesome specials on certain days that make your wallet happy. 

Pssst- guys it's a great place to take your lady out to a \"fancy\" dinner that seems really nice, but really it's super reasonable and won't leave you broke. Unless the two of you order a lot of alcohol, you won't ever have a bill over 40 dollars."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried for UNA next door, but we weren't having it with the line, so we decided to try Fiore.

Polite service. I loved walking in and having my pick of where to sit. I was craving pizza, so I decided to try theirs as a substitute to UNA. The pizza was average. Great portion for it's price. Great ambiance. Mediocre beer selection.

I'll reconsider waiting it out in line at UNAs the next time I have a craving for pizza."}
{"text":"I just got back from meeting someone over at Fiore Cantina Italiana on 17th. I wanted to update y'all on my thoughts of this place and since I've got an hour or so before I'm heading out elsewhere (gotta fill that Yelp review quota ;) ), now's as good a time as any. 

Things I loved: 
- They offer parking (behind the restaurant there are spaces reserved for their patrons) 
- Very nice atmosphere 
- Great location 
- Excellent service 
- Excellent food 
- Reasonable pricing 

Like Lindsay K., I don't have anything bad to say about this place. 

As for the guy half way down the block, you know, the one that was projectile vomiting all over the sidewalk, well, that's another story."}
{"text":"I have gone to Fiore's on many occasions. It's great for going on a date, the vibe is totally romantic and what says romance more than some delicious Italian food? I've also gone with the girls for a nice dinner out before heading off to party. 

The service is decent, I wouldn't say they're exceptional, but they're polite! The food, the wine and the ambiance are what really keep bringing me back. 

They're reasonably priced, and the portions will have you leaving satisfied! 

I will continue going to this place for a nice, inexpensive place to eat pasta."}
{"text":"PROS
- nice location
- decent service
- unpretentious ambiance
CONS
- terrible food (very mangia-cake). 
- my test of a good italian restaurant is their spaghetti and meatballs. when it's done right, you will feel like a little italian grandma made them with love, experience, and magic. fiore did not fit the bill for this. at all.
NOTE TO SELF
- do not go to places with an 8.99 pasta special."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and that time its was a good experience although okay service.

The second time I went with friends and I ordered their 10.99 pasta with mushroom and crab. First thing I noticed when I sat down was a microwave in the back, and I was not impressed. 
The first few bites of the pasta was good (because I was starving). I expected the crab to be in slightly bigger portions, but they were stringy like pulled pork that added a strange texture to the pasta. You can tell the ingredients are not fresh because I've experienced way better.

I would normally finish the portion they gave. But before finishing the meal something did not feel right with my stomach so I asked my friends to finish it. I asked my friends what they thought of the dish, and said that it was not the best combination of crab and pasta, plus there was something off with the ingredients. 
20 minutes later I had acid reflux, I felt like vomiting and my stomach started hurting. The next day I was sick, and sure enough I threw up at night because of a stomach flu.

Would never go there again, even with their discounted pasta. I'm also pretty sure that they do not give you a second serving of bread, because our server did not ask (something I thought showed their lack of service, compared to other pasta restaurants I've been to)."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and it was awful! My friends (3) and I were excited to try out their pasta special. Needless to say, my rating for the place is awful, so I'll get to the point. The service was so slow, one of my friends actually had to leave because they took 1 hour just to get us waters, not even order! We were about to leave until last minute they came and got out orders. Luckily, my friends and I had a lot of catching up to do, but we noticed that we were one of the only other tables that didn't get bread, which we were famished from the already 1.5 hour wait. We finally got the bread around the same time the food came out and we continuously asked for refills for our waters and beers, but nothing! Our server couldn't be found and even asked someone else! The portions were so small and even the server looked at the \"full\" size pasta and says \"Yeah... that's the full size\" probably 1.5 cups of pasta. Overall, the food was extremely oily and not below par. I wouldn't come back to this place, especially since they didn't apologize for the service or offered any accommodations. Fiore's that night had horrible customer service and my friends and I did not feel like we were treated fairly."}

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

It's my second time here (first for dinner, second for lunch) and it's official, I'm never coming back here for pasta again! Located on 17th ave across from Western High School, Fiore is a modern Italian restaurant with over 20 different pastas to choose from, pizza, fish, veal, Italian soups and salads. 

Fiore is a moderately sized restaurant with a clean slick look; a bar to the side and a small patio. Nothing too glamorous. My bf and I decided to sit on the patio for lunch which made me a little uneasy as the table tops looked worn down and littered with crusty bits. What made it worse was the tiny creepy crawlies on the table. A tablecloth would have made it more sanitary and refined. The service was only OK.

We went to Fiore that day for their pasta lunch special where their regular pastas were on sale for $8.99 (everyday until 4pm). Normally it would cost around $12-$15. Each meal starts off with complimentary bread rolls and butter. I ordered their Linguini Vegetariano (fresh vegetables and Linguini sauteed with olive oil, basil, chilies and garlic) and my bf ordered their Fusilli Arriabiatta (red peppers, green peppers and bacon in tomato sauce).

The presentation of the pasta was 'sad'. It was like looking at a pile of limp noodles smack in the middle of an over sized plate. The portion size was decent but the quality and flavour of the pasta was terrible. Both pastas were bland and not spicy even though the menu stated that it was 'SPICY!'. My bf's dish tasted like chef boyardee and preferred my pasta with canned sauce. Mine was like a greasy Asian stir-fry with no hints of basil or chilies. 

All in all, skip this place! You're better off being most satisfied going to Boston Pizza for their Pasta Tuesdays."}
{"text":"We needed a place to have lunch, traveling on business in Calgary and was our first time on 17th Ave.
We saw the outside of the eatery, it was just opening up for the day at 11am and we saw the pasta Specials sign $8.99 a entree. I hate being the first one into a place but in we went and could sit wherever we wanted. We were greeted - service was OK throughout. Wine choice offered was good. Bathrooms spotless - had to throw that in there as this is important to me. 
The food. I had spinach fettucine alfredo with crab (they promised it was not canned) , hubby had the gnocchi with meat sauce. Gnocchi = not good, not pillowy nor fresh tasting. The meat sauce was too sweet and I am not sure how he ate all of it. Guaranteed the food is all frozen from here. I thought my pasta was better than the gnocchi, 7 out of 10. We left satisfied but would love to try a higher end place next time."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend dragged me here saying things like it was the \"bomb diggity\" and the \"Bees-Knees\" and I was pretty impressed.
I checked out some other yelp reviews and most of the negative reviews seemed to be focused on bad service. We didnt have that issue, the lady who served us was prompt and pleasant. Now she wasnt the wind hovering over my every whim, but it was a bit busier and a small place like this cant afford a legion of employees. So I forgave that readily, but the sweet drinks where well made, the cheese cake put lead in my pencil, and it was THE BEST manicotti I have ever had. And I am a big fat guy so you can take that advice TO THE BANK 
5/5 would eat again"}
{"text":"We decided to visit Fiorre on a Saturday Night when we thought Calgary was all but deserted on a long weekend. Still it was a pleasant saturday night and everyone was out walking on 17th, Fiorre had great outside seating to accommodate people watching.

Now to the nitty gritty:

-I've been drinking Alexander Keiths consistently for the last few years and the two pints I had here had something off with it, I wonder if it was an old batch of beer.

-Their coconut chicken curry zuppa was really good, creamy and lightly salty

-Their carbonarra was...interesting. The pasta was done well and had the right creamy consistency. But the onions were undercooked, onions just don't have any taste at all but have that crunchyness raw onions would have. There were other ingredients but everytime I bit into the dish my mind would Seinfeld-obsess about the whole thing: Why are the onions undercooked? Did I say something bad? it must've been that cook with the unibrow? But how could he know I called him uni-brow...unless...NEWMAN!!"}
{"text":"Food was disappointing.  Fairly bland and not particularly well executed.  Butternut squash ravioli which was the waiters best pick was so so.  Other dishes ordered were worse.  Plain Bolognese pasta could not be finished by our noodle loving son as it quickly became tiresome due to its blandness.
We were hopeful after the calamari appetizer that they pan fried instead of breaded due to our allergies.  It was promising but set us up for being a bit disappointed with the pasta dishes that followed.
Service was fine.  waiter did his best to try to accomodate allergies.
Prices were relatively cheap.  But the quality of the food reflected the price.   Be forewarned."}
{"text":"Not bad... This place is pretty good. Prices are reasonable and you get what you paid for. I called the restaurant and told them I was looking for something a small step above the  Olive Garden and that is exactly what I got. It is nice to sit outside and watch the people go by. Casar Salad was very good."}
{"text":"I use to go to Fiore's quite a bit 10+ years ago, but I have gotten away from it, simply because 17th Avenue is not really my stomping grounds anymore.  However, my dear friend Heather suggested we go there, so I was in like flint!

The restaurant looks a LOT different than the last time I was there.  Definately renovations have happened since my last visit (one would hope so, since it had been so long!).  

The wait staff were friendly and charismatic.  When the took our order, I asked them what the spiciest thing was on their menu.  They said that anything could be spicy, because the chef would simply add more spice to any dish.  

I ordered the Fusilli Arriabiatta, which is red peppers, green peppers and bacon in tomato sauce.  It was spicy, no question, but for my palate, they could have turned up the heat a few notches.  The peppers were only slightly cooked (which I like!) so my dish didn't have a pile of mushy peppers on it.  They were slightly crispy, and the pasta had lots of flavor. Since my dish had bacon, I passed on the grated cheese that came by, and the meal was yummy and savoury without all the extra cheese.  The pasta was very tasty.

They had a pretty good wine list too.  I tried their Lotus Cabernet Sauvignon (California) which did the trick for me!

What shocked me most, was how reasonably priced it was.  I got a pasta dish and a glass of wine for $25. There's not very many places I go in this city where I can get an entre and wine for that price."}
{"text":"Just got back from my first experience here. A friend and I were heading down 17th looking for a place to grab lunch, and literally walked into the first place we saw that she hadn't been yet. All told, I was unimpressed.

Sure, when the bill came I was pleased it was so small and our server (while really nothing overtly impressive) was friendly. However, I have a few gripes about the place...

1. When sitting on the patio, there's almost no buffer to keep you from being harassed for spare change from the sidewalk (which happened to us and at least one other table that I noticed)

2. A little too much \"suggestive selling\" - I don't know how many people are easily convinced into order special blend martinis at 12:30, but it seemed a bit tacky to press the issue at that time of day... and literally grabbing the menu and flipping the page to where the pasta special was to point out where it said \"8.99\" (despite the fact it was the biggest, boldest type on the page) was unnecessary.

(Side note: on the topic of specials... how \"special\" is a \"bucket\" of 4 beers for $20? A five dollar beer doesn't exactly strike me as anything worthy of it's own ad on the chalk board.)

3. I'm a pizza fanatic. Anywhere I go that has pizza, chances are good that's what I'm going to get, and Fiore's was NOT good. Of the 3 toppings I ordered, one was so scarse I'm still not entirely sure if there was even any there,and even if there was the other two were in pieces so big it over-powered it, there was almost no sauce (and what there was was flavorless) and the cheese was too stong. Basically it felt like biting into somewhat crunchy chunks of mozza covered pineapple.... and since I'm griping about pizza I need to air one of my biggest frustrations about this place;

WHO THE HELL MAKES PIZZA AND (even on their 'build your own' part of the menu) DOESN'T OFFER PEPPERONI? As a true pizza fan I was shocked and a little bit offended. Pepperoni is a pizza staple that should never be ignored.

I didn't even finish half of my pizza cause I had lost all interest, and had the rest boxed up to give to one of the areas many homeless (I figure, great or not, a free meal is a free meal) and I likely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My cousin came from New Brunswick for a visit. She used to live here and used to love this restaurant. It was her favourite so she wanted to go back. Boy, was she disappointed. 
Yeah I get it. Things obviously change over time but this was bad. 
To start we had horrible service. However, the patio where we were sitting was nice as it was a nice evening and it was recommended as inside they had a Bachelorette Party which was very loud. Outside was nice and calm and the avenue wasn't even crazy with silly people yet. However, the tables and chairs on the patio were not great. They were plastic and very uncomfortable and very close together so you could clearly hear everyone's conversations and your chair would even be touching the person beside you. Getting in and out was a nightmare so even if you had to go to the bathroom it was better to just wait till you were leaving and had to get up. 
The tables and chairs were all dirty so we had to ask them to whips them down which should be obvious. 
When the pasta came it was dry! Can you believe that? Dry pasta! Not saucy at all! Then when we asked for more sauce for the pasta they brought sauces that tasted like butter to moisten the pasta and wasn't even correct. We ordered four different kinds of pasta and they were all dry so when we asked for more sauces for each of the pastas and we each got the same one.. that's not right. 
To boot, I got a pasta with Alaskan Crab and my pasta was full of crab shells. 
No thanks"}
{"text":"Great deal from Sun-Tues. $8.99 pasta. 

Nice decor and atmosphere, friendly service, although a little slow. 

Will be back again"}
{"text":"I went to this place for dinner on a Saturday evening. The place was dead inside but the patio was a little busy. Our server was friendly but quite forgetful. But I didn't mind as I was there to relax with the company of some good folks. I had the Spinach and Mushroom Salad with Salmon. The salmon was meh but the salad was amazing. Their house dressing on a crisp bed of spinach with fresh mushrooms... Mmmm just mmmm! I have been wanting more since I left! I need the house dressing recipe!!"}

{"text":"3.5 Stars. Comfortable Place. Good Food. OK Service. Nice Location. This is a nice place to meet friends and have some fun. Management offers an 8.99 pasta deal Sunday through Tuesday inclusive. The food can range from very mediocre to very good depending on what you order. The Ciao Bella was very good. The manicotti was almost a write off, came out rather fast and likely microwaved. The greeter was friendly and efficient. The waiter clearly over paced the dining experience and, unknowingly, became a source of entertainment for the evening as he hovered and dashed around the entire restaurant into the night. Those looking for fun, fiore would be a good spot. Serious food lovers, please try Il Giardino Ristorante Italiano, it is not far and the menu is seriously delicious."}
{"text":"Fiore was an Italian restaurant that I would definitely go back again when I am back in Calgary.  The atmosphere was pleasant, not too bright and not dark at all.  We had gone there fairly late at night, and they did not hesitate to seat us quickly.  The wait staff was friendly, and suggestive when we had questions.  

I had the linguine con cozze.  The mussels were cooked well, not overdone and rubbery like several other places I have been too.  The sauce was good as well, not too salty like most other places.  The tiramisu was probably the most enjoyable part of my meal.  It was light and creamy.

My water glass was constantly filled, and my tummy was full of yummy food.  Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"I work a few doors away and have been coming to Fiore for years, i have  enjoyed all their pastas, and have to say they are great. My kids love going to fiore after schools for their thin crust pizzas, my favourite has always been their lunch specials, a nice feature pasta with soup or salad, i always get the soups, I love love the soups at fiore, they are the best soups in all of calgary, not one single one is disappointing. I dont eat pork, so the soups that have bacon or ham, those days i will have their traditional Minestrone. But i look forward to Tomato Garlic, or the Tortellini Brodo, a yummy broth italian soup with chicken tortellini. For the deserts, the homemade tiramisu is awesome, i even special order it for special occasions."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian place on 17th -- bar none. If you're lucky you'll come in for the lunchbox special :) I've been after the mista salad dressing for 20yrs!!! The owner is a sweetheart and he closest thing to an Italian mama you'll get! Warm and inviting, piping hot delicious pasta and crispy cold salads -- yum!"}
{"text":"We got the fonduta, the ciao Bella and the spinach fettuccini pollo. Delicious and service was great! Pasta is only $10.99 on Mondays"}
{"text":"I love it when restaurants go along with my weird food whims. I recently went to a very renovated Fiore for lunch, and man oh man was I ever craving some delicious Gnocchi! They did have gnocchi, but it was in a weird tomato sauce. For me, gnocchi must come with pesto or cheese sauce or NOTHING. Authentic Italian, Schamathentic Italian. The waiter was totally cool switching out the tomato sauce for four cheese. It was delicious! It filled my craving! My friend has made them do it for her since! Apparently I AM always right, at least here. And I have adored Fiore ever since. I also like the new reno, as it went from Olive Garden to contemporary lounge. It feels more comfortable, and a little more classy."}
{"text":"Dining on my own, I was greeted warmly:
For yourself?

Notice she did NOT say:
Just for yourself? (As if a woman dining alone is a woeful soul to be pitied)

So refreshing!
Immediately I relaxed. 
Welcomed.
I lingered. 
The pasta special enticed me into Fiore's.

Despite devouring the ENTIRE lasagne, the tiramisu 
whispered my name, as did the decaf cappuccino.

I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a dining experience
as I did at Fiore's today.

SO  R-E-L-A-X-I-N-G

Luckily I don't eat like that everyday, but every so often 
it's the best Rx for whatever ails you.

Oh the Ruby Relaxer was a delicious cocktail.

To the hostess, and chef, 

Thank you."}
{"text":"Fiore on 17th avenue is highly recommended by this yelper. I have been in many times and have enjoyed all visits.  The first was with a friend and we just wanted to have deserts and a coffee and watch the local color pass by.  Service was kind, friendly and we sat there all afternoon enjoying the sun. It was great! 

Another time I went with a friend and she ordered curry pasta and I had a calamari.  Both dishes were abundant and delicious and better still was the bill at the end of the night. Shockingly inexpensive.   I believe it is Sunday , Monday and Tuesday that some pasta dishes are 8.99 all day and all night.  Check Fiore out."}
{"text":"Came to Fiores for an early Mothers Day dinner....food and service was fantastic and very reasonably priced. Even the MIL was impressed with her meal, and that rarely happens. I had the Parm Salmon with risotto and it was awesome. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Calgary has really 'grown up' and this place needs to do some changing. Don't let the location fool you! Where this place may have been a 'a date place' 5 years ago, it now just seems like a casual place to grab some grub after too much walking on 17th!  Location is great, it was a hot day last week and we sat on the patio which is always nice to do on a sunny day in Calgary.  

I'm not a fan of pasta in general, but when I eat pasta, I only like the hand made kind and it has to be cooked perfectly.  Pasta - though seems easy - is most often screwed up, hence, I ordered the calamari salad.  The calamari salad was ok. It was to me a bit of an Asian/Italian fusion salad.  The Asian part to me was the bell peppers and pepper flakes but I liked the calamari. All in all, A-ok 3 *. I appreciated the portion size as well, not too big and not too small. I just hate it when I order an entree size salad and can only finish 1/2 of it... cuz really? who wants left over soggy salad - so then it's wasted, but the portion of the salad here was just right for my appetite."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, the place itself is nice, it does get a bit crowded sometimes. 

Let's talk about the important stuff, food. I can pretty much guarantee you that none of the ingredients they use are fresh. Most of the menu items are bland at best, they overdo the cheese just to masquarade the fact that everything you eat is tasteless and boring. 

Seriously though, this restaurants food tastes like they stopped caring about it years ago."}
{"text":"My second visit here was sub par from food to especially service. The portions were sub par and their staff pretty much ignored us lounging over the bar. The food before was really exceptional as was our waitress. There's a reason this place is probably often empty. I think with a few changes it would be a great place to go."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.  Related to the Chianti group, Fiore is a bit of a more upscale version of their restaurants.  Whereas Fiore tries to shoot more for the family and the worker markets, Chianti wants the upscale diners, young couples and such.  It's been a popular mainstay in Calgary for decades, and offers an ever popular discounted pasta menu from Sunday to Tuesday (just like Chianti).

In the meals I have had, there's been calamari, crab cakes and so on, and they were done fairly well, but just a little short of outstanding.  But in the case of the pasta and sauces, I'll have to give it an average rating.  Definately not fresh pasta, and the sauces were a bit more watery than I would like.  There's still flavour, but just not much body to the sauce, which was a bit of a turn off.  Still, since they don't seem to be serving fresh pasta, it does give them a little flexibility in that they can offer other types of pasta as well as whole wheat or gluten-free.

Service was ok, not the fastest.  Water glasses remained pretty empty until I flagged people down.  Still, when I can't complain too much since I did get some decent bread.

{"text":"Excellent place to go on pasta night if you don't wanna cook! Fresh hot tasty and a good deal!! Comfortable atmosphere always feel at home. Consistent menu. Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken is my fav !"}
{"text":"Every time I was on 17th I would pass Fiore and say to my boyfriend, \"we should go in there sometime.\"  After a hundred or so times of saying that we finally went in.  I don't think I could really say anything bad about Fiore Cantina.  I had a pleasant enough experience there one afternoon for my boyfriend's birthday lunch.

It wasn't very busy in the afternoon, so it was quiet and intimate.  It's been my past experience that when a place is busy your waiter seems to pay too much attention to you due to boredom, but this wasn't even the case at Fiore.  The waiter gave us our space, but came back exactly when needed.

We both shared our meals, so we got to enjoy two dishes each.  Both we delicious in their own way.  The marinara sauce we had wasn't too overpowering and the pizza was crispy, but still soft and warm.  It's a pretty good amount of food and we were pleased when we left.

Next time I'm on 17th and in the mood for a nice lunch or dinner, I'm going to stop saying I should go in and just do it!  I like Fiore Cantina just fine!"}
{"text":"I hate to be rude but this place is probably one of the worst pasta joints I have yet to check out. I ordered the lasagna and it was really watery and bland...portion sizes were small and the bread they brought out prior to our meal seemed stale. The worst part was that one of the men working there (we assumed he was the owner) got really upset and gave us such attitude because we had pulled up a chair from a different table to put our purses on...he later came by and apologized but it really wasn't much of an apology. 

The only positive thing I have to say is that the gentleman who was our server was extremely friendly, polite and attentive. 

Don't recommend and won't be back!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly cute place! Just a tad bit on the cheapish side, and that's a pity as there is absolutely no reason for that... I am not talking about the prices here, but rather about the overall experience.

Fiore (Flower) is all about pasta, I don't think there is a reason to order anything else there. Plates are abundant, tasty and served with a very friendly attitude. You can visit them solo, with your better half, parents, kids, whatever...

That's not an authentic Italian place, but good in its own way. Lots of space - even when it is relatively packed, you can still drop in and they'll find a table for you. Good location, literally in the middle of the downtown.

I've been to Fiore numerous times, and won't hesitate to drop in again, passing by the 17th. Not that exciting, but quite recommendable."}
