{"text":"I don't live in Fountain Hills, but was in town at a friends and picked up Pizza and Wings. Wings are NOT eatable. The pizza did not taste good at all! I won't return and am ticked off at my loss of $20.00. The service however, was great!"}
{"text":"Hours of operation are incorrect!  Nothing frustrates me more than getting a $100 order all written down from the whole family and then to call and u be closed.  So irritating.  No wonder business suffers."}
{"text":"Rosati's Pizza is the best in the Phoenix area.   I'm from Chicago and this is definitely great Chicago pizza!  Been here over 20 times and every time the pizza is superb!"}
{"text":"The best pizza place in Fountain Hills! The management and entire staff have great customer service."}
{"text":"We called in a $70+ order to be delivered as we had company. It arrived hot.  The Italian beef sandwich was perfect-have never had better.  The ribs were tender and had a great seasoning rub, but I had to look for any BBQ sauce as it  had the taste that some was on there but couldn't see much of it and no extra was provided, so we just added some of our own.  Full racks of ribs are $21, so that was annoying.  3 salads and only 2 little bags of croutons. Salads fine-no complaints there. Fried chicken dinner had chicken so old and so dried out that it was obvious before it was ever tasted.  It must have been deep fried several times.  I gave it away.  The side orders  of fried zucchini and onion rings were pretty small for $5.50 and disgustingly greasy.  Now I am somewhat of an expert on these sides, ordering them anytime I see fried zucchini offered. Either they are deep fried several times (hence the extra oil) or just not put in to properly hot oil and drained properly.  I don't know.  But they should be ashamed to serve that to customers.  My husband loves their pizza and calzones, while I love their beef sandwiches.  We will stick to that from now on."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is awful, and they do not accept any of their own coupons that come in the mail.  They will always tell you the coupons are not for their store, even though the coupon has their printed address, and phone number."}
{"text":"It wouldn't be my first choice... however, it will do in a pinch. Biggest complaint is the wait time. They said my order would be ready at a specified time. Sat there for 20 min after the time I was given."}
{"text":"I've ordered and gotten take out from here on and off for at least 10 years. There has been changes of ownership throughout that time.  Tonight 6/14/17 was the best ever.  Our delivered pizza was fantastic.  Exactly as I ordered ( some minor requests for specifically arranged toppings) delivered hot and fresh.  My 5 star review is for the lady who answered the phone and took my order.  Her smile in her voice was infectious.  She was professional, positive and happy to be doing her job.  I hope her day was as phenomenal as she sounded on the phone.  I hung up not only pleased with my choice of takeout but happier after speaking with her.  I unfortunately did not catch her name but know that her attitude will be an asset to this business.  When I concluded the call I said to my boyfriend, \"That was the best customer service I've ever experienced over the phone!\"  She made me feel confident I'd made the right choice for takeout.  And she was right on the money!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is either great or just bad with to much grease and not cooked completely.   Customer Service is ok.  I have been eating here for the last 4 years and it's really a hit or miss on the order."}
{"text":"Rosati's has a habit of burning their pizza. Their new management is a copy of the last management. Can you EVER get your order right????? I agree with the previous reviews. They would have a good business if they would try harder. One good thing is their Spicy Italian beef. Forget the pizza for now. They just don't have it together."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Rosati's for decades. I found them in Chicago and was overjoyed to find them again in Fountain Hills, AZ. However, the FH store has messed up my order on multiple occasions. They did so again last night when they failed to put cheese on my half of the pizza and then burnt it. When I called to let them know I was told there was a note on my account that I \"complained too much\" and they would no longer serve me. So apparently the business model isn't to get the orders right but to cut off service to the customer if they rightly complain that the pizza is not done correctly.  They also claimed my husband was \"threatening\" when he returned another incorrectly done pizza and he said he was going to inform corporate of the terrible service. Do not walk, run away from this terribly run franchise and get your pizza from a completely different Rosati's location."}
{"text":"These restaurants drive me crazy. They have one job and that is to make food for customers. Why go to the trouble of making it if it is terrible? The delivery we ordered last night was a 45 min wait but took 1 1/2 hours to get delivered. All the food we ordered was leaking out the sides and was barely warm. They do not serve a Caesar salad, they serve a regular house salad with Caesar dressing (not really a Caesar salad and should not be in the menu). The pasta was mac n cheese quality. I suggest not wasting time and money on this place."}
{"text":"I used to go to Rosati's back in my hometown in Chicagoland - it's the exact same pizza here in Fountain Hills. Delivery takes a long time - but if you don't want to head out on a cold winter night (HA) it is worth it. Of course, it is not too far away to pick up either.

Nice crispy thin crust - extra cheese makes it extra gooey. Sausage has that little kick of spice. 

If you like a crispy thin Chicago style pizza - get it here!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!  Rude and unapologetic for getting our order wrong and wouldn't give me my money back or provide credit for a next visit. It's like they go out of their way to get your order wrong and then get upset at you for calling them out on it. 
I picked up my order and had to wait about ten minutes for it, when I checked the pizza (habit after getting a wrong pizza from here before when I received sausage on a vegetarian pizza) it was already cold. They forgot to give me the salad my boyfriend ordered and I had to ask for it.  When I finally got home the salad was of course the incorrect salad. I've given them three shots and have given up.  
If you end up ordering from this place don't expect a good experience and don't say we didn't warn you."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Lots of options! We order frequently. They have great deals too! Always impressed with the service too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have ordered (delivery) pizza from Rosati's many times, have always been happy with what we got. I really like the \"monster\", has tons of toppings. The Chicago deep-dish could stand more goodies in it, but has lots of cheese, is skimpy on the other ingredients. Still WAY better than Pizza hut, at a higher price."}
{"text":"Alright, first things first...Their thin crust pizza is the best pizza I have EVER had in AZ.  On the downside and this almost cost them a star, it is always more $$$ then we want to spend on pick-up/delivery pizza.  We off set this however by getting the large with the small cheese for free and then make 3-5 meals out of it.  Hopefully they will begin to offer good deals on their Facebook page to help out their faithful supporters.  I have never had a burger/sandwich or fries, as pizza is the only way to go for us but I'm sure they are good.  My only question is why haven't they expanded their space to offer a dine-in option?  That would be a successful venture for sure as we always look fwd to our next ROSATI'S night."}
{"text":"We placed an order for pick up.  We got home only to discover the pizza was made wrong.  Because the pizzas are over priced I felt we should get what we paid for.  I was REALLY disappointed in the customer service.  I knew our family dinner plans were going to be delayed another hour because it takes so long for the pizzas to be ready.  When I called they told me that I had to bring back the bad pizza BEFORE they would begin making it the way we ordered it.  So they messed up our order and I am inconvenienced by having the whole family waiting an hour to eat, I had to drive back down to the store and THEN I had to wait all over.  Not exactly the best way to treat customers."}
{"text":"I called this in for pick up. They said 20 minutes. 

It was ready in twenty minutes. 

I asked for pepperoni and mushroom. 

I got pepperoni and mushroom. 

The dude was nice. 

I was nice. 

It was hot. 

It was cheesy. 

It had marinara. 

Lol

But

BUT!!!

BUTTTTTTT!!!

Who the cuts pizza into small bite size pieces?  

It's a \"pizza PIE\"!!!  I want pie shaped slices!!!  

Who would think that you'd have to say that. Or ask or that?  

I mean. I get it for jumbo slices I guess. Like a 30\" pizza from San Diego giant pizza...  

But this is a 12\". 

Cutting pizza this way disrupts the balance of flavors you get toward the crust. Now I have 4 pieces of pizza with no crust. And 4 pieces of crust that have no pizza. 

Otherwise, it tastes pretty good for a traditional American pizza.  I'll be back.  I wish I could give a half a star. It's not really 4 star but it's not 3 star either. But considering the local options, this is better than most."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place so far! I lived it always fresh and super yummy. Sometimes the guy that answers is a little grumpy but the food is great!!!!!"}
{"text":"While the food was okay, this had to be some of the worst customer service that I encountered. So I tried using a gift card here which ended up not working and the person at the desk offered no help at all. I later found out that the gift card only works at one location (where the gift cards were activated) but it would have been nice to know that upfront. I'm not saying that it's this location's fault that this happened necessarily, just was mainly disappointed in Rosati's in how they handle their gift cards.

The chicken parm was fine but after what happened I would never come back here again. I was thinking about not even getting the food but it would have been a waste to do that, so I ended up getting it anyway..."}
{"text":"In past they had great pizza, just very average if that now.  I Can't get them to cut it in pie slice either, (4 ) of last  4 orders.   Can not recommend  anymore.  I will order elsewhere,  gave them many chances.  Sorry."}
{"text":"The food was great!  When we walked in,  only one dark haired guy greeted us and I said it was our first time in to which he said nothing.  Then we ordered 3 salads,  4 meatballs,  one cheesy bread and one order of 4 canolis to go.  The order took about 25 mins to fill. We sat at an old card table that appeared to be in need of replacement.  Two chairs only so we grabbed another for our third person.  Leaving room only for two tables with one chair each.  Then we used the restroom which wasn't clean at although tp was provided.  While the same guy who took our order prepared our food another customer came in and stood probably five mins for the guy making the food to come out and give our order.  The customer left as no one came out to get his order.  Then we finally got our food brought out in plastic to go containers.  The salads were delicious in spite of the dry chicken.  All the dressing was in small individual servings that you had to open. The meatballs were fantastic and moist.  Best I've had.  The cheesy bread was also delicious.  The dining room was very small and I think it's geared towards pick up and take out mostly.  Not an enjoyable environment for dinner.  Great food. Though I would only get takeout.  When I eat in, I like real plates and silverware.  Also,  nice to get appetizer before main course instead of after.  Food was good.  One star for dining room experience."}
{"text":"1st time was perfect in fact they saved my valentines  dinner for a last minute romantic dinner at home. I was so impressed we went back for more. Never again! Terrible service. On the second time around we went for pick up again and they gave us someone else's salad. Called to get things straight and they put me on hold, after two attempts at calling back they finally took my call from my GF # because they knew my # and knew they screwed up. Offered to deliver us the correct salad, i tried to explain the correct salad the kid didn't even know what mixed greens are!! They delivered the wrong salad still..the delivery kid ended up paying me back from his own pocket. Tried again tonight after holding over 5 min! Said they couldn't put alfredo sauce on the f#%kin ravioli!! They did that on my first order no problem...Worst customer service ever! Its a shame because the food can be good but the fools running this  place need to be all fired! Avoid!"}
{"text":"Spot on proper, food-deals-Service. I can not understand the three plus star rating; it simply makes no sense to me. Not sure what people expect. Very hard to please the public."}
{"text":"Rosati's of Fountain Hills,
The worst ever, I'm from San Francisco, and I'm pretty used to good Pizza.
The other night my son tried to order 4 minutes after delivery of course they said no, after 30 years in the Restaurant business I get that, but he was rude enough to hang up on my Son.
The last pizza we picked up from them was inedible!
I like Hawaiian, pineapple had turned hard and had to pick it off, ham almost broke a tooth so tough!
I have many friends in just Scottsdale, let alone San Francisco ready to come and do it right, wood cooked, ready to deliver at anytime good Italian Pizza!
They think they are the only game in Fountain Hills, but not for long,, rudeness and old ingredients aren't gonna make it here, or anywhere. 
Be looking forward to a great Pizzeria! Good-bye Rosati's! Don't waste your money!!!"}
{"text":"We've tried it three times - twice on our own dime, and once when a neighbor treated.

Sorry, we just didn't like the amount of grease.  Taste was OK, but none of the three of us in the family could get past 1 piece due to the grease.

We prefer Euro Pizza or Sapori D'Italia for pizza in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the amount of bad reviews. My experience has been different. I'm from Chicago so to see Rosatis here was a breath of fresh air. I tried a few pizza places in FH that were awful but this Rosatis tastes like Rosatis from home. I've only had the double dough pizza so I can't speak to anything else. One review complained about the thin crust being \"cut like a checkerboard\" but that's how we do it in Chicago. That's actually normal and some would argue the right way to do it. :)  They have always had my pizza done on time and have been nice to me. I gave it 4 stars because the last time I was there,  I stood at the desk for a good amount of time with the guys in the back looking at me but not one acknowledging me or coming out. I get that you're busy but if we lock eyes just tell me you will be with me in a minute. That was a little weird. But I'll take that for some good pizza! There are only 2 good pizza spots in FH in my opinion and this is one of them."}
{"text":"We just moved and thus Rosati's is close to our new home.
Yummy Chicago style thin crust!

We like to go pick up our pizza. The facility was clean nd the people super nice. Have been there 2 times already. 

We'll be back."}
{"text":"It literally took 3 hours for my pizza,me and my friend ordered food from here off of grub hub,and after two whole hours we were concerned there was no pizza coming for us,we called Rosati's and as it turns out there wasn't,I will admit for the most part the customer service is average,but they said they would make our pizza and deliver it quickly,another hour went by and so we called again,they didn't answer,because at this point they were closed,but eventually they called us back,and explained that the order came through their email,still have no idea why they don't check their email,anyways,they gave us a large pizza,and it was average,but maybe that's because since I waited three hours I was expecting more.But the pizzas fine,don't order it off grub hub though."}
{"text":"Lame. Called at 9:45pm they said they were closed even though they were open till 10."}
{"text":"Quick pizza that was ready on time and tasted great!  Over the Christmas Holiday they opened up a couple of hours exclusively for those less fortunate."}
{"text":"I'm adding a new review as I've been eating here more often lately & having a consistently good experience. We recently discovered the Chicago-style deep dish, with the sauce on top of the cheese (though they offer it both ways). Wow. Really delicious! DEF Chicago-style & super freaking good. Thin crust has also been fresh, savory, & yummy. Salads always fresh. The game has been upped; good food!"}
{"text":"I'm  a Chicago Resident and have been raised on the best pizza in America. Rosati's in Fountain Hills makes a great pizza. 
I order my pie extra thin, extra crispy and the boys at Rosati's do a phenomenal job. 
I tried a Chicago Pizza Restaurant in Gilbert called Salernos and I wouldn't recommend that place to my worst enemy. Over priced, over cooked and filthy dirty."}
{"text":"If there was a zero, it'd be them! I am NOT reviewing the pizza since we never got to try it.... we did however try thier customer service and it was the worst I have ever seen!

Please note, this review is being written by a retail manager with over 20 years of customer service....

I called in a pizza, asked for 2 pizzas and was told it would be 25 minutes. Upon returning home, we found 2 pizzas, completely wrong with wrong toppings, and it was cut like a checkerboard. All we wanted was one plain pizza and one with mushrooms, total $46 (maybe if was gold plated that would be fair, but $23 a pizza????) We didn't get that... 

Here is the issue. Upon calling them to ask for what we ordered, we were met with resistance. I prefer the \"kill 'em with kindness and keep the customer approach\". The woman on the phone was sweet, and was relaying messages to me from the Manager. I told them in my 20+ years experience that it is better to take the loss ($5-8 in ingredients at most for 2 pizzas) and keep the customer. We were told that they can give us 1/2 off of one pizza for the order they just messed up. 

We said \"forget it\" and left with a credit. Now I have a $46 credit to a pizza place that I have no interest in going back to. 

You have now lost a NEW customer, the hardest kind of customer to obtain. Also, with all of the pizza joints in Fountain Hills, why would I or any of my friends/family ever return after being treated rudely and unfairly. 

Called in an order to Ray's in Scottsdale, told them what happened at Rosati's, and they said come on over, we will make your night better.  

Bottom line, shitty customer service, not sure about the food, and we'll see how long Rosati's can last with that kind of service."}
