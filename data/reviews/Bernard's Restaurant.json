{"text":"We went to Bernard's on July 7th for their Taco Tuesday. It was horrible! The taco's were small the shells were so dry you couldn't swallow without drinking water. The waitress or kitchen mixed up the order and one in our party waited over 30 min to get their ONE taco and that was after the rest of us had been served. We have been going to Bernard's for 6-8 years and the last 3 times have been so bad that we told the restaurant manager that we were done. No more. What happened to the wait staff that has been there for years and to the past management? They were attentive, polite, and the food was great. It saddens me to think that a once nice restaurant is now not worth going to. The old Bernard's...we miss you."}
{"text":"French dip sandwich and sweet potato fries = relatively inexpensive tasty lunch and happy, full belly. Nothing super fancy, but better than average (in my experiences) golf course cuisine. I'll be making stops there in the future."}
{"text":"We went to Bernard's for the Saturday night promotion (last night in June) and was very impressed with the food quality.  I had New York Steak and it was done perfectly to medium rare and the mushroom sauce was very flavorful.  My friends had the filet mignon and their comment was \"one of the best filet mignon I've had\".   We all said we would definitely go back for the steak dinner!"}
{"text":"On May 9TH, the IronOaks Ladies Billiards' Group had their Spring Luncheon at Bernard's Restaurant.  I can not say enough about the service we received from Trey, the Manager.  The room accomodations were great and Trey served us.  He never wrote down one order and he got all the orders correct.  I asked for bread and he brought out freshly baked sour dough bread for the whole group.  I had the Southwest Salad and it was good and I loved the dressing.  The ladies raved about the Club Sandwiches, too.  Trey was able to provide us with individual checks and could not have done more for us."}
{"text":"One of my favorite unknown jems. I love sitting out on the patio enjoying a glass of wine and the green of the golf  course. Food is average, but always tasty. Great date night!"}
{"text":"Wonderful location for breakfast.  Live music. Great ambiance. Attentive servers.  Great relaxing spot in the golf course."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and enjoyed the atmosphere. The food here is nothing to rave about. It's very basic and the menu is limited. However, I really liked that there is no buffet brunch; instead you order off a menu. We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the sounds of rushing water (the patio is surrounded by small fountains). The price was reasonable and the Bloody Marys were good."}
{"text":"We came here for our date night, and I will give the food a B overall. The cesar salad dressing was VERRRYYY fishy (i know, they use anchovies to make it, but this one tasted like pure fish). I ordered the salmon and garlic mashed potatoes, both were fabulous. The asparagus was my other side.... which was.... a little soggy, and steamed with apparently no seasoning.   Dessert was GREAT... we got the carrot cake. YUM.   My reasoning behind the A-OK rating:   When we walked in, we had a reservation, but the guy at the front had to go get the table ready. He came back, took us to our table, and only gave us one menu. Minor mishap--- I know. But the fact is, we saw him ditch the second menu before he took us to our table. Why? I'm not sure.  Secondly.....We waited for 10 minutes before we were ever approached by our server. Then another 5+ for her to get our drinks after we ordered them and the additional menu we needed.   So overall: FOOD, great (minus the fishy salad). Service: just OK for me."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch with some friends.  Food was good, price was good. Can never figure out how a waitress takes an order and then serves it by saying who had this and who had that?  Didn't she take the order?"}
{"text":"The food overall is average, nothing special, but the Sunday Brunch is small, good quality, and reasonably priced. We go there during the winter when it is nice time to sit outside on the patio."}
{"text":"The Sriracha hot wings were undercooked and I got food poisoning as a result. Will not be eating here again any time soon..."}
{"text":"I must have missed the restaurant all these reviewers are talking about.  We went for Mothers day brunch and it was awful.,,felt like we were at a high school reunion with the way the room was set up.  The buffet was horrible and not at all what others write.  We left it was that bad.  Maybe we will try again on a non-holiday."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday for breakfast.  Small menu.  Food was ok.  Had a nice young server that was just amazing!  No one else was overly friendly but Tyler made it a good experience."}
{"text":"What a disappoint. Mothers day brunch was a bust. Omelette station right in front of the door is thoughtless. Bacon, hash browns and cheese blintzs with fruit, dear heavens, I realize we're not in Vegas but what a poor excuse for a menu. They made my father inlaw get in line twice to order an omelette for himself and my mother inlaw, on mothers day? Seriously?? Lack of options, lack luster quality and poor service? Oh, and to lay the bill down in front of myself on mothers day, shhesh!! I won't be back, I guess my dreams of duchess of Bernards are over.."}
{"text":"I am EXTREMELY upset... we go to Bernards every year Easter brunch in the regular restaurant not in the buffet. We called a week ago and they said they're not doing the buffet restaurant menu. They also said it was first come first serve..My cousin called today to see how long of a wait and she was told now they're not doing the regular menu they're just doing the buffet and it changed a few days ago!!! HORRIBLE NEW OWNERS TO HAVE PEOPLE CALLING FOR WEEKS BEING TOLD ONE THING AND CHANGING IT LAST MINUTE!!!!!.  We had 12 people scheduled for tomorrow to come for regular menu!!!!! Now what???? They are horrible new owners and I will tell everyone not to come there!!! That already tells me what a bunch of idiots they are!!! I'm looking forward to the hosts getting yelled at alll day because of the previous information provided to all callers.... those owners should be at the host stand taking the complains for being idiots"}
