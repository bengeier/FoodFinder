{"text":"This is probably one of the WORST pizza places around Vegas and there's a lot.  I'm from Jersey, so I KNOW a little something about good pizza! I've ordered from Maestro's many times before and have always gave them the benefit of the doubt, but how could a pizza place really mess up a plain cheese pizza?! I ordered for delivery multiple times and the pizza ALWAYS comes cold, tissue-thin uncooked dough, and the taste is soooo bland! EVERY TIME!! They really like to get more of YOUR bang for your buck by watering down condiments which they charge an arm and a leg for and thinning out the dough so much, all you get is overly-processed cold toppings. I really have had it with this place. They just get more and more worse. NO MORE. BEWARE. Digiorno offers better pizza than this place! Geesh!"}
{"text":"I have made multiple trips to this restaurant. All were great the food is the closest to authentic italian cuisine since i lived in Chicago 2 years ago."}
{"text":"Ordered online said one hour to deliver took hour and an half driver said he was stopped cheese steak was cold and smashed pizza was cold fries were cold and limp foods better at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that the website changed my order of wings from Garlic to Plain, it was still good. Food was delivered fast, fresh, and HOT! I'd definitely be ordering my lunch from here again."}
{"text":"I have to say my food is awesome!!! It came hot and fresh!! I've ordered the same items at another place and there is no comparison! Came on time too!"}
{"text":"Mind you- the 5 stars are for the pizza alone.  Me and my co-worker ordered lunch- 16\" veggie supreme/ half with pepperoni added and it was absolutely delicious!!! The pizza was perfectly cooked, not too thick/thin, FRESH and hot! The slices were big but I guess it comes with the price... $27.56 for the pizza and two orders of fries.   We literally work across the street- they said 40 minutes or so and did take that long but it was soo worth it! I love their pizza and it's the second time we order it from here.  Also, I've ordered from here before with my family and dealt with the previous owner I think it was and he was really really nice. I would've given them an overall 5 for service and food.   As of then it's just been one other time and I don't really like the customer service the woman at the register gives but I guess it does the job.   Just as long as they keep a good cook that's all that matters!  Point is - goood pizza and its fresh!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Pizza places!  Love it. Owner is very friendly, the place is not the highest quality of apearance, but it is nice to bring everyone you know. Tastes very good for the $5 special pizza pie. I'm from New York City, I got to say this pizza passes my taste."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined in and thoroughly enjoyed it. Food was good and our hostess/waitress was great!!! Good food, great service, great price."}
{"text":"Failed to take pictures! The pizzas have been pretty damn good! Unfortunately, there was not an option for a \"normal\" supreme like with pepperoni, sausage, onions, bell pepper, mushrooms, and maybe some olives. Maestro's supreme adds marinated pork, ground beef, ham, and tomato. A bit much for me so I ordered 14\" spinach,mushrooms, onions,and sausage. Damn that was a great pizza! The crust wasn't consistent though. There were thick parts which were kinda doughy, but the thin crust was awesome! I took one star because of the crust. The delivery driver the first time was happy and cool! Yesterday the guy wasn't full of personality. Will order this again!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible and so was the service. The girl on the phone took forever to get my address and order correct. Then when they delivered our food, which took and hour and 15 minutes, they forgot part of our order and it took them over an hour to bring us that part that was missing from the order. Even the people delivering were embarrassed of the company they work for. I highly recommend not eating at this pizza/italian/greek location."}
{"text":"These guys get me a great, authentic gyro sandwich, delivered in less than a half-hour.  One star deducted because they never seem to have the tiramisu dessert, but 4.5 stars would be a better rating.  Maestro's is one of the bright spots left in this part of town."}
{"text":"OMG! Love their vegetarian pizza,  just the right amont of veggies and the flavor is incredible.  Delivery didn't take long at all and pizza was still hot  when we got it."}
{"text":"If you're looking to find a new pizza go to place, this is it! About a year ago my brother and I started a pizza escapade. where we would order a pepperoni special at every new mom and pop shop we went to. When we ordered the first pepperoni pizza, it had been 1 am (the hours went later back then). The quality was absolutely superb. We decided to give it a second chance 3 days later to see if it had been a fluke, this time going during the day, and it was equally as delicious. Over the past year I would say that I have gone to maestros over 100 times (yes, I did get a pizza every week at least). While I have never ordered delivery, the pickup and dine-in service was consistently excellent. Regardless of whether the place was empty, or if they were having a party of 50 people.   Having gone to maestros so many times, I've tried almost everything. Recommended eats from each type are: Pizza- Medium pizza special, Maestro's specialty pizza, Meet Meat, and Veggie supreme Italian Grinders- meatball Pasta- Meat lasagna and tortellini Maestro Philly Cheese Steaks- Maestro combo Calzones- Five cheese Greek corner- Gyro (most consistently delicious gyro in vegas. very good portion as well) Appetizers- mozzarella sticks and calamari fritti (so crispy and flavorful) Dessert- Chocolate cake. Beware of the baklava by the way. Sometimes it can come out stale tasting. Avoid getting it at night.  Finally, I'd like to add that Maestros is not a business stuck in its beginning. They continue to make improvements to service, interior restaurant layout, and food quality. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"We have been visiting Maestro's once a week for  several months now.  We always order lasagna and pizza, and occasionally order the Alfredo or spaghetti.  The sit down restaurant is a but neglected by customers, but it is a hidden gem!  The service is very personal.  The food is excellent, with generous portions.  We always eat family-style and share everything.  They don't mind bringing us extra plates.  Highly recommend for great Italian food at reasonable prices.  P.S.  the French silk pie is to die for, too!"}
{"text":"For the price wasn't a fan. Chicken Alfredo sauce was runny and the chicken was not the good stuff, had to spit most out as IDK what part it was from. Philly was Meh. Had better. The fries were good lol"}
{"text":"I Have been coming here for 4yrs now, the staff has always been very friendly. I love their pizza,  they put real bacon stripes on it not fake  bacon bits like most places. Their prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I was going to order Saturday night for the first time. I get it it's busy on Saturday nights. I asked the girl who answered what their specials were. She would not even tell me she said look on the website we are busy and delivery time is 2 hours. I was actually picking up so she said oh it's 1 hour then. How do you tell your customer look on the website. Poor customer service! I just hung up and ordered elsewhere. I will never try this place. Talk about first impression. I will take my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"And this one star is still too high for this jerk! I live 5 miles from this location, which to most people it wouldn't be that far, but to the jerk that owns or manages this place, it's too far. Funny, I ordered delivery food from there before, living here, and it was delivered without any problem. On this particular day, I ordered delivery food, the nice young lady took my order. The order came to almost $15, for a $6.50 sandwich + delivery charge. I had a $20 + 1's and change for the order. The delivery driver shows up without any change. So he took the food back and left. I called the place back and got this complete asshole! Said it wasn't worth it for them and that it was too far. Good for him, certainly not a problem to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"GREAT food.  The lasagna was the best I have ever had.  Portions are large and the price is right!  Too bad it's only carry out."}
{"text":"Maestro's equals Delicious. Everyday Lunch specials until 2 pm. Eat in, Take out and Delivery. Ordered lunch special: small one item sausage pizza plus can of soda and Chef Salad for delivery. Lunch was delicious! Food was delivered quick. Pizza was cooked very well with the right amount cheese and the sauce on point! The Chef salad was fresh and tasty with a good amount of toppings.  Side note, Driver forgot to give the can of soda upon delivery, however, was nice enough to drive back to the office to deliver the can of soda! Thumbs up!!!   Overall Good service and good food. Would order delivery service again."}
{"text":"the worker has a bad attitude he got salty cuz i didnt want to eat there because they charged you can clearly tell thats why people dont eat there"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  Definitely one of the best places to get pizza in Vegas.  I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Made me super SICK!! Total waste of my 20 bucks, I ordered a Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad and Over priced Tiramisu. It looked nice but once I started to investigate they sent me COLD FRIED CHICKEN OLD, SOGGY LETTUCE and SPOILED salad dressing (smelled disgusting). As far as the Tiramisu goes I took one bite and was disgusted. Tasted Old and Not like its suppose to. No one gave me a RECEIPT  so i'm stuck what to do... I ended up (trying) to eat half of it but felt sick after and now I've been SICK ALL DAY!!  Waiting for a call back from manger due to they have no mangers on duty... Waiting to see what happens. But I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich with extra cheese, onions and banana peppers.  Any Italian person knows cheddar isn't used and full peppers not cooked into the sandwich?  I've had the pizza here it's ok but this sandwich is a joke."}
{"text":"We ordered Maestro's party pack #1 for $19.95.   It comes with 2 large pizzas with 2 toppings & 2 liter soda.  I ordered 1 pepperoni/pineapple and 1 canadian bacon/pineapple.  We were told that it will take 45 minutes for delivery.  Our pizzas arrived after 1 hour and 15 minutes later.  They messed one of the pizzas.  They used regular bacon instead of canadian bacon.  The pizza was good.  I gave them 2 stars because of bad service due to late delivery and wrong ingredient."}
{"text":"i took an order in yelp. i went to pick it up and she( i guess she is an owner) was super nice.   i ordered fry stuffs, so i cannot say about the taste of food but service was wonderful.   i will try for sure to eat the pizza"}
{"text":"WOW, we just received our pizza, theChicago Fire, the delivery was on time, the pizza was hot and talk about flavor, 10+ The Marinara sauce we asked for on the side was also amazing, what flavors!!!Nice job, this is now going to be our go to place for pizza A extra special bonus was the pleasant, polite young lady that answered the phone and took our order and let's not forget the polite young man who made the delivery!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! We just moved back to Vegas and we HAD to get pizza from here again. This is the best pizza I think I've ever had! Everybody is so nice and helpful. The food is AMAZING! We will definitely be ordering from here again! Try them, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My husband and i dined in. I had the gyro for the first time ever and it was so amazing. It was served on pita bread with a tad bit of crushed sweet purple onion and diced tomato. It was topped with sour cream. There was a side of french fries that were made just right too. My husband had the stromboli with marinara sauce and he loved it. Both big portions. We were very impressed with the service and the atmosphere in there. The place is casual nothing too fancy but i love it because its an everyday place where locals can go often and have a good meal. I would tell everyone i know about this place."}
{"text":"Decent lunch stop for this area- Crab Corner and Burger Lab were both closed at 11AM on a Monday, so eventually found myself here with coworkers. Unclear whether there is typically table service (as we received) or if it's a walk-up order place (as a customer after us did). Much of their business is delivery and take-out/pickup.   Service was okay but not personable or attentive; drinks not refilled, orders came out slow and one at a time, eventually the cook brought them out after noticing they were sitting on the counter as waiter took a lengthy phone order.  Menu is extensive: pizza, chicken wings/tenders, salads, burgers, hot and cold sandwiches, gyros, and about 10 $7 lunch specials. Most of group got lunch specials- I opted for buffalo chicken salad ($9), portions for all were huge and no one actually finished. Best value was 1 topping small pizza and drink.  Salad I ordered was large, portion of chicken was large too, but there was way too much wing sauce puddling in the vegetables rather than being able to really use the salad dressing (bleu cheese). Filling and fresh."}
{"text":"Yummmm!! Just ordered from this place and i have to say the pizza was so good! There also open 24 hours which is very convenient. The prices are also very good. We got a large pizza w/ 1 topping, 12 Wings, French Fries & 2 cans of soda all for $18. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I wanted pizza on July 4th in Vegas.  Most other mom and pop pizza shops weren't open.  I was a little hesitant to call Maestro's at first based on Yelp reviews of this place having rude customer service, but I decided to give them a try anyway.  First of all, the person who answered the phone was very nice and polite.  I ordered a spinach pizza with chicken, which was amazing.  I also got the sampler for two, since I love mozzarella sticks.  They were solid, but the french fries weren't that good.  I was told my food would arrive in 45 minutes and it came within 20, which is a big plus.  The pizza quality is REALLY REALLY GREAT.  I cannot stress this enough.  The cheese is fresh, the chicken is premium.  I will definitely be ordering more of their menu.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone that wants good, fresh pizza in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Maestro's Pizza, I told my friends about this place and they all like to get their pizza from here if they are in the area. The Spicy Mexican Pizza is my favorite, its got a perfect amount of spice to it and its crazy flavorful!! Every pizza Ive had has been good and Ive had like 5 different ones."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood.  They are a HORRIBLE neighbor!  Rude, the owner/manager is NEVER there when you call to complain that they are littering the area with their menus.  We would be better off having a strip club in that location.  At least we wouldn't have to pick up all the trash they distribute."}
{"text":"Maestro's has great food and great customer service.  I especially like the cheeseburger! It's unusually mouthwatering delicious.  Michelle and all  the delivery drivers and always nice to me."}
{"text":"If I can give no stars, that would be more acceptable. A bit of background, i'm a Jersey girl and I frequent pizza all the time so I know what good pizza tastes like. This place has to be the WORST ever pizza I have tried and I tried a lot of bad places out here in Vegas. the pizza arrived cold, so cold the cheese was separated from the dough. The pizza sauce tasted like it came right out of the can. To make it seem even worse, the sausage that we ordered on the pizza was not real. It was like curdled breakfast sausage that you find pre-packaged on a shelf in the grocery store. Why oh why does this place still stand is beyond me. Do yourself a favor and go to Cugino's or something. Save your money and do not go to this place."}
{"text":"Food is amazing as well as the service!! Cute sit down pizza place, we loved it and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! THE worst costumer service EVER!! We used to order food from the place at my work a couple times a week. So needless to say they where getting a TON of business from us. I placed my order for a small salad took over an hour to get to here AND the over charged the crap out of me! My salad was DOUBLE the price they told me. I had an extra $2.00 added onto the already $1.50 delivery fee ( When my coworker ordered aswell and didn't get charged that amount) and they added an extra 1.50 to the total on top of the credit card charge (Which I've been charged for before) so there is an extra 3.50 right there!  To make matters worse they didn't give me any salad dressing! So when I called to complain about the horrible service and over charge they didn't care and THEN the cook got on the phone are started YELLING AT ME! About how he put the dressing in the bag and I was like no I'm looking at the bag. In the end over charged and dressingless with assholes that don't care. I hope this place goes under."}
{"text":"Wow that was a good spinach pizza, it was fully loaded with tastiness. The dough was crispy and fluffy. Im  glad they are open late and close to my work. Thanks guys! !"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I popped in late one night there was no wait and the pizza was fresh cooked in 15 mins. Hand tossed and very authentic. The cook even has an Italian accent."}
{"text":"Employees were outside smoking and went inside to take order and DID NOT washed his hands.. they are just rude to they customers!!!! Don't waste your money with these people!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wish could rate them Zero!!!!"}
{"text":"I've now been there twice, first time I ordered the lunch pizza and it was good and well worth the price.  The second time I ordered the Ravioli and it came with lots of sauce and melted cheese.  I was expecting just the ravioli and sauce, but the melted cheese on top was great.  I don't live too far away and it's nice to know that this place is so close and also the food is good.  I can't wait to try the other food on the menu.  Very well done!"}
{"text":"I am going to start by saying I don't like pizza. That being said, this is some of the best pizza in town.   I've hunted for years to find good New York style pizza in Vegas. This is the best I've  found. The dough is delicious, the toppings are fresh & they make a tasty white pizza. They have a great oven, which creates that perfect crispy crust and defines New York style pizza. Every time we go there, the food is consistently delicious. Each pizza is as good as the next. We've also been happy with the chicken wings and fingers.   This is not an \"eat in\" place, per se. They do have a few tables, but it seems that 95% of their business is carry out. The owners are great. They are friendly and helpful. I've fed large groups and they went out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed."}
{"text":"Used this place for a lunch with a client, Good food and service, Will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites pizza places ever ! For being a picky person, it's always hard for me to try new places because I'm used to the same places but I'm very glad I tried this place out. They ordered from here at work one shift and I ended up loving it. Every time I order they're super nice and helpful and at times one of the workers realizes who I am and asks how I've been. My coworker and I have days where we just crave this place and we order it on our shift!"}
{"text":"Really bad customer service.  Food was not good.  Visit one of the many other pizza places in town.  Spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing food, Delicious flavors , Worth every dollar spent. I highly recommend this Restaurant I am a regular and will be recommending to my friends."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place because we were in the mood for some Italian and heard good things about them. We weren't sure if we were out of their range so we called to ask. The guy on the phone was rude right off the bat. I've been in the food business and knew that during lunch time things can get hectic but starting off with a negative attitude is never a good start on the phone. We asked if we were in their range and he said yes. We ordered the food and he neglected to tell us how long it would take. After about 30 minutes I called to ask how long and he rudely says he told me 45 minutes. I don't recall it but still no reason to be rude. After an hour and 20 mins passes I called again and he tells me 'look, we are very busy. You will get your food soon just wait ok? We are a very famous place you are lucky we are delivering to you!'  WOW!!! I'm so sorry my lordship I didn't know your special PIZZERIA was some world renowned establishment!!  Needless to say we cancelled our order and will never recommend this place!   DO           NOT              EAT           AT       MAESTROS             PIZZERIA!!!!!"}
{"text":"Last night we decided to have take out pizza and wings and we ordered take out from maestro's.  Normally I don't like ordering food too late at night because it seems like if it's too close to closing they either rush it or it's not what you ordered.  Last night I called and placed and order for 2 medium pizza and calamari and 48 wings.  After I placed the order I say on hold for about 6 minutes and the line was disconnected.  I waited a few minutes and called back to see what happened and the lady said she was trying to call me back.  After that was settled and the order was really placed I went to pick it up.   In their defense .....normally they are effing awesome with their pizza and wings. Last night had to be an off night or something.  One of the medium pizzas was actually a little burned.  When you think of how you want your pizza you want that joint moist with cheese dripping and vegetables bursting in your mouth.  Both pizzas were dry and the crust tasted like it came straight out of a box.    In the last 4 years of eating here last night I can honestly say I was disappointed.  I hate it when your favorite pizza joint used to bring the delicious and then either they are saving on ingredients or something.  Listen....get it together...we as your loyal customers know when your cutting corners.  I can barely even remember any sauce on the pizza.  It evaporated in the oven.      I think if I ever decide to order from here again I'll have to explain that I want to see the pizzas before I pay for it.  Well....maybe I won't do that but I'll let them know they let down a loyal pizza king."}
{"text":"Pizza was good.  Service was fast.  Calamari was just a fried piece of leather.  BUT the tiramisu was AMAZING."}
{"text":"Yesterday my co-workers and I decided to order from this place. Everything from ordering to receiving the food was horrible service! The lady on the phone Carla (supervisor) was extremely rude and disrespectful.. When we received our orders they were wrong, I called back to ask for the supervisor and it was Carla again I explained to her I ordered a calzone not a sandwich and she started snapping at me saying I was wrong and being very disrespectful.. And then she said they would send an replacement I'm like thank you. 3 hours later I called her and asked where the driver was and she said he is busy he will get there when he can!! I am like can we have our money back was suppose to receive it yesterday however we still have not received anything! My supervisor called and tried to speak to her about her order as well and Carla was rude and hung the phone up!! I would never ever recommended this place to anyone.   So this morning I wake up and this is the direct message I get from the supervisor! Karla!! Btw get Your spelling right its Karla with a K. ; ) and btw are you such a loser that you have to talk bad about ppl on yelp your life must suck big time hahaha good luck loser"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good compared to other 5 dollar pizzas its really A-ok homestyle not A box taste.Also the steak quesadilla  is really good,pick up time is reasonable/quick idk about delivery."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! We had pepperoni with olives and onions! We'll definitely come back! I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food does take some time, but it is always delicious. Some of the older guy employees are a little strange, but the younger girls are super nice. Definitely try their wings during their lunch time special and their $5 carry out special that comes with one topping. The ricotta is amazing!"}
{"text":"Called for pick up an the person who picked up was so rude, rushing me to tell him what I wanted to order, then went to pick it up, I didn't check it until I got home an it looked like a mess, like a child made it. Also there was a type of cheese on it that looked like globs of white pudding. Really... Learn how to make a decent pizza"}
{"text":"Good za!!' Apart from the franchise pizza this is a better alternative.  The wings are great too"}
{"text":"Called to place an order at 11:30 am and I waited and waited and at 1:00 pm we called and they stated \"we are really busy and stressed out and we are just going to cancel your order and refund your money \" so an hour and a half later you cancel my order  because you are busy ! horrible customer service do not recommend!"}
{"text":"I have never had a problem here before other than the extremely rude man whom you can barely understand who usually answers the phone. Tonight I got a really pleasant young lady who answered the phone. Here are my issues: One- I was charged 12.95 for wings and fries that were 8.95, when I called I was told the prices had gone up. I informed them that they needed to change their prices on the paper menu and the online menu and that it was false advertising otherwise. Two- My order took an hour and twenty minutes to arrive!!!! I was completely starving by the time the food got here! I am pregnant so this was significant. Three- My calzone was burnt!!!!!!!!!!!!!   My order was a $40.00 order so yeah I am more than a little upset.  My suggestion, check your food before you pay and demand a delivery time. Also, check your receipt before you pay."}
{"text":"The food was ok nothing exceptional ordered standard pizza medium cheese with sausage. It was only two people working. me and my boyfriend walked in no one said anything no hi Can I help you nothing we ordered waited about 20 mins for the food they didn't have any deals for what we ordered overall the experience was ok"}
{"text":"yum, yum, yum, yum, yum...oh by the way...did I say yum???  my husband and I have ordered from them 6-7 times and I think each time has been better than the last.  I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THEM...you will NOT be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I called to order a pizza for delivery on a weekday afternoon and I was SHOCKED how RUDE the person who picked up the phone was. They expected me to know their menu and couldn't answer my questions.  I was put ON HOLD multiple times and it took over 1 and a half hour to get two pizzas.  Needless to say the quality of the pizza was Very Disappointing. The dough was half cooked and ALL the TOPPINGS FELL  OFF once I reached for my first slice.  I have never had this Terrible a Pizza.  Even the chain restaurants make a decent pizza.  I will never order from here again. Very Disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm sure people hate when people say they are from New York. But I know pizza pretty good and I'm from New York. Save your money. I know I could get better frozen pizza at the store. Made me and my boyfriend alittle queasy all night after eating. Nice staff since we knew the guys brother but I don't recommend. I'm sorry."}
{"text":"Waited 8 minutes. Wasn't acknowledged, only customer in line. Turned around and left."}
{"text":"It's kind of hard to mess up pizza, but everyone knows some is better than others. Maestro's delivers one of the better slices of pizzas around and is defiantly the most bang for your buck, the pizzas are dirt cheap. I always encounter friendly service when I visit and have never waited too long on an order. This is defiantly a place I would recommend it you have a craving for pizza, and they are open late too."}
{"text":"Always the best gyros in town.  Cooked the right way on a spit. No frozen slabs of meat.  It doesn't get better than here."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service left a lot to be desired. Came here for lunch and the place wasn't all that busy. Besides us, there was only one table. Had 2 server and they took our orders, food came after a while but we had to ask them again about the drinks."}
{"text":"It had a horrible costumer service. Manager was not pleasant and don't let us use a coupon that was good. He don't even care like that was our first time at the restaurant"}
{"text":"Good pizza, reasonably priced. Better than the chain pizzerias, their chicken parm is especially good for take-out. They have a pretty large selection but I usually stick with the pizza and italian dishes.   They usually give you a 45 minute delivery time and show up within 30-45 min. I never had them mess up an order or show up late."}
{"text":"Beware of this place. If you happen to browse their website to look at their menu and see a special you want they will NOT honor it.   I tried to order a special they had listed about 3 months ago. They said they were in the process of updating their website so I gave them a pass.   Again, tonight I looked at their website and found a family deal I wanted to order. I called them to place the order and was told they had no such special. I informed them it was clearly listed on their website, the guy I spoke with hummm'd and stuttered and said they were updating their website. I told him I called months ago and was fed the same line. I asked him if he would honor the deal listed online or now. He placed me on hold for an extended period of time where I eventually hung up.   Seems extra shady. I will never give this place my business again."}
{"text":"I order from here atleast twice a week while at work and love them. Their lunch specials are great and delivery is fast."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for delivery.  Good observances:  Pizza arrived within specified time limit and the delivery person was very friendly and polite.  Large pizza was huge.  Not-so-good observances:  pizza must have been tilted at at some point between pizzeria and our place.  Half the cheese and topping had slid to one end if the box and was stuck to the box. Sausage was not very good.    Cheese was ok.  Crust was ok.  Very thin crust that you really need to fold and eat that way.  I really did not enjoy this pizza.  Would not order again."}
{"text":"We ended up at Maestro's with family that eats there a lot. They were bragging on the Strombolis and so I had to order one. I got the Italian supreme and it was great. I do have to say that my wife got the spinach Strombolis and I found myself stealing more and more bites of hers! It had the perfect combination of sautéed spinach, garlic, and onions, smothered in cheese. Good times! And the owners actually served us. His name was Lehman and what a character. He made our dining stay worth coming back. . . Ok the good food helped."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Quality and quantity in one. The pizza and calamari was so good.We had a little bit of a problem with the wait but the food and price made up for it."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, I like the lunch specials, food is really good and good sized portions (lunch small pizza is big enough for two, but only about $7). Great value, and staff is really friendly every time I'm here."}
{"text":"I have found heaven in a pizza box.  Easy to order, good delivery service, fantastic flavor (Specialty Pizza) with salad.  Great value ... Good quality and lots of food for the money."}
{"text":"New restaurant with  open mic night on Fridays. It's new so still feeling it out. I think they are doing improvements."}
{"text":"First, Maestro's delivers. The actual restaurant's employees deliver - not a delivery service - so the friendly person who brings your meal to the door actually *cares* whether it's correct/complete. This matters.  When you call them on the phone, they're actually happy to hear from you. We order maybe once a month or so, but they remember hubby by name, every time.  We've ordered the pizza a couple times. It's really good.  But usually we go for the gyros, which are always delicious. Hubby orders his with extra meat, which makes it an enormous damn sandwich. The 'regular' gyro is plenty filling all on it's own.  My only complaints are with the appetizer menu. Anything in that section of the menu is just about guaranteed to be frozen/packaged and not very good. Given the quality of the other things we've had, I'd love to see Maestro's selling fresh, hand-battered onion rings and calamari!"}
{"text":"never reopened after the holidays, exterior sign has been removed, so it looks like the Maestro's is gone, finished, kaput, has been kind of a revolving door operation the last 10 years or so, different operators, different quality, restaurant business tough enough but when you through in marginal product and owner indifference the place won't last long,"}
{"text":"Great place. Johnny was awesome and made me some fresh wings right before closing. No complaints at all, and had a great conversation about the business. Very pleasant and great service. I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"What a great find this place is.  Take out, delivery and eat in. The owner is super friendly and recognizes you if you frequent their establishment. Took the family out for a Sunday dinner. Very accommodating for a group of 13 with no reservations. Pizza is the best in my opinion. I don't like my pizza loaded with sauce. Here you don't have to ask for light sauce as it just comes that way. We had the chicken fingers (huge pieces) and chicken wings. Added a Greek salad for two which fed four. Plenty of cheese and the right amount of other toppings."}
{"text":"It was a pleasure to stop by and order a spinach pizza and fried calamari to carry out. Service was friendly and efficient. Advisement was that order would take about 15 minutes so I opted to stop next door at Food 4 Less to grab a six pack of Peroni to accompany the fare. Upon returning, counterman updated progress by saying about another six minutes and my order would be ready. He was right on schedule and brought the parcel to me rather than yelling for me to come pick it up! Upon opening at home, the calamari rings were battered nicely and ensconced in aluminum foil to keep them warm. Two dipping sauces as well as two large lemon squeezes were included! Nice touch. The pizza was outstanding: generous portions of ingredients properly presented and again well packaged. I heartily recommend Maestro's."}
