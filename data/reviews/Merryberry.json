{"text":"This is my favourite bistro/cafe! It's such a hidden gem and I have yet to try out their whole menu! I've been here a few times and I've always had a good experience, service and food-wise. I love the unique, but healthy combinations.Their food is flavourful and delicious! The place itself, is quite cute and it's in such a quiet neighbourhood. I just love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 2 years. This place is just amazing! Great food, great service, great atmosphere.
Menu is updated regularly and there is always a plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"I haven't just sat and eaten here yet, but can't wait to! What I did experience was being part of a large cooking class in which 16 of us made 15 different dishes over four hours. It was so much fun! A great team-building and fun experience, made very special by the wonderful hospitality and expertise of Cyril and his team, Roger and Grace. Two big thumbs up on all counts: food, hospitality and ambience."}
{"text":"What a great little place,  it has very cool vibe and atmosphere.  The food was outstanding, I had the shredded chicken on a Naan with the Beirut flavor style, the sauce was awesome. There coffee was also really good and it is served in a clear glass cup.

The furniture and decorations in the restaurant are super cool and really add to the chill vibe. I can't wait to go back and try out some more of the really great sounding sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is very cozy.  Although for vegetarians, food selection is limited, to my surprise they have vegetarian burger which called Super Food.  It is amazingly good, I will call it Super Good instead!  Their crème brûlée is great as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my very favourite spots in Toronto. The service is warm and the food is delicious. The secret back patio is as delightful as the inside. 

It's the perfect spot to have a tea and croissant with a book, or to meet friends for lunch. Whenever I recommend Merry Berry, friends are grateful. It's a gem!"}
{"text":"What a cute, quirky cafe!  The food is really tasty.  In the warmer weather  they have a nice little patio out back.  Salads, sandwiches, quiche, etc. Very nice."}
{"text":"I love this neighbourhood gem in Cabbagetown and it is one of my favourite brunch spots in Toronto. It is a gorgeous cafe that we frequente quite regularly. The staff are extremely friendly and efficient and the food is delicious. The decor is also cute and quirky. My favourite sandwich/burger is the California burger and my husband just loves the African peanut burger (sorry can't remember it's proper name). I also love all the side salads with the quinoa salad been my favourite. The smoked salmon open brunch sandwich is also yum! We have been here at least 20 times over the past 2-3 years and I have never had a bad meal or experience there. Whilst it can sometimes be busy at peak times on a weekend it is generally relatively quiet early morning or afternoon. It baffles me as to why this place is not busy all day long especially at weekends.

My only negative on the place is that we have a young baby and there are no baby changing facilities. It feels like there would be enough room downstairs near the washrooms to have one  so it would be great to see something especially as I imagine they get a lot of families. I have come here a few times with other mums of babies who feel the same way.

I really can't say enough good things about this places."}
{"text":"This place is quirky, and loveable.  I only ordered the lemon poppyseed muffin and a cold lemon ginger tea, so I can't comment on the meal foods, but everything I order was wonderful.  A great atmosphere with colourful decor and jazz playing overhead.  Definitely one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Working in the area of Cabbagetown this spot is definitely in my top 5 picks.

The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming as are the staff.
But it doesn't over shadow the food which is the true shining star.
The dish are all freshly prepared with whole ingredients and though I agree that due to these reasons the wait time can be long don't let that deter you from trying this hidden delight."}
{"text":"We love this place! Our friends introduced us to this fabulous funky restaurant today. The menu is imaginative and wide-ranging; the food is beautifully prepared and presented. The hosts are welcoming and charming. We particularly loved the delightful design elements which embellished every surface and space. Homey environment and exceptional food!"}
{"text":"The French pastries are to die for. (Psst, butter is the secret ingredient.) The sandwiches are really tasty with options for vegetarians. I try to come here every week since it's bright and around the corner from my house. They're easy to miss, but hard to forget :)"}
{"text":"Quaint, healthy meals with much love and thought put into each dish!
Feb 2016 - Went for a brunch date with friends:
Open-Face Brunch Sandwich $10.00
(Toasted Rye Bread, Dijon mustard, Marinated onions, Arugula, smoked salmon, Asparagus & a Poached Egg)
Good coffee options as well."}
{"text":"Really nice place with warm and hearty atmosphere and amazing food! My quinoa bowl was great!! Service is prompt and thoughtful."}
{"text":"A newly opened cafe located in the heart of Cabbagetown, MerryBerry first surprised me with its quirky and colourful decor. I am definitely someone who is willing to compensate money for a good environment and this is another great example of a cafe that has slightly pricier foods (I went for lunch, cost about $13 with a drink) but has an atmosphere of the young and hip, abuzz with a coolness. I went on a Sunday and it was completely filled to the brim (thank goodness my friend made a reservation). The foods on the menu incorporated more obscure ingredients. All in all, it had pretty good food with an amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Merryberry is a great little restaurant in Cabbagetown on Parliament.  I've been here 5 or 6 times for lunch meetings during the weekdays.  I can't really comment on brunch or dinner but lunch has always been really tasty.  I get the \"Shane Tried\" sandwich with chorizo, green apple and melted cheddar.  I usually get a soup or salad on the side.  Soup of the day and green lentil salad.  The food is consistently fresh and VERY tasty.  The other sandwiches on the menu all look incredible but I like this one so much I'm having a tough time getting away from it.  Sandwich with half soup or salad is $13 and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Petit bistro avec terrasse blotti dans un coin perdu de Cabbagetown : excellent choix au menu, saveurs et goûts intéressants, imagination et créativité avec en plus un personnel attentif et sérieux, c'est la formule gagnante. A consommer sans modération !"}
{"text":"Cute lunch spot on Parliament. Seats about 25 but they also have a patio out back. Servers are always attentive and polite. The soup changes week to week and is always very good. The tomato and tea soup is a recurring one that is very good. They have recently branded themselves as The Hive. With that re-branding they have changed their menu. You choose a protein, dressing and bread. The comfort salad is great. Coffee is well done by the barista (waiter). They don't look at you in disdain when you ask for a substitution, rather they accommodate. Vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"This place is adorable. I love the colourful décor and the people who work here are incredibly friendly and nice. My partner and I both went with the 'street food' options. I love that you can mix and match the kind of bread, protein, and flavouring you want!
I got the naan with chicken and the Bamako. It was SO good. The spicy peanut sauce was delicious and paired super nicely with the sweet mango! The flavour reminds me a bit of a cold noodle dish from Taiwan -- and I loved it even more for that! My partner got the Beirut on baguette with meatballs. For me, this one was okay-- the flavours were good but compared to my juicy Bamako, this one was a bit dry for me. It was also quite small. 
They also serve a bunch of different brunch options. It's such a cute and colourful place -- definitely stop by for some brunch or a quick lunch if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The Lady K, Cubanito sandwich and portabello burgers are all excellent."}
{"text":"What a lovely spot! Went for brunch on a Sunday and sat on their little backyard patio. Prices were on par with most brunch spots but the food and excellent service were really stand out. Intricate flavours and a really homey feeling make this place a winner. Going to tell folks about this one."}
{"text":"Merryberry is a charming cafe/bistro on Parliament with fantastic food, friendly service, and a cheerful, laid back atmosphere. The mismatch wallpaper and colourful cushions decorating the bench seating, are great for a quick bite or longer stay to gossip or read. 

The food is delicious and quick, with some interesting but definitely yummy ingredient twists! The unique menu and food preparation is definitely the best part! (Did I mention the great service??)

They also have a really cool selection of 'made in France' products to buy, like aprons, notebooks, vases and oven mitts! You can also buy a wicked selection of Kusmi loose leaf tea/defusers!"}
{"text":"Loved this quaint little spot in cabbagetown! Service was spot on - my restless toddler was immediately provided crayons and paper to occupy him!! Food was just overall packed with flavour. We ordered the carrot hummus to start which was deliciously seasoned. The Mexican naan wrap with shredded chicken, thought doesn't sound terribly exciting, was so good. Last but not the least was the dark choc brownie with banana ice cream - rich and decadent without feeling like a weight in your stomach afterwards!"}
{"text":"I love Cabbagetown and I love Merryberry!! This colourful, nicely decorated restaurant on Parliament Street is a must if you find yourself in the area and want to enjoy a good meal. 

I had one of the brunch options, a whole avocado with eggs and a bit of bacon on top of them.  The avocados were perfectly soft and spot on and the bacon gave the combination a nice crunchy touch. This option included a side salad of your choice so I decided to have the lentils salad with carrots: the combination of the two dishes was so energetic and so ideal for lunch! It was a healthy, perfectly cooked meal. They also have a great selection of teas - the caramel black tea was my choice.

The service was friendly, funny, attentive, they take their time to explain how some of their dishes are gluten free and vegan and so tasty. We ended up having an interesting conversation with them about their brownie with coconut ice cream recipe :)

Another one that goes to my favourite places list."}
{"text":"Merryberry has long been one of my favourite places in Cabbagetown to get a bite to eat. It's charming interior and delicious fresh food are perfect for those extra long lunches.

The drink menu is extensive, various coffees, teas and fresh juices. My favourite is the spicy hot chocolate where you are presented with a syringe to select your own spice level.

The sandwiches here are drool worthy. Add an awesome seasonal rotating soup menu and I wish I could eat here everyday. They don't have a fryer here, so do not have expect fries with your meal, a refreshing change from the heavy pub fare available in the neighbourhood. 

Having only been for lunch, I look forward to returning in order to sample their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Let me start with the good - the owner is lovely, the food is great, unique and reasonably priced, the people are nice and the room is pleasant.  

Now for the reason behind the one star - the service: We (dad, mom, two kids) just had lunch here on the weekend and as usual it took 40 minutes to get drinks and an hour to get food. I say as usual since this is literally the case every other time you visit the place. 

A lovely older lady is working as a waitress - she has no business being a waitress and is merrily destroying reputation and costing the place business daily. I am watching the disaster unfold as people sit down, wait for 15 minutes and leave without anyone talking to them. 

Cyril (I believe that's the owners name) you have a great place, great food, reasonable prices - get a couple of real waiters and enjoy your business."}
{"text":"This place is soooooooo cute!!!! Secret backyard patio and extremely reasonably priced brunch menu. Staff were great! I called half an hour before arrival and make a reservation for 12 people on their patio and they were able to accommodate us! 

Had their ninja burger with summer salad omg so good the avocado with salmon and quinoa salad with berries! Would totally come back here again!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a rainy day with a friend here - she selected it because of the better vegetarian options compared to other places in the neighbourhood.

Lots of great things to say about this place.  It is incredibly cute - which is the first thing I noticed.  Very neat decor (I felt like I was in Alice in Wonderland).  There were two staff members working - one in the kitchen, one in the restaurant.  Very friendly, kind service.

Food was excellent.  I found the menu a little difficult to read (no idea why) but initially nothing appealed to me.  I ended up choosing a sandwich and the soup of the day (potato lemon), and all of our items came out fresh and tasty.  Their tea selection was amazing as well.

Great spot for lunch - it was quiet when we walked in and filled up quickly after that.  Must have walked by this place dozens of times in the past - glad I finally stopped in."}
{"text":"I nearly found my thrill on Merryberry Hill
On Merryberry Hill where I found you
The moon stood still on Merryberry Hill
And lingered till my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Tho' we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Merryberry Hill

Interesting little Bistro in St Jamestown/Cabbagetown.  It's a small bistro that offers decent prices with a nice selection on their menus of assorted sandwiches, savoury pies, and desserts.  I liked the bright mish-mashy décor of the place, however the food was only ok.  I had the meat pie which was just a tad dry like my fellow compadre's Chicken pot pie.  

If I'm in the neighbourhood again, I might give it a second go.  But nothing really thrilled me on this Merryberry hill."}
{"text":"A group of fellow Yelpers and I had dinner here this past week, and it was actually my first time venturing to Cabbagetown.  It's a fairly new restaurant, and I really liked the funky country-home décor.  The bench that ran the length of the restaurant was covered in cushions in bright and colourful mismatched fabrics.  The only thing that I didn't like about the décor were the hanging lights - maybe it was the way the tables were set up for our group, but it was hanging right in between tables at face-hitting level.  

The menu had a separate page with specials for stew, soup, meat pie, sandwich, and sliders.  The regular menu had the same sections, and the sandwiches intrigued me the most - they had very interesting combinations.  As soon as I saw chorizo I knew that would be my dinner.  It was chorizo and green apple with a mayo aioli, and it was delicious.  The sausage naturally overpowered most of the sandwich, but the apple provided a nice crispness and managed to cut through the flavour of the meat occasionally.  The bread was great, a nice crunchy crust and soft in the middle.  The sandwich was $8.50 and didn't come with any sides, but it was enough for me.  

Some of the other selections were the meat pies which didn't seem to be a fan favourite -the general consensus was that they were a little too dry.  The side potatoes were apparently delicious though.

I finished with dessert - earl grey crème brulee.  I love crème brulee, but I'm not a huge tea drinker, so I was curious whether I would like this.  First off, they nailed the top - a decently thick and very crackable shell of burnt sugar covered the smooth pudding underneath.  The crème itself wasn't overpowering with the earl grey, but it was definitely noticeable and I really enjoyed it.  The best word I can think of to describe it is fragrant, which seems like a strange word to describe the taste but there you have it.  

All in all, it's a very cute little restaurant with some unique options at a good price.  If I lived in the neighbourhood, I would definitely come back, but I probably wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I love unique and quirky places that have character, especially if they have good food to go with it. Merryberry is definitely fits into this category and was a great place for a bunch of us to grab a late lunch. 

What's nice is that I was able to make a reservation for 8 even though its such a tiny place. On a Saturday afternoon, it wasn't too busy, but still was necessary seemed like. 

Like a small little cottage, the walls had some really cute decals, and mismatched fabric on the couches with pockets of full of magazines which could make for a great conversational break. 

The menu has tons of choice. They do serve brunch but only on Sundays, but you can get the Eggs a La Coque (and try not to snicker) which is boiled eggs, with toast and a bunch of other fixings (see photo). 

There's Sandwiches, lots of salads, burgers etc. Popular among our group was the magic quinoa salad. Not sure what was so magic about it, but it was tasty. 

I got the Mother of All Sandwiches ($9.95), a grilled panini with goat cheese, basil, strawberries, hummus and a portobello mushroom. It was mighty tasty but I did not feel sated at all. There's no side that came with it, and you'd have to order separately. I was disappointed that the price point did not reflect this at all. One of the big reasons I can't give 5 stars. 

They have a very extensive tea selection with what seemed like everything under the sun. As well, 4 different hot chocolate choices including one where you can all chilli sauce using a syringe. Weird and cute! 

We were there for about 2 hours chit chatting. Although the wait staff was really nice, and did give us separate bills, they were not as attentive as we'd liked. We had to ask multiple time for water, and they were not proactive about anything. After our meal was done and plates cleared, I really wanted them to come by and ask if we wanted dessert. Instead, we were chatting for a while and I had to get up and get the menu ourselves. As a group we were ready for a change of scenery and decided to grab dessert somewhere else (although not much choice along the strip to be honest). 

I would recommend the place for a nice dinner or lunch, esp if you're looking for something new and quiet."}
{"text":"Seven of us went for brunch today and made a reservation (sometimes it gets very busy and we wanted to make sure we could all sit together). Roger was our server and was outstanding !! 

We all had a nice LARGE coffee and placed our order....Brunch was fantastic! 
 
I had the corn and roasted pepper soup and a salad. The soup has a little watery and I would have preferred a more hearty soup, but it was okay. A couple people  had the combo brunch of a mini frittata, fruit cup, muffin, a grilled cheese sandwich and a jam that was apparently to die for. One had the savoury crepe and one had the pancakes (I think)...we all ate everything in sight  - YUMMY !  

All in all nice place for a different (non typical) brunch. The menu has a vast variety of items for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner.  The restaurant seats about 40 people, you can see the open kitchen at the back and the decor is very funky and relaxing."}
{"text":"This adorable cafe has lots of personality, a cozy dining area, private backyard patio, lovely and personable staff, with delicious and flavourful food. 

HUBBY AND I SPLIT THE FOLLOWING....
- Curried Zucchini soup (could order it hot or cold) was thick and savoury.
- Meatball sandwich on a toasted baguette New Orleans Style (Cajun-maple ketchup, mixed greens, tomato, pickled onions and bacon). Enjoyed my sandwich very much. The baguette was crunchy, some people might not like it toasted this much; I wonder if they would be able to adjust it next time.
- The Firetruck Sandwich: chicken, roasted red peppers, marinated onions, green onions, melted cheddar and jalapeño aioli on a toasted baguette. Flavours worked well together.
- Cocoa-banana dessert: a warm double chocolate brownie (had chocolate chips on top) with roasted banana ice cream. YUM! I could have finished this all by myself!

For those with big appetites, I wouldn't recommend this place for a main meal because the portions are small. Being 5'2\" 130 lbs, the portions were perfect and I was able to finished everything (sandwich, soup and dessert) which is unusual for me because I usually take home leftovers.

Great place for a girly lunch with lots of decorative details to admire and scrumptious food to enjoy. Afterwards you can check out Cabbagetown's historic Victorian homes along Sackville St, Riverdale Farm, Riverdale Farmer's Market, Menagerie Pet Shop or even the Toronto Necropolis."}
{"text":"Got a reservation for a birthday here and they accommodated us well. We had about 10-12 people with a few infants. The place is nicely set up and has a cozy vibe. The food is good and service was good too. Would certainly visit again for breakfast."}
{"text":"A lovely hidden gem! I almost don't want to tell you about it because I'd kind of like to keep it all to myself. I've walked by this place probably hundreds of times and never really noticed it. I only came on the suggestion of a friend because we both live close by. I loved the cute, funky and cozy decor. Our waiter was sweet and unobtrusive. And the whole reason for being there -- the food  -- was great! Fresh, creative and delicious. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Merry Berry...I wish you were in my neighbourhood so I could visit every day.

This coffee shop is lovely. Its so cute (but not too cute a guy would be weirded out by it). I love the deco-there's comfy side seats. Everything in this place is just too adorable. 

The staff were very friendly. The baked goods looked home-made had a chocolate chip cookie-to die for. And I had a regular drip coffee-bold and well-flavoured. They do have sandwiches and small lunch fare.

This is the kind of place I could hang out for a few hours and just chill. Beats any starbucks or second cup hands down (and I'm a second cup fan, so I don't say that lightly).

Go here for coffee. Its my favourite independent coffee stop in the city thus far :)"}
{"text":"I tried this place out earlier this week with a group of fellow yelpers.

It's a small restaurant located on Parliament, near Carlton.  The decor is bright and quirky, think colourful patchwork banquet seating, birdhouses, and birch tree branches.  I really liked this place for it's kitch factor.  The menu overall was a collection of delcious sounding sandwiches, stews, steak and chicken pies and other comfort foods. 

They had a small but decent beer and wine menu and a good selection of hot teas and they also have fresh fruit juices.

The menu was bright and colourful, just like the rest of the place.  I ordered the Chicken Pot pie with salad and a side of home fried potatoes.  The pie was good, but the filling a litte dry, plus I had ordered my salad dressing on the side, which he forgot, but no worries.

I skipped dessert but a few of my fellow diners ordered the Earl Grey Creme Brulee, and seemed to enjoy, though I don't know for certain.

Our server was friendly, though a bit scattered...the place was actually packed by the time we ordered and so I can cut him some slack for that.

Overall, I liked this place, the server was friendly, the menu was good, the decor was cute and we all enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"What a beautiful and happy place to be, the owners are super nice and make you feel really welcome.
They were quick to give us menus and let us know the specials for the day.
I got the combo with the sandwich Lady K and side of lentil curried soup.
Wow the soup was avery simple soup but full of flavor and spices, i was so surprised, it was perfect for a chilly day.
And the sandwich was so delicious, all this flavors but together that i could bever imagine will work but it was an amazing new experience and delicious!
Mom got the cubanito sandwich along with the winter salad. Holyyyyyy everything was amazing.
I am so going back to this place over and over again. Their food is really wonderful as well as the atmosphere and ooohhh the washrooms are so much fun and colorful as well. You should try this place. AWESOME"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this accidentally and what a great find. The people walking out of it could have been paid, but probably just always go there as their local place and they love it so much they are willing to share it.
I think it's great they have magazines on the banquettes, and they aren't your traditional Time/Economist, but more little known ones that really had interesting articles.
I also really like their website, looks awesome and reflective of the type of place Merryberry is.
I had the \"Shane Tried\" sandwich with a generous portion of chorizo this sandwich should be tried.
Had a bite of the La Marseillais as well, I don't think as good as Shane Tried (at least for me), but well worth eating.

The service was very nice, i really like their eye glasses. 

I'd come here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem of Toronto. A unique and a very beautifully decorated place. There is a very feel good vibe inside. We went there for brunch and tried \"Build Your Own Omelet\", & \"Lady K\" sandwich. \"Build Your Own Omelet\" came with a great selection of sides. The food tasted great. The staff were super friendly that made our experience even better.  They open at 11 am, and luckily we were there early because it got full within 10 minutes of opening."}
{"text":"I finally went here with my husband for lunch.  This place has had great reviews and I live in the area so I was eager to come and try the food.  I found i a bit pricey, but I guess that's what you pay for when it's \"healthy\" items on the menu.  I ordered what I think was called the firetruck sandwich with coleslaw on the side.  The sandwich had a kick, hence the name firetruck and the coleslaw wasn't heavy or vinegary.  Just tasted a lot of flavours and was not overwhelming.  My husband had the butternut squash soup which he enjoyed but I wish they would have served it a bit hotter.  He also ordered the Quinoa salad with smoked salmon.  Now when ordering we looked at all the ingredients that came with the Quinoa but he had no idea what Quinoa was nor has ever tried it.  We just assumed it a \"name\".  - We are not healthy eaters.  Anyways.  I ate it but I don't think I can say he enjoyed it.  I don't know if I would go back....maybe in the summer to enjoy their patio and maybe try something different.  Bottom line is I was disappointed after coming.  Sometimes 4-5 stars with enough reviews is just not enough for some people."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. 
Not my favourite latte, I appreciate the space, good escape from work around the corner."}
{"text":"A surprising find in the Parliament area of downtown Toronto. Very gad to have given this suggestion a whirl.

It's a sweet space. There's nothing pretentious about it all. It's welcoming and has a rather hippy playfulness. Honestly, the decor could use a little refining but as it is it's quite entertaining.

I ordered the beirut style grilled chicken on naan bread. It was so good!  The bread it was on  was fresh and didn't take away from the deliciousness of the filling.

Definitely would recommend and go back again if ever in the area.
I read about the banana chocolate dessert. Sound incredible."}
{"text":"Came here with the yelpies to try out dinner.

The place was decorated quite quirky. It definitely has a more of a cafe feel and personally think it would make a much better brunch or lunch spot as it lacked the intimate feel for a dinner gathering.

The service was super friendly but very slow. The place was packed and they really only had one poor waiter running back and forth. The food took a long time to arrive.

Prices here are incredibly reasonable, most things are until $10, however the portions are more lunch-sized so it's all relative. 

I tried one of the weekly specials, which was a lentil stew with (or without) meatballs. It came served with some delicately light poppadom type breads. The meatballs were nicely cooked (just ever so slightly pink on the inside, just how they should be). The stew didn't wow me but it was tasty enough.

My friends all seemed to think their food was just OK. A few tried the potpies and I heard comments that they were a bit dry.

I was a huge fan on the bathrooms here, large private stalls with a sink in each, some artwork and bright paint. Me rikey."}
{"text":"The Ninja Salmon sandwich might just be the best sandwich I've ever eaten. I'm a bit sad that this place is almost 1000 miles away from home. Delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favourite places in the city. It's such a gem of a place. 

Found somewhat hidden in Cabbage Town, this french(ish) bistro serves unique, interesting, delicious food. Soups, salads, sandwiches, and burgers are the prominent items on the menu. The two times I've been i've opted for the soup and sandwich and I've never been disappointed. Both of the soups at first glance seemed to be combination of things that were a bit interesting, so to speak, but both times I've been blown away with how delicious the combinations have been. Curry zucchini and beet, ginger, lemon both tasted superb. The firetruck sandwich is fantastic. 

Besides having delicious food, the owner and staff are so friendly and accomodating. It's always a pleasure to go here and feels like you've been invited over to a friend's house for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is really relaxing and cozy. I stopped in for the first time just to cool down and get a drink and I was not disappointed! Their iced mokas are AMAZING, the atmosphere is really chill and my boyfriend and I plan on returning to try their food later as we saw some things that interested us :)"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch twice now and I decided both times to sit outside. It's beautiful outside and it almost feels like just sitting at home. Everyone is so friendly and food comes out pretty fast. 

I had the She's No Lady, a side of soup and I shared a Grace Approved the first time I went. The Grace Approved was out of this world it was so amazing I can't ever get over it. The first time I got pita bread the second I got bagette. Personally I like the pita since I get to taste more of the dip that way. The She's No Lady was great too, the bread was crisp and the salmon was amazing. I love that they used sprouts, it gave the sandwich a great taste. I'm not sure if they change the soup everyday but the first time I went, I loved the soup the second, the soup was good but it just wasn't for me. 

Overall, if you want a calm place to go for brunch or lunch or whatever, try Merry Berry."}
{"text":"My second office of choice when meeting with clients!

Very tastefully decorated, great food, light atmosphere and a great drink selection makes this a perfect place to meet with clients.  The patio out back is great in the summer to catch some sun while doing business.  Their sandwiches are top notch and my fav is la merceliea which I can never spell or pronounce.

The owners are great and provide impeccable service to make every visit pleasant...

Oh, and they also have free Internet... :)"}
{"text":"A cute place in Cabbage Town, off the beaten path a bit, but such a great vibe and decent food. Quaint, unique - it's a refresher spot."}
{"text":"A super sweet neighbourhood cafe run by lovely, friendly people, with an oasis of a patio out the back. Ignore the No Alcohol Yelp has on it, they do have a short but sweet wine and beer list and some gorgeous fruity smoothie cocktails (last time I was here, anyway)."}
{"text":"The food and service are definitely 5 stars in my book for lunch (having just spent 5 months in NYC that says a lot!).   The limited wine selection might make this a 4.5, but then again I have been to a lot of cafes in France where you only get 3 choices: red, white, or rose.  

When a restaurant has a short menu like Merryberry I get excited.  To a foody like me that sends a clear message: they want to focus on quality of ingredients, preparation, and creativity.  Merryberry succeeds on all of these.  As a unrepentant lover of veal I had the \"hamburger\" which was was dressed creatively and came in a bun that had the perfect chewy bite of hand made bread.  The style of the food is decidedly French, you choose a dish and you get it.  I love that about French inspired food - life is complicated and I prefer the chef to make decisions instead of me deciding about what I want on my burger.  In this case the flavor profile was nicely balanced.  As a side I ordered \"farm starch\" - oven roasted potatoes that will make you think twice about ever ordering deep fried potatoes again.  For desert I had lemon tart - great balance between tart and sweet and a deep flavor of fresh lemon balanced with a hint of rind in hand thrown pastry (you can tell).  Unfortunately I am just visiting or I would be planning an exploration of dinner........"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Food: 3/5
Washrooms: 5/5

I've spent lots of time in Cabbagetown but only recently stumbled upon Merryberry. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to enjoy Sunday brunch at such a quaint establishment. I enjoyed my mango and jalapeno grilled cheese sandwich, but the soup that came with it was  underwhelming. Definitely tasted a bit too broth-y for something that was sold to me as a chowder. A friend of mine got Avocado and eggs and, well... she got exactly that. Nothing fancy there, just an egg cooked into an avocado. It didn't taste bad but there wasn't much creativity to be spoken of. 

My washroom experience was a highlight. Well decorated and a cozy place to drop a decent deuce. The door was covered in chalkboard paint and there was chalk left to add little notes. One list being compiled by various poopers who passed through was \"Name your poop after a movie.\" I named mine \"A-poo-calypse Now\" which I was proud of.

Would rate this place higher if my poop experience didn't outrank my dining experience, but definitely a place that you should check out for yourself. One of the better brunch spots in the area."}

{"text":"Whimsical! That's the word to describe the helterskelter look of MerryBerry in Cabbagetown. With ashen floors on a 45, and variegated strips of decorative papers on the walls MerryBerry is a real looker, perfect for a date or small-group dinner. If you are lucky enough to sit against the wall, you are treated a bench covered with a diverse arrange of multi-colored pillows. The non-cushioned seating here resembles park benches, painted with the shadows of trees. This motif is carried on with the very real logs of birch throughout. Just for fun, striped placemats dangle from cords stretched across the ceilding, like a clown's laundry. Whee.

Foodwise there is quite a bit on the menu. Lots of lunch-like options: soups, sandwiches, burgers, etc. I had a chicken pot pie with a side of slaw and a fresh orange and apple juice. Admittedly, our party was the largest in the restaurant at six, but the food took a long time to come out. When it finally arrived a few requests were ignored, but nothing egregious. (I wanted to substitute my side salad for slaw and got it as a side instead.) In my opinion, the pot pie was good but nothing special. Kind of gentle on the flavour and too dry for my tastes. I really enjoyed the slaw however, and it was dusted with something crunchy. I think sesame? The crême brulée for dessert was phenomenal.

I think I will come back here for lunch sometime.

Obligatory Title Pun: Eat, drink and be MERRY. 

Menu Readability: Their menu is a folder full of brightly-coloured loose pages. This isn't my favourite, but the design of each page is definitely some of the best I have seen. 

Need to mention: They have a front patio.

What this place teaches me about myself: I can't not order chicken pot pie when it is on a menu."}
