{"text":"Had a b-day celebration dinner here, had heard great things about Todd's from friends, decided to give it a try, came in from out of town. We wanted a rest from the pretentiousness of the Strip restaurants for a change, and since we had rented cars, it was no problem to drive out to Todd's, only 15 minutes away from Mandalay Bay down Sunset.  The restaurant was quite busy when we arrived, for a 6:45pm reservation, and its plain to see that there are many regulars who eat here often and are greeted as old friends when they come in the door.

Half of our large party ordered the Grumpy's salads, they did not disapoint, there was just the right amount of dressing and as a previous reviewer said, those little nuggets of blue cheese hiding in the lettuce were a delightful surprise.  2 had the crab cake appetizer (2 nice sized crab cakes, minimal filler, well seasoned and very tasty!) , one had the beet salad with a grapefruit dressing, very light and refreshing and good counterpoint to the beets, and I had the spinach salad with lamb bacon, which was also nicely dressed, not heavy at all.

For entrees, 2 people had the seared scallops, 3 had the sea bass on tomato risotto, 1 each the ahi tuna, and the NY steak, and I had the short ribs.  The only disappointing entree that didn't get raved about was the NY steak, which was on the tough side, but had great flavor!.  There were several dietary issues in the group (onion allergy, dairy allergy, starch preference) which the restaurant handled with aplomb and grace.   The short ribs were melt in your mouth tender, (just a tad salty for me), and our waiter gladly swiched out the jalapeno mashed potatoes for the plain ones since I'm a spice wimp.  The fish and scallop eaters said their entrees were prepared perfectly and very yummy.

The restaurant comped 2 \"\"Todd-a-misu's\", their mini version of Tiramisu, for the two birthday boys, which was a very nice gesture from the restaurant.   For dessert, we ordered a couple of the cobbler of the day, (one peach, strawberry, raspberry), along with a slightly different one since they ran out  (apple, peach, I think)--both dishes were served with ice cream and licked clean!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has its ups and downs. The drink list is decent. Has a lot of choices. For appetizers we got the crab cakes which we thought were better than most. They get an a+ for those. We also got the goat cheese wontons which were as straight forward as they could be. Goat cheese fried in a wonton. Nothing special. We got the endive salad which wasnt bad. For the main course we got the scallops. Good. Not great. Based on all that I might have rounded up to a 4 but I have to factor in dessert which was terrible. We ordered 2. We got the mixed fruit cobbler which was a little dry and the ice cream on top was icy like it was old or melted and had been refrozen. We started with that dessert and after tasting it all in all we were disappointed. The other dessert we ordered was the \"bananas foster\". Those are my quotes, not theirs. It was the worst bananas foster we have had ever had. It had no flavor, it was runny like you were eating a soup, the bananas didnt look good. It was so bad that after taking a couple of bites and going back to the cobbler, all of a sudden the cobbler tasted delicious. I don't expect every dish at a place to be great, and this place definitely does some things right so I'm sure here it just depends on what you order."}
{"text":"I have never eaten a single bite that was not pure heaven by Chef Todd. He makes masterpieces out of every dining experience. Worth every penny and the staff is outstanding too!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Great Mothers Day brunch.  Many entrees and starters to choose from."}
{"text":"I am always in search of some hidden off the strip gems and Todds more than qualifies! When a local restaurant can stay open past 10 years you know you are doing something right! The menu has many choices but I always seem to come back for the short rib. Still one of my favorite places in the city."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week to try it out because my friends have always raved about it.
 It was very good. 
I had the petite filet medallions, goat cheese wontons  and butterscotch custard for dessert.
 Everyone I dined with also loved everything they ordered.
Great intimate dining experience and service."}
{"text":"We had our favorite meal in the Vegas area in this restaurant, significantly better than the celebrity-chef place where we dined on the strip. Each dish was refined and fascinating in its combination of ingredients, starting with the goat cheese won tons with raspberry basil sauce -- a really wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Really nice... casual with great food and service. We started with their specialty cocktails that were delicious and refreshing, followed by their goat cheese app that was so yummy. Several of us had the grilled skirt steak on-fire with the loaded fries and the sauce was really unique and spicy. Being a hot-head... would have asked for more jalepeno's, as it was slightly too mild (only in heat status, not spicy-ness) for me. The waiter was awesome, giving us the history of the chef when we asked. Split some desserts, but my favorite was the homemade buttermilk cinnamon ice cream which was not too sweet. Agree with another reviewer that the decor was outdated, but the price and quality of the food, and the fact that it was not a chain made Todd's really unique!"}
{"text":"Dreadfully overrated.  A recent dining experience at Todd's was nothing short of dreadful.  Crabcake (yes one) was tepid and mostly filler.  We shared a \"Caesar Salad\" which was two small flat plates of chopped lettuce - with little or no dressing which could not be picked up with a fork without sliding off the plate......followed by \"braised short ribs\" which were so salty they were inedible.  
The staff was inexperienced and ill-informed \"the Dungeness crab comes from the Dungeness River\"???"}
{"text":"i think this is my favorite restaurant in the state of nevada i only ate here 2 times in the last year and a half but it's  vary good  and Unique i love the skirt steak and fries i did have some disappointing soup one time but  i really  like this restaurant i wish it wasn't so far away  i Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"In the days of our ancestors, we had the choice of four salad dressings: ranch, blue cheese, thousand island, and Italian.  Our ancestors were happy and feasted upon the bounty that was placed before them.  If our ancestors were really lucky, the restaurant would toss the salad for them, and our ancestors would give thanks to the dining gods.  Fast forward several generations, and we are faced with a paradox of choice.  Our ancestors would be awed by opulence available at your neighborhood Vons.  Italian dressing?  We have low-cal, low-fat, organic, and gluten-free.  We even have Italian's more sophisticated sibling, balsamic vinaigrette, and even that comes in regular, raspberry, sugar-free, and Atkins-approved.

So what does all this have to do with Todd's Unique Cuisine?  Quite a lot.  Wolfgang Puck opened the first Spago just 25 years ago and since then, our expectations of dining have increased exponentially every year.  Dining at Todd's is like prom night.  You go in with unreal expectations that can never be met.  Todd's is good.  It's just not great.  If Todd's were located in Spokane, WA, it'd be the best restaurant in town.  However, as all things Vegas, we set the bar ridiculously high.  While Todd's mix of modern, slightly Asian-inspired fusion fare is definitely delicious, it's not exactly cutting edge any more.  If Todd's were fashion, it'd be a pair of bootcut jeans.  Just a season or two out of date.

Yes, I know I'm holding Todd's up to a ridiculous standard, but part of it probably comes from the name of the restaurant.  If it was simply called \"Todd's Cuisine\" I may have had a different experience.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  Just like prom night.

Pro: Good food, generous-sized portions
Con: Dining area away from the bar can be loud when there are large groups present.  Holding a conversation can be difficult.

Summary: As Fergie would say, it's so Two Thousand and Late"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the entire Las Vegas Valley. I haven't had anything on the Las Vegas strip or downtown that is better. Food is fresh and simple. Best Creme Brulee I have ever had. Service was excellent. My only complaint is that the booths are uncomfortable. What I really like is the variety of attire. Some people were very dressed, others were watching TV in bar area in shorts and Hawaiian shirts. I think the experience of Todd's is really what you bring to it."}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday with the wife.  Excellent food.  Great prices.  Terry our server was very helpful even with a full station.  If your in the area this place is a must."}
{"text":"Oh, yes I approached Todd's with a skeptical eye and palate!  There's nothing glamorous about the strip mall store front and the décor is clean but not LV glamorous, but the food for the prices were great!  Todd's is easily comparable to some of the pricier well known hotel restaurants but at a much more affordable price.  So, if you're truly a foodie and don't necessarily care about being seen, this is the place to dine."}
{"text":"I visited Todd's for my wife's birthday 2 weeks back. I was scptical, because I haven't been the before. I wanted to take her to Flemings, but she insisted.  The room is intimate with Cubby's that are wonderful for conversation.  We sat in a booth, and our waiter let us settle for a minute, before approaching the table. Our Server Scott was the type of server who knew exactly what kind of timing we wanted, without asking. I was relieved that we had a pro serving us and my anxiety left my body right then.  We ordered two specialty cocktails, and I think the word to use is Yum!  Scott gave some history on the restaurant, and pointed out that Todd actually does all, and I mean all the cooking every single night. Now I'm happy we chose to spend our night here, and I couldn't wait to try the food. I went with Scotts selection of the short rib with mashed potatoes. No offense mom, but these were a close second. My lovely wife had the Salmon, and she was blown away.  I asked Scott to pick a bottle of wine, and he nailed it.  You see we are in love, and we appreciate places like this. Small,Cozy,nice soft music, and great service from a true professional.  This us a dying breed in restaurants, and Todd's just became our favorite.  The Anniversary touch at dessert was done elegantly, and Scott disappeared to let us say a few words. It truly a place to dine, and I have dined everywhere. Thank You Todd for your food, Thanks to the staff for all the little things that made our night special. A special thanks to Scott for being the best server we have ever had.  Well see you again soon."}
{"text":"I had the duck - and it was amazing!!! The duck was cooked perfectly; a crisp finish with the bright red center. The entire dish has such an amazing combinations of flavors and textures. Served with butternut squash, mashed sweet potatoes, sprouts, carrots, and some other goodies. Everything flowed perfectly. 

We had the creme brûlée for dessert. Good, but to sweet for me with one flavor."}
{"text":"Truly unique and enjoyable food. I loved the watermelon salad- sweet and spicy. The marinade made the fruit a little heavier so it was more filling. I also had the scallops...amazing. Three large scallops each resting on a small bed of creamy mashed potatoes. So delicious. The bread pudding dessert was good and plentiful in size but I would definitely consider trying something else next time to mix it up. 

Must have: watermelon salad while in season. Definitely: scallops."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food. Had near perfect service and wine etiquette from the new guy Scott. Perfect place for date night and low key atmosphere. See you guys again next week hopefully."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Todd's at least four times over the last 9months. It is one of our favorite spots to bring friends and family when they come to visit. The food is always excellent, quiet/intimate setting, solid wine selection and very attentive staff.  there are some core items we see on the menu with each visit but others change so there's usually something new we can try. Currently my favorite restaurant in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Don't let this restaurant's tucked away location fool you, Todd's is the best.  I've been to plenty of fancy restaurants that on the surface are nicer than Todd's, and received food and service that come nowhere close to what you get at this small place.  The decor is a little outdated, but I guarantee you will not care once you take a bite of anything on the menu.  Go here.  Take a date.  Order everything you can afford and then tip the shit out of your server, because the service here is incredible."}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the fuss is about. The food was fine, but not exceptional by this town, and pricey to boot. Top it off with the \"better than you\" attitude from the time I called to make the reservation until the time I walked out the door...just not worth it. 

Like I said, the food was fine, so if I'm out with others adamant on dining at Todd's then I'd come again. As long as they're also paying. I work too hard for my money to spend it at this place."}
{"text":"Before our red-eye flight home, we stopped at a small restaurant off-strip called, Todd's.

For appetizers, we tried the Malaysian BBQ Shrimp, cucumber salad and johnny cakes, and the Asian dumpling pan fried soy dipping sauce. Both were relatively unimpressive. The shrimp were tasty and perfectly cooked, but the flavors did not meld well with the slightly chilled corn cakes (dry and not particularly flavorful.) The dumplings were good but nothing special.

The real surprise came with the main courses. The South African Sea Bass with artichokes and caper butter was PERFECTLY cooked, delicate, delicious and amazing enough to stand alone (I actually think the artichoke caper sauce was a bit too overpowering for such a fantastic filet of fish!) The salmon dish was phenomenal, perfectly cooked and served on a bed of sticky rice. The pan seared day boat scallops with pistachio and brown butter were also amazing, perfectly cooked, tender and sweet. The fire-grilled Kobe Skirt steak with spicy black bean and chili sauce was AMAZING. The steak was juicy, tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The chili fries were a nice pairing, and the Chinese black beans added a salty twist to this fantastic dish.

Todd's: go for the mains and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"What an absolutely amazing dining experience!  My mother and I decided to try something new, instead of all the typical chain restaurants, and I am so glad we did.  We were looking for a nice steak and seafood restaurant away fromThe Strip and my mother found this place through Yelp.  We called at 4:45 to make a reservation and we were able to get a table at 5:30pm on a Friday night.  One of the questions that was asked while making our reservation was if we were celebrating a special occasion this evening.  We weren't, but, what a nice question to be asked while making a reservation.  We arrived a few minutes early and were greeted at the door before being taken directly to our table.  The ambiance was very nice - low-lit, quiet and small (in a good way).  Our server was terrific and helped guide us through the menu.  
We started with an appetizer of calamari and shrimp.  I have never had calamari so tender and the shrimp were cooked to perfection.  The breading is flavorful, but not overpowering, and not at all greasy.  The chipotle dipping sauce wasn't even necessary - I used just a squeeze of lemon.  
When ordering, out server asked if we would like to split a salad.  What a perfect idea!  We split the house salad that included cucumber and tomato with assorted greens and a perfect raspberry vinaigrette.  I don't usually eat salads with any dressings at all, but I enjoyed this one.
I ordered the sea bass with tomato risotto and asparagus and my mother ordered the sea scallops with mashed potatoes in a pistachio-mushroom sauce.  The sea bass was exquisite, perfectly cooked and I thought the tomato risotto was a terrific compliment.  I didn't enjoy the asparagus, but that was just me and the fact that asparagus is out-of-season. I'm sure most people will enjoy the smokey flavor, I just wasn't a fan.  My mother's scallops were seared beautifully and the accompanying sauce and potatoes were also enjoyed. 
We decided to share a dessert and ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla and raspberry sauces and added vanilla ice cream a la mode.  The cake was warm and rich and perfectly paired with the sauces and the ice cream.  We both wanted to lick our plates clean.   
The portions were just right at Todd's - not too heavy - and we walked out full, but not uncomfortably so.  Appetizers, salads and desserts run $6-$14, with entrees $25-$40, so expect to pay about $100 for 2, unless you order from the prix fixe.  This is not a child-friendly environment, so don't bring the kids.  There are no high chairs, booster seats or kids menus.  
The food, service and ambiance were all fantastic at this unassuming location in one of the numerous strip malls around Las Vegas.  I highly recommend Todd's!"}
{"text":"We had a very good dinner there.  The wine list is nicely varied, although one wine we ordered was replaced with a different vintage to which the waiter responded with a shrug.  The portions were quite large and the flank steak was delicious, although it burns off your taste buds, so you can't really taste anything else.  The waiter was knowledgable and friendly, and not cranky even though we stayed for hours.  It was a fun night."}
{"text":"We like to dine at Todd's on special occasions, therefore we try to invent some additional special occasions. We love the food and dining experience and will continue to dine with them.

I usually get the grilled skirt steak with the chili cheese fries and black bean sauce, which is incredible. The Kobe steak is to die for and who can pass up the goat cheese wantons??? 

We also dined during a food and wine event, which was an incredible evening with wineries and each coarse was pared with the various wines.

The atmosphere is cozy. Don't let the \"dated\" comments scare you. The place is clean and kept up nicely. The food is great and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Let me say that while my main course at Todd's was the best I had during my recent Vegas vacation, the dining experience was not without disappointments. The first negative experience of the evening was the rubbery calamari that was part of our fried calamari and rock shrimp appetizer. The spicy aioli sauce could have used more spice, but that would not have made up for the rubbery calamari. The rock shrimp were tender and delicious, making the calamari even more disappointing. The dessert menu was another let down for a restaurant with unique in the name. We wanted to get excited for a dessert, but my date and I did not see anything that spoke to us. 
Now for the positive. My Ahi Tuna with Wasabi mashed potatoes was divine. The soy garlic butter sauce perfectly complemented the exceptionally prepared tuna and fabulous Wasabi mashed potatoes. Todd's masterful Ahi Tuna is the reason I'm giving them four stars. I'll definitely be back again for the tuna, but I think I'll try the goat cheese wontons instead of the calamari."}
{"text":"Todd's is a hidden gem! Who would think such a wonderful place would be right off Sunset. We have been here a few times but I am writing my review off our recent trip on 9/8/14.

Todd's is a very small place so make sure to have reservations before coming. On arrival we ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It was probably the best calamari I've ever had they spice it perfectly and it did not have any of that rubbery chew you might find at other places. I highly recommend this appetizer. 

For dinner I went with there special of the night Alaskan king crab. Now this isn't just king crab its fresh king crab that had never been frozen. The taste was divine! the order was supposed to come with about a pound of crab the server told us. I received at least 3 king crab legs so much more then a pound. My wife chose to have the halibut and shrimp risotto, she said it was very tasty though the crab was better. 

For desert we went with a blueberry and coconut apple cobbler. This desert is big enough to share and finished the night off perfectly.

If you want good food without leaving the Henderson area I can't recommend this place enough. Always something new on the menu to try and everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Located on Sunset Road just a few blocks from where we live in Henderson, Todd's Unique Dining is an oasis of excellence in the desert of chain-restaurant mediocrity at this end of the Las Vegas valley. They specialize in steak and seafood, with an ever-changing menu that focuses on seasonal freshness and strong technique to create some really wonderful dishes.

The staff is friendly and attentive, with a thorough knowledge of their menu and drink selections.

The decor at Todd's Unique Dining is simple, straightforward, and elegant. I wouldn't call it bland, because every detail speaks of craftsmanship, but it doesn't draw attention to itself. Nor does it detract from the overall experience. Like everything at Todd's Unique Dining, it strikes a perfect balance on the palate.

Always order the night's special, which on my latest visit was the Guadalajara Hanger Steak, served medium rare. Marinated with a tangy blend of spices and grilled with a deft touch that created a crunchy, flavorful crust while keeping the center of the steak moist and juicy with just the right amount of chewiness, this steak was beefy perfection.

It was accompanied by a generous helping of polenta that had been seasoned with green onions and lashings of sriracha that gave the creamy side-dish real bite while still allowing it to fulfill its function as a sop for those precious drippings from the steak.

My date had Todd's pork tenderloin with granny smith apple glaze. It's an elegant version of a favorite comfort food, with the moist pork seasoned very nicely and the glaze adding a nice note of tart sweetness. Her mashed potatoes came laced with caramelized onions, adding another layer of sweetness, though this was leavened somewhat by the tang of the onion. A lesser chef could have cooked those onions to near tastelessness or left them too raw and biting, but, as you've probably gathered, Todd knows what he's doing.

Dessert was a shared apple cobbler. The cobbler was, of course, delicious with a thick, brown-sugar crust that quickly quieted my normally-raging sweet tooth. But the real coup de grace of this dish was the scoop of homemade cinnamon gelato that topped it. It was very nearly too much, but we couldn't resist. We descended on it like we hadn't eaten all day.

In all, a really wonderful evening. We'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  The service is great.  They always seem to have a great wine special that doesn't kill the wallet.  The food is so consistently good.  

The Skirt Steak on Fire is my go to.  I always say I want to try something different, but it's rare that I order something else."}
{"text":"I love Todd's.  The five stars is for the food, drinks, and service.  The cocktails are served strong, Ahi Tuna is always fresh, and service is always top notch.  However, don't let the cheesy decor or location deter you from trying Todd's.  They have the best food in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service and better food. The braised short ribs are the best thing I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype about this place. First off the atmosphere is that of a retirement home. A pink flamigo holding a wine bottle at the bar?  Goofy decor! Booths are uncomfortable. I'm not sure what was going on but the staff seemed depressed. (Bartender was very personable and charming) My waiter was nice but kinda creepy and depressed. The matronly head waitress seemed very upset we could hear them from our booth by the kitchen. (Noisy high traffic area)Next time maybe they should consider arguing behind closed doors away from diners              

Food was good for the most part. The goat cheese wontons seemed better as a dessert than a first course. Too sweet. Skirt steak was chewy but had a good bean sauce. Loved the tuna but the short rib was predictable. Apparently you can't get potatos instead of rice with mahi mahi beacause our waiter doesn't want to get \"yelled at\"  Poor selection of wines by the glass."}
{"text":"I havent been here in a few years. Just came in tonight. Not impressed - food was average. Nothibg special."}
{"text":"It's actually 4.5.I had the short rib and my wife had the filet. Both were very good and we will be back. Knocked off the half star because the vegetables were soso and lack of glueten free options."}
{"text":"In Henderson for a convention. Tried Todd's and was not disappointed.  I tried the flank steak and fries.  Really cleared my sinuses.

My wife enjoyed her salmon

An enjoyable dining experience in an unexpected strip mall location.

Make sure to make reservations!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Todd's--and loved it--about 6 times, so I feel it's about time I wrote a review to support this (consistently!) excellent restaurant.

I guess the best way to describe the menu is to say that every dish tastes like the best version of your favorite food, but with one or two surprising and delightful additions. For example, lots of places have calamari as an app, but Todd's adds just a smidge of chipotle chili for a kick that never overpowers.

The watermelon salad is also not to be missed--don't think about the listed ingredients--just have faith and order it. You will not be sorry.

The menu changes, and there's usually a couple of special entrees, but you can always count on a nice cross section of seafood, poultry, and red meat, as well as a gluten free and veggie option. My husband almost always gets whatever risotto is featured because it's always fantastic. I tend to surf around--moist yet crispy duck, short ribs with jalapeno mashed potatoes, seared scallops, meatloaf with wild mushroom gravy--but I've never had any dish that was less than wonderful.

If you want to impress a client or a new crush with truly good food, you simply cannot go wrong here. Don't let the strip mall location deter you.

Seating tip: if you can, get a table. The booths are rather uncomfortable, and the pattern is vintage 1985.

Last tip--the French Kiss cocktail is yummy--and even makes the booth bench pretty comfy once you've had one!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for dinner in the Henderson area, The only thing keeping me from a five star rating is the booths. they are very uncomfortable. But , the food is fantastic. It seems that Todd does fish dishes the best. And the menu always is changing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me with dinner to Todd's on Valentine's Day! It was a great surprise and even better food! The service was great and the waitress had made some recommendations for wine pairing and they were all great.  We had a nice intimate table and was a great ending to our night!"}
{"text":"The skirt steak on fire and seared tuna were amazing. Easily one of the best meals we've had in Vegas and very reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Not a \"regular\" but have been coming for anniversaries for years.

The food is so good that I don't care that the female owner isn't very pleasant and that Service is kinda slow.

Guests always \"Unique\" I've seen celebrities and politicians here a few times.

This is not a dive or hole in the wall. Just a quaint, quiet spot with excellent food."}
{"text":"Small place that I would easily overlooked if not for Yelp.  It is really worth try if you are in the area.  The food is skillfully prepared in a small family style location.  I would recommend Todd's for a date night due to it's atmosphere and skillfully prepared menu.  I would not recommend for kids."}
{"text":"The sous chef at Todd's Unique Dining is my boyfriend, Jeremy...so this may be a bit biased. But just a bit, since the first & only time I ate there was on one of our first dates about a year and a half ago. I remember the wontons and halibut I ordered were great. And Jeremy's favorite...the skirt steak, was fantastic. The short ribs must be awesome, because when Jeremy makes 'em at home they're MEAN! I hear this place has a ton of local regulars, some who come more than once a week. They also have a wine dinner one Sunday a month. Hopefully my boyfriend will get a day off so I can eat there again (I doubt it)."}
{"text":"One crab cake appetizer is $11 for one small cake - pretty tastey but not a great value.  We had halibut and ono entrees.  Neither fish entree was overly impressive in flavor - could have used a sauce or prepared with more seasonings.  The biggest disappointment though was the sparse servings of vegetables with each entree - you would have thought veggies were the most expensive ingredient of these meals.  The service was top notch - as good as it gets.  The food however wasn't impressive enough to get me back."}
{"text":"Scallops, skirt steak, goat cheese wontons, peach cobbler, and a Grey Goose Orange Cosmo. These are my favorites so far at Todd's! My husband and I have been here a total of 3 times, and have loved every meal. Tried the sea-bass last night: which was very good, but a little heavy on the salt.  I'm still wanting to try the duck and the short rib, both look very good! Plan on being back soon, it's our favorite special neighborhood place."}
{"text":"What a terrible restaurant! Between the awful decor, food that might have been impressive in the 80's and the sense of strange entitlement from the service staff will make me stay away, FOREVER!. This weird sports bar dive, across the street form a KFC mind you, was not only dated and uninspired but dirty. If you are able to get past the slop on your plates, stay out of the restrooms, and probably the kitchen for that matter. The big blonde older waitress was the cherry on top for our evening. She talked down to everyone around her, including us, ordered people around and seemed pushy and uninterested in the matter at hand, us. I've never been around such a disrespectful group of staff before nor will I ever again! Save yourself the time and money on the over-priced food, but if you want a good laugh, pop in for a to go menu and you'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"It's around the corner from our house, and the outside is pretty plain. So we were skeptical at first... until we opened the door. Inside was small, 2 separated dining area, christmas songs were playing back to back on the radio, and it looked cozy. Friendly hostesses and waiters welcomed us, and brought us the menu of the day. It seems like the menu changes daily? We ordered Cioppino which was soup of the day, fried calamari, fish (I forgot what it was, it was dish of the day), and short ribs. We loved the way chef uses his spices and herbs... Every dish was truly UNIQUE, delicious, plenty to share, and reasonably priced. We'd definitely repeat."}
{"text":"This was our 4th or 5th time at Todd's. We like it, especially their scallops when they're on the menu.

So, I'll start with the seating and service. We were seated next to the bar -an undesirable location, especially since the restaurant was not very busy.

The service is usually stellar but fell short this time with very slow table-clearing, and a very slow initial drink order.

We enjoyed the crab cake and Asian dumping appetizers, the fish chowder was very tasty, and my wife and son's fish main course was very well prepared. I tried the meatloaf, and was disappointed to discover that the middle of each slice was undercooked (making it very chewy and slightly off-putting). We also felt that the seasoning used on the garnish (curry ?) to be completely wrong for the dishes.

This is the first time we've ever been disappointed by any aspect of dinning at Todd's. As this is my first review of the establishment I'm giving it 4stars based on past experiences and current disappointment. We will be back, but a lot hinges on the next visit."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week at Todd's Unique.

This evening we had dinner at Todd's Unique Dining, 4350 East Sunset Road, Henderson, NV 89014. You can make a reservation for lunch or dinner by dialing 702-259-TODD (8633) or take a look at their very informative web page at www,toddsunique, com .

We arrived about ten minutes early for our appointed time at 6:30 PM. We were greeted by the Hostess Chelsea who seemed to know just who we were even though this was our first experience at Todd's. 

Although small, the restaurant was well set up, clean, and conducive to a fine dining experience. Once we were settled at our table our Server, Terry was there to get us beverages and chat. The menu folder held the menu created by Todd for the 02/27 to 03/03 time period and a separate menu of his offerings for the Restaurant Week Charity Event. 

We were there for the Restaurant Week Experience. Each year we choose a different restaurant to try for this usual fall event. This year the need by \"Three Square Food Bank\" was such that a decision was made to offer a spring dining week also.


From the \"special\" menu we chose:

FIRST COURSE:

Grumpy's Salad

Cream of Heirloom 

SECOND COURSE:

Roast Prime Rib of Pork; Apple Pan Sauce and Sausage Stuffing 

Filet Medallions with Wild Mushroom Cabernet

THIRD COURSE:

Hazelnut Crème Brûlée

Salted Butterscotch Pudding

                                                                 **********

Dinner of these wonderful sounding items was spectacular. Libby started with the Cream of Heirloom tomatoes. What a beautiful concoction of deep tomato flavor with a smooth light cream finish. My \"Grumpy's\" salad was a classic wedge of lettuce salad with a twist. The lettuce was shredded; there was some diced tomato, and a little onion all mixed together with wonderful blue cheese crumbs. This was piled high on an icy cold plate. Our Server Terry used a big wooden grinder to insure I had enough fresh cracked pepper to satisfy me.

After we lazed over our first course Terry and Laura (hope I got this right) presented us with our main courses. We dove in to this repast first tasting our own plates and then on to each other's. The best thing to say is everything was a palate delight. Libby's medallions of beef were cooked perfectly and so tender that you could by pass chewing and just roll your tongue to bring out the outstanding texture and flavor. My roasted pork (huge) was grilled to perfection, juicy and wound through a myriad of flavors that questioned every taste bud in my mouth. I am still astounded by the mixtures of tastes that one bite could bring bouncing through my mouth. Glorious vegetables that were lightly cooked using different methods to produce texture and flavor explosions adorned our plates. I truly enjoyed the red cabbage with its crunchy and unusual components kept me excited for more. Libby ate her baby carrot and mine too. She also had a homemade and hot potato chip that was crunchy and pleasingly warm. My wonderful wife ate her own baked tomato and the speared mine right off my plate. At least she smiled at me as she finished the little beauty while I pined my existence. There were other veggies but I am just leaving them alone. They were texturally and flavor right. They got eaten too.

Now, let's talk desert. The Hazelnut Crème Brûlée was thick and rich with a whipped cream atop. An enticing blue berry and raspberry insured that the looker put a spoon to it. My Salted Butterscotch Pudding was absolutely worth going in to battle to get again. Nestled into a clear glass was a scoop of dangerously tan and creamy butterscotch pudding. Around this ball of fun was a thick almost honey like caramel syrup and a dab of cream fluff that accented the whole artistry. With my first spoonful I ensured that I had pudding, caramel, and topping. The whole thing caught me off guard. I had forgotten the salt. Pudding and cream mix enveloped my every taste bud and as this mixture began to disintegrate I was hit by the salty and sweet aftermath like I had just taken a low right to the jaw. I have never tasted anything like this. It was an amazing creation. I hope I can get it as an entrée sometime.

That's it. Go to Todd's Unique. Feel well cared for and well fed. You will leave after your lunch or dinner thinking only about the next visit you will schedule"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. We were there last night, party of 8. Our server was so great we never wanted for anything. Always a step ahead. Appetizers were fantastic (she recommended a taster platter) it was perfect as a starter. Everyone's meal was perfect. I had scallops and half of my wife's short ribs. Then cinnamon ice cream to finish it all off."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far my husband and I's favorite. It's always delicious, consistent, the atmosphere is perfect and the staff is amazing, never had one bad experience and have dined there several times over the past few years. My favorite is the short rib but there's not one bad thing on their menu!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit.
We had a party of 5 and wanted to get away from the strip.  Service was great very attentive. Food outstanding in taste and presentation.  The wine was a little pricey but good selection.  We will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"I had the meatloaf and the flavor was very flat.   Spice needed!!  My wife had the swordfish steak with a curry sauce.  The swordfish was under cooked and the sauce had a very strong curry taste.  Service was above average and martini's with blue cheese olives were tasty! Nothing special here, especially since the meatloaf was $26."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice atmosphere. Cool vibe."}
{"text":"Visited on 3 May, 2016 - party of two.  This is how a restaurant should be.  Shayne was our waiter, and he was extremely personable and professional.  All employees were spot on.  The food was as good as reported.  Wife had the scallops, I had the skirt steak.  We also had the wontons (very tasty), and salads.  Total bill was under $100, and this price point is so much better than what can be found on the strip that it isn't funny.  I should have returned a few days later but made a mistake of going to a disappointing dinner elsewhere - for more money!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the food is excellent.  To start I had the crab Ames, which have to be among the best I've had anywhere.  I had the short ribs (not something I normally eat) and it was delicious.  Service was friendly and timely.  I'd definitely comes back here again if I'm ever in Vegas again."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Todd's since they opened.  When I lived in Vegas, I would send all of my nightclub clients there when they were looking for some of the best dining in town.  Now that I live in California and STILL send anyone headed to Vegas there!   Todd's keeps an awesome menu with a great rotation on specials, and the wine list is superb.  Speaking of, you won't find better wine dinners in town, nor a more flexible menu to work with your wines.  The corkage fee is beyond reasonable, and they even waive it on Wednesdays (call to make sure this is still the case).   Of all the restaurant's in town, Todd's is the best for any oenophile on or off the strip.  There might not be a 5-story high wine cellar that requires repelling to pull a half-century aged chateauneuf-du-pape, but if you want great food that goes with great wine, all presented with great service, Todd's is the spot."}
{"text":"John Curtas' pick for best on the East side... need I say more?  Okay, it behooves any foodie to try Todd's if you have any integrity.  It is a delightful joint with an honest and talented chef in the kitch...check it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This small restaurant did provide a solid meal but there are some opportunities. The dining room is a touch small and not in a good intimate way but more of a one obnoxious diner can ruin your night kind of way! The booths are super upright and wouldn't allow for a slow leisurely dinner which is a bit disappointing considering the comfort level of the offerings! Service was good...I found the braised short rib a touch salty and could describe it as a churched up mimis cafe pot roast and for the price point expected more. Basically ok but nothing to write home about..."}
{"text":"A great restaurant in a strip center, truly outstanding food.  The beer is eclectic and fun to explore, the wine list, according to my friends, is outstanding.

The food and service are superb.  Todd creates masterpieces, from appetizers to main courses through desserts.  It is hard to describe...you should just experience Todd' Unique Dining, a hidden gem."}
{"text":"My favorite local spot in Vegas!  We always have excellent service and top notch cuisine!  We've never had anything we didn't love. 

Try the goat cheese won-tons, the duck, grilled skirt steak on fire,  and any of his specials.  Have to save room for the snickerdoodle bread pudding.  To die for! 

Todds special Reserve Wine list and Scotch selection is hard to top as well!  Definitely rivals the high end restaurant's on the Strip.  

We have brought a couple dozen people to Todd's and everyone walks away extremely surprised at the quality of food and the experience overall."}
{"text":"Ok -- several trips to Todd's later and he still doesn't disappoint. Extremely attentive service by Todd's wife, attentive bussing (bread, water, etc.), still one of the most approachable and reasonably priced wine lists in town, and a well executed menu. 

These are the reasons we've been patronizing Todd's for 10 years. 

We ate at Giada's earlier in the week and while it was fairly good, the bill was twice as expensive as Todd's, and the service was a little more impersonal. This is another reason to patronize a local chef's restaurant over the big strip joints."}
{"text":"Todd's intrigued me from the first I saw it when staying at the Residence Inn nearby. Finally went to dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday and it exceeded our high expectations. The \"goat's cheese\" (sic) wontons were exceptional, Caesars salad  was beyond the ordinary, the seared scallops and meat loaf (funny we should get the meatloaf but the description was THAT good), and the wine selections mouth watering. Total bill including drinks was $125. Paid more than double that on the strip for more crowd and noise but not better food."}
{"text":"Todd's is a classic! If you haven't been here then know that Todd himself makes all of the food! the service is great here and the food is spectacular. We didn't make a reservation, but it seemed like the majority of people walking in did. My husband and I ordered all of the specials for the night and two caesar salads. We had the Lobster Crusted Steak and Razor Clams with Creme Brulee for dessert. They also have a great wine selection and full bar. I had a patron margarita and my husband had a martini both of which were outstanding. 

The service was top notch. Our server was so friendly and had us giggling at the table. First glance at this place and you wouldn't think it would be anything special, but the service and food will blow you away."}
{"text":"We kicked off Spring Restaurant Week with dinner at Todd's Unique. I was told years ago this place is a neighborhood gem and I figured it was about time we gave it a try. We had reservations for a five at 6:30. We arrived a bit early and there was no room at the bar so we went to the Coyote Cafe next door for drinks. They had old school video poker and ice cold Modelo Especial. 

When we returned to Todd's they prepped our table and we were promptly seated. We made our selections and nibbled on bread while we waited for the first course. Each of us chose the Sweet Corn Ravioli with Chipotle Sauce to start. It was tasty but very rich. 

For entrees, two orders of Filet Medallions with Wild Mushroom Cabernet were had, one with the lobster tail for $20 supplement. There were also two orders of Prime Rib of Pork with Apple Pan Sauce and Sausage Stuffing. And I had Grilled Steelhead with Meyer Lemon Aioli, and Toasted Cous Cous. I was told the lobster tail was very good, those that had the filet were happy. The pork was decent, but overcooked. My trout seemed to be one of the better choices, I enjoyed it.

Majority of us had the Hazelnut Creme Brulee for dessert. Myself included, even though I generally do not like creme brulee. It was the hazelnuts sold me. I did not regret my choice. There was also an order of Vanilla Ice Cream and Butterscotch Pudding which was too sweet for my liking.

The food was solid, but nothing blew me away. It doesn't rival options on the strip, but it's good to support the little guy and you can stretch your dollar at Todd's. Long lulls between courses was the weakest link. It was no fault of the wait staff, they were attentive, the kitchen must have been in the weeds. I think they were overwhelmed by the restaurant week crowd. At least, I hope that was the excuse."}
{"text":"Really?  4 stars?  Ok, I did think the food was good, and the service was better.  But I've been to this restaurant under it's several incarnations -- why did they leave the furniture the same?  The chairs are horribly uncomfortable, and the booths are worse (straight backs, hard bottoms, DREADFUL).  It's very hard to enjoy the good food when all you want to do it leave because you're so uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Todd's Unique Dining is a 5 star restaurant hands down.  It is a must for any Henderson resident to at least experience this restaurant one time.
  For the quality of food it is worth every penny and then some.  

Appetizer: Don't play around and just get the crab.  Do not share!

Main course: Too good!  Always have the short ribs; never a disappointment.  The jalapeño mashed potatoes are definitely a unique creation.

Dessert: For as good as the main course the selection of desserts lack imagination but are not horrible.  Good luck.

Make sure to call ahead 
 Get extra bread.
  And order Mission Hill dessert wine (special treat)."}
{"text":"I find Todd's UDR very sexy.  It just feels like it.  Very intimate and romantic.  The food portions are small but very good.  They serve really good wine."}
{"text":"A Henderson gem.  Scallops are wonderful (my favorite).Got the bread pudding last night, and finished it off for breakfast this morning. Always outstanding service and a nice atmosphere.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Finally I had a chance to eat at Todd's. I just thought it was OK. I had the short rib, which is a cut of meat I usually go for. Although the flavor was good, it was dry. It was definitely overcooked. My friend's piece, on the other hand, was so fatty that only half of it was meat. The jalapeño mashed potatoes that went with it weren't bad, but the portion was small. The service was not the greatest. The female waitress was borderline curt and never smiled. She actually seemed a bit impatient & mainly looked at my friend when talking. Worst yet I told Todd when he called to confirm my reservation that it was a birthday celebration. They did nothing about it when we were there. I don't see myself going back, and the menu selection was too small."}
{"text":"We left the zipline at Bootleg Canyon very hungry in the early evening for some dinner in Boulder City. We looked online for a place nearby that served seasonal local ingredients in their cooking,  We  found great reviews online for Todd's.  It was a cozy little restaurant, nicely decorated with generally good food. Two people in our party ordered the marinated skirt steak with chili cheese fries, It was very tasty and spicy. Our daughter who is gluten free enjoyed the Duck very much and even found a delicious flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  I had the Sea Bass and it was very tasty with a delicious sauce.  The long island iced tea was made just right for my husband.  I tried a Spanish pinot noir which was good enough for 2 glasses.  The service was very good and all in all it was a good Off the Vegas Strip meal, so much more reasonable."}
{"text":"Locals' spot to hang with your bartender and favorite waitress...very small venue,  some might say cozy.  Friendly service but it does take a while to get your food.  This is not The Cheesecake Factory people,  their kitchen is small and the food is not half-prepared like the chain restaurants out there.  Relax.  

Great beet salad and goat cheese wonton app.   The signature entree is the braised short rib : Perfection on a plate. 

Wine list is decent too..."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first experience at Todds. Sadly it will be my last.
First, the booth was very uncomfortable which I thought was very odd. It seemed to be pushing me towards the table. Was not comfortable throughout the whole experience. My companion ordered a salad with no onions. Well there were onions in the salad and when she brought it up to the server, the server argued with her before bringing her another salad. My companion had the duck entrée which she said was very good. I had the filet minion, I ordered it medium well toward the well side. When I received  it, it was more rare to the medium side. When I brought it to the servers attention he  gave me a look and said well I'm not going to argue with you. Then he asked me it I just wanted him to take the steak back or the whole plate????????? I finally got my steak back and although it was better it was no where near what I would have called medium well to the well side. I did not finish the steak but asked for a small piece of tin foil to wrap it up for my dog, the server then brought it back in a box. Did I stutter? I eat out in fine restaurants frequently and was not impressed at all by the wait staff. Throughout the whole meal I felt that the servers and cooks served what they thought I should want and not what I wanted. I also thought the servers had a very snooty attitude and that alone is a reason I will not go back. Food was ok but I've had better in a casino."}
{"text":"Was taken here by my date who had been referred to try Todd's out by another foodie friend. What an amazing experience we had from first walking in the door to leaving. Everyone is friendly and the atmosphere was nice and quaint. 
Amazing food... The Goat cheese Wontons were delicious, The Sea Scallops melted in my mouth and oh my the desserts. The make all there own desserts in the restaurant  even the whipped cream is fresh and homemade.  Todd's has a very nice selection of wines and other libations to indulge in.  We had the pleasure of chatting with Todd's wife and what a sweetheart she was. WE will definitely be back some day.   A total hidden gem that I am glad I got to experience."}
{"text":"I do not know how they have such high reviews?! The hostess was rude, not a very good first impression. Food is okay but there are much better places to eat in Henderson/Vegas. Not worth your money. We had the halibut, skirt steak, and tuna.  Halibut was good not great. Skirt steak with cheese fries was just meh. Tuna was fresh but sinewy I couldn't cut through it with a knife and  beware it's more like eating sashimi.  It was just barely seared on one side and completely raw on the other side and it was served with very salty sauce surrounding the wasabi potatoes.  The dish surprised me because of the way it was \"cooked\" I feel like the waitress should have explained that when she introduced it to us as a special. The waitress was nice but not very attentive, no water refills. Ambience in the restaurant is very dated."}
{"text":"We've been loving on Todd's for years and last night was no exception. A flawless meal, start to finish, with top-notch attentive service from the entire staff. Chef Todd serves up the best Ahi in all of Vegas, beautifully rare and moistly flavorful nestled on a bed of wasabi mash, bam! Salmon was brilliant and perfectly done; spinach quinoa cranberry salad went to the next level with the addition of roasted butternut squash, addictive. Always a splendid wine list, something for all tastes and pocketbooks. Check out this neighborhood gem for a gourmet dining experience you'll treasure!"}
{"text":"Todd's Unique Dining is our \"go to\" to celebrate everything.  I love the atmosphere and everything about the place.  It is my very favorite restaurant in our valley and it is so close to our house.  We celebrated my birthday there on Aug 7 and it was fun.

{"text":"We drove out of our way to try this place at my hubby's recommendation because he saw it listed on a food blog somewhere, and figured the 'unique' aspect would be interesting. We found this unassuming restaurant tucked as part of a larger strip mall away from the usual tourist traps and the noise of the Strip, and settled in for a quiet family dinner.

The service was really very friendly and obliging, so there are no complaints there. The food was solid with no apparent missteps in presentation, portions or taste. The problem is that I just couldn't find anything really inventive or unique about the entrees. Duck, steak, short ribs all presented in pretty traditional fashions. I admit though I am comparing this based on restaurants in the Tri-State Area. If a restaurant in NYC or even my area of NJ calls themselves unique as part of its name, they would really need to do something off the beaten path to earn that adjective, and in my opinion that aspect was definitely missing in our dining experience here. I am not from the Henderson area, however, so maybe the standards are different.

It was a good meal, but rather much like a meal at a standard Italian or American restaurant on the East Coast. I'm glad I tried the restaurant as a tourist, but doubt I would go out of my way to return since as a tourist I have limited time to try everything. I'm sure that it would be a nice place for regulars and locals."}
{"text":"FInally, Restaurant Week gets me to Todd's.  The prix fixe menu had all great options.  If this food was an indication of their regular quality, then I will certainly be back and would readily recommend this venue to anyone.  I like the idea behind changing the menu around weekly.seasonally as ingredients available change.  It's all well thought out and worked around nature.  The food was all prepared well and was delicious."}
{"text":"The service was great and it was a unique dining experience. The ahi tuna dish and curry soup were really good :)"}
{"text":"Our server: Ryan
Our appetizers: Sweet potato Samosas & Dungeness Crab cake with curry sauce. 
Salad: Caesar Salad
Entrée: Short Ribs & Grilled Skirtsteak
Dessert: Marshmallow Creme Brûlée 

We made a reservation since it was recommended by their site. Since we went on a Monday at 5:15pm we didn't feel it was needed. 

Our server Ryan was simply put wow! Extremely knowledgeable and very attentive. Excellent polite server. 

Appetizers: the crab cakes melted in our mouth, we were wondering about the curry sauce before ordering but it went with it perfectly! Why haven't more places done this is beyond me!!
Ever so slightly disappointed about \"samosas\" I am Pakistani and well you can steal a name and then make it into any shape you want while using the same concept as Indian/Paki food. Samosas are supposed to be a triangle! But it was so delicious and again surprised that us Indian/paki people haven't given this a go.

Salad: so I read a review that compared it to Pizza Hut Caesar salad. Last I checked Pizza Hut won't know what Parmesan flakes are, let alone to have the brain to bake the flakes making them crunchy!!! Yes crunchy parm flakes, genius! Also we have decided after eating the delicious Caesar salad that white balsamic dressing is going to become a staple in our home! 

Entrees: fiancé had the short ribs they were delicious we share our food with each other both thought it was scrumptious.
Skirtsteak was extremely tender though like other reviews mentioned I was not at all found of the sauce it came with. It's just odd tasting, smelling...not a fan. I ate the steak skipping the sauce as much as possible. 

Dessert: now confessions of a sweet tooth, I can and have eaten 6-7 Creme brulees in one sitting (Wynn Las Vegas Buffet) I have also eaten Creme brûlée at many many restaurants from fanciest to mediocre and I can honestly tell you this was the most delicious Creme brûlée EVER!!! 

We loved the ambiance, we loved the service, and most of all we loved the food. This place isn't pricey, considering level of quality service and food. If this restaurant ever moved to the Strip it could literally charge 50 for the same item they charge $26 for.

Also the guy who suggested using a table scrapper please don't bring your bougieness to this place we can survive a meal with a simple wipe down between each meal (which they did)"}
{"text":"Todd's Unique Dining, its just like everything else.. we joked.

Fortunately it is quite a bit better than that.  It is in a strip mall, so that seems a bit odd and can be a bit of a turn off, but the food was quite good.

I ordered the Teriyaki Halibut and was not disappointed with the taste.. But these are \"Gourmet\" portions, so don't expect to end up with a plateful like Hash House A Go Go or somewhere on the strip.  This doesn't count against them, but it is something to keep in mind.  I honestly wish there had been more rice with my dish, but I had no complaints with the taste.  My friend did get the signature item which seems to be the \"Grilled Skirtsteak \"ON FIRE\"\" and it was very good! I would certainly recommend that to anyone who hasn't been here.

For dessert the better half and I shared the Nutella Creme Brulee which was tasty, but  our friends got the Chocolate Hazelnut Dome which was delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant is soooo good. This is the place to go for a fine dining type of night. The restaurant is nothing fancy but the food is amazing..."}
{"text":"Great local find! Beef carpaccio was pre-plated and refrigerated, and sliced so thinly that it was nearly a paste. Out of tuna entree, but the short rib and duck entrees were outstanding. Reasonable prices, easy parking. Will return again."}
{"text":"There is nothing more depressing than a Friday Happy Hour after a long week at work that is anything but a happy experience. 

Came with a group of my girlfriends after seeing that Todds had a great happy hour advertised on their website. Not only did the bartender cut the happy hour thirty minutes short as advertised, but it was more than apparent that the owner, Terry, wanted us out of there. 
Keep in mind, we are all professional young adults and were not loud or obnoxious by any means. The owner had an agenda that she wanted the staff to take care of \"regulars\" and disregard new business. It was insulting.

Several women in our group were neglected and forgotten about, we did not receive our food at the same time, orders were forgotten, and my friends credit card was charged five times. While I have no strong opinions about the food, either good or bad, we will not be back because of the service. With 7 diverse women working in different career fields and being well-connected within the Las Vegas Community from Boulder City to Summerlin, word of mouth travels quickly Ms. Terry and I am pretty sure there will not be any recommendations coming out of our mouths."}
{"text":"I was turned on to this place by a friend a few years ago and have been spreading the word ever since. In typical Vegas fashion, this gem is tucked away in a strip mall. The food is absolutely amazing. My favorite is the Goat Cheese Wontons and the Braised Short Rib with jalapeno mashpotatoes! Too die for! Ive also had a great Thanksgiving dinner as well there. Sign up for their email and you receive notices about special dinner and wine tasting parties they have!!! Great great place!"}
{"text":"Everything was top notch here except for the seating experience.  Arrived 10 min early for our OpenTable.com reservation and was told there would be a 10-15 min wait.  I noticed within view that there was a table right in front of the door avail.  I figured that someone would be sitting there within the next couple of minutes and brushed it off.  20 min later (after waiting outside) I peeked in the door just to wonder if that table was occupied and it wasn't.  Being Valentine's Day I didn't want to cause a scene and just noted it for this review.  When we finally got called 10 min later (and 15 late for our reservation and after waiting outside by ourselves) we were cheerfully called in. On our way to our booth we noticed another unoccupied table.  Now I genuinely appreciate the booth but having not been given the option of sitting at one of the tables (she could've asked us if we'd rather wait for a booth) we were left to wait outside.  Food and service was excellent.  Wouldn't trade it for anything.  Since it's a pretty high end restaurant, I figured they (and you) should know this attention to detail (the seating) was not handled satisfactorily."}
{"text":"The scallops were really good. This place is unassuming. I actually wasn't a fan of the cheese gyoza. I like this place though. It's more of a 3.5."}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit to Todd's but it will not be our lasts.  We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer they were amazing full of crab. We both had a Cesear salad which was tasty. My scallops were by far some of the best I have ever had. My husband had the short ribs and he enjoyed them. We had wonderful service, the restaurant is small but cozy."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars much.  This place was 4 and a half!

The Beet Salad and Watermelon Salad to start - AMAZING!  No, really, we could have just eaten a couple more of those.  But then the Scallops..... U8 size.  Really REALLY good.  The server was excellent.  Not pretentious, but obviously very knowledgeable about food and wine.  Love the laid back atmosphere, and the up-to-date, but not-too-loud music really set the tone.  The bar looked like a nice, chill place to hang out, too.  

Moral:  I can't believe this place has been here for 9 years, and this is the first time I've ever been.  Can't wait to go back again and again.  I'm hooked."}
{"text":"I found Todd's on the Internet as I was seeking a restaurant to which I could buy my dad a gift certificate. The Web site is encouraging, as well as the many positive reviews from others on Yelp and elsewhere. Long story short, my dad has put it on his short list of regular restaurants.

The vibe here is casual. Diners' attire is all over the map and no one cares.

The main attraction here is fish. Though I'm told the meat entrees are good as well, I can never get myself to order anything other than fish. This time I got the Alaskan Halibut (which I'm told is a special rarity by the waitress who recommended it) with a soy sauce glaze and finished with pine nuts. Very, very good. 

For a starter, I had the spinach salad - a great set up to what would be a really good entrée.

Food is plated attractively, which makes its arrival to the table an \"event.\" 

Todd's has a great beer selection, and seemingly good wine selection as well (though I am not as well-versed in the latter). The beer range is vast from many parts of the world. I had two, the Stone IPA (San Diego) and Blanche de Bruxelles (Belgium) which provided two very different complements to my meal.

Service is laid back and casual, but attentive.

You can't miss with Todd's. Go ahead. Order anything. You can't miss..."}
{"text":"I've been to Todd's twice now. Both times making the reservation took multiple phone calls with unfriendly staff. The first time, took 3 phone calls.  I ate there during restaurant week. I found the menu to be somewhat generic but the food was good, not amazing. Definitely not unique by any means. The second time I ate there I made a reservation for 10 people for New Year's (wasn't my choice of restaurant). Again it took 2 phone calls to 2 different people. They took my credit card and said I would be charged per person if we didn't show. (Who does that??) When we arrived we were surprised that the only menu available was a pre fixe with 3 options at $70 a person. We were all very upset because at no time was I informed of this during my 2 separate phone calls with 2 different people.  The options were very limited and did not meet the dietary restrictions of some members of our group. For $700+ we could have went somewhere much better but we couldn't leave for fear of them charging my credit card. So we sucked it up and ordered. I had my boring salad and lamb chops. The lamp chops were cooked well but the sides were ok. They put that gross cabbage thing on everyone's plate regardless of what they ordered. I guess that's unique. My mother's fish was horribly overcooked. None of us were much impressed. This place serves mediocre food and service at best and is definitely overpriced. For my money there are plenty other restaurants I'd rather go to. I won't be back to Todd's....ever."}
{"text":"Todd's is in the running to replace the now-closed Rosemary's as the intimate, private restaurant that is used by executives in the film and TV industry when they are in town for the National Association of Broadcasters conference each April.  The reason is the combination of innovative cuisine, served in appropriate portions, and with quite good service.  For example, one of us had seared scallops, which are nearly impossible to prepare, plate and serve simultaneously with other plates at the same table (short ribs with jalapeno mash).  The scallops were divine, as were the hors d'oeuvres and the short ribs.

Mark's service was very good.

To step up to five stars, my wife and I would recommend the following:

1.  Step up the quality of the wine list considerably.  We could only drink wine by the glass that night.  Even so, it would have been wonderful to see some superb wines by the glass on offer -- something in the $20 per glass range.

2.  The Caesar salad was very plain:  Just torn lettuce, a tiny bit of dressing (almost none) and two mandolin-sliced pieces of cheese.  The ingredients were fresh, but this really, really needed help: It was almost flavorless, the presentation was awful, and there were no anchovies on offer.  What is Caesar salad without anchovies?  Well, it's a Pizza Hut salad, that's what it is.

3.  Due to the severe drought, we realize that there must be an economy of service.  If the drought ever ends, then we strongly recommend stepping up the service:  (a)  Pour the wine into fresh wine glasses each time, (b) use table cloths on each table, (c) provide full service for the silverware, (d) unfold napkins and offer to place in clients' laps, and (e) use a crumb scraper to remove bits from the tablecloth at least twice during the meal."}
{"text":"Great place to bring a date. The roasted duck breast is great, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This is one of those dining experiences that makes you completely rethink what you put in your body on a daily basis and how the most simple menus and ingredients in the right combination can make all the difference in the world. This was, by far, the best dining experience I have ever had in my entire life - so much so that I feel like I should downgrade every other review I have ever made on Yelp by a star or two because this restaurant has blown them all out of the water.

My friend and I walked in about 10 minutes before our reservation, and the hostess told us it would be about 5 minutes to get a table, so we cozied up to the bar. The bartender showed us the specialty drinks and I ordered a raspberry lemon drop which was the perfect blend of sour-sweet. Right after I ordered the hostess came up to us and told us our table was ready. Grabbed our drinks and added them to our table tab. 

Sat down and was greeted by our waiter who told us the house specials. When I asked him if a certain soup was vegetarian he said no, but told me he would ask the chef if he would make a special vegetarian dish for me for my entree. We also came specifically for the edamame that was posted on the site but was not on the menu, but our waiter left us for a moment and came back letting us know that both of those items would be up for ordering - actually, he told us he asked Todd if those items were available. Spectacular. Todd's has a small menu but they have a small menu for a reason: these items are made to perfection. When you specialize in something, you try to make them right and not go overboard which a lot of restaurants have forgotten to do. 

Appetizers:
Edamame with truffle oil: TO DIE FOR. So good, so tantalizing, just made so well. Definitely a tie for best edamame I've ever had with Kabuki's garlic edamame. Delicious.
Cream cheese wontons: AHHHHH. SO GOOD. They are set on top of some red and white sauce that is just too yummy. Crunchy with a creamy center, an absolute delicacy. 
At this point I also ordered a glass of Merlot which was nice and robust and went well with my vegetables.
Caesar salad: I have eaten probably a thousand Caesar salads in my lifetime and this one is top three for sure. A large piece of thin, crunchy Parmesan tops this light-tasting Caesar salad with a perfect blend of spices with fresh ground pepper. Ahhhhmazing. 

Main course: vegetarian entree with mashed potatoes, asparagus, tomato halves topped with herb breadcrumbs (I exclaimed throughout the meal, \"These are NOT tomatoes! They are goddess fruit!\") carrots, snap peas, and cabbage with coriander and cumin. The only thing I did not care for was the cabbage but that's because I'm not a cabbage fan. But everything else - heaven. Before tonight I have actually never had asparagus but it was so good!

My friend ordered the veal (of course he had to order the most politically incorrect thing on the menu in order to counteract my vegetarianism :P) but it came with a pasta dish that was out of this world. Cooked perfectly with the right spices and flavors to make it just right. He didn't finish that part, but I did! :D

Although I was ridiculously full at this point as was my friend, we still ordered dessert, and we both had a creme brulee with fresh fruit - a strawberry, blueberries, a raspberry, and a slice of kiwi. Crunchy top, fresh fruit, and creamy goodness underneath. A perfect end to the meal.

I don't know what the bill came out to be but even if I was the one paying, it would have been totally worth it. The presentation of the food was beautiful, the service was top-notch (any questions we had for our waiter were answered, he was very knowledgeable about the food, and he was a freakin' ninja with refilling our water - my friend and I didn't even realize he had reached across the table to refill them), and the food was phenomenal. Simple yet succulent ingredients and very fresh produce made it all an unforgettable experience. Every thing I put in my mouth was a surprise - it looked like the food I have come to know and love, but tasted better than I could have imagined. The last time I truly ate this well was when I had a personal chef cater to my gastronomical needs. This place is pricey, but worth every penny. If I love anything, it is to eat, and when I eat I want it to be good, and this meal was terrific beyond my wildest dreams. The drinks, the food, the service, the atmosphere - everything was top notch and I cannot wait to come back here again. All my friend and I could talk about after dinner was dinner, and we could only speak in hand movements and yummy sounds ;) In one word: perfection. Compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"I don't usually venture past the strip unless it's for a good enough reason (like to catch a flight out of the country) but Todd's has been on my go to list and we had company staying on that side of town.

I'll get the worst part of it over first; the ambiance fails miserably and the decor is on need of a major overhaul!  Uncomfortable 80's diner drab booths, outdated doodie-brown color scheme,  annoying noise from the TV and patrons in the bar area that intrudes into the dining area.  

Once I moved past the absence of marble columns and chandeliers and tuned out the chatter (with the help of a delectable  hibiscus coconut Mojito) I was able to see what made dining at Todd's worth the trek... the food is scrumptious.
 
We had:

Goat cheese wontons with raspberry basil sauce.

Potato and carrot samosas. 

Filet of beef grilled with wild mushroom Cabernet sauce.

Short Rib with jalapeno mashed, caramelized onion sauce.

Organic chicken breast, substituted the jalapeno mashed for the toasted couscous.

Apple & blueberry cobble with buttermilk cinnamon ice cream.

The food gets a big Y for YUM and Martin, our server,  was helpful and fantastic and in sync with our leisurely pace.  

Too bad the atmosphere doesn't meld with the food and service to make this a truly unique dining experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Todd's.  This restaurant is small and intimate (make a reservation!) and serves wonderfully diverse, delicious food.  Our last visit was 12/20/14, which happened to be the 23rd anniversary of when my hubby and I met.  Not a significant anniversary to anyone else--certainly most people celebrate a wedding anniversary more often than a \"day we met\" one--but we happened to be talking about it and the waitress overheard.  At the end of the wonderful meal, she served us a lovely little complementary \"Happy Anniversary\" tiramisu dessert.  A total surprise to both of us and the kind of thing that brings customers back.

But I digress...the meal itself was *delicious*.  We started with a house salad--highly recommended mixed vegetables with the most wonderful hibiscus-garlic dressing (we joked about getting a bowl of dressing as a soup!)  After that, my husband had the sea bass with a tomatoey risotto, and it was just out of this world.  Having a weakness for comfort food, especially this time of year, I ordered the meat loaf--and was swoonily comforted!  What a wonderful meat loaf this was, seasoned just right, served with a creamy swirl of mashed potatoes and yummy gravy and caramalized onions.  Did I mention, this portion would make TWO meals???  Really, I boxed it up at the end and had it the next day because yummm.

We ordered a Bananas Foster for dessert (not knowing we were getting the aforementioned tiramisu!) and it was delicious.  The only thing I might wonder about--not really complain, just wonder--is that, isn't Bananas Foster usually served flaming?  Ours was not.  But it was wonderful anyway.

I would go back to Todd's anytime.  The food is wonderful, the service accommodating and kind.  

Highly recommended, five stars."}
{"text":"So, last night we went to Todd's to celebrate my birthday.. and two words totally pulled me there, Unique & Eclectic.

Both appetizers arrived at the same time, the dumplings and the goat cheese wontons.  The dumplings were.. fantastic.  Probably the best dumplings I've ever had, I ate my first one without having even tried the dipping sauce.  Perfect amount of crunch, caramelization, flavor, texture, etc.. just fantastic.  The wontons, however, were another story.  I liked it somewhat, but it was a bit too tangy overall.  And.. I love tangy.  It was just overwhelmingly tangy/sour and I wasn't able to eat more than two of them, which was a shame because hubby couldn't stand it at all so those went to waste (and I usually count on him making up for my minimalist eating).  So, one total winner and one that could have been great but was needing some tweaking to be a winner.

Then the caesar salads arrived.. we both loved it (and the dressing was tangy).  So far, we've got 4 woohoos, one meh, and one yuck.. pretty good rating, overall.

Then.. the entrees.  First, hubby's veal schnitzel meal.. the schnitzel was prepared well, the potato salad was warm & vinegary, the glazed carrots had absolutely no flavor anywhere, and the red cabbage was wonderfully flavored with curry.  Unfortunately, the lemon butter sauce for the schnitzel was poured all over it and, since he's already been overwhelmed with so much tanginess in the dinner, he's rather sick of it.  His favorite part of the dinner was the curried red cabbage, since there was no tanginess whatsoever and his palate needed a reprieve.  So... since it all has to count to one vote, I'm going to have to give this one a meh from each of us.

I had the scallops, and there were plenty of them on my plate and served with a wonderful sauce that complemented their flavor nicely.  However, and this was important to me.. there was a lot of sand in the scallops.  Nothing is more off-putting than biting into what is supposed to be tender creaminess and getting lots of \"crunch\" that also tells me that these scallops were NOT cleaned properly, if at all.  They were seared nicely and the sauce was excellent, and the accompanying mushroom potatoes were okay (actually kinda forgot to eat more than one bite of these before I shoved the plate away in disgust).  My vote, with everything good being wiped out by the disgust of the sand, is yuck.. and hubby agreed, so two.

When the waitress asked about them, I told her about the sand.. another woman came by to ask about them and I repeated it.  I'm assuming she was the head waitress or manager confirming that there was a complaint, they didn't really explain.  Nothing said or offered, she leaves.

Our creme brulee's arrived, they were excellent.. though I'll admit that I would have liked the strawberry to have been trimmed to make it edible instead of the greens left on for decoration.  Two woohoos for this.

The bill arrives.. there was no adjustment for an inedible entree.  I didn't insist on it, but I'll admit that I do judge a place on good or bad handling of complaints.  They failed that one.

So, overall... 6 woohoos, 3 mehs, and 3 yucks.. thus the middlin' star rating.  And no, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Yes, a restaurant on Sunset in Henderson that has excellent food and service. Emphasis on excellent food.

I have dined at Todd's several times and each time the one page menu has changed to offer various specials and what's in season.

My most recent trip here was for dinner before a show. We were a few minutes late for our 7:00pm reservation and were seated right away. [Side note, my phone is notorious for its short battery life so I tend to keep an emergency charger with me in my purse. The hostess at Todd's was very accomodating and plugged in/charged my phone for me during our dinner.]

I started with a cantalope martini then switched to prosecco during my meal. We ordered:

-crabcake
-house salad
-spicy skirt steak
-white fish from Alaska (one of the specials for the night)

I will upload a pic of our main entrees. Everything was very light and fresh, even the skirt steak didn't feel heavy or overwhelming. Our waitress was on point and even though the restaurant was completely packed she stayed on top of things.

All that said, I am not a huge fan of Todd's decor. I feel that ambiance can be a very important component to one's entire dining experience when at a particular establishment. As a result, the generic, kind of tired fabric, on the booth seats at Todd's is not attractive. Everything is clean but there were areas that looked a bit worn."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Todd's restaurant! The food, decor, service, food, drinks and everything are all excellent!!! Also it's right next to the Luxury Theatres making it a great place to eat before going to see a movie. It's so awesome going to Todd's on date nights with my fiance."}
{"text":"This Annual feast is a wondrous repast!  The favors build, the waitstaff is worthy of respect, the bar well staff with knowledge!  Worthy of a return -  for me, again and again!"}
{"text":"This Gem of a restaurant has been in Green Valley since I can remember I haven't been back in a couple years and I'm so sorry for that this scallops I had last night or possibly the best I've ever had in my entire life once again Todd's unique dining wonderful success always love the menu fresh new short ribs were great I can't say enough"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place just driving by about five years ago on Valentines day. Its hard to see if your not looking for it, but I'm super happy to have found the place! I love their happy hour menu because you can have a small taste of the entire menu almost, from the short rib martini to the wontons with goat cheese or the tuna with crispy rice, all of the meals prepared are amazing. My favorite thing is that the staff seems to be like family. We were even told that they close for a week or so in August I believe and the owner fishes for fresh fish for his restaurant, and it also give the staff a vacation, I've never heard of a place doing that but I really like the concept. There are fresh herbs growing out front of the restaurant and the bar is stocked with amazing wines and always a friendly bartender, they know us by name! At my last visit my entrée of short rib, which I love to death, was a bit chewy, didn't really fall apart like usual and seemed to be a larger hunk of meat than I'm use to which is the only reason I'm giving it four stars and not five. I always have the fear that like most Vegas restaurants quality and care start to decline so I hope the short rib wasn't a sign of that, but for so many consistent years of amazing food Ill give Todd a break and definetly go back soon!"}
{"text":"My step-mom and I both had a great experience dining at Todd's. The atmosphere was great, I would definitely go on date to this restaurant. The servers were very polite and professional which you don't see very often anymore. The food was very good. We had the Halibut and the spinach salad with blueberry dressing. Very refreshing. The price's were a little spendy but overall I had a good experience."}
{"text":"Todd's remains one of my favorite places in Henderson!

I believe I've been hooked ever since our first visit.   Service here continues to provide a friendly atmosphere.  Rodney, who was our most recent waiter, kept a courteous and attentive persona.  Drinks were always filled promptly along with the delicious bread basket.  

For an appetizer they had the cajun shrimp and grits on special.  This was great! The shrimp had a very succulent flavor accompanied by the buttery creamy grits.  I'd order this again.  I had the Seared Sea Scallops over Mushroom Mash for my main attraction.  Lightly seared and perfectly cooked.  I was so happy with my choices so far that I was going to get dessert!   Snickerdoodle bread pudding anyone?  I will admit it's not the first time I've ordered this dessert and I promise it won't be my last.  My husband doesn't like raisins so luckily for him there aren't any in their bread pudding.  This makes it perfect for us to share.  It's definitely large enough so you won't feel the guilt of eating the whole thing.  

I will continue to be a loyal customer of Todd's.  It's always a pleasure dining here!"}
{"text":"It was good! We are four foodies from San Jose, and we thought the service was great, the food was good, and the wine list was awesome. Recommended."}
{"text":"I am a local and this is one of my top very few restaurants.  It is so good, every time we go.  Also it is priced well and no strip / hotel drama too ."}
{"text":"We had scallops, mahi mahi (special) and the short ribs. 
The short ribs were outstanding, very well done and wonderful flavor. the scallops were perfectly cooked with a sweet glaze and very complex flavor.  The only problem with the scallops is only 4 scallops, seemed kind of a rip off, but the flavor was there. The Mahi Mahi was a off menu special and we thought kind of ordinary. We had the goat cheese wontons for a appetizer, they were flavorful and went perfect with the raspberry sauce. We also had a grumpy salad which seemed to be the only thing we had that we didn't love. Overall, very good food. I want to go back for the fiery skirt steak. Service was excellent and very quick even though it was a friday night. Make reservations."}
{"text":"Date night - Incredible experience. The ambiance, the service, the food, the wine and the dessert. Had the skirtsteak and jalapeno mashed...my date had the lamb...we both were in heaven from start to finish...speaking of finish, the creme broulees were wonderful and perfectly done.  Bellisimo!!"}
{"text":"Finally went to this place after many recommendations and it met my requirement of a craveable item.   The menu didn't sound as appealing as it was but the spicy skirt steak atop a bed of fries was pretty tasty and unique."}
{"text":"All I have the say is this place is a hidden gem. We love coming here and the food has always been perfect and service is always great! We always recommend this place to visitors."}
{"text":"We went with friends for a quiet evening of good food and good conversation. The restaurant has only 2 rooms. the front room by the door with a bar and the back room. We chose to eat in the back room because it is quieter and a little bit more private. Our waiter came almost immediately to get our drink orders and to explain the specials. This was very nice because on Wednesday nights they have no corkage fee. We were able to bring our own bottles of wine and drink our own selections. I ordered the ahi tuna with wasabi mashed potatoes. They serve the tuna seared rare. The tuna was extremely tender and very flavorful. Perfect! My wife had the salmon special. Also very flavorful. A little over cooked but not spoiled. Our friends had one of the beef specials. He raved about it the entire night. We ordered two desserts to be shared by the four of us. We had a bread pudding and a fruit cobbler with ice cream. One dish was better than the next. A perfect way to end the meal. Overall, excellent ambience, service, and food quality. You couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on TV as being rated highest by the CHEFs in Las Vegas, so I was eager to try it.  Both my husband and I go to Vegas several times a year on business and are always looking for that \"Unique\" restaurant to be able to share with clients and to impress the boss.  After putting the finishing touches on our space at the World Market Center, we went to Todd's.  We each had a different appetizer, salad, entree', and desert, and all was the best we had ever had, right down to the Lemon Drop cocktail.
My husband took his clients and boss and while there was some hesitation before tasting, (located in a strip mall), that quickly was replaced with extreme satisfaction for the ease of access and awesome meal.   Now the boss requests to go back to \"that really great restaurant off the strip\".  It is so nice to be able to entertain clients with pride knowing they will have a fabulous dining experience.
My husband and I also drive there from Riverside County, Ca a few times a year as well, just to relax and enjoy the food!  Can't miss!!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner here recently.  Was my second time in and was just as good as the first.  I brought some co-workers who were in from out of town.  It did not disappoint.  From the Chef's appetizer combo that was offered to our table because of our number (six of us), to the deserts that were shared among the party, it was  a perfect night of fabulous food and great service.  I highly recommend the short ribs.... AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"one of the best neighborhood gems anywhere - and I've lived in SF and LA...gotta try the goat cheese won tons to start and go from there...decent wine list, killer appetizers and entrees (scallops are my favorite)...They do first rate seafood but does lamb chops and steaks as good or better than anywhere...dining room is a bit odd and decor is mediocre but the food is the star here so who cares...if you plan on going on a weekend night or any special occasion make reservations...plus they usually are running behind...just a tip don't get a booth - they are uncomfortable.  If they ever change out the decor and seating they get 5-stars."}
{"text":"Went for Valentines Day. I don't usually eat steak or seafood but I got it. Soo good! I love the fish bowls on the table with bread. Everything was great. I also loved the fruity iced tea. Will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you have kids! Why you ask? Well, the entrees don't come with VEGGIES! Man, you don't have to fight the little nuggets they'll hopefully lick the plate clean! Orrrrr, be in my shoes and couldn't fathom finishing the dish. 

The night starts with a consistent lack of acknowledgement from our fabulous server! Or the couple times I got the finger and said she'd be \"just a minute.\" She was so great it took a full 15 minutes before taking our order because I guess serving your family who's finishing up was more important than the hungry hippos. The goat cheese wontons were nothing exciting and the raspberry sauce I felt lacked a lot of the tartness I hope for in a berry! 

For entrees we got the scallops and the short ribs. Well, I guess you do get some Vegetable, if you count your starch potato. The scallops had a minimal dollop under the 4 that were on my plate. The short ribs had a significant amount.. but here's where my dismay comes. EVERY bite was the same, no veggies to offset it, or any flavor for that matter. Every tater bite, every meat bite, was drenched in the sauce. After 5 bites, I'm pretty much over the dish. We had to switch our plates just to help spice up our life. That applies to both meals.

Unfortunately, our star server was clearly uninterested in our table and didn't offer dessert and dropped the check as soon as she cleared off our table. Too bad it was my boyfriends birthday.. I went to the store and baked him Profiteroles instead. Happy Birthday Honey! 

Fail."}
{"text":"Very much a locals place. You will not be blown away by the 80's decor but Todd cooks nightly (take that strip chefs) and lets his food do the talking. 

He keeps the menu fresh and works hard at retaining customers through excellent food and great wait staff.  

The wine dinners are an excellent value."}
{"text":"Amazing food period.  Service was also exceptional, and the waiter really made his recommendations based on our inputs. We will definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable. The halibut was underwhelming, but the peach cobbler was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Have seen reviews but never been-always looking for a great quality bistro that avoids the tourists and the strip area. Dined on Saturday eve and the restaurant was busy but not crowded-noticed several groups of at least 6 people, and with the low ceiling and strip center size, I thought the noise level was high for easy conversation. We noticed that Todds has vegan and vegetarian option designations on the menu, however there were no entrees or salad/appetizer items that were offered that evening. With a vegan diner, we informed the waitress to see what could be worked out. Looked dicey at first as the only option was essentially a vegetable box, but she spoke with Todd and came back with a vegan mushroom risotto option and salad option that worked well and were very well prepared. Spinach salad, Rare Ahi Tuna, a classic martini, and a surprise birthday treat for me were all very good-my only quibble is that the sauce with the Tuna was very salty to my tongue, however I am not a \"salter\" in general so perhaps others would not find it so. I enjoy highly spiced or flavored, but this was perhaps too heavy on the soy. Portions are moderate, and the prices are fair-I do feel the entrees were expensive for the suburbs and portion size at $27, however the other ala carte items seemed more in line. Service was excellent and décor comfortable. Would love to come back and try some other fish options as well prepared fish is always a treat."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite places to eat out. Have been going to Todd ' s for years. Oysters, skirt steak on fire or the filet & the raspberry dome is my favorite. Can't skip out on a couple of martinis or a glass of wine. 
Keep it up, Todd & I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Booked a couple months in advance for Thanksgiving dinner with family. 

The menu was crafted for the holiday and included turkey with all the trimmings as one of four entree options. Everything was flavorful and the presentation was spot on. I had alerted them that I have a food allergy and they were ready when I got there.

Our waiter, Scott, was very attentive without hovering. My mom got the steak instead of turkey and it was delicious, super tender.

The outside of the restaurant is very understated but the atmosphere and the food were outstanding.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and everything was great. Had the beet salad, seafood soup, ahi tuna, kobe skirt steak, bread pudding. Service was prompt but not over the top. It's a little out of the way but definitely worth the trip especially if you're one looking to escape the strip (like me!). 

The restaurant was pretty empty for dinner and half of the restaurant was shut down which was pretty sad because it's a really great meal. Get the word out!"}
{"text":"Easy drive from the strip, but somehow the taxi driver got lost (neither the driver nor the hotel doorman even heard of the place).  After the meal, had to wait 45 minutes for the taxi called by the maitre d'.   

The service was excellent and friendly.  The chef/owner seemed to know everybody at the bar.  My waitress was super-nice throughout the meal, and when I pointed out an error on the bill of 1$ in my favor (entered incorrectly in the computer) they rewarded me with a glass of Villa M and of course let me keep the dollar.  

The food was good, but unspectacular.  I chose the calamari and rock shrimp with spicy aioli, and the Skirtsteak on fire (marinated in moderately hot sauce).  I didn't finish either dish, a rare occurrence for me.  I did like the wine, particularly the Villa M."}
{"text":"This was our first time here at Todd's. 
The service was excellent!

Food: They serve you some bread while you wait for your food. I had a watermelon martini, it was good. Ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer it was delicious. I had the duck, it was very tender, down side is the fat was not rendered enough so it was chewy. The dish as a whole was just okay, there was too much sweetness on the plate.
The hubby ordered the scallops, he thought the food was delicious. We will be coming back to Todd's!"}
{"text":"I had eaten at Todds a few times over the course of the past 10 years and it was always a pleasant experience.  Going there on Valentines Day was totally different. Made reservations, weren't seated on time, but noticed an empty booth obviously waiting for a regular open for 20 minutes. My husband confronted the manager/assuming part owner (female) and she basically shrugged her shoulders and said it's Valentines Day, what do you expect?  I don't know, maybe an apology, free dessert, drink, a smile???   She was so smug. She just didn't care and I get the sense they don't need clientele as they may have a following. I doubt that will last forever.  We left before eating. Good luck with your attitude.  Bye, Todd."}
{"text":"My dad was searching for some fine dining in Henderson and he stumbled across Todd's Unique Dining. We ordered the crab cakes (amazing, no bell peppers in the cakes which is a plus!), dumplings (good, like any other dumplings you'd get anywhere else), tuna tartar on crispy rice (good), scallops with risotto (fantastic, everyone finished theirs), duck breast (very very good) and boneless shortrib (ok)."}
{"text":"I have looked at their restaurant week menu offerings a few times over the course of the last few years, but have never gone.  After trying to go to Bertolucci's Brazilian steakhouse (see review). We ended up here on a whim and we were so glad we did!  Their salad offerings are right up my alley!  i had the beet salad which was a little on the small side, but was loaded with beets!  I have had many beet salads in the past that was mostly greens and no beets.  I ended up getting the halibut, upon recommendation of the server because \"it is wild caught and fresh and the season was coming to an end\". Glad i did, it was very tasty!  Mh husband ordered the short rib and said it was really tender and tasty as well.  Will go return!"}
{"text":"It is a 5 indeed. 
I have not found many places like this one. 
What a concept. A real chef who actually does the cooking. 
You can taste the pride. 
Small business with great ambiance and perfect taste and presentation
Worth every penny

{"text":"Gotta come here more often!!! Tuna tartare is delicious! Loved the goat cheese wontons. Can't wait for dinner!! Stay for dinner and dessert! We had the meatloaf, short ribs and halibut!  They were amazing!! My pictures didn't turn out. Dessert was the fruit cobbler and salted butterscotch pudding. Amazing!!!! Can't miss this neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Totally understaffed for Valentine's day.  Hostess disappeared for 10 minutes while multiple couples with reservations just stood around by the door waiting.  What was amusing was that there were at least 6 empty tables around the place at 8pm.

Service suffered immensely, with water not being refilled, long periods of no attention.  

The food as always was excellent.  Just the front of the house let them down."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful \"off strip\" dining experience at Todd's.  Our friend is a pal of the owner so we were set up with a sampling of many of the apps on the menu - YUM!  They were so well prepared and flavorful - I'd go in just for apps and drinks.  We had dinner though too - which was fanulous.  I had scallops which were phenomenal.  Definitely a place I'd go to regularly if I lived in Vegas and one I hope to go to again on a future trip."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!! Get the special. Or the short ribs. Or anything. :)  The first time we went, as I suspected, the food was a bit off.  The duck and scallops were both overcooked.  However, the last time we went (gave them another chance), EVERYTHING was AMAZING!  I have to hold back one star for atmosphere, as it's very, very loud if you're not in a booth.  Or perhaps it was just the two parties next to us (we moved).  But, the skirt steak was succulent and cooked perfectly.  Very spicy!  Not for the timid, but I loved it!  My wife's crab and shrimp stuffed Mahi was brilliant!  Our picky guests from the shore dined on the rare Ahi Tuna (rave reviewed) and the braised short ribs, which were my recommendations for them.  They both loved it.  The staff is great here and Todd is THE MAN!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tried Todd's on a recent visit to Henderson, and although our hopes were high we were generally underwhelmed.  The decor is extremely dated and unappealing and the booths were surprisingly uncomfortable.  So much so that it actually put a damper on the evening.

Although the appetizers, salad and desserts we tried were nothing to write home about, the entrees were excellent, as previous reviewers have stated.  The signature dish Flank Steak \"on fire\" was decadent and extremely flavorful (almost too much so), and was truly \"unique.\" The sea bass with artichokes was an excellent dish, although ours was slightly overcooked.  The wait staff was excellent and helpful in righting this error with complimentary desserts.   

Although this is an interesting place it was not good enough to return to, especially at around $30 per entree."}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed dining at Todd's.  The menu doesn't change very often, but they always have specials.  They have exceptional service.  The food is nothing short of amazing.  The special touch to each dish shows."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Todd's during Restaurant Week and had the caesar salad, salmon and butterscotch pudding.  The salad was fresh, crisp and delicious.  The salmon was amazing, nicely seared on the outside and served in a lemon sauce.  The butterscotch pudding with caramel sauce swe-e-e-et and delicious!"}

{"text":"My group of 6 decided on Todd's for a Saturday night dinner and we had a fabulous experience.  The restaurant was crowded (likely because they began their Restaurant Week menu) but our table was ready for our 8pm reservation. 

We ordered some cocktails and wine (my girlfriend ordered the raspberry lemon drop martini and it was really yummy) to start.  Todd's has a pretty decent wine menu and the prices are definitely reasonable, so I recommend ordering a bottle instead of cocktails. 

Our server informed us that the chef offers an appetizer sampler for groups of 6 or more, which we decided to order.  Shortly after, each of us received a plate with calamari, one mini crab cake, one goats cheese wonton and one asian dumpling. Everything was delicious!

I ordered the Halibut and my girlfriend ordered the boneless short rib. My Halibut was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing - flaky, soft and served with sweet potato gnocci, which was incredibly delicious.  I literally finished my entire plate of food, which I almost never do.  I tasted the boneless short rib/jalapeno mash and really enjoyed the flavor combinations - not too strong or overpowering at all and perfectly tender short rib.  

Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals with no complaints. The service was wonderful. Although many people complain about the prices being a little high, i think the prices are actually very reasonable considering the quality of food, diverse flavors and extreme attention to detail in every dish. 

The only thing I didn't like about Todd's was the decor.  The decor doesn't match the restaurants high class food because it looks similar to chain restaurant. Todd's could benefit from a makeover with darker wood and less patterns and better lighting in order to provide the ambiance of a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for so long and finally on my birthday last week we drove across town to have a delicious birthday dinner, or so I had hoped. I can't begin to describe how disappointed I was with the experience and the food. I waited a week before writing a review because I would have annihilated them had I written the review at the time....

It started off with them seating us in the noisy bar area even though my husband had told them it was my birthday when he made the reservations. I thought it inappropriate for them to seat us in the bar when you are celebrating a special occasion. We moved into the dining area and I was ready for an amazing meal. We started with the goat cheese won tons and ahi tuna appetizer. They were both slightly above average but both needed more sauce. We also tried 2 specialty cocktails and neither were very good, and tasted watery. 

Now for the entree, I ordered the Alaskan halibut (btw- what I was served looked nothing like the other reviewer's pic of halibut) thinking it would be absolutely divine, my husband had scallops. What a disappointment!!! My halibut was not fresh caught, tasted like it had just come out of the freezer, AND was overcooked to the point of being completely dry. I had to eat the weird sauce that came with it just to be able to eat the dry chunk of fish. What a waste for the most expensive item on the menu. The scallops were not cooked properly either and were mushy, instead of having a nice crisp on the ends. Both meals came with mashed potatoes that were clearly yesterday's leftovers as they were cold in the center and tasted like a blend of instant and real mashed potatoes. They didn't have flavor and came with an unappetizing gravy that tasted canned. The entire meal was a disappointment but I scarfed down the food just so I could get out of there. Their only saving grace and reason I gave them more than 1 star was that they brought out a birthday dessert for me. 

This is the 2nd year in a row that I had a crappy birthday dinner from trying a new place based on Yelp reviews. I have found many amazing restaurants based on other reviews but I seem to be unlucky on my birthdays. I think next year I will just go somewhere I already know is good."}
{"text":"My boy friend recommended Todd's Unique Dining.  Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  First we were served some bread with butter.  We had the crab cake for our appetizer and it was very tasty.  We shared the house salad.  After reading the Yelp reviews, I had to order the Fire Skirt Steak with fries and it was so delicious.  I enjoyed every bite.  My date ordered the swordfish and I took a big bite of his and it was tasty and moist.  We enjoyed our dinner with some red wine.   I plan to come back because the food is fabulous."}
{"text":"we are getting a little obsessed with this place. everything is so delicious-  but beyond good. like the chef knows exactly how food should be. Seasonal menu to write home about. cocktails are so awesome too. Mark the bartender is a rare true mixologist. Katy the server is a total pro. everything is perfectly flavored. Service is wonderful. Makes an awesome evening. try this place for sure- and you will return."}
{"text":"Another wonderful meal at Todd's. The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel at home. It's nice to find a non corporate restaurant in Henderson that provides a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Very rare nice little restaurant off the strip.  The kind of place common in most cities but stamped out by celebrity chefs.  

This is quality food and when I got the bill it was much less than I know I would've spent anywhere on the strip.   Duck breast, beet salad, bread pudding, cobbler - all excellent.  Surprisingly good cup of coffee with desert also.   Can't recommend it enough - it's a hidden gem in old Green Valley"}
{"text":"They refused to serve us because my girlfriend has a seasonal ID, issued by the State of Nevada. But because they had never heard of this local government issued document, with birthdate and all, they embarrassed us and refused to serve us. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Food was great!

Service was great!

Drinks were great!

They even did a little something for our anniversary. I also thought the prices for both drinks and food were fairly decent for the quality of food you were given. 

They get one star knocked off for location."}
{"text":"We have been traveling for 2 weeks and eating at the best places we could find in a variety of locations including Las Vegas and Palm Springs.

This was the best meal we have had on our trip.  In addition, the wine list was outstanding in terms of both selection and price.

This is an A+ place."}
{"text":"My close friend, who lives nearby, and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner reunion at Todd's, December 26. We \"discovered\" this special restaurant years ago, during my visits from Texas. On this occasion Shayne provided for an excellent evening as he skillfully served carpaccio, scallops, and skirt steak, each one a delight. We had a blast catching up on the Las Vegas Valley as I intend to move there some day, come back really; I lived in Las Vegas 15 years. My daughter lives in Spring Valley. Todd's is a casual, relaxing oasis...perfect for reunions."}
{"text":"Todd's Unique Dining is one of the few places in Henderson that truly deserves all 5 of those stars.  While entrees are about $25-35 they represent a very good value.  On my first trip we enjoyed an tuna tar tar appetiser, scallops and short rib entrees, a house salad and a blue cheese/onion salad with bannannas foster desert.  Everything was superb and it was clear that all of the ingredients were extremely fresh and high quality.  Preparation was first rate, as was presentation.  We dined at 5pm and it was not crowded, but I bet the service would have been just as excellent it the place was full.

It appears that they have a different menu each day of the week.

I look forward to becoming a regular at Todd's Unique Dining!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here during Las Vegas Restaurant Week 2010 (which runs through Sunday Sept 5th).  This was our second visit to Todd's and enjoyed it as much as the first visit!

Let me say that for $30.10/pp for a 3-course pre-fixe (only this week) - run, don't walk, to take advantage of this steal of a meal!

The bf was afraid that the portion sizes would be small and no way were they.  He had the Grumpy Salad (blue cheese, onion, tomato, iceberg) and loved it!  I had the Caesar and it was great, not too heavy.  Next I had the chicken marsala with these great buttery noodles with course black pepper, which really should be a regular item.  He had the beef (filet) tournados with a green peppercorn sauce with fries and cleaned his plate.  For dessert, they had 3 choices - I shared my sorbet and he cleaned up his chocolate soufle.

Besides a great meal, we shared a wondeful bottle of wine at a very reasonable price!  Great service - great meal.  Restaurant Week is a nice way to visit your current favorite or next favorite restaurant all while a proceed is donated to a nice charity.

{"text":"Amazing and truly unique food. Great service. A little pricier than the places I usually eat but I'll be back for sure, just not every week. :-)"}
{"text":"Service was great. Ambiance is casual but nice. The place is a bit dated. 

Food:
Started off with the cream cheese wonton appetizer which is totally overrated. Do not recommend 

Duck breast entree is delicious. The duck was amazing. I thought the mashed yams were too sweet for my taste though. I would've preferred mashed potatoes. 

Skirt steak marinated in jalapeños was amazing. The meat was really tender. Comes with fries which I thought was just okay"}
{"text":"Our first time here.  Like the names states very unique and impressive dinner experience. Truly an amazing selection of meals to choose from. I had the Prime steak which was so good. Don't forget the starters like Tuna Tartare and a Grumpy Salad. I will most definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"As you walk in the smell is delicious. The appetizers and main dishes were tasty and correctly proportioned for a pleasant experience that didn't overwhelm.

It was very unfortunate that our dessert (a mousse with a sponge base) had picked up some mold (yes - blue mold on the base). We alerted the kitchen to this fact only to be told that it was not mold but chocolate powder and flour. I don't know why they felt the need to deny the extremely characteristic smell/taste/color - perhaps they were afraid of a health inspection. At least they comp'ed the dessert.

We left insulted and disappointed for that single unfortunate event."}
{"text":"They weren't kidding when they call themselves \"unique dining.\" You get everything from steaks. seafood, to asian dumplings.

Boyfriend wanted to take me here for a casual dinner date. Once I entered this quaint little restaurant, I know right off the bat how much I will enjoy the ambiance. For a second there, I thought I was somewhere in Chicago or New York. You got the dim lighting with Frank Sinatra-esque soundtrack lightly playing throughout the night.

Apparently, the menu is always changing because our menu was dated on the day we went. (March 30, 2015.) Not sure how often they're changing the menu.

Too bad I wasn't too hungry that day, otherwise I would've gotten their skirt steak with chili cheese fries. Random, right!? Who the heck pairs a steak with something so normal as french fries? But hey! It worked! My boyfriend ordered that and gave me a few pieces to try and omgosh! That sauce.....geez! It smelled great and tasted even better. Full of flavor! The chili cheese fries was good too....fresh melted cheese, chili, and they had some kind of black bean sauce that had a smoked flavor to it.
I ordered Asian dumplings and a side of chili cheese fries as my entree. 

The bill wasn't too bad either. A soda, two glass of wines and our entrees cost about $85. 

We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic servers, amazing wine dinners, sign up for their mailing list and keep updated with what is new and fresh. http://www.toddsunique.com/"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined there on Valentines day. First time there and very disappointing. I ordered the sea bass, they were out of it, understandable for a holiday. So I opted for the NY steak with tiger prawn for $38. We had crab cake app, average. I ordered the lobster bisque, had no lobster in it. my husband had cesear salad,it was ok. it took a long time for the courses to come out, still understandable for a holiday. He ordered the scallops, it was good. My steak was the worst steak I've ever had. It was a fatty piece of cheap meat, with little tiny chopped up pieces of shrimp on top. If I had scooped the pieces together it would be a half dollar size. I asked the waitress doesn't this include tiger prawn? She responded its chopped up in the sauce. I thought it was a spice, didn't taste like shrimp. It was like they ran out of shrimp and used one las remaining shrimp for 3 steaks, very disappointing. Needless to say, I will never be back! $120 for a very subpar restaurant! The service was good, but the cooks need lessons on how to cook!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed another amazing dinner at Todd's last night July 7.  We had family in from NYC who enjoyed this off the Strip gem of a restaurant.  

Chef Clore thank you for always making us feel welcomed.    The staff and service are perfect.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  What a treat every time we visit Todd's."}
{"text":"the food we had was excellent, well seasoned and delicious. however i asked for a side of string beans intead of potatoes and they charged me $3 and gave me about 10 beans. The selection is very limited as well. Maybe if the specials were good we would go back."}
{"text":"I love that Todd's is a true local gem. The quality and presentation of the food is 5-star, top notch. This is a high end restaurant at off the strip mid-range prices. Dont be fooled by the look. The service is excellent and food something really unique to find off the strip in Vegas. 

I'm an especial admirer of their cobbler desserts. I've tried the rhubarb, the strawberry, and most recently this apple-mixture cobbler. Amazing desert. I really go there mostly for this. The short rib is also excellent. I like the beet salad as well. 

I think my only real suggestion is that they just add more specials or mix up the menu a bit more. I've been there maybe 10 times and I know I'd go more often with a few more specials, something different than what they serve already or a new menu item or appetizer. Maybe a nice risotto or something like that. Would love to see more creations from the great chef."}
{"text":"Picked this place for dinner based on reviews . From the first encounter the service was outstanding . We ordered the calamari , Cesar salad scallops and meatloaf based on reviews and \" signature\" dishes on the menu. Calamari was over cooked - salad was great and the scallops were outstanding . Meatloaf was bland and overcooled and the veggies were undercooked with minimal gravy - at $23 we expected more . Our waitress was outstanding with some of the best service we have had - attentive , engaging and knowledgeable so the service was 5 and the food was 3."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant, tucked away on Sunset Rd. We were introduced to this little gem by friends who invited us to join them for the Christmas Eve menu. The food is great and the staff friendly. It appears to cater to a loyal local crowd and they even have a small bar in the corner with great choices of wine & beers.
They also host special wine tasting dinner menus on occasion, as well as special holiday menus.
The place is very small, so I definitely recommend reservations. On our particular night, they actually asked us to bump up our reservations, then were running behind, then forgot we were waiting and gave away our table. Granted, it was a holiday and very busy but there's nowhere to wait unless you stand outside with the smokers or just inside the door where people are eating. This was the only hiccup and the rest of the night was great. I do recommend giving them a try and I look forward to returning when they're not so busy."}
{"text":"My experience at Todd's Unique Dining was indeed unique. When we walked in the restaurant was empty. The hostess asked if we had a reservation when we replied no she acted as though she wouldn't be able to seat us. However, she managed to find a table (out of the 10 open tables) for us to sit. The waitstaff were very friendly, however like other posts read, cater to the regulars way more. It was very obvious yet I didn't feel neglected. We sat near the kitchen and I understand the stress of the culinary industry, however, in a restaurant of this caliber I should not be able to hear people yell and swearing at each other from my table. The upside to my entire experience is that the food was phenomenal. The portions were perfect satisfying my appetite. This is a pricy place, however, I would suggest everyone to try it. Sadly, I will probably not return due to the unprofessionalism and favoritism to regulars."}
{"text":"This was our second time at the place. I have zero complaints. The portions were perfect, and the flavor was spot on! We will become regulars, I'm sure. You have to try the duck, it was great"}
{"text":"Second time here for my boyfriend and I and as always the food was amazing! !the service was incredible too ....is our new favorite place. If you want to taste great food in  the henderson area this is the place to go you would not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I love Todd's! The service is friendly & the food is outstanding. When we were not thrilled with the soup they took it off the bill without us asking."}
{"text":"I must have gone on an off day, I guess. I picked the scallops, as they were a \"Signature Dish\" - one would think that would be one of the best things on the menu, no? Well, what I got was a four undercooked, flavorless, unpleasant globs of sea-life, served in what, had I not read the menu to make sure that's not what it was, a pool of cat vomit. The mashed potatoes with the mushrooms in them were good, at least. The rest of it - I'm definitely more on the \"leave it\" side. 

As far as I'm concerned, it's called \"Unique Dining\" because you'll only eat there once."}
{"text":"Ambiance probably the worsr of all time haha but that makes it fun because u will be suprised when main course arrives! Service is ok. Could be much better however owners are very close minded and arrogant about how to run a restaurant. 
Food is good The Appetizers are rather boring except the Goat Cheese wontons with raspberry sauce VERY GOOD. Salads are ok The Watermelon salad is most impressive. Main Courses however are exceptional no doubt. Skirt Steak on Fire is AMAZING. All main course items are very very good. Definitely worth checking this place out.  Deseerts again nothing to rave about. Price is a little steep when go for the whole deal , meaning apps , salads, main, desserts. U can skip a lot of that maybe share a salad and come for the main courses which are truly kick ass and unique.."}
{"text":"I really like the purpose and local community focus of this restaurant and its neighborhood fine dining focus.  I also really like that they are community contributors, providing services for local non-profits and their customers.

I have been to Todd's several times (about 1 month ago was my most recent visit.)

I found the food in general to be well prepared, with generous servings.  However, I found the food to also be mildly seasoned, which did not provide the depth of flavor I hope for when dining in a finer restaurant.  

For example, the short rib entree I had was a very large portion, and very well cooked and tender.  However, it had a somewhat bland flavor in my opinion.  This had also been my experience in the past with an ahi entree.  The caesar salad I had was also relatively mild and unremarkable - I typically like a caesar salad at a better restaurant with whole or large fresh piece of romaine, a good portion of anchovy, and fresh large croutons, with the salad well dressed.  This salad was little cut-up pieces of romaine, and just was not prepared in any remarkable way - seemed like a prepared in advance and chilled item that was bland and uninteresting.

The only outlier in my meals has been the 'Steak On-Fire' entree, which was cooked well, and had a well seasoned and spicy sauce.  I could have lived without the chili cheese fries on the side - messy, overproportioned, and texture was kind of soft/undistinguished based on a variety of ingredients with a similar texture.

Booths are also pretty uncomfortable - these need to be upgraded (too vertical, not enough cushion - just not a very natural seating position for dining).

Again - I think Todd's is an important restaurant in this neighborhood, especially in that shopping area which is currently seeing difficult times - I just think they need to season their food better and be a little more consistent in the design, preparation and elements of this food.  I would really like to ultimately see this as a 4-5 star review."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so many years to try Todd's.  I missed out!  Though the hubby and I are making up for lost time by patronizing Todd's on a frequent basis.

Let's talk about the food.  

The appetizers and salads.  The hubby has tried the ahi tuna tartar, Dungeness crab cake, and Grumpy's salad.  He's mentioned their good but not exactly what he was expecting.  I always order their caesar salad to start out.  It is delicious!  It's not the typical caesar because the dressing is a white balsamic/caesar dressing--it gives it a great flavor!  

For entrees, I'll preface that I was NOT a short rib fan, until I tried Todd's.  Just go to their website toddsunique.com and watch the video for the short ribs, and you'll want to try them too.  The meat is so moist and falls apart upon it's first touch with the fork.  The gravy is succulent, with bits of carrot and onion.  Underneath it all, there's the jalapeno mashed potatoes (I get them w/out jalapenos) which carry a nice zest to the plate.  I've also tried their filet mignon, magnificent!  It is served with a complimenting cabernet/blue cheese sauce and a few grilled veggies.  As I mentioned before I do not eat things that have crawled/perched/swam around in the water, so I'll relay what the hubby said about the seared scallops.  \"They were perfectly cooked,\" \"some of the best scallops I've ever had.\"  The hubby has also had their shrimp risotto, and said it was very good and rich.  Overall, I might classify Todd's style of food as \"American Fusion Comfort Food.\"

Desserts are pretty darn good here too, so leave room!  I'll let you explore the dessert menu on your own!

Todd's is a very casual, comfortable, homely, semi-fine dining restaurant.  There is a full bar on the right side of the restaurant, and from what I understand they do run food and drink specials at the bar.  I've noticed most of the clientele seems to be more on the mature side (40s+).  That being said, most of the clientele are repeat customers, therefore I do recommend reservations.  Todd's is nestled in a strip mall on the corner of Sunset & Athenian."}
{"text":"Just recently, I've seen the headline, \"if you have bad customer service, it's probably because you are a back customer.\" (Or something similar to that) Tonight's experience echoed this quote. We were excited to be out, we were excited to try this restaurant and we were excited for the dishes we ordered. Our server, Anthony, mirrored our excitement! This was great and even though a previous table got allllllll in a tizzy about their food being 'delayed because they ordered a salad', he approached our table with a fresh take. {side note: if you continue to pick at and hold your salads, the server will hold your entrees. This is dining 101 so don't blame the salads or the service, blame your common sense}. My scallops were perfectly coolly with a slightly salty cauliflower bed. My husbands short rib did the \"fall apart just enough\" thing it's supposed to do so he was happy as can be. 

The food was great but the experience made it over the top. Being from Philadelphia, I like service that is proper but still approachable and family based... like your server will give you proper wine service then sit down and shoot the shit with you. And that's what we got. 

See you soon, Todds."}
{"text":"Great entrees. Creme brulee was overcooked so they took it off our bill. Dinner took 2 hours..it took a long time for them just to take our order. Wine list is not that great. The short rib was melt in your mouth good and the fries with the skirt steak on fire were awesome!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times that I can't believe I have forgotten to write a review.

This is one of those un-assuming places yet amazing restaurants in Henderson that it seems hardly anyone knows about.  Unless you are someone who likes to go out to eat a lot like me.  :)

I'd call this dressy, casual.  Not T-shirts casual but in the summer time you can definitely wear nice Bermuda shorts and a button down shirt or sundress or in the winter you can wear a nice pair of jeans and sweater.  Anyways...

The Ambiance - - 
Casual, Simple but Elegant

The Service - - 
Professional, Genuine, Friendly

The Food - - 
Changes periodically. Everything I've ever had has been perfectly prepared and presented.
Recently I enjoyed the Rabbit with Cassoulet.  The perfect comfort food!

The Wine - - 
They have a great wine list.... lots to choose from and the pricing is not stupid expensive like on the strip.  Very reasonably priced.

The Dessert - - 
Save Room!
You have to order one of their desserts.
Recently we had the bread pudding and it was rich and buttery and melt-in-your-mouth good."}
{"text":"For Henderson....it's a great restaurant...for Las Vegas, it's \"okay\".

As for decor and ambiance, I'm not a fan.  The booths have 1980's upholstery and the general layout is a little too boring for me. But I'm reviewing the food, not the decor.

Started with the Goat Cheese Wontons....absolutely incredible dish, I wanted to order 3 more orders!

Moved then to a Watermelon Salad, drizzled in lime sauch and cheese crumples...very nice and light, perfect amount before diving into the main course.

Short Ribs....very nicely done with great sauce.  Meat fell apart at the touch of the fork.

Also had the scallops, to which I was actually NOT a fan of...a little too simple and plain...didn't spark my tastebuds as much as the other items ordered.

Service was genuine, but a little backed up due to the dinner rush.  Having 2 servers cover 16 tables is very difficult, but they managed it well.

All in all, I will certainly return and try some more dishes."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Todd's and we will definitely be back.  We love places off the beaten path that have amazing food and worth the drive, thus came finding Todd's.

I stumbled across it using Open Table (I won't go to any restaurant in Vegas with out reservations).  The menu looked amazing, my kind of food, and seemed worth the 8 mile drive from the strip.  

The restaurant is located in Henderson/Green Valley, and very unassuming.  It would not have been a place I would have even considered had it not been for open table and Yelp reviews.  You may miss it as you drive by.   The decor was ok, very homey feeling, room for about 80 or so diners, with a very nice full bar with seating for another 8 or so.

We were sat immediately in a booth (most of the restaurant is booths, a couple tables, the one adjacent to us was reserved for a large party).  Our waiter greeted us and gave us a great introduction to the menu.  The menu is printed daily with several daily specials, seasonal specials, and a few regular items that are Todd's Signature items.  We thought we would do a mix of a few of each.

Bread arrived, and it was fantastic. A great focaccia and sweet cranberry bread that was wonderful. 

We ordered 2 appetizers.  Their signature Goat Cheese won tons were amazing.  They were the right combination of goat cheese and cream cheese and spices. They were perfectly fried and sitting on a raspberry gastrique swirled with creme fraiche, topped with 3 kinds of sesame seeds and a small amount of fresh basil. OMG YUM!  I also got a glass of Prosecco to go with my appetizers and this matched very well with these.

Our second app was Lobster stuffed mushrooms. Brown mushroom caps that were perfectly cooked and stuffed with lobster. They were served in a small skillet with a small gravy/butter sauce.  There were 8-10 mushrooms which were plenty, we were actually surprised how many we got.

Our second course we did a soup and salad.  I got the Grumpys salad which was like an iceberg wedge that was chopped for you.  The dressing was awesome, the perfect amount of blue cheese, delicious grape tomatoes, and a sprinkle of fresh chives. I didn't know you could make a wedge salad so amazing.  My husband got the special soup of the night which was a mushroom soup with creme fraiche on top.  It tasted like blended fresh mushrooms.  It was definitely not a heavy cream of mushroom soup, but actually nice and light and was fantastic. 

For entrees, I got the Signature Short rib. WOW... I won on this one. It was a baseball sized cut of short rib that was perfectly cooked.  It was almost like a pot roast. Super flavorful, tender and moist.  It was sitting on mashed potatoes that were superb all surrounded by a sauce/gravy that was out of this world.  You could taste the love in this dish. 

My husband got the special of the night which was a seafood risotto. It was just ok.  Honestly, and this is weird to say, there was too much seafood in it, we would have like to have had more of the risotto.  The seafood was good, scallops, mexican sea bass, lobster, and crab, but it was almost overwhelming.  There were also a couple small pieces of shell in the risotto. The flavor was good but it was just not to the level that the short rib was.

For dessert we got the creme brulee which was fantastic.  A very creamy vanilla custard with a perfect sugar crust on top.  Everything that I love about a great creme brulee.

When I went to the bathroom, you can see into the kitchen and you can actually see Todd back there cooking.  I commented to the waiter that this was something that I love.  Many of the celebrity chefs on the Strip just have their name on the entrance and may have helped design the menu but thats about it.  Todd is cooking back there which is something I really appreciate.  As I said before, you can taste the love in his food. 

The food was also reasonably priced, we would have paid at least 50% more for this food at a Strip restaurant in a major hotel.  I also liked that the restaurant was packed on a Wednesday night, packed with locals, and filled with many repeat customers. 

I will definitely make a return trip to Todd's on our next Vegas trip.  I think I would have like to have ordered 1 or two more appetizers and just split the entree.  I like more Tapas style dining and the selection of appetizers and salads would make this perfect at Todd's.  I knocked the star off their rating for two reasons: 1 - the shells in my husbands seafood risotto and 2- the booth was a little tight/uncomfortable, I think it may have actually been that booth, it seemed a touch smaller than the rest. 

Our waiter said that Todd will usually come out to talk to the patrons, especially first time diners, but he was pretty busy in the kitchen (like I said, restaurant was packed).  He also gave us a tip that on Wednesdays there is no corkage fee for up to two bottles."}
{"text":"We have been on a dining quest - we live in Las Vegas and hate to go to the strip - overpriced, touristy, and too too crowded.  In our quest, we tried Todd's, which is very close to our home and which we had, embarrassingly, managed overlook for a long time.

This is what I would call the quintessential romantic restaurant - small and intimate, perfect food, out of the way and kind of a local secret.  I could see \"popping the question\" here - it is the kind of place that you would be calling \"our\" place even if you hadn't experienced a proposal there.

My husband had the steak, I had fish, friends made other choices - all were perfect, great portions, great staff, everything the way you picture in your mind that a great little place should be.  Todd used to be a chef at some other major restaurant and now has this little place where he can food-riff all he wants.  Think of the mental picture you get from that sentence, then go - you will get exactly what you anticipated - personal service, great food, nice atmosphere.  Local favorite.  MAKE RESERVATIONS!"}
{"text":"I love food. I try to find something different, something that at the end of the dinner I could honestly say that it was an \"experience\" rather than a \"meal\"--and Todd's did just that.  For months I would skim over his website, wondering if it would be worth the journey from North Las Vegas to East Sunset in Henderson, and last night we decided to give it a try.  We made reservations through opentable, where I've accumulated 10,000 points so far, and arrived on time at 7:45pm.  The server was friendly, attentive, and although it's in a strange place for what I consider high scale service, it was welcomed.  They have a notable wine list, a quaint bar and an interesting drink menu, which we did not partake in that evening.  Concentrating on dissecting textures, tastes and ingredients that night, I can honestly say that I was impressed.  His ravioli's, although hesitant at first to order southwest-themed ones, were very good.  Perfectly creamy on the inside, not overpowering sauce on the outside, and the southwest theme played well for something that is of Italian origin.  I very much enjoyed the tomato salad, which was plated beautifully and paired very nicely with a creamy balsamic.  The highlight of the evening were the two dishes of scallops and lamb--sauces to die for, perfectly cooked and very well presented.  Dessert, which was peach and ginger cobbler a la mode, paired with complimentary sparkling wine was the perfect ending to a perfect dinner.  

If you are the type of person looking for extremely fancy, 5 michelin star food at this place, to be honest, it's not that.  It's more of a true dining experience in taste and textures both.  It's a place where the sauces blow your tastebuds away, where in some miracle mexican pasta isn't a bad thing at all, and where the dining at the end can be summed up as a true experience.  The chef knows how to pair flavors and textures well, and present seasonal food with grace and style.  

I gave it a 5/5 stars because it truly deserves it. Knowledgeable staff, great variety, and out of this world flavors. 

A new hit for me--now it's your turn."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for two years. Got this recommended by a friend and glad I finally tried it. Great happy hour at the bar, the dates and won tons were amazing. Then the short rib for a main course was equally as great. No doubt we will become regulars here. Ask for Caleb at the bar."}
{"text":"Worth every penny and it's not over priced like the strip restaurants. If you are visiting  LV, step away from the slot machine and see how well the locals eat!  This place doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is top notch and service is spot on!  Enjoy Todd's before the secret gets out and you can't get a table."}
{"text":"After listening to friends rave and after reading many 5 star reviews of Todd's Unique Dining we (5 of us) decided it was time we added this place to our monthly dining choices.  We were not disappointed. 

The food and service are excellent.  Todd bowed to my request to add a couple of his much touted scallops to my pan seared Lake Superior Whitefish.   The scallops deserve all the praise they get, but the star here was the Whitefish flown in fresh from Michigan.   The top was seared to form a crunchy crust that complimented the moist, perfectly done interior.  Thank you Todd.  Three of us ordered the Whitefish and no one left a crumb.  As a former Michigan resident I miss the LS Whitefish.  

One of our party ordered a full order of scallops and said they were the best she'd ever had.  Cindy ordered the  melt-in-your-mouth-like-butter Short Ribs.  A large portion, covered in an untensly flavored and delicious gravy. 

Salads all around except for me, were excellent and fresh.  I chose the Asian Dumplings (potstickers) with dipping sauce.  The dumpligs were small, very tender and sooo very deicious as was the dipping sauce.  Not a complaint from anyone at our table.   Oh and the awesome Watermelon/Jalapeno Martini was over the top.  
Bananas Foster for dessert - excellent.   

The ambiance is very nice, somewhatt romantic if that's what you're looking for and reservations are strongly recommeded.  

Our waitress was quiet, efficient and very polite.  Special thanks to the busser - whose name I didn't get - for taking the photos of our group."}
{"text":"Incredible fun find in vegas!!! Don't miss the skirt steak \"on fire\". Everything we had was memorable and delicious. Very creative, fun menu. We will be adding it to our \"don't miss\" list every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for Restaurant Week.  I actually planned to order the braised short ribs or duck breast a la carte but was pleased to find they had a 40 dollar RW menu in addition to their 30 dollar menu.  I was excited to try their signature braised short ribs dish so it was a no brainier ordering it.  Things went down quickly after.

The beef carpaccio appetizer was decent.  I wasn't wow'ed but everything was fresh. It just lacked the extra element to take it to the top.  Next came their signature braised short ribs and this was disappointing.  The portions were huge and the jalapeño mashed potatoes were good but the short ribs weren't seasoned at all.  It was slightly over cooked and I had to douse it with salt - a good 2-3 salt applications.  I'm not one to usually season my food especially at a fine dining spot where execution on a signature dish should be like a layup.  The highlight of the meal was the chocolate cake definitely.

For the money there's far too many other options to spend your money.  This is more of a 2 but rounded up to 3 bc of service and the Weds no wine corkage fee bumps up but i won't be coming back"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  The menu is short, but each the meals chosen, they were all excellent - clearly they focus on doing really well with few rather than doing okay with lots.  We took a cab from the Strip and paid (there and back) $80 in travel costs.  Ignoring this financial blunder, the restaurant is worthy of praise and was a much needed escape from the \"in your face\" experience on the Strip.  The ambiance in Todd's is charming but dated...certainly no Club Chasse et Peche (à Montreal).  In summary: if you have your own car, check this place out."}
{"text":"Todd's really is a hidden gem in Henderson. This should be an option for anyone looking for a romantic dinner or somewhere to bring out-of-towners wanting to avoid the Strip. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel like you're part of their family. Though no one was at the bar while we were there on a Friday for dinner, I can't wait to come back for Happy Hour. 

To start we shared the goat cheese won tons and the grumpy salad. The won tons are served atop a sweet raspberry basil sauce which paired perfectly with the tart goat cheese. The grumpy salad had shredded lettuce and a wee bit too much dressing, so I'm glad we shared this and didn't have to eat it all myself. 

For dinner I had the seared sea scallops with risotto. Yes there are four of them but they are HUGE. Unbelievably plump and buttery. The risotto had mushrooms in it and was a nice palate cleanser but I'm not a big fan of the texture of risotto. Everyone including myself loved the short ribs. Most of the photos I've seen of this dish aren't very appetizing but believe me it's really good. 

Todd's can be a bit expensive so I don't go except for special occasions but the food is definitely high quality and the experience is always pleasant."}
{"text":"My first time here and it far exceeded my hopes. It was terrific. The Asian dumplings and goat cheese wonton starters were delicious. The duck breast perfectly cooked, juicy meat, crisp skin. The ahi tuna with Wasabi mashed beyond incredible. And all this at very reasonable prices. You will totally love this hidden Vegas gem."}
{"text":"We went with our family for Christmas Eve and wow. The restaurant itself is small and quaint, which I love. 
 The food was incredible, you can tell the chef puts so much effort into each dish. 
I mean it was truly just incredible. Will definitely be going back!! 

The staff was so pleasant and kind, even with the rush of people coming in , our drinks were always refilled before we could even ask. 

Great food, great service, a must try!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place being a pescatarian and looking for good places to eat off the strip.  But I was very disappointed. 
We started out with the crab cake with remoulade, the crab cakes were nothing special and the remoulade tasted nothing like any remoulade I've ever tasted in New Orleans.  Next we got the Watermelon salad, which was actually a fun surprise, spicy and sweet, by the end I had lost some of taste from the cayenne, it would have been better as dessert.  For the main attraction my man go the skirt steak, he thought it was ruined with all the sauce, there was just too much on it, taking away for the flavor of the meat.  I got a pan-seared fish, but it was deep fried and I hated it.  Why would a place the boasts about the fresh quality of their food disguise it with oil and sub-par sauce.  And to top it off our waiter interrupted us every 5 min, don't get me wrong I love good service but this dude was just rude!"}
{"text":"Wow! My first time dining here and it was delicious! Great food and excellent service! Terri was our waitress and she was absolute perfection!!"}
{"text":"I love an excellent dining experience and I have to say, I'm impressed.  First, let me compliment the staff here.  From the bus people to the bartender, kudos.  Everyone was attentive, pleasant and professional.  This is a great staff focused on excellent service.  Second, the food was amazing.  Started with the goat cheese wontons, delicious.  Moved to the grain salad, fresh and satisfying.  Finished with their signature skirt steak on fire and the monkfish.  Every dish was well prepared with a lovely presentation.  I loved the unique pairings of sauce and dish.  I highly recommend checking out this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Came for New Years Eve and hadn't been here in quite awhile but was very very happy with the experience!
It was busy so although our reservations were at 7:15 weren't seated til after 8, couple at our table DID NOT want to leave!
Service, however, was amazing!  Food was delicious, 3 of us ordered the lamb which was perfectly cooked and so tasty!  
We brought our own wines and they were perfectly attended to...bread was delicious and desserts were great as well.
It was a wonderful evening, festive and busy but the servers were on top of everything and all is a good mood which made the evening a success!"}
{"text":"Recommended by my sister who lives in Henderson as a good place for me and my wife's anniversary dinner. Made reservations online and was promptly seated upon our arrival. Small intimate place with a great staff. Hard to make a decision since the menu items all looked great! I had the meatloaf and my wife had the skirt steak. Both were absolutely amazing! Dessert was fantastic as well. Wonderful choice for our special day and I recommend! Thank you, we enjoyed our dining experience."}
{"text":"I first dined at Todd's a week ago and I've been back twice since!  It might be a bit soon to make this call, but I am going to go out on a limb and declare it to be my overall favorite off-strip restaurant in Vegas.  Blows away Rosemary's.

Todd serves creative, well executed, high-quality food made with fresh seasonal ingredients combining both subtle and bold flavors,  I suppose some might say there is Asian influence, but I consider it to be West Coast American Nouveau.  I must admit, however, that this review might be slightly biased because it is soft shell crab season and I am sort of a soft shell crab whore.  

Besides the juicy, succulent, makes-my-mouth-water-just-thinking-about-it soft shell crab, everything I've had there has been surprisingly good.  On a couple occasions I've even caught myself chuckling out loud about an unexpected twist or an extra added touch which took the dish to the next level.  

One example would be the time I ordered what the menu that day called surf and turf - day boat scallops and tournedos of beef .  I ordered scallops rare and they were prepared exactly how I like them.  The tenderloin was well cooked, properly seasoned and balanced out with the scallops nicely.  However what took the dish to the next level in my opinion was the attention to detail found in the veg served on the plate.  Squash, beautiful broccoli, perfectly cooked enoki mushrooms, fresh green beans, and to top it off (and what made me chuckle) was a 2 inch piece of delicious, sweet corn still on the cob.  Nice touch.

I won't go into detail about their must-order signature Kobe short rib, but  I will tell you they braise it for three days to create unparalleled tenderness.

The service at Todd's is top notch.  Besides being attentive and well versed on the menu and the cooking techniques used, the servers are very nice and not afraid to engage in some friendly conversation.  In my opinion one of the keys to good service is making the customers feel comfortable and they certainly achieve that here.

With the kind of food and service one might expect from a white tablecloth restaurant, it is refreshing to be served in a more cozy, relaxed environment.  There is a no-smoking bar on one side of the restaurant that has a bit of an old-fashioned feel to it but then they've got the basketball playoffs going on the TV. 

Todd is an actual person (chef/owner) and from what I can tell he is there most nights and makes an effort to come out on the floor and interact with the guests, another nice touch.  

I'm glad to have discovered this gem and it's already become a new weekly spot for me in spite of being clear across town from me."}
{"text":"In support of restaurant Week, Todd's has again created a great menu. There were choices between 2 dinner options. Both are 3 courses. My choice was:

First Course: Goat Cheese Wonton with Raspberry Basil Sauce. The dish consisted of 5 wontons filled with warm goat cheese. Just spread on the raspberry sauce to create a heavenly starter. 

Second Course: Branzino with Shrimp Risotto and asparagus. The fish was cooked perfectly and the risotto was smooth as silk.

Third Course: Salted Caramel Butterscotch Pudding. Lost for words. Just a perfect finish.

As in the past, service was on point, with the wait staff friendly and attentive. Glad they still have The Puzzle - 2006 Pinot Noir but I was told they are almost out.

Again Thank You Todd's for providing an opportunity to support Three Square."}
{"text":"We finally tried Todd's and am very happy we did. It's nice to find a great place to eat off the strip and we will return. We were first seated in a booth. The booths have vertical backs and aren't very comfortable. We asked for a table and were reseated right away. Service from start to finish was friendly and attentive. Couldn't have been happier. They have a few half bottles of wine on the list and the Armand Riesling was delicious. The bread basket was good although butter very hard. Apps were a perfect carpaccio and a very good but bit loose crab cake. Entrees were Sea Scallops and Duck Breast, both cooked perfectly. The scallops tasted perfectly fresh and had just the right sear. The duck breast also had a nice crust on one side and was one of the best in a long time. We both had bananas foster and an ice wine for desert, both very good. The decor inside leaves a bit to be desired - its a plain place but the delicious food and excellent service are enough that we will be back soon. It was a great dinner."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me 10 years to dine at Todd's again for the second time. My loss. Everything was amazing.  A party of 4 of us went last night. We all enjoyed the experience. The braised short ribs were very flavorful and I didn't need a knife to cut the meat. Crab cake and grumpy salad were delicious.  I like the location because you are away from the strip and you can park close to the building. I will not wait so long next time to visit Todd's."}
{"text":"I felt this restaurant was very overpriced for what you got.  The restaurant itself is very old and not in a classic way.  Furniture was cheap and tables pushed very close to one another.  The food was just alright, but not worth the price.  I won't be coming back here again which is too bad, because I live right down the street."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre at best.  Service was good from host stand to our server.


Unless you're 120 lbs or less and lisle to sit up at a 90 degree angle, this place has the most cramped undersized booths. I was squirming to get out of the booth my entire meal.

For appetizers, the watermelon salad and goat cheese won tons were both delicious.

Entrees left a lot to be desired. The eggplant pasta was missing a key ingredient...  EGGPLANT! It's like the took the eggplant out and added extra balsamic!

We enjoyed the scallops and short ribs but the mashed potatoes tasted like they just came out of the microwave.

A bit of a disappointment but needed to try this much talked about place."}
{"text":"Love Todd's... There's always something amazing on the menu.  No pretense... just great food."}
{"text":"Attended the monthly wine dinner at Todd's Unique Dining, this month they featured wines from Middleton Family Wines.  Started the dinner with a wonderful 2012 Adobe White Blend-- 36% Viognier, 34% Grenache Blanc, 24% Sauvignon Blanc, 6% Princes--had a bright straw color with aromas of orange blossoms, mandarin zest, jasmine, sweet fennel and honey, with hints of fresh-ground nutmeg, a little tropical fruit flavors of mango, cherimoya, and white peach predominate with a firm acidity level and a great balanced mouth-feel. The course served was a fabulous King Crab Cake--delicate with a light crisp breading--accompanied with a delicious Bok choy slaw, had a tantalizing sesame seed oil and rice wine vinegar dressing.  The next course was Alaskan Halibut filet, served with a truffle cream sauce--sweet cream with a slight nuttiness and earthiness flavor, this was plated with herbed barley which enhanced the earthiness of the course.  This course was pared with 2013 Inconceivable White Queen of Tides--a 100% Chardonnay with a bright straw color with aromas of tropical fruit, honey, marzipan, wet stone and some yeasty undertones. The wine has flavors of pineapple, with a distinctive sea-floor minerality, and bright acidity in the mouth. The surprise is the viscosity and smooth mouthfeel that brings you to a warm, spicy, oak-tinged finish that lingers. The next wine presented was 2012 Adobe Red Blend--23% Zinfandel, 22% Petite Sirah, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Malbec, 10% Petit Verdot, 4% Tempranillo, and 3% Syrah.  This wine had a dark black cherry and dusty mocha aromas with soft, jammy strawberry and black fruit characters combine in the mouth for a complex blend of fruit flavors. The tannins were soft and rounded, leaving a rich mouthfeel, finishing with a lacing of warm toasty vanilla a very good selection.  The Butternut Squash Ravioli--homemade, airy with a very sweet butternut filling--with a brown butter and fried sage leaf dusted with Parmesan cheese pared well.  The main course was a Bone-in Short rib, very tender and flavorful with a red wine essence accompanied with a mushroom potpie--a combination of cremini mushrooms with a biscuit and cheddar cheese topping. Also served with buttered orzo to complete the course.  This course was pared with 2012 Inconceivable Cabernet Sauvignon a very nice wine.  Intense deep purple hue, dark fruits (black berry, black cherry) and toasted bread lead the aromatics. Savory aspects of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a slight tinge of wet earth add complexity. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with fruit character echoing the aromatics, plus subtler elements of cocoa powder, tanned leather, red and Bing cherries, the finish lingers for an extended length of time with a persistent character of dried berries. The dessert course was a Chocolate Devil's food cake with butter frosting a splash of blackberry coulis and chocolate ice cream with chips.  This was pared with a 2013 Clayhouse Cabernet Sauvignon, deep purple/dark red color. Aromas of dark Bing cherry, black currant, and hints of cedar and sweet vanilla. The wine is rich, full bodied and has sweet black cherry and ripe plum fruit flavors with licorice undertones. This Cabernet has chewy but rounded and smooth tannins and finishes with warm toasty notes.  The evening was enjoyable and well attended, I enjoyed most of the wines and food courses definitely presented well and thank you to Chef Todd for his creations."}
{"text":"From the minute I stepped into this place for Valentines it was a disaster. We had a 8:30 reservation and walked in at 8:20 and didn't get seated till 9pm which is whatever. Our bread didnt come out until 20 minutes after we sat down only because I had to ask him for it. The waiter came over after 13 minutes after we were seated to take our drink order and I said do you have stolich elite on the rocks and he told me yes.. 7 minutes later he brought my girls drink and told me oh we are out and then the host came over and said yea we stopped buying that 3 months ago, i dont even care about the drinks. Now another 12 minutes later the waiter finally comes back and takes our order so we are there over 30 minutes without even getting our order in. We were going to order from the non pre fix menu side and there was 3 things on the menu we liked and the waiter then tells us that they were all out of those 3 items which were all their signature items. Don't you think on the busiest restaurant day of the year you would be stocked up on those items instead of running out of them by 9pm?? So we ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. We got The carpaccio and the goat cheese wontons, the carpaccio was smothered in cheese my gf said but I actually enjoyed it, the goat cheese wontons just tasted like oil and didnt have much flavor. For our entrees my gf ordered the filet mignon and i got the ahi tuna rare with wasabi mash which I make all the time. Before you listen to our outcome I just want you all to know that I am a \"CHEF\" here in Vegas and I don't like giving bad reviews but this could've been our worst experience since living out here in the restaurant aspect. \"Salt\", there was no salt on anything. Her filet mignon steak was cooked good but had no salt & pepper on it at all and her veggies were just steamed veggies that weren't seasoned. My ahi tuna has no flavor to it and the wasabi mash had way too much wasabi paste in it cause every bite i took my nose started burning. We then ordered dessert with was the salted caramel pudding and that also needed more salt to give that salty and sweet combination. The place was so understaffed its crazy. No way a meal should take 2 hrs in a restaurant. Food service was a 2/10 and food was a 1/10.. sorry just giving our honest opinions. Todd probably ran out of Salt like he did with everything else."}
{"text":"Amazeballs! If you have doubts about dining at Todd's, leave your doubts behind! My husband and I just had the most amazing dinner at Todd's.
Everything from the bread to the potstickers and crab cake starters were amazing.
For the entrees, I had the skirt steak \"on fire\" with the chile cheese fries and my husband had the ahi tuna with wasabi mashed potatoes. Both were absolutely outstanding!
For dessert, My husband had the cinnamon bread pudding--Delicious! I had McKenna's brownie--it was very good, also.
Terry C., our server, was professional, friendly and personable.
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One negative was that we were sitting under the cooling vents and were uncomfortable.  We mentioned it to our wait person and she said that is just the way it work.

The food was very good and the service was a little less.  Overall it was a nice experience.  We will be back but not take the booth in the back."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner at happy hour and asked to sit in the bar area. We ordered a salad and our dinners. I asked what drinks they have for happy hour and the server said happy hour is in the bar. I said we are in the bar and she said no you have to sit at the bar. What!!  There's not two seats together at the bar and why are we sitting in the bar if we can't have happy hour. Never heard of anything so stupid. It's too bad we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My brother chose Todd's for his birthday dinner, leading to one of the best meals I've had since moving to Las Vegas in 2013.  First off, the service was amazing.  On arrival, we were seated promptly and presented with menus (drinks and food) and an offer of water, which was quickly delivered.  This was a theme that would continue throughout the meal, as our fantastic waitress took great care of us throughout our dining experience.

Some of us opted for cocktails (two mules and a pear martini) which were both great.  I had a mule and it was just delicious. One of the best cocktails I've had.  For apps, we (party of 5) chose the appetizer sampler, which offered an asian dumpling, some calamari, a goat cheese wonton, a crab cake, and a sweet potato puff.  Everything was great, but I particularly enjoyed the goat cheese wonton and crab cake. Dinner included a perfectly prepared salmon special, the seared sea scallops, the NY steak, a fillet of beef, and the boneless short rib.  Everyone loved their food, but I particularly want to tell you about my dish, which was the short rib.  This was a good sized piece of meat and it just melted in your mouth.  So delicious.  The jalapeno mash and onion sauce were a perfect compliment to this delicious entrée.

For desert, my parents split a nutella crème brulee, my brother had the chocolate cake, my sister-in-law had the bread pudding (which was big enough for at least two people and delicious), and I went with the amazing bananas foster.  My brother also got a special complimentary birthday desert (tiramisu).  Everything was thoroughly enjoyed.

Overall, this place is amazing and quite reasonably priced for such high end fare.  I cannot recommend Todd's Unique Dining enough, and can see being a regular visitor."}
{"text":"Don't let the simple, subdued logo fool you. Todd's is a nice establishment. Not too classy and not too pricey, but with food at that epicurean level and a more casual, relaxed feel. 

I've tried 3, maybe 4, entrees and each one was superb. The shirt ribs stood out the most to me. You know how people say slow-cooked meat falls off the bone or,  even further, melts in your mouth? But it doesn't actually melt in your mouth, does it?* Well... this one virtually does. You don't need a knife. 


*surely there are exceptions, but I mean it as a hyperbolic statement."}
{"text":"WINNING! Charlie may talk about it, but Todd pulls it off. Stopped by for the first time on my last trip to Vegas. Loved the rustic ambiance which was in sharp contrast to the strip mall Todd's is located in. After drinking some Tiger Blood, I mean red wine, my lady friend and I enjoyed a pretty tasty meal. The salad was good. The lobster special was sinfully delicious. The bread pudding was om nom nom nom. The only disappointing thing for me was the amount of fat on the skirt steak. I don't normally order skirt steaks, so maybe it's always that fatty? Not sure. I did, however, enjoy the sauce on the steak. Last but not least, our server was friendly and informative...just the way it should be. Till next time!"}
{"text":"I'm way behind on my reviews. This one is from Spring Restaurant Week '12. Dining out at any half-decent, upscale place should be relaxing. That wasn't the vibe I got as we entered. It was a madhouse with servers and hostesses running around frantically with overwhelmed and panicked looks on their faces. Granted, it was a Saturday night during restaurant week, but I've seen plenty of places handle the rush much better.

The waiting area by the host stand is only large enough for about four people to stand. Any more than that and you'll feel like you're in the way. It's probably best to wait outside if you can.

Luckily, the table we were seated at was away from all the commotion. The interior of the restaurant feels dated -- the kind of dark greens and browns that remind me of a cheap hotel.

As for the food, it wasn't bad. We both opted for the RW menu, starting off with the sweet corn ravioli, which could have used more sauce and some acidity to cut through the sweetness of it.

The filet medallions were a fairly large size, but the quality of the beef was tougher than expected. The roast prime rib of pork was a massive chunk of meat that was as tender as a pork chop could be. The accompanying mashed potatoes were delicious and the cabbage added a welcoming bit of crunch to the meal.

The desserts were the highlight of the meal. The flourless chocolate cake was rich and sweet and the perfect size to satisfy your sweet tooth without making you feel like you overindulged. The butterscotch pudding was similar to a budino but wasn't as creamy or silky smooth. 

After hearing so many good things about this place, my expectations were high. Unfortunately, Todd's Unique Dining wasn't able to meet them. The food was pretty good all the way around, but lacked the wow factor of more acclaimed spots around town. The flavors of most of the dishes were solid, but the presentation looked a little dated. Even compared to other high-end, off the strip restaurants, I'd rate Todd's well below both Marche Bacchus and Vintner Grill."}
{"text":"The experience on Valentine's Day Dinner was just OK -

The staff though is very nice. The server accomodated to a switch of side as requested. 

The food took too long. 

They had ran out of calamari - we did have an 830p reservation. So it was rather late for a holiday sort of night.

My lamb was perfectly cooked - it was rather delicious. 

The glass of wine wasn't badly price and was complimentary to my lamb. 

Decor was cozy.

Will try again."}
{"text":"We came here for Restaurant Week to support Three Square and found an amazing restaurant that we will continue coming back to. The entire wait staff was friendly and prompt. Literally everything we ate was absolutely delicious. I do not give five stars easily nor often. This place earned it this evening!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to have a great experience here.  I may have just been there on a bad night. Firstly, we ordered the samosas, we bit into a block of ice.  Obviously these were pulled from the freezer and not heated properly.  My wife had the scallops which came out chewy and extremely salty! My skirt steak was was ok, but over seasoned as well.  I had such high hopes from word of mouth reviews, it only made it more disappointing."}
{"text":"If you aren't a regular, you won't be well taken care of. 

After yelping this place, I suggested it to my girlfriends before we went to see a movie at green valley galaxy. We decided to grab seats at the bar since we only had about an hour before our show and the bar was wide open. The restaurant is pretty small and the bar only had 10 chairs. We took up 7 of those. 

This was all of our first time trying this place and we were excited to see they had a great happy hour menu but that's where the excitement ended. Our bartender Mark was incredibly busy. We didn't get to order anything until he was finished making three other rounds of drinks and almost TWENTY minutes had passed. 

At this point happy hour was over and so Mark let us know if we wanted something we had to put it in quickly. We all ordered cocktails and food, including a bottle of wine, a few glasses of wine, a vodka tonic, tuna tartar, cheese plate, grilled cheese, wontons, bacon wrapped dates, etc, but once again had long wait times for our orders. One of my girlfriends was served twenty minutes after the rest of us for a glass of wine and two appetizers!

While Mark was rushing around working hard, I noticed the gentleman sitting next to me was incredibly well taken care of by the wait staff up until he left. While we waited twenty minutes just for waters this guys plate and glass were always full because a female server was constantly checking on him. I found this to be odd as Mark clearly looked like he was struggling to keep up with all if the bar orders, and didn't get any help. We weren't even acknowledged by anyone else.

Once that man at the bar left a little while later I noticed two older gentlemen enter the restaurant and walk over to the bar. Seeing that there was only one seat available, as a couple had taken the other two, they proceed to get a table instead. 
This is when I overheard Terry (apparently part owner) completely ream Mark for not taking care of the regulars while he was trying to help serve us! She was mad at him for not helping these two guys out even though there was clearly nothing he could do. I was so offended that within ear shot of me she was bashing us for taking up the bar seats. How incredibly rude! 

We won't be coming back here or recommending this place but they probably don't want new business anyway seeing as Terry was verbally bashing us seven new paying customers within hearing distance."}
{"text":"I had had a company dinner here before our annual convention an was impressed. driving by here it's possible to miss as there is no flair or flashing light to lure you in, just good reviews and excellent food. 
 I had read they are know for their seafood so I went with the scallops and mushroom risotto. Scallops were seared perfectly, cooked to perfection and the risotto was equally as good. It was nice to have more than just a few scallops per order, they actually plated nine on my plate making it a very filling dish.
The service was top notch. We had one server for our group and she was on top of all of our drink orders, nobody had to wait for a refill the entire evening and we had several rounds."}
{"text":"Not so unique dining experience indeed.

The short: looks like it used to be a Mexican restaurant, service was eh, entrees were tough, disappointing dessert :(. 

Dined here during Restaurant Week and Todd's definitely seemed to be the place with the most value, it was $30.12 for a 3 course.

The night did not start off so well beginning with reservation. Made a reservation Friday 9PM, came a bit early, and didn't get seated until 930PM. Okay no problem you're busy, but I did see empty tables in the dining room. Service was a hit and miss throughout the night, seemed to be a lot of tension between the waitress and the bussers. 

Started with a Grumpy's salad and a heirloom tomato bisque for appetizers. The tomato bisque was creamy and delicious, but the grumpy's salad was overwhelmed with cheese. For entrees we ordered the beef medallions (medium-rare) and the prime pork ribs. Both equally tough to chew, but had a very nice presentation, accompanying items didn't do much to complement flavor wise though. Lastly the desserts ordered were the hazelnut creme brulee and the salted caramel pudding. Creme brulee was disappointing and lacked the wonderful experience of breaking the torched sugar coat on top. Salted caramel pudding sweetness was overwhelming. 

All and all, I'm glad I tried it just to have it crossed off my list of to-do's, but considering it was a 30 minute drive, and so-so experience, I will probably not come back."}
{"text":"1st I have to say that the service was wonderful & everyone there was extremely kind & helpful. We arrived with a reservation & were promptly seated & greeted by our server. The only reason I am giving this place a 2 star review is because of the food...it just was not as good as I expected, especially for the price. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Todd's, it was a weekday so we knew it wasn't going to be crazy busy or anything. Service was good very fluent and timely. The ambiance was good, very intimate small restaurant, on a couple of occasions I had to lower my voice down as to not be too loud. The restaurant is a little outdated but it adds to its  charm I think. 

Good Wine List.... Silver Oaks always a go to. 

Let's talk food, we started with goat cheese wantons and the Seared beef carpaccio. 
wanton, were very flavorful and the capers were a nice add. The Goat Cheese wantons were moist and tasteful. We decided to go with the Ceasar salad for the greens and just split it, it was a Caesar salad, as expected. 

For our main dishes we got the scallops and the Skirt Steak \"On Fire\".... The scallops, pretty good, and cook correctly so was the steak... the presentation was lacking and the fact that the steak came with what looked to be just a pile of cheese fries made me question who is creating the menu. I was a little disappointed with that. 

Overall I gave it 4/5 because th food didn't jump out at me but I think I will give it another go because its so close."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Server was friendly, helpful, delightful, Drinks were above average; the gal who greeted us however,  was such a downer; she never cracked a smile and gave the impression that we were bothering her. We had a reservation and we were prompt;That was disappointing."}
{"text":"Had dinner with My Father, Brother, and a friend. The service was impeccable!! Then the food, WOW! The Scallops with the Pistachio Butter were amazing!! The Steak was cooked to perfection!! The atmosphere is very inviting. Thank you Sheena, Dustin and Amy for your great service!! We had a wonderful evening!! Definately will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best dining experiences I have ever had! Ryan our server is the best! He was very attentive. If you want top shelf food and I mean top shelf, this is your place. I will always eat here when in Las Vegas! Don't waste you time or money anywhere else. Forget the strip, Todd has what you want and meets all expectations with 5 stars. Thanks to Todd's unique for some delicious food! PS request Ryan as your sever."}
{"text":"We were here last night for a birthday dinner with close friends. 
Impeccable service can take a great meal to amazing. Scott was attentive yet not intrusive. Spot on with timing and servicing the table. 
Todd's food preparation was a delight and his suggested wine pairings were perfection.
After having a less than stellar experience the last time we visited in June of this year we were reluctant to try Todd's again. So glad that we did! 
We will definitely be back - in fact we already have reservations for next week.
Kudos to Todd and Terri and their staff!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary there tonight, it was our first time eating there. I want to say the service was great and the food delicious.
I would highly recommend the appetizer Carpaccio ( steak tar tar) if you like very rare filet like I do this dish is amazing, although I would skip the salad
You get greens with the appetizer. My husband had the fish special and although I can't remember the name he really enjoyed it , I had the filet (rare) and I have to admit although a little pricey in was absolutely delicious . Would highly recommend this restaurant and I'm sure it will become our go to for special occasions ."}
{"text":"I'm verbose, I'm loquacious, I word-smith for a living yet I do not have verbiage sufficient to describe the cavalcade of wondrous flavors I experienced a few nights ago on my first visit to Todd's.

I think the theme for the evening would have to be Surprise. You don't expect this gem to be hidden in a strip mall among chain restaurants and nail salons. When you walk in and see the simple, clean, small (the marketer in me wants to say \"intimate\") dining room, you don't expect the food to come out plated like a showpiece from the Food Network. And when you see the (relatively) moderate prices on the menu, you certainly don't expect a 5-star dining experience. Yet in each of these assumptions I was surprised - pleasantly surprised. 

From the signature Asian dumplings, to the seafood chowder, then a plate of sea scallops that left me perfectly satisfied yet desperately craving three more portions - just for the flavor - I could not have asked for more. 

Then came the dessert menu!  We opted for a pineapple-apple cobbler with a cinnamon gelato topping. Again, as was par for the evening, the flavors were sumptuous  - a perfectly balanced mix of rich dark seasonings and bright fruity sugars. 

 My wife and I both enjoyed our 4-course meal immensely and got out for under $100... can't complain about that. We went two days ago, and are already looking for an excuse to go back. St. Patrick's Day maybe?"}
{"text":"An amazing menu, wonderfully prepared and expertly served.  Sorry that it took us so long to find it. The only draw back is that their wine list is pricey, so we decided to enjoy the wine by the glass.   I wish they would sell Todd's wines by the bottle."}
{"text":"Our last dining experience with Toods was over Thanksgiving. The food was great, in-fact it was very good. The service was friendly and over all-good quality.

I few negatives about our experience, one they added gratuity automatically to our bill for a party of 2. I found this offensive, when automatically added its called a service charge not a gratuity.  In my case, I added another 20%, not noticing it, as they still had a line on the bill labeled \"gratuity\"... not additional gratuity.  The staff said nothing, when the bill was returned my dinner mate pointed out that..... I had tipped 40%. I had been ripped off. 

The second point, the bartender was overheard talking about Tood guests to other guests sitting at the bar, about how drunk this guest was, which guy toy that guest was with, how much makeup another guest had on.... it was embarrassing and class-less. I would have fired the bartender on the spot. But the thing is, other staff seemed to accept it, which gave me the feeling they do it often. 

Recap - good food, good food service.... class-less bar staff. Lame auto gratuity - service charge policy."}
{"text":"Adorable small restaurant with a small restaurant feel. Employees take great pride in their work."}
{"text":"OK this place is very good. Have the flank steak was absolutely delectable with some really cool fries. It's not the least expensive that I have run into however you will not be disappointed with the quality of the meal"}
{"text":"you know, todds just never disappoints...from the first moment you step in, the greeting is warm, the seating is great...the intimate feel...then the libations, watermelon martini-truly delightful, the wine selection, great and by the glass very nice!  the food, oh the food...always delicious...the serve staff-truly friendly without any stuffiness...one of my very favorite places to be!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, reasonably priced. Scallops with mushroom mashed potatoes were superb!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to the North Green Valley area and we were eager to try out some of the restaurants in our area. We stumbled upon Todd's via Yelp. We had from friends/co-workers about how great this place was but never really had a chance to go. Well, last week we finally did and we were impressed. 
First off, while the location and restaurant decor may seem a tad ordinary and boring, the food is NOT!! We went on a Monday and it was fairly slow so we were seated right away. The waiter let us know about the specials and then let us peruse the menu. For appetizers we opted for the goat cheese wontons and a salad that we would both share. For the main course, I opted for the NY Strip steak while my wife had the Filet. Our meal started with the won tons and the spinach salad with almonds and blueberries. My wife and I planned on sharing it so the waiter offered to split it, which was nice. The salad was amazing and the won tons were divine! So good that when the fifth one was left on the plate, my wife said, \"Should we split that last one?\" to which I replied, \"Of course!!\" Our main dishes were fabulous. Our steaks were cooked just right. I paired my steak with a wine that the waiter recommended and it was perfection! All in all, we both rated our meals \"five-stars.\"
About the only gripe I would have would be the portions. My main entree was huge while my wife's looked much smaller. It ended up working out perfectly for both of us, but had our orders been reversed, it would have been disappointing. But don't let that minor quibble prevent you from visiting. We look forward to our next visit to Todd's Unique Dining."}
{"text":"Continuing the theme of previous post, this is another \"old\" review.

For whatever reason, I tried to come up with a \"local\" joint in Las Vegas that my friend (who lived there her whole life minus college years) did not know/hear about.  After some poking around the internet, I came up with this place (if I remember correctly, on citysearch).

From what I can remember, it's not too terribly far from the strip area.  But then again, I wasn't driving and we may have left from her house, not the hotel... so my estimate could be way off.  Check the map =D

While I liked the \"local\" feel of the restaurant (this was my first not-on-strip dining experience in Vegas), I didn't think the food was all that great.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't like bad food... just nothing special.  And for tourists, it's definitely not worth it to drive/cab off the strip to dine here."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of this place. Maybe it was the limited menu on Valentines day. We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation time. we were seated shortly after our set time. I would say this is a restaurant that is VERY popular with the older crowd. The choice was small.. option wise of the menu.
but I will give it another shot on a non-holiday!! The bartender, hostess and servers were all friendly. but the wait time for the food was a little long.

The Quality of the food. was good. I enjoyed my steak and veggies. 
They accept cash and credit cards."}
{"text":"I had big expectations. People love this place. I liked it.  I was told I had to get the wonton appetizer. It was good but the sauce was too sweet. That seemed to be the theme throughout the meal: overly sweet sauces that over powered the dish.  Service was good. Ambiance was very similar to the Italian restaurant that was in there years ago."}
{"text":"*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2018 Menu ***

I've been going to try Todd's Unique for a couple of years on recommendations from some friends.  I chose this for my first Restaurant Week 2018 dinner.

There is one menu online for $30.18 but they have a second for $40.18 when you go there with some more choices.  I went with the higher priced menu.  For my three courses, I ordered:  beef carpaccio with lemon oil and parmesan, boneless short rib, and what they call \"Killer chocolate cake and blackberry sauce.\"

I was brought my iced tea quickly by Sheena, my server, and she refilled the glass several times during the meal.  She told me the bread would be out of the oven shortly and she brought me a bread basket with two slices of garlic bread and two pieces of focaccia with soft butter.

In a short time she brought me my appetizer of beef carpaccio.  Standard carpaccio except for the lemon oil squeezed over the beef.  There were also some greens for a small salad with the beef.  Not a bad starter.

The boneless short rib was very good.  It was tender, no knife needed--the way it should be.  The beef was on a small bed of mashed potatoes and it was steaming hot when brought to the table.  The gravy was very rich.

Dessert was a bit of a let down.  I expected a \"killer\" of a cake.  What I got was a small round dish with chocolate cake (not a killer by any means) and it had some blackberry jelly in the center that melted in the warm cake.  It was OK but it was no killer.

I'm glad I finally made it to Todd's.  I am intrigued by two items on their regular menu.  It may be worth a trip back to try one of those.  

Service was excellent.  Sheena was my main server but there was another woman there who seated me and got the dinner started."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place out to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. I'm always a little weary when it comes to \"unique\" dining since I'm a fan of the old ways. This restaurant truly shocked me and the food was great. The staff were very friendly and even surprised us with a mini dessert gift for our anniversary. My wife and I plan on coming back here whenever we're in the mood for semi-fine dining or celebrations"}
{"text":"First of all, I love Todd's because the food is excellent, the service is excellent, and it's a fancy restaurant that's locally owned and down the street from my house. I love that they host wine and beer dinners regularly and that the menu is constantly rotating. I also enjoy that Todd has come out and made the rounds every time we've been in. It feels like a true local spot.

However, I have one comment to Todd/staff. My husband wanted to do something special for his bday this year, so we attended the February wine dinner (apologies for my tardiness in this review). The food was really good (until dessert, which was just ok), but the wines kinda sucked. Also, it was no bargain - at $120/head, it was one of Todd's pricier wine dinners.

Not sure if it was the fault of Todd or the winemaker, but I think it's tough for anybody to do an entire meal pairing consisting of only zinfandel blends. It's probably my own fault for not doing more research on the winery/wines to see what we would be having, but I put full trust in Todd. We were treated to scallops (yum) paired with a zin blend (weird). Salad with a zin blend. Salmon with a zin blend, short ribs with a zin blend, and finally a cannoli with a zin blend. Honestly, I tried the last 2 wines just to see if something had changed. I was so so so excited leading up to this dinner. The food and service did not disappoint, but the wines fell way short. Too bad!"}
{"text":"It needs to be said.  This place looks like your grandma's tacky vacation home.  But if you can get past the terrible decor and less than stellar atmosphere, the food is really, really good.  Probably 4.5 stars, but I'm feeling generous!  

Started with the calamari and grumpy's salad.  Both were solid.  For my entree, I had the Ahi tuna with wasabi mashed potatoes.  Holy awesome ahi.  This was so good.  The tuna was cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were creamy with just the right amount of wasabi.  The price of this culinary suprise was a welcome change from the exorbitant prices you find on the strip.  I rarely venture out into Henderson anymore, but I may make the trip more frequently for Todd's.  Seriously though, the color scheme has got to go."}
{"text":"We stayed in Henderson at the M Hotel for the first time and decided to try someting off strip.  We were very glad we made this decision.  It was by far our best meal in vegas.   Outstanding service, presentation and taste.  Don't let the location and the basic initial appearance of the place cause you to second guess this place -- OUTSTANDING.

We had the Steak with Black Bean Chili sauce and fries -- very spicy and very good.  Also had Sea Bass with jalapeno mashed potatoes and that was wonderful too.  The Won Ton and Dumpling appetizers were fantastic as was the \"Grumpy\" salad.   We were rushed a little to get to a show and didnt get to stay for the final dessert but they had a cobbler and some bread pudding that sounded great.

Todd even came out and greeted us and we very friendly and down to earth.  Appreciated his personal touch.  

Highly recommend this place!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were in town for Thanksgiving and staying off the strip for a change so I wanted to use that as an opportunity to try a good local's place. Did some quick research on my phone and I was reminded of Todd's and that I've been wanting to try it for a while. 
The place is in some random strip mall as many Vegas places are. Nothing too impressive about that or the decor. As people mentioned earlier, it is a little old school 80s but it didn't really bother me too much. It was definitely pretty packed for a Saturday night. 
We ordered the much hyped goat cheese won-tons to start. They were pretty good but honestly not as unique as I was thinking they would be. I'm a huge goat cheese fan but these honestly didn't taste too different than regular cream cheese won-tons I've had at other places. 
Its been a few months now so I can't remember too clearly what I ordered but I believe it was some type of fish. I know I cleaned my plate and it was good but nothing too memorable. Same reaction for dessert. 
That being said, the service here was great. Todd is always there working as the chef which is very rare in strip restaurants. His wife was our server and she was very friendly, telling us the story of how Todd started the restaurant and all the places he worked before. We definitely appreciated this personal touch. 
All in all, this wasn't a bad dining experience however it didn't really live up to my expectations. Perhaps its because I've had such great experiences at other off strip Vegas dining spots such as Firefly and Grimaldi's. If I lived in Henderson, perhaps I would go to this place again. I might even hit it up if I'm in the area. However since I wasn't blown away, I think next time I have the chance to dine off strip I might use the opportunity to go somewhere I haven't tried."}
{"text":"We went to Todd's for my birthday, we came away very happy and will return in the future.  I'd like to give 5 stars all around but because of a couple of technical hiccups, 4 is probably more accurate on the night we visited:

We brought our own wine, Wednesday being free corkage night as long as it's not a bottle they have on the list.  It turned out their list was pretty decent, and moderate prices, not the crazy markups quite common these days.

We started with the dumplings, 5 or 6 delicious super thin wrapped pot-stickers with a soy dipping sauce.  Yummo!

Next the waiter happily split a Caesar salad for us.  Not very big portions and fairly bland, but a good segue to the main course.

My girlfriend got the New Zealand Blue Nose Bass in a light caper and artichoke sauce, hold the capers.  Unfortunately the fish was a little overcooked, but as a meal with the veggies and mash it was still delicious.

I got the \"skirt steak on fire\".  I'm English, the hottest curries in the U.S. wouldn't even count as mild in England, but WOW, this skirt steak was HOT.  It comes with chili fries with black bean sauce, sounds crazy but it works.  Deeee-licious.  However, I asked for it medium rare but it came out too rare, making some of the steak a bit stringy and tougher.  I didn't send it back, but would probably go nearer medium next time.

For dessert the birthday boy was given a free, but little, take on Tiramisu, an excellent end to a \"Unique\" meal.

It's not so easy these days to find a chef willing to be creative and take a few risks.  Not perfect execution on the night we went, but still plenty good enough for us to return."}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious, as Todd always does a great job in the kitchen. If the surf and turf is available, try it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times, and each time the dining room was packed.  We overdid it a little bit on our last visit, two covers coming to about 250 with the tip, but the experience was great.  Our food and server were excellent.  Todd came out towards the end of our meal and chatted us up, letting us know about his menu and some upcoming events.  Great off-strip locals dining if you are willing to set aside the dated decor and focus on the food and service."}
{"text":"We found Todd's via the Internet. We were tired of dining on the strip.  Whack, home run. It is an easy drive and easy to navigate to from the strip. My wife had a steel-head trout special and I had very spicy skirt steak.  It used a fair amount of peppers and was hot but not overpowering.   Both were delicious.  The chef is very creative with spicing and presentation.  

Also worth the short trip was the \"Grumpy's Blue Cheese Iceberg Salad\".  Shredded iceberg with onion slices, tomatoes and chunks of blue cheese with a mayonnaise sauce.  

The place was packed, so we ended up seated for dinner at the bar.  The other diners were local residents and really spoke highly of the Todd's. 

We will eat here again on our next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great for a celebration or simply a nice dinner,  phenomenal  wine list.  The short rib was so tender and meaty. The menu was varied and the service was  superb."}
{"text":"Todd's Unique Dining was such an amazing experience m. Food was perfect, atmosphere was awesome and the service was amazing. Great secret place!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to Todd's for quite a while.  I had heard so many wonderful things about it.  My husband and I were a little underwhelmed.  The appetizers and cocktails were fabulous!  The crab cake with curry sauce was delicious.  The ahi tuna was fantastic and the goat cheese wontons were yummy. My husband ordered the Whiskey Smash cocktail and I ordered the watermelon martini, both were excellent.  I had the beet salad, which was mediocre.  For dinner I had the spare ribs, which tasted like a regular old pot roast.  My husband had the halibut.  It was dry and overcooked.  All in all it was a nice dinner.  I would go back for cocktails and appetizers, but not for dinner.  With so many amazing restaurants in Las Vegas, this one missed the mark a bit."}
{"text":"After finding out that all of my 'friends' had other family in to spend thanksgiving with I found myself with the situation of fending for myself on thanksgiving dinner so I made a reservation to partake in Todd's Prix fix special event Thanksgiving Menu.

I arrived a half hour early and contemplated sitting in the car or entering... I ended up entering and the hostess who was very nice told me that she'd have me seated in 5 minutes. 

After I was seated I was promptly greeted by my waitress Kylee R. she was very friendly and accommodating and even though I was by myself she made me feel welcome. 

I ordered an Ice tea which had tropical flavorings added it seemed bitter at first but sugar made it taste way better.

I went with the butternut squash soup based on Kylee's Recommendation and I have to agree that it was very fantastic, flavorful and you could taste that hint of honey and truffle in the background of the main ingredients. I liked it.

I of course had to choose the Free Range Petaluma Organic Hand carved Roast Turkey Dinner that came with White and Dark Roasted Turkey, Giblet Gravy, Sweet sausage stuffing, roasted Brussels sprouts, haricot vert, mashed potato and brown sugar sweet potatoes since it didn't seem right to order a steak tonight. 

The turkey was melt-in-your mouth delicious, and the giblet gravy was fantastic. I of course asked for an extra helping of gravy because I'm one of those people that likes to make sure it's dead and drowned in the stuff!

I found the 'sweet' sausage stuffing to be abnormally spicy though and it actually put a stop to my dinner for a moment as I must have gotten a really spicy piece of sausage that managed to make it's way into the 'sweet' batch... Either that or TODD is trying to be unique by saying it's \"sweet\" and instead watching you spit fire while he giggles in his office watching the cameras.... 

The mashed taters sweet potatoes Brussels Sprouts and Haricot Vert were good and flavorful as well. My only gripe is that it says \"sprouts\" and not sprout! I could have eaten another three or twenty of them, it was that good! 

Dessert was a Crisp Cinnamon Apple Tart and Pumpkin Pie Timbale which both were of course fantastic and I was stuffed and finished at the end of this... 

So why the 1 star off you might be asking? well it's quite simple... I am not a fan of loud boisterous cursing every minute (GD this and GD that and F this and No S that.) there was a table with an extremely loud overly intoxicated individual that was clearly thinking that he was at his house instead of out in public and none of the employees let him know that his language or boisterous exaggerations were inappropriate. there should have been some kind of customer control going on there, Kylee had mentioned it and apologized to me that it was happening before I left and I accepted it and thanked her very much.

Overall-This experience was great though and I would like to return on a non-holiday to try the regular menu, so thanks Todd, and Kylee for providing this soul a good thanksgiving meal when it had nowhere else to go. (Pictures added)"}
{"text":"I came here some time ago for dinner with my husband. I had wanted to try Todd's for some time, checking out their website and drooling over the video demos they have. 
I must say that the dining room looks kind of dated and the booth where we sat was not very comfortable. But I was encouraged to see that everybody seemed to be having a great time so I relaxed. 

We started off with the goat cheese wonton which was super good, then I chose skirt steak for my entrée and the hubby chose the short rib. Both were fantastic. The skirt steak is frickin' awesome, they serve it with chili cheese fries, holy cow! This dish is hearty hearty! We both ordered cocktails cannot recall which ones, and neither of us liked them. I would say be safe and choose beer or wine. Anyway, who orders chili cheese fries, steak and a cocktail? Get a beer dammit!

What I found particularly thoughtful is that Chef Clore came out an stopped at every table throughout the evening to check and see how their meal was, including ours. It's that fantastic service that will keep people coming back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"So cute it's such a gem absolutely loved it great food and service was like being on the strip but very quaint great for dates"}
{"text":"I would give Todd's more than five stars if that was an option. This has been my favorite restaurant in town since I moved to Las Vegas two years ago. It's my favorite for not only food, but for the consistently great service.

I've never had anything here that was less than excellent. My favorite entree is the skirt steak on fire. To die for! It is the spice and flavor I crave with a nice tender steak. The fries served alongside complement the steak nicely. All of the desserts are amazing, but the butterscotch pudding is my favorite because it's not only delicious, but unique as well. I love that the cobbler flavors change seasonally and make a nice finish to a meal as well. The scallop entree is quite remarkable as well, perfectly prepared with a tasty sauce applied in the perfect amount. The drinks are always delicious as well. When watermelon is seasonal they make a great watermelon martini with fresh watermelon."}
{"text":"I hate to be one of the few people that wasn't overly impressed here. I heard about this place years ago and finally came in and perhaps my expectations were overly high but I was completely underwhelmed. I ordered the beef carpaccio and the scallops and both were rather bland and uninspiring. Others in my dining party really enjoyed themselves, one ordered the Mahi Mahi special and was very pleased with it, the other ordered the Meatloaf and really raved about it. I will say that the staff was amazing and really on the ball with everything so definitely no complaints at all with that."}
{"text":"Consistently great service and food quality! We are big fans of Todd's and can always count on having a great experience. The tuna is my favorite entree."}
{"text":"There is a reason Todd cooks in Henderson and not in LV.  That said, the food was passable, but nothing extraordinary or unique."}
{"text":"My husband & I went here on a Tuesday night around 7pm, and the place was PACKED. We didn't have a reservation so we had to sit at the bar. I took this to be a really good indication of the food.

The restaurant itself seemed to be in an odd location. Sort of in a strip mall. So, nothing flashy about it, but looks can be SO decieving!!!

The service is some of the absolute BEST I have ever seen. Every single person that passed us while we were waiting to be seated asked if we had been helped. And, since we ended up sitting at the bar, we got to see that Mark (the bartender) knew many of the patrons by name as well as their \"usual\" orders. I thought that was pretty impressive!

So, the food. I ordered a teryaki halibut whic came with coconut rice & baby bok choy. I asked to sub the bok choy for mashed sweet potato & they mixed it up and sub'd the rice instead. I was a little sad about missing out on the rice because I had been looking forward to trying it, but I didn't have them correct it. The fish, was OUTSTANDING!! It was a good size portion, cooked perfectly, great flavor. Hands down one of my top 10 meals EVER.

My husband had the \"steak on fire\" which was skirt steak marinated in various peppers & served with fries. I didn't try it since I am not into spicy, but he loved it.

I had a cantaloupe martini which was awesome. For these 2 dishes & drink (along w/ soda & iced tea) came to about $80...and worth EVERY penny!!

CHECK OUT TODD'S!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times, how did I forget to review it?  Unforgivable!

the quick:
love love love the food. the food is my master!
friendly, courteous and feels like family!
very quaint restaurant, good for special occasional or casual upscale dining!

Thanks OpenTable for helping find Todd's!  Being off the strip it's hard to come upon this eatery at random.

Todd's Skirt Steak & Black Bean Chili Fries.  This is all that needs to be said. Get it. It's good, so very good.

I stacked my friends and brought them out here as well and everyone was quite happy with what they ordered.  The menu changes from season to season so it's difficult to say what is great to have but the skirt steak is a staple of his menu.  Other items I recall having are wasabi mash which is quite tasty and the ahi tuna tar tar, which is served on crispy rice squares.  Very good as well.

Todd's isn't the least expensive option available to you but the food is top notch for what you pay.  I've always been happy when I left.  Thanks for great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Great place hidden in small strip.  Real local joint, though there is no doubt lots of locals have no idea this is here!!!"}
{"text":"Todd's always lives up to its name...VERY UNIQUE!!  I love it here.  The food, the service, the atmosphere are always as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"On a recent busy weekend evening, when I complained that I'd waited 15 minutes for the appetizer, apparently a head waitress curtly informed me it \"had only been 10 minutes, I know, I timed it\".  When I questioned this unbelievable response, she gave me \"an excuse me?\".  I almost walked out.  This woman should have been fired on the spot. 

The food is good, but on the night I was there, the service was rushed, impersonal, rude (see above), and not appropriate for the pretentiousness of the menu.

Todd's is a welcome change from Strip mega-restaurants, but the space on weekends is too small, the servers can be harried, and the experience less than optimal.

The prices are high, which probably give the average Henderson/Las Vegas diner some comfort that  are truly dining high-end.  However, gourmet dining involves more than a creative, expensive menu.  It must also include a comfortable, relaxed space:  my seat was under a very cold vent which was slow to be turned down even after I complained.  Comfort is not something the customer should have to ask for at these prices!  The servers should be relaxed and confident, but mine was harried and inexperienced.  The kitchen was slammed and pretty far behind.   

Hey Todd, remove some tables, add some senior servers and tell them to slow down and relax, don't rudely confront the guests when the kitchen is under pressure, and Todd's would be a better place, especially during high volume times.

As stated by an earlier review of Todd's (see below), the thing this tight little place is lacking is ambience and genuine warmth."}
{"text":"My husband and I met his sister and her husband here for dinner when we were in Vegas for a brief break over Christmas. 

One caveat:  Due to illness, I was unable to drink and my diet was a bit restricted.  That said, here's what we experienced. 

Great service. Good wine recommendations (I didn't drink, the rest of the table did).  

I had never had steelhead before, had always wanted to try it, and asked the waiter  if I should have that or the regular trout, telling him that I didn't like fishy fish.  He said the steelhead was a better choice.  I was pretty impressed!  Very good, mild fish. I'd compare to a mild salmon. Not over cooked. Well presented.  My husband had the short ribs:  fantastic fall off the bone meat.  Hubby and shared a dessert, which, I cannot for the life of me remember. 

Suffice to say, nice spot. Tucked into a strip mall.  We'd come back if back in the area.   

Oh and it was pretty quiet for such a small place.  Not a place for kids, IMO."}
{"text":"An eclectic restaurant.   Remember when you were taught to eat a balanced meal?  They usually don't serve a balanced meal.  Maybe if they offered some sides (eg mac&cheese, green beans, asparagus. twice baked potato) the meals you get there could be real meals instead of the scimpy partial meals  you often get.

They offer a caesar salad.  It should be offered as \"Hearts of Romaine with a non-caesar dressing but with an Italian Vinegerrete. IOW, their caesar salad is very serious disappointing if you like regular caesar salad."}
{"text":"One of my foodie friends has always chastised me for not trying this restaurant and I finally tried it last night. I am so glad I did. It's small and it was a little warm when we got there but I am so glad I went. First we started with the wontons which were really amazing. I don't normally like wontons but these were crispy and savory and were really good. I got the short rib which is a favorite of mine to order at restaurants especially when the meat is as tender as it was a Todd's. But I really really have to say that this portion was humongous one of the biggest portions of short ribs I have ever seen. I was so happy to eat it last night and I'll be happy to eat it again tomorrow night. It came with jalapeno mash potatoes which I don't know how Todd did this but he managed to get all of the flavor of jalapeno and not an over amount of the spice of the jalapeno. One of the best things I have ever tasted in my life. When I asked for my meal to be boxed I really really wanted to box it myself because I have this strange feeling that I'm the only one that could box it exactly the way I wanted it and I wanted every drop of that delectable sauce in my box. I just have to trust that they got it all in for me. We had two desserts to share between five people it was the brownie and the peach cobbler. I will come back to Todd's because the menu was fantastic it changes seasonally I was told by the waitress who was incredibly knowledgeable and very attentive and I am dying to try the scallops!!!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been back in years but decided to give it a try during restaurant week last evening.
Enjoyed a great meal that was very nicely priced  along with excellent service.  
We won't wait so long next time. Ciao"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a week or so ago on a recommendation. Was not disappointed. I had the signature skirt steak and fries which isn't how your mom made it, very flavorful, spicy, I couldn't finish  the plate but wanted to. My wife had the scallops which was also fantastic. Don't let the location fool you, if in Vegas GO!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for the past eight years.  The food and service is as good as just about anywhere on the Strip.  I have a hard time straying from the Kobe Short ribs but when I do, I'm still very pleased.   The Martinis here are unbelievable too."}
{"text":"While the food was okay, it was nothing outstanding and it certainly didn't seem unique - except for dessert size which was uniquely huge..."}
{"text":"Owner/chef Todd Clure celebrated the restaurant's 11th year anniversary by sending out $20 off 2 entrees' coupons via emails to his regulars including yours truly. We received a bread basket with 2 types of butter. We next shared a pear and blue cheese salad that included cranberries with a fig balsamic dressing that proved to be refreshing.  Todd is noted for bringing in seasonal fresh fish and so my wife ordered the evening's special of Pacific swordfish with couscous.  My entree was Alaskan halibut in an artichoke and caper sauce accompanied by bok choy and a decorative mix of fresh herbs and vegetables.  Hers was very good, mine was excellent."}
{"text":"I had a multimillionaire take me here for a business meeting after wanting to list his home. 
I loved it! 
I will forever remember these amazing cream cheese duck wontons 
It was the highlight of my week! 
I ordered a fish dinner and orange Grey goose 

I have wanted to come back and tried to replicate the wontons 
Didn't work out well 

This is a nice hole in the wall. 
I liked this very much! 
I believe my client had ordered fish 
I don't remember 
I did find parking 

Right in front 
Service was good, he was a young Latino man. 
And man those wontons!!!!!!! Ugh 
Amazing 
Must order"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Yelp... I drive by this place everyday but if it weren't for Yelp, I never would have come across it! My husband and I were looking for a new place for a date night that we hadn't already been to a million times and didn't have to spend $500 to enjoy ourselves! We came across Todd's Unique Dining on Yelp and after seeing their great reviews, decided to try it out! What an amazing dinner we had! The restaurant has dimmed lighting (very romantic), our service was amazing and our food was perfectly cooked.
Even though this place might not catch your eye as you drive by it, it is definitely worth dining at!"}
{"text":"I remember this place being ALOT better the first time I  tried it a few years ago. This time it was just OK. First of all, this restaurant is not kid friendly at all.  I wish we would've known that bc they didn't even have a high chair for our 1 year old so he had to stand in the booth with us the whole time.  I had the steak on fire. It was just OK. He had the short rib. It was just OK. We had a couple of apps too, but I can't remember what. And that is kinda how our  meal was... Forgettable. For dessert we had some kind of salted caramel custard thing. It was waaay too sweet.  I don't think we'll be going back. 3 stars is being generous."}
{"text":"There was much hype to this restaurant from friends and reviews and I looked forward to eating at Todd's with friends.
Decor and presentation of all the foods were great!  
Hubby ordered the short ribs and I the sea bass with the Ahi Tuna tartar as the appetizer...desert was the wonderful bread pudding.
Waiter and service was great, too!
My friends and hubby would probably give Todd's 4 stars.  If I knew how to put 1/2 a star, I would rate it 3.5 stars.
The problem?  The Sea Bass was overcooked and dry.  I did not like it at all.  
I would probably go back and give them another try.  I know hubby would go again..."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly people here. I have had their halibut and several of their salads before. Everything tasted great. This is a good spot for a date or for a nicer family outing. Intimate dining room. Ask for a booth when you make your reservation!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here on Valentine's Day. Even though there was a wait with a reservation, that was offset by the professional, friendly staff. The menu features familiar favorites with a twist. We started off with the dumplings. They had great flavor. Then we ordered pork chops and the salmon for the entrees. The pork chops were great, and the salmon was absolutely decadent. 5 star food, 4 star wait. I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've been twice now. The food is good. Nothing spectacular. The wine list is fabulous.

I was horrified when I found out that the butter they brought with the bread was not butter, but half-margarine and half-butter. When I go to a gourmet restaurant, I expect real butter. I can't imagine why they would go to the trouble to make a special concoction of butter/margarine whip.  Margarine is just a few molecules from plastic. 

To their credit, when I asked the waiter to bring out real butter, he did. 

The whole margarine thing makes me wonder what else they are doing in the kitchen.

With all the other great restaurants in Vegas, I don't see a reason to eat at Todd's. If they nix the margarine, I would go back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for years and decided it was a great place for date night. This place is truly a hidden gem.

The server was very friendly and helpful.

We had the Razor Clams special as an appetizer, its one of my favorite foods in the world. He treated them with so much respect. They were perfectly cooked and wonderful.

I had the duck and she had the halibut. Both were also perfectly cooked.

The waitress came out with some Brachetto as an after dinner drink which was a great touch

We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Had our wedding dinner here with a few friends and it was amazing! We spent a good amount of time choosing a place that met our needs: great tasting food, ambiance fit for an event as special as our wedding, and a location close to our local posse.  Reading about how Todd started the business was also perfect.  Supporting local talent is always a good goal.  The wine list was an exceptional illustration of great taste paired with sensible value.  They even had a biodynamic wine from my hometown.  A great place!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice. Once with Mom, once with my girlfriend. Each experience was unique. Each experience provided superb service and fantastic food. Go there to enjoy a meal for a beautiful evening out."}
{"text":"I swear I reviewed this place, guess I forgot.  We visited a few months ago and it was great.  A small, cozy place with an old style feel.  The appetizers were amazing, including very fresh oysters.  I had the skirt steak \"on fire\" and it was fantastic.  It actually had some spice to it.  Everyone enjoyed the meal, the waitress was friendly and professional.  A nice place to visit in that part of town."}
{"text":"A+! Went here for the first time on one of their Sunday Wine Dinners and was not disappointed!! Definitely wouldn't expect the quality food that comes out of this place in a random strip mall location. I'm still DREAMING about the braised short rib and chile shrimp and grits. 


PRO TIP: Wednesday there's no corkage fee when you bring wine!"}
{"text":"The Short ribs I had were perfect. Packed with flavor and fall of the bone good.

Make sure to start your meal with some goat cheese won-tons.

everything we had was great. We ended up playing \"musical chairs\" with our entrees so we could try a bit of everything because all 8 of us were raving about our food.

Go Eat Here!"}
{"text":"Christmas Eve was a disaster. An hour wait beyond reservation time. The staff appeared overwhelmed because there were too many people. The food was OK but not worth the price. And there wasn't much of it. Left disappointed and hungry."}
{"text":"\"Absolutely Amazing\"
Last night was our 2nd time at Todd's.  We have decided that this is our go to place for special occasions or if we want an amazing meal without all the pretense of some of the restaurants on the strip.  One of the appetizer specials of the day was a gruyere onion tart....Absolutely Amazing!  For dinner I had one of the specials.....Gumbo.....consisting of three different shrimps, lobster, and a host of other goodies that made it also Absolutely Amazing!!!  For dessert I had the special of the day which was an apple cobbler with homemade cinnamon ice cream......you know what I'm going to say.....Absolutely Amazing!!!  My husband had the Grumpy Salad which he loved and he had the Gnocchi dish which he devoured!  For desert he had the bread pudding which he said was probably the best he has ever had, and he is a huge bread pudding lover.  
Our waitress, Terry, had some time to chat with us, which was very nice.  The atmosphere is casual and conducive to having a conversation without having to talk over the blaring music or other noisy distractions as you might find in some of the chain restaurants.
The key to any business is repeat business.  We will definitely be going back to Todd's for our next special occasion or for one of the beer tasting nights....or maybe we'll go back just because!"}
{"text":"We hit up Todd's for our anniversary.  As most note, it's pretty unassuming in a strip mall location.  But, a lot of gems can be found in similar locales.  The wine list was not huge, but very reasonable.  Love being off the strip and seeing prices on wine and scotch....

Their menu changes, but I had the short rib and my wife had the scallops.  Both were winners.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, and have that velvety texture they can get.  The short rib was beyond tender.  I didn't need a fork to cut them, much less a knife.  And, the portions were REASONABLE.  We got full, but we weren't miserable.

It's a great romantic place, we will return.  Service was good, not fantastic, but also didn't take away from the meal.  I think Todd's is my new favorite off-Strip restaurant since Rosemary's closed."}
{"text":"Great dinner tonight. Crab wontons, crab stuffed mahi mahi, duck, soup. Great service!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best Ahi tuna I've ever had. Terry took amazing care of us, and the personal touch of Todd and her make it a place you'll want to come back to time and time again. 

The wasabi mashed potatoes with my entree were incredible, and the wine list extensive. 

A hidden gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Just walking up to this office park building you are expecting a weird little place, when you walk in it only reinforces that expectation and when you open the menu things kind of change. The selections change daily so who knows what you'll see but on this Friday night everything looks good.

I ordered the Kobe short rib that you could tell was cooked right when I never touched a knife the entire time. My wife got the halibut which was equally flaky and delicious.

We had a $50 gift card and if my wife wasn't a wino I don't think we would have had to shell out anything but a tip for the attentive server.

All in all it was a great dinner and I'd reccomend this place to anyone who likes good food and doesn't care about being at a \"hot spot\""}
{"text":"Just found out about Todd's and had to try it out

Food was Great -5 Stars
Service was Good- 4 .3 Stars
No Table cloths and booth seating for 50$ a person -3 Stars 



Todd's Unique dining - Most Unique dishes in Henderson"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place since shortly after we moved to Henderson in 2010 & we finally got around to trying it last night. 
We were able to get a reservation for 6:45 about an hour before which was nice. I think we've tried to go on 2 other occasions & each time, there was no availability. 
First thing I noticed walking in was the  decor. It has a very casual, 80's diner theme & not what I was expecting for a nicer, upscale restaurant. The very nice hostess seated us in a booth which turned out to be very uncomfortable. Nothing worse than an uncomfortable booth! 
We started with the Dungeness crab cake appetizer & tuna tartar on crispy rice. The tuna was spot on, really delicious. But I think you could serve dog food to me on crispy rice & I would still think it was delicious. That crispy rice is becoming an addiction that could get very out of control! The Dungeness crab was a big disappointment. The cake itself was way too mushy & the accompanying curry sauce was too strong. It's almost like they just made the sauce & added some curry to it. I think the key to cooking/eating curry is to toast or sauté it before using it to flavor whatever dish you're making with it. 
For dinner, hubby got the petite filet & I got the scallops. Hubby's filet was perfect, cooked exactly like he likes it, rare, & served along with pesto mashed potatoes & a delicious sauce. My scallops were good & cooked perfectly as well but my mashed potatoes were way too dry & just ended up being a disappointing afterthought. 
All in all, our meal was good but I guess I was expecting more & that always tends to leave me disappointed. We will prob try them again but I don't think we'll rush back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Finally was on this side of town to give it a go.

Let me start off saying that from the pictures on Yelp, I could not tell that this was a \"fancy\" restaurant.  What I mean, is that the setting is very low lit, and quiet.  There was only 3-4 other tables there at the time, so this could be part of the reason.  So you can understand how I felt out of place with my little one....

They do NOT expect you to bring kids....they do NOT have booster seats or highchairs.  Good thing my little foodie baby loves to eat, and is well mannered...most of the time anyways ;)

Now that I have that out of the way, on to the food!

We tried the crab cake and tuna tartare.  The crab cake was good, but I am jaded with Del Frisco's and I still order them.  The tuna tartare was good, with a little spice from the hot sauce, however the consistency of the tuna was kind of mushy, and not like the tartare that I am used to (thick cuts of fish).  This was more of a blended/smashed consistency....not bad, but it was a little distracting personally.

Went with the duck and the sea bass.  This is what they do well here!  The duck was crazy tender, and did not have the slightest \"gammy\" taste that one would expect with most duck.  The sauce was packed with flavor and the sides were all delicious.  The sea bass was super tender, and cooked perfectly.  The flavor was great as well!

Went with the bread pudding and it was good.  Not mind blowing, but it was good nonetheless.  We also tried some of their dessert wine on the house, which was a very nice touch.

Only other thing I would slightly complain about...the prices here are a little substantial.  I have paid quite a bit more for food, so don't get me wrong, but each app was $11-12 and most of the entrees are $25-30 each.  You are going to spend at least $50-60pp even without alcohol IMO, which to be fair is still a good deal here, but I feel like it goes a little farther elsewhere in town.

Still have to give it a go!  Maybe I will come back for a prix fixe menu"}
{"text":"I had high hopes, went for my birthday, and it was just an okay meal.   The ambiance really ruined things.    The booths aren't comfortable...they basically force you to sit up straight.  The lighting is too bright.   The service is much slower than it should be (aka you guys could have made more on wine) the food was good, but not quite as great as I expected."}
{"text":"Delicious burger. Bar is cute. I will be back! It is a little pricy, so its a little more of a special occasion place."}
{"text":"Starting with service, very nice, attentive and quick with every thing we needed. The atmosphere was decent. The booths seemed more fitting for a cafe but the lighting was dim, the bar was pretty.

Now on to the food. I had the lamb with a beat/yam puree and it was perfect! Meat was tender, puree was smooth and the blueberry sauce complimented it all well. My husband had the jalapeno beef skirt. The meat was very well prepared with just enough heat. The fries were also good but the only critique was there could be less fries and add some vegetables.

Prices were reasonable, good wine selection too. We will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Todd's before and I knew I had to try this place once and for all. Thankfully Todd is participating in Restaurant Week so I'm taking full advantage. I made reservations on a slow Thursday evening at 5pm for 2 people. My date didnt show it until 5:45pm.... so I ordered a Pear Martini in the meantime. For Restaurant Week you chose from two pricing options $30 or $40. The main different were \"upgraded\" appetizers and entree. Example instead of the petite fillet you can upgrade to the braised short rib. 

Service: 5/5 Everyone including the hostesses was very kind and was very patient with me while I waited 45 mins for my friend to arrive. The wait time between the appetizer and the entree was as little long but I was in good company so I didnt mind to much.

Quality vs quantity: 5/5 For the amount of food i received for $30 is crazy! Very high quality of meant for a very reasonable price.

I would recommend this restaurant and ask that you order the braised short rib. It was literally the size of my face and just fell apart because it was so tender."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how close this place was to me and never dined here.  We had reservations for 6.  
The service was great and attentive. The food was delicious.  I had the rainbow trout  and it was so good.  The regular house salad was delicious, too.  And their apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream was wonderful. 

This place is wonderful to not only dine but have a relaxing dinner and to chat with your family and friends. 

I think our group ended up leaving after they closed and not one time did the employees disturb or rushed us out. Actually when we realized we were passed closing we got up to be respectful. As we chatted outside, our waitress came after us to thank us for dining with them. Very classic. 

It's located right across from TGIFridays."}
{"text":"We first tried this place for the $30 restaurant week meal. The service was the best service I've ever had anywhere in Las Vegas and the food was great, but not without flaws here and there. We both enjoyed grumpy's salad (like a wedge salad but already chopped up for you!) and my trout was spectacular. My husband got the steak and it was pretty bad - chewy and nothing special. Dessert was beautifully presented and tasty (a chocolate flourless cake if memory serves). Overall a 4, but not a 5 star dinner. It was $30, however, and it WAS restaurant week, so I went back a few weeks ago determined to have the 5 star evening I was determined Todd's could deliver! 

Todd's had sent out an email about how they were one of a few restaurants to get one of the first early shipments of King Crabs this year. I'm a huge crab freak, so I was more than eager to try them. They were sold in 2 or 3 lb dinners at market price ($65ish if memory serves). My husband and I shared this and it was TONS of crab. My husband's family is from Maryland my family is from New Orleans so we're pretty big on crab. Most of the buffet crabs here I find pretty disgusting, and I was eager to have a crab dinner that lived up to my standards! The crab here was phenomenal. I've had king crab many times before but this was by far the best I'd ever had. This crab was fresh off the boat (just 2 days before!) and had never been frozen. Flavor and texture was flawless. I never thought I'd eat the best crab in my life in freaking Henderson, NV, but this happens to be the case !

Other than the mediocre steak during restaurant week, everything about this place has been flawless over our 2 visits. The decor is very dated, but the service and food more than make up for it!"}
{"text":"While the food was delicious, the service was nothing to write home about. We had a party of 5 people, and we had to wait over an hour- even though we had a reservation. The waiter was BLAH to say the least- but the food and drinks were worth every penny. It's everything else that wasn't so great. 
Living in Vegas with so many options....I'm not sure if I would go back here again."}
{"text":"The food is excellent- as good as any fine dining in Vegas and arguably some of the best ahi and scallops this side of town.

The staff, especially Todd and his wife Terry are generous and extremely friendly.

Totally worth a visit or 10."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Todd's, very fresh food .. with specialties off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Good food and cocktails.  The service is very good as well.  Nice choices on the menu.  Tucked in a little strip center, you could tell this was some mom and pop coffee shop at one time.  The booths are a little 90's, but the food and quietness of the place makes up for it.
The bartenders are good at what they do.  Scallops are yummy."}
{"text":"I never knew about this little hidden gem.  Had the Asian potstickers and the halibut which were both very good.  Service was excellent.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I met up with family for dinner after work since I was in Henderson and have had this place bookmarked for a long time.  Although the interior isn't that marvelous, the food and service more than made up for it.

We started with goat cheese wontons with raspberry basil sauce.  It's like a better version of a crab rangoon.  I got the Togarashi Seared Ahi Tuna with Wasabi mashed potatoes.  It was sooo good.  Our family likes to share and taste each other's food.  The rest of the family got Organic Chicken Breast with couscous and 2 orders of Boneless Short Rib with jalapeno mashed potatoes.  Everything was excellent taste-wise and presentation-wise.  The portions were just right.

For the dessert we tried the Nutella Creme Brulee (I love Nutella!!!), Salted Caramel Butterscotch Pudding. and McKenna's Brownie which was recommended by our server.  Of course, I'm biased towards anything Nutella so the creme brulee was my favorite without a doubt.  It was creamy and full of Nutella-goodness!  I did have to get rid of half the torched sugar on top though - it didn't need it.  I'm not a fan of butterscotch so the pudding was ok.  The brownie was nothing exciting.

I want to try the duck next time.  And there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Just want to take a few minutes to tell you about one of my favorite eateries in the Vegas Area.  I first went over 10 years ago and we went Wednesday night for my Birthday.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The place is still just as fabulous if not more than years before.  Anything you order is going to be delicious.  Not having a huge menu allows the chef to concentrate on the fare they serve.  I had the duck breast in pomegranit reduction.  My boyfriend had the best meatloaf I have ever tasted.  We started with crab cake app.  I am an International Flight Attendant and have the Blessing to dine all over the world.  Few places stick out in my mind and stay there.  I'm just sorry I stayed away so long.  Won't happen again. Another plus, you can park your ride out front and just walk right in and start a wonderful dining experience sans a casino or a long walk.   Truly one of  The Vegas areas best.  And it's in Henderson, 10 minutes from my house.  Do yourself a favor if you haven't already.  GO!!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say Todd is still the best. Located near coyotes Mexican Café and TGI Fridays. Todd's food is consistent and always delicious. You get find dining cuisine without having to pay strip prices and to travel down in traffic. We ordered the beef braised short ribs with jalapeño mashed potatoes the meet was fall off the fork tender and the mashed potatoes had a slight kick to it.We also got the duck which was cooked perfectly and also the fish of the day delicious.  For dessert we had the berry crumble which was crisp and sweet. We also ordered the raspberry chocolate cake which was a little disappointing because the raspberry was baked into the cake. We assumed it was raspberry sauce on the side. Nonetheless Todd is still one of my favorites and will always be."}
{"text":"Good food, nice service, quiet restaurant. Unique is a good description of the menu and I say that in a complimentary way.  Personally I enjoyed it but harder on my dining partner.  Menu apparently changes regularly.  Wish there were either more options that stayed regularly on the menu and perhaps rotate in a few new ones.  Another option would be to at least post the menu on your website for that day.  This would be helpful for diners who might have a limited circle of what they are willing to eat. Good for small groups but agree with prior reviews that suggest reservations.  Most entrees are between $21-29 apps are $8-11 and salads are up to $12. Quiet to average atmosphere. Easy to hold a conversation. Booth set up was sort of uncomfortable.  90 degree bench style seat with little padding."}
{"text":"If given the option, I like to dine off Strip, even during restaurant week. Yes, there are big name chefs with big casinos backing them, but to find a charming restaurants is more difficult. 

Todd's does hit some positive notes, but overall it was middle of the road. My reservation was for four people at 5:30. Two of us got there early and was told to sit at the bar until the rest of our party came. I had ordered a Joie De Veev. (Is that even how you spell it?) It is a mixture of muddled strawberries, mint, berry vodka, and ginger ale. The drink is refreshing and would be perfect for summer or Vegas winter.

When everyone showed up, we were sat and greeted promptly. For appetizers; we started with two Grumpy Salads and two Sweet Corn Raviolis. Nothing wow inducing, but edible. The salad was plain and the sauce for the ravioli was rich with no kick. For entrees; two of us got the prime rib of pork, one steelhead, and one beef medallion. Everyone was happy with these dishes. All of the meats were cooked to perfection. For the dessert course; we ordered the chocolate ice cream, hazelnut creme brulee, salted caramel pudding, and the flourless chocolate cake. My favorite was the salted caramel pudding. It had a nice balance. The creme brulee was underwhelming and was the least favorite for the group.

The service was great. It looked like the room worked as a team. We had our waitress, but throughout the meal multiple people stopped by with food, refills and to clear plates. It looked more complex than the basic captain, front waiter, back waiter, food runner combo. Whatever formula it was, it worked."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time tonight and was NOT disappointed. We live right by the restaurant and have always wondered about it; I highly recommend going here if you've ever wondered about stopping by.

My boyfriend and I started with truffled edamame (yum!), tuna tartare, and bacon wrapped dates. (We ordered off of the happy hour appetizer menu. Everything was so delicious. The edamame was so good, definitely split it because it's a big portion. The tuna tartare was small which makes it great if you are very hungry and intend to order off the main menu as well (which I did). It was really great the mix of textures in the tartare and they could potentially be bite sized depending on the eater. And the bacon wrapped dates, please get them. They are so good and you will love them!

For our entrees, my boyfriend got the short rib. I nabbed a little bite of it and it was tender, juicy, and flavorful. I got the duck with the blueberry sauce and sweet potato. If you love duck, you will love this. It was cooked to perfection and was a great portion; it wasn't enough to make you feel uncomfortably stuffed if you finished the plate. 

We sat at the bar and had a great bartender, Caleb. If you sit at the bar to eat, he's your man. Definitely will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Took a couple here for their 5 year wedding anniversary a few weeks ago. Past experiences have been great, so we were looking forward to the same. 

Service was great as usual with attentive waitstaff and great drinks from the bar. 

The anniversary couple had steak and a dinner salad. I had scallops, which half were perfect and half were undercooked. What really earned the 2 stars though, was the clams with hoisin sauce my wife ordered. Somehow, someway her plate was served with a few unopened clams. Now I have seen varying opinions on eating unopened clams, but why would a fine dining establishment risk it and serve them?

Not sure if we will return, but we really enjoyed meals there in the past."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 27

It was about four years ago that we were in town and dined at Todds for the first time.  Tonight we were able to return once again.

Our server Anthony was excellent, very attentive. We started our meal with the fried calamari and aioli dipping sauce. Not sure what was up with the calamari tonight. It seemed as though they were left in the fryer too long, as they were a tad chewy and a little on the greasy side. Additionally, the batter was flavorless. Enough said about the appetizer.

On the other hand our beet salad served on cold plates with golden beets, fennel, mixed greens was delicious.  The dressing was light and didn't weigh down or over power the other ingredients.

My hubby ordered the tuna tartare served with wasabi mashed...excellent! 
The fish was sashimi grade, so very tender and the sauce was equally delicious. I ordered the mahi mahi stuffed with crab and served with mixed veggies. The fish was excellent and the veggies tender crisp. Both entrees were presented beautifully.

As for dessert, we were stuffed so we passed this time.

Ample free parking out front. Reservations helpful on the weekends."}
{"text":"We've dined at Todd's about 5 times over the past 2 years, and every creation Todd has crafted for us has been stellar.  Last night was no different.  Todd's is participating in the Spring Restaurant (Feb 27 - Mar 4), offering a 3 course dinner @ $30.12/person.  I started with the \"Grumpy's Salad\", which is a delightful mound of chipped lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and blue cheese lightly coated in a creamy dressing.  Because of the texture, the blue cheese sneaks into random bites, which is such a wonderful mid chew surprise!  Other first course options are the Cream of Heirloom Tomato Soup or a Sweet Corn Ravioli.  

Second Course offerings include Roast Prime Rib of Pork, Grilled Steelhead with Meyer Lemon Aioli & Toasted Cous Cous, Filet Medallions in a Wild Mushroom Cabernet Sauce, Vegetable Risotto, or for $20 more they offer a Surf and Turf with a Maine Lobster Tail.  Most everyone at our table ordered the Grilled Steelhead because we had brought a wine pairing that worked best with the fish.  This was my first time ordering Steelhead, which most resembled the texture and tenderness of salmon.  It was absolutely delicious in the light lemon cream sauce.  I  loved the larger sized cous cous they paired.

Most important note: Every Wednesday night Todd's offers free corkage for up to 2 bottles per table!!!

The third course offers way more choices than any of the other restaurant week dining options with 4 dessert choices that ALL sound yummy to my tummy!  Choices include their Flourless Chocolate Cake with Raspberry and Vanilla Sauce, Hazelnut Crème Brûlée, Salted Butterscotch Pudding topped with Fresh Cream, or an assortment of Housemade Ice Creams.  Since I've ordered their Flourless Chocolate Cake on a few occasions, I went with the Hazelnut Crème Brûlée.  Absolute melt off your chair goodness!   If you are a hazelnut fan & you love crème brûlée, then this is a must have.

My only regrets about the whole night were that I didn't place a to-go order for their duck breast that comes in a pomegranate red wine sauce over a sweet potato purée.  This is one of those dishes that food dreams are made of.  Probably one of my top 5 dishes to order in all of Vegas."}
{"text":"I am sure this place was probably good back in its prime days but we were here in January since family and it was mediocre. The Steak was amazing but everything else was so salty, and I am a normally a salty eater. They had salt in the salad... who puts that much salt in a salad or a pasta dish? Sorry for ranting but I hate paying a lot for bad food. I only gave it a 3 as the steak itself was very good. The steak was Cooked perfectly to a medium rare. I wouldn't want to go back though.."}
{"text":"This is a hard one to rate. We had a 7:30 reservation and we seated immediately. I have been hearing rave reviews and was quite excited to try this place. I LOVE going to none chain- local places. The waitress came and plopped down the menus and only one wine list. We were a group of 3 women and all wanted something different to drink. The server was not terrible, but for the prices and what I think they want to be she needs a lot of training. To me correct etiquette and flow is what makes a great server. It's all part of a fine dining experience. She boringly rattled off the specials, she didn't really seem to even know for sure what it consisted of. We ordered and when the food arrived she plunked it down on the table like it was IHOP. Really rather annoying. I ordered the steak on fire and a beet salad. Beet salad description said it had grapefruit. I didn't see or taste it, but it was really good (fantastic) anyway. The steak was really good for a few bites. I think all the cheese on the fries was overwhelming. My friend had the same, she said she loved it, but only ate about 3 bites. He daughter had scallops and said she liked it. None of us were raving or swooning over the food. It was good. But def didn't live up to all the hype I have been hearing. Our water was never refilled and that steak was so hot I really wanted water. They also were playing a football game which I found odd and anoying in fine dining and at those prices. But I really got annoyed at the end of the meal. We haven't seen each other in quite awhile and were enjoying catching up. We finished eating at about 9. The waitress dropped off the check and we were talking. She never returned to see if we wanted anything else. They started tearing the bar apart for heavy cleaning at 9. They were banging and clanging away. The lights got brighter as well. Then at about 9:30 it felt like they shut off the air to get rid of us. It was about 200 degrees and the entire place was getting torn down. The hours state open till 10. First of all if the waitress ever came back we wanted to have more drinks, it wasn't time for them to close and there was no one waiting for our table. I could understand we would be a bother if it was time to go home or they needed to turn the table for another reservation. These kind of things are why locally owned places never survive. The whole point is making the guests feel welcome and wanted. Olive Garden next door has a warmer vibe. Also, their website states a $30 PP average. All our entress were $36, plus salad and 2 drinks each the bill was QUITE a bit more pricy. Darn, I was so excited about this one."}
{"text":"I like Todd's a lot the food is always good so is the staff,but they need new booths they are miserably uncomfortable. I've been going there for at least 15 years and I've sat in the same booth 75% of the time and I'd like to take an axe to it. But that would just lead to trouble. I'll continue to suffer because I like the place that much."}
{"text":"Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. It was delightful. The calamari Ricardo was great. We split a Caesar...no. Our salad was elf sized.i It was good, just EXTREMELY small so for eight bucks I would higly advise against it.. His skirt steak was great and the fries were phenomenal.

I got barramundi in caviar sauce with cous cous.  It was beautiful and had the best texture mix I've ever had. They brought out a todd-a-misu for his birthday which was awesome, and we also ordered bread pudding. Excellent. 

Ive seen others talk about uncomfortable seats and I was afraid, but they must have done some renovating because our booth was way comfortable."}
{"text":"I measure by three different things in comparison to Taco Bell:

DECOR: Located in Henderson, Todd's Unique is in a small plaza sharing a building with other establishments. A bit ironic as externally Taco Bells look nicer than this place! However, walking in you find a restaurant that gives off a fancy atmosphere, but not in an overwhelming sense. Patrons dress casually, which is nice. A star for delivering a nice atmosphere.

SERVICE:  The waiters here are dressed up and polite. I'd say they deliver the same service that you'd expect in a five star establishment! More upscale service than your average Taco Bell establishment for sure! Another star!

FOOD: I started off with the Goats Cheese with Raspberry Basil Sauce as an appetizer. I have to say while this was delicious it was sweet enough that I think it would rather be better as a dessert. I don't recommend this as an appetizer, again too sweet. My main entree was the Lamb 2 ways. I always enjoy a good lamb, however while it was good it wasn't mind blowing. Since the overall the food was just okay, only one star here.

FINAL VERDICT: Is Taco Bell better? Yes

Look you're in Henderson, which means you're just miles away from the Las Vegas Strip. There are a ton of better sophisticated restaurants if that's what you're looking for. However if it's been a long night in Vegas and you're looking for some chow, Taco Bell would work as well."}
{"text":"My short ribs were tender, succulent and tasty. My lady's diver scallops were perfectly prepared with a garnish of pistachio potatoes. Our friends raved about their entrees. We shared goat cheese won ton, and lobster Sui Mai apps, as well as a decadent brownie and flourless chocolate cake. With cocktails $200, or $50pp. Great value, with attentive service"}
{"text":"Came here again for a regular dinner, which was outstanding.  This is literally my husband's favorite restaurant.  I love it but I hate saying \"ok this is my absolute favorite and nothing else compares to it.\"  But as others have said (echoing Adina M and Trina T), this restaurant really blows others out of the water and is more of an experience than a meal.

I had heard that John Curtas of Eating Las Vegas thought Todd's dumplings were Chinese worthy restaurant dumplings and assuming were insanely good, we tried those because my other choice, the tuna would have to be eaten by me alone since my non fish-eating husband wouldn't touch it.  They were executed perfectly, better than the asian places I have had them before (which isn't much sadly).  We also split the beet salad which was incredibly fresh with a horseradish dressing.  My non horseradish-loving husband really loved this, as the dressing did not overwhelm the good fresh vegetables and the grapefruit.

I was full at this point but we also had the skirt steak on fire and the hanger steak in cognac sauce.  My skirt steak was the most flavorful I've ever had in my life, much better than the skirt steak I've had in strip restaurants (Tom Coliccio should send his Craftsteak chefs to Todd to learn how to properly cook and cut skirt steak, seriously).  While I'm not a huge fan of hanger steak, the sauce was pretty incredible.  My husband though kept eating my skirt steak and liked it better, thank god because I could barely finish half of it.

I also want to point out that they serve this saffron beer which I just can't remember the same of.  It was really incredible and now I want to get a hold of some of it.  It had an odd name, so if anyone out there knows the name of the saffron beer they serve, please let me know what it is!  One of the best I have had ever.

Dinner for two, with drinks, was only around $90ish dollars, which was a steal for this kind of level of food. The food here really surpasses all three of the Michelin Star restaurants I have been to in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great local restuarant that can easily compete with any place on The Strip! Food is always fantastic, service is excellent and ambiance is just what you look for in a restaurant. Always enjoy our trip to Todd's and look forward to visiting again real soon!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for my first time trying this place.  Wanted to go have a nice dinner with my boyfriend for our date night.  Arrived early and was extremely underwhelmed with the decor/interior.  The hostess immediately explained that due to a large walk in party, I would not be able to be seated on time.  She then walked me to the bar and said \"when our servers are available, then we will seat you at a table\".  OK.... so we sit at the bar and order martinis- which were very overpriced considering this is in a strip mall OFF the strip ($13) We sit and wait for over 20 minutes before deciding that this is ridiculous and discuss where we should go instead since we wanted to catch a show we already bought tickets for.  The bartender overhears, and then grabs the hostess and she tries to \"convince\" us to stay, but then promises that our food WON'T be ready in time for our movie.... but we should stay anyway.  What a joke.  Horrible first impression, unimpressive service, and overpriced.  I will NOT be giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"This is another good gourmet restaurant off the strip in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Do not let the strip mall location deter you from dining here.   This is a romantic little local place with excellent food.  

Our server was a bit dull but the quality of the food more than made up for it.  Very well presented and delivered timely.  All the dishes we ordered were fine and devoured in short order. 

I would call this place a hidden gem but is facing Sunset Blvd so it is not very hidden.   If you are looking for a quiet dinner spot with your significant other, this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Been to Todd's a few times and the food is always amazing. Friendly staff and an eclectic menu. Don't worry, if it sounds odd, it's probably really good. We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner. He was a little skeptical because he had never heard of it.  Service was outstanding and attentive. Goat cheese wonton appetizer was amazing! We had two different salads, both were very fresh and flavors were amazing! We had the two specials- a sword fish and a steak! Both were amazing! Definitely will come back. Highly, highly recommend. My husband is now a believer!"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem! I have wanted to dine here for so long, but had not made it until recently.

My BF and I had date night and this restaurant was his choice because it's a longtime favorite of his. He made reservations the same day and we were both pretty excited.

The location and decor are nothing special, but the food and service are phenomenal. I had the scallops and they were fantastic. They also have a great wine list - we just ended up with a bottle of Moet, since we both ordered seafood.

This could be a romantic date, but there is also a bar where you could be more casual. I look forward to going to one of their wine dinners soon."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers!  Located across from an Olive Garden is this hidden gem.  The place was right off the street in a strip mall, and I still missed it. 

I had the duck, and it was amazing.  I'd go back just for that.  My bf had the braised short rib, and he raved how tender it was.  The jalapeno mashed was good, and wasn't over powering.

The bread pudding was wonderful, but my only sad part was the coffee after my meal.  It was weak.  That was disappointing after a delightful meal and didn't compliment the dessert.  Otherwise, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is a great date night restaurant. It is Vegas quality fine dining in our neighborhood"}
{"text":"Time for an update since I've gotten several visits in. The last one I invited some friends to join for happy hour. There were 4 of us on a Friday evening 5pm. We ordered, we ate, we had a good time. At the time of the bill, we noted that Happy Hour prices were not in effect for our table. The waiter informed us that Happy Hour only applies to the bar, which was basically 5 feet away from our table. There are probably 6 tables in the bar area, and the other side of the restaurant has more. This seemed a bit hokey to me, because we could have easily sat at the bar to get 1/2 off wine, of which my friends ordered 3-4 glasses each of. 

I had the grilled pork chop and I found the flavor to be a bit lacking in the peach jalapeno sauce. The chop itself was very thick, and almost seemed a little undercooked. I wasn't impressed with this selection. Two had the coconut crusted mahi and they loved it, as did I on my first visit. The sea scallops were my other friends choice and he enjoyed them as well. 

So now I know Happy Hour only applies to the 9 seats at the bar. I guess I won't get the luxury of bringing friends with me to this fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"Great seafood & steaks.  Great value for the quality of food.  Sign up for their newsletter & you will get coupons & updates on wine dinners (which are fabulous)."}
{"text":"It was Restaurant Week, and at long last I was slated to step inside Todd's Unique Dining Restaurant and evaluate it for myself.  Our reservations were acknowledged and quickly honored, and not a moment too soon.  For, several parties arrived just after us.  The place was quickly packed with people and frantic servers.  But, initially, ours did not move fast enough.  Although our server said she would get us set with water and bread, she next took orders from an adjoining table of 11 diners instead.  When, after hailing a busser, our bread basket did finally arrive, it contained very good raisin bread but there was nothing special about the white bread.  The ambiance was homey but, as other Yelpers have previously noted, our straightback booth was rather cramped and uncomfortable.  

A bowl of Cream of Heirloom Tomato Soup was very good.  Unusual Sweet Corn Ravioli tasted pretty good.  And, Grumpy's Salad turned out to be like a chopped wedge salad.  The medium-rare Filet Medallions I was served were excellent and buttery but very peppery, although I got used to the spice.  The Wild Mushroom Cabernet Sauce ladled under it tasted good.  So did Mashed Potatoes.  While a tomato on my plate was perfectly cooked, lengths of carrot served wild rabbit-style were too hard for my taste and julienned red beets accompanying Roast Prime Rib of Pork with Sausage Stuffing were undercooked.  I found Mexican Squash and Enoki Mushrooms to be pleasant but unremarkable.

I thought \"Todd's\" etched in cocoa powder was a nice visual touch next to a great-tasting Flourless Chocolate Cake with excellent Rasbperry and Vanilla Sauce.  The array of desserts (also Hazelnut Creme Brulee, Salted Butterscotch Pudding with fresh cream, and housemade ice cream) was the highlight of the meal.  While the food did not transport me, it and the overall experience were very good, and a return trip is likely in my future."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for Valentines day. 
On recommendations from other Yelp reviewers, we opted for the to start our dinner with Crab Cakes and the Goat cheese wontons. We also ordered the house salad, watermelon martinis, Scallop entree, the duck entree and a brownie dessert. 
Now the reason for the three stars.
We were seated and given enough time to order without feeling rushed, but once we ordered, we sat and waited and waited and waited. Other tables were given bread to snack on while they waited but not us. 
About thirty minutes later we finally had to ask for bread in order to get something to snack on while we continued to wait.
All the time we sat and waited we had to listen to some apparently drunk loud lady dropping F-bombs non stop. Even the server serving that table heard the lady multiple times but nothing was said.
At this point our romantic night was shot. Seriously, if i wanted to hear loud, drunk, obnoxious people slurring incoherent sentences plagued with F this, mother F'er that, then I could have gone to Applebees or Fridays or Red Lobster. 
When we finally got our appetizers, the wontons barely had any of the raspberry sauce, the wonton wrappers were  not crispy at all and the texture was like they were precooked waiting for someone to order them and then quickly microwaved to get the cheese warm, because they were chewy. The crab cake was cool in the center and not from sitting there on a counter waiting to be picked up but just from not being cooked long enough. 
Did we eat the appetizers or send them back???
We ate them, because at this point it had been about forty minutes just waiting to get them and we haven't even got our salad yet either.
The entrees were very good though. 
The Scallops were cooked perfectly, the risotto was on point, the duck was amazing, but again, no matter how good the food is, the F-bombs coming from the other table were enough to destroy the mood.

The question is would we come back.
Truthfully I am not sure and I have to ask myself, were the issues with the appetizers related to the amount of covers and overwhelmed kitchen staff or did the station chef just not care or pay attention?
Was the issue with the possibly drunk, loud obnoxious F-bomb dropping lady and issue with untrained dining room staff, or did the dining room staff not care and were only concerned with potential tip earnings for the night?"}
{"text":"Then short ribs were as good as advertised but otherwise the experience fell short.   The decor is REALLY dated and food was so-so.  A party of 4 spent $400 with $150 of that in wine.   Our sweet potatoes samosas seemed right from the freezer, flatbread was underwhelming and salads were average at best.  

Perhaps an okay spot if you're not wanting to impress someone but for a business meal, I should have stuck with more of a sure thing."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try Todd's. I was disappointed, the consensus of our group was that it was just OK. Our biggest complaint was that it is SO NOISY inside. It is a small crowded main dining area and we had a hard time hearing each other. 

I will list what we ordered and what we thought of the dishes.

Goat cheese wontons- We felt they were slightly under cooked and a little greasy. The flavor was nice though. 

Chipotle calamari- The calamari itself was very bland. You had to use the spicy chipotle sauce to get any flavor. 

Grumpy's salad- Again it was very bland, it had dressing but you could not tell what kind as there was no flavor. The only thing I tasted was the blue cheese. 

The famous short ribs- I thought they were pretty good. Nice flavor and cooked until very tender. 

The seared ahi dish and mahi mahi were good however pretty small portions. The service was very good throughout the night. I think when they get their fresh halibut and king crab I would like to give Todd's another try. Maybe it was an off night in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"50+ crowd. Decorated like grandmas house. Food was decent but not particularly \"unique.\""}
{"text":"First time eating at Todd's. 
It was an interesting set up. I almost felt more like I was in a coffee shop.
The service was great.
We ordered a crab cake appetizer...it could have been a bit crispier, but tasted good.
We shared a Grumpy's salad. The waitress heard we were sharing and split it for us, nice...but my husband's plate got all of the blue cheese crumbles. 
I had the seared scallops with mushroom mashed potatoes...absolutely delicious.
My husband had the mahi mahi stuffed crab, he thoroughly enjoyed it.
Although the food was great, somehow the ambiance made me not want to return...I'm not exactly sure why."}
