{"text":"The food was very good, definitely will come back!!! We just move in the neighborhood and decided to try this place ,the bento box was huge and delicious , the salad was fresh and dressing was yummy. The tempura was great, the honey chicken was crispy and flavorfull my daughter loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I go here a lot. Love their Sushi and the Sea Star! Always have a great time with the staff."}
{"text":"My favorite go to Asian food spot! I love the sushi and the honey chicken!  Great staff, quick service, I frequent this place at least twice a week for lunch or dinner takeout orders."}
{"text":"I work close by, so I have their food at least once a week if not twice. I have tried several dishes and they are above the other Asian take-out but not great. The waitresses are always quick, helpful and with a smile. My issue has been with the older Asian women. I find her rude on the phone and in person. I went to have lunch last week. I ordered my side of ginger dressing as usual. I can tell it puts her out to have me use that in place of a brown sauce. However, I pay for it. I call today to place my usual order. She tells me she can't do that and that dressing is only for salad. First of all, who the fuck are you to tell me what condiment to pair with which dish.  Secondly, I stated on the phone you brought this to me in person. The women lies and says this didn't happen.Lastly, you are a rude person who should not be head of house dealing with paying public. I have wanted to slap you so many times. I will never give my money to your establishment. Stop taking the waitresses tips!"}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent service!  We love going there!  Keep doing what your doing, because it works!"}
{"text":"First time here and not impressed. Fish amounts were small in rolls and not the freshest. The one big no no for me is when I order a number of rolls and sushi I expect it to come out together.  Every time they finished a roll thy brought it out. The reason I order various rolls is to try one them another. It's like ordering dinner and they bring out the vegetables and later the meat and later the potatoes. I will not be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Pleasant atmosphere. A diamond in the rough. Curried Singapore noodles a must!"}
{"text":"The worst place ever that should be shut down immediately!!! For anyone reading this do not visit this place as the manager and owner is extremely rude! I was overcharged and then she argued with me over extra mushrooms which resulted in her hanging up on me. I now understand why they were so empty on a Saturday and warn anyone do not waste your time and money at this place which has no regard for their customers at all!"}
{"text":"Very sad that this is what I received for bourbon chicken. The sauce was very gelatin and couldn't Identify a flavor. Thankfully I had ranch dressing. Last shot for this establishment"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. Very overpriced sushi. Not a very welcoming atmosphere - especially when the untrained waitresses shout from the kitchen, \"Are you dining in?\" in a tone that sounds like, \"I hope you aren't.\" Definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"Really good take out Chinese joint. Broccoli Trio is awesome! Not a sushi lover so will leave it up to someone else to review that."}
{"text":"Food is good, sushi is nice, place is kind of cute. But the Asian lady that supervises the place is extremely mean! You get the feeling like you're not supposed to be here !  It's too bad everything else seems to be clicking for them."}
{"text":"We were seated right away. Then we waited and waited for at least 20 minutes. We finally got a drink order in and they did come quickly.  Several minutes later the waitress came for our order. We came for their sushi. She said they were out of rice and would be another hour before they had any made.  We then left and thankfully were not charged for drinks we barely drank. Not having rice at a Chinese restaurant  is unbelievable,  but we were more upset because we were not told that until we had been sitting there for a long time. This occurred on December 27, 2017."}
{"text":"I hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and do not spend one cent here! The manager is extremely rude and lacks customer service skills. I questioned about the amount of extra items I received as I paid an additional $$ and she called me a liar and began to raise her voice. I noticed another reviewer mentioned the rudeness of this manager and was skeptical but apparently they were correct. As the call escalated the manager hung up on me and never apologized or allowed me to fully explain myself. I hope this review reaches the owner and big changes happen as this is disgusting behavior and no one should be treated this poorly."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from Hanako on a Saturday at 4:20 pm. I asked for pickup at 5:00. When I arrived the order was not ready. Had to wait 15 minutes. There was only one person in the place, so it wasn't as if there was a long line of orders to prepare. Obviously, just poor planning on their part.  When I called to place the order,  I asked about the Saturday  buy two rolls, get 1 free. I had a coupon from Money mailer. It was expired, but the website said it was good until 10/31/12. I asked the hostess over the phone about the coupon and the website. She said.. sure bring it with you. So I ordered the 3rd roll. When I checked out, she denied the use of the coupon and charged me for the third roll.  Now, for the food. The spicy sauce on the rolls is not spicy. It is dull and very thinly applied. The chicken fried rice tasted like it was made a week ago. It was very bland and there were no vegetables in it. Only chicken egg and rice. The pickled ginger with the sushi had fermented and tasted BAD!. The wasabi had no real kick to it. I ordered a smoked salmon spicy tuna roll, but it was not in the order. We got a roll with cream cheese and tuna instead.   In summary, I normally think of sushi from a grocery as fair to mediocre and restaraunt sushi as better quality, but the Sushi from Harris teeter or Publix is much better than what we had here. So we will not go be going back to Hanako  So if you go here, skip the sushi"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. The staff was friendly but not very personable. The table was sticky as were menus. Sushi rolls were topped with warm mayo after we specifically asked for spicy (and were assured it would be) and the chicken was definitely microwaved. It was rubbery and very tough. The sushi rolls were extremely disappointing. It looked like boxed sushi. Tasted like it, too. The rice tasted old and plastic-y. We faked an emergency and left to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"When we first moved to the area in March 2015, our neighbors recommended this place for Chinese food. And they were right. Good food, reasonable prices, and nice to support a mom-and-pop type establishment. That said, over time the food has gone noticeably downhill. But worst of all is the service from the owner (a middle-aged woman who's there just about all the time). She has an angry demeanor, like she doesn't really want to be there. She comes across nasty most of the time, and she nickels-and-dimes you for things like extra sauce and substitutions. My wife and I were there tonight (Christmas Day 2016), and we have vowed never to go back again. Sad when an owner puts off a vibe which makes customers uncomfortable and not wanting to return. There are far better places in the area (i.e. Red Bowl, a few miles South on 521. Bottom line, food decent, owner is like the 'Soup Nazi' from Seinfeld. I'd stay away."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week for lunch. I'm a big fan of hibachi, so I either get Hibachi chicken/Shrimp or the  broccoli trio. The food is quick and very good on most occasions. The owner has a hard time keeping waitresses so it's a merry go round for waitresses. The owner is very nice and she knows my order by now. I would definitely recommend this place for the sushi and Chinese food lovers."}
{"text":"I know they exist, but should never ever ever meet up with them on a restaurant visit.  I am referring to cockroaches in the bathroom.  I reported them and it went with no concern, it did not even get an appology.  Why customers did not hear me scream in the restroom is beyond me, but not many here for lunch, so maybe others know!!!    I also had the opportunity to hear an adult staff,  possibly the owner, yell and argue over a sushi order, that was awkward.  My food arrived and to not be rude, I got a to go box to just drop in the trash.    Yuck, pass on this place.  Food looked good but the staff and roaches put a squash on that meal."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian place to eat. Great selection on food. They have the best crab rangoons I have ever had (don't like them anywhere else). Fast service. Great food to go as well. I always get the hibachi beef bento box. Mela the manager is super sweet and knows me by name. Great quality food."}
{"text":"Great food at a value price. Sure it's not Kona Grill but that's what Kona Grill is for.   If you are looking for some very good Chinese-American food at a good price, this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"The food is excellent but the service is abysmal. We waited 45 minutes for our food. The servers we got were awful like some you'd expect at fast food level places. Overall the great food does not make up for the the poor service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the only Asian restaurant in Indian Land. This is my second visit. The food is average. The service is rushed.  In the summer it is hot inside. No substitutions.  The lady who owns/manages this place is rude, to everyone. She treats customers like they are a nuisance to her. I wish there was another Asian restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"This is the only Japanese restaurant in town, but it's actually very good for Indianland. It has very reasonable prices and good quality food. It's refreshing to find a good Asian restaurant in the midst of Bbq and fast food! The Hibachi lunch is our favorite. Last week I  tried the  Vietnamese noodle soup, which is basically a big steaming bowl of Pho and it was delicious!  Today, one of the specials was seafood dumplings.  We tried it and loved them! They have fresh Sushi and daily specials. It has a nice atmosphere, great service and is very authentic. Everyone there is always super nice and the food is always good. This is one of the best restaurants in town in my opinion. You should check it out if you love asian food, seafood or just for a refreshing change of pace!"}
{"text":"Diner BEWARE! The food here is good, but they keep changing their \"rules\" on their specials, such as 1/2 price sushi on Wednesdays. I've been coming here for almost two years and have ordered the 1/2 price sushi with no changes except with soy wrap instead of seaweed (which I pay extra for) and all of a sudden this is not allowed? Bunch of BS! Have lost a very loyal diner"}
{"text":"I am writing this review on behalf of my sister who lives nearby and have frequented them several times (every other weekend or so since June 2016).  She enjoys the food, that's why she ordered from them and eaten with them several times.  Finally though last night (Friday) she called me up and complained about the Asian lady (older) that answered the phone to take her order.  She was leaving work and had no access to a menu and tried ordering from memory.  She was ordering several appetizers and multiple sushi roll for her family of three.     Sister said that the lady was so rude and not helpful at all.  She already ordered several items and just needed help with the sushi portion of remembering.  She asked the lady to name several of the sushi items when the lady basically told her that she doesn't have the time to read the menu to her.  Sister says I only need the sushi side.  The Asian lady kept on cutting her off when she had a question saying she doesn't have time for this and that she's busy.   This wasn't the first time this has happened.  Sister said she called them once along with her husband and they were both on the Bluetooth speaker in the car when the Asian lady told them that she needed only one of them to speak the order.  How rude is that?    Sister ended up ordering from a sushi place near her work and spent over $60.  She was fed up with this restaurant that she called them up and told the Asian lady that she was rude and has lost a customer.    I love sushi, but this will be one place that I will not visit.  Food can be great, but service is key and customer appreciation is lacking with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Go on Thursdays for senior special, so prices are reasonable.  Food is acceptable/ok.  Do NOT have egg rolls.  Service is spotty.  Interest of management is non existent.  I have been there at least 25 times in the last 30 weeks and the manager or owner has NO idea who I am nor does she seem to care.  Definitely a feeling of lack of interest by management.  Brocolli seems to come with everything, since I can not eat broccoli, I have asked for a substitute, and answer has been \"NO\".  So the plat is half empty as you can see in your photo."}
{"text":"2nd time not a charm...cold soup, overfried chicken, fishy fish...this place used to be ok..not sure what happened.The server was very kind and apologetic, server was great!"}
{"text":"LONG STORY SHORT: WORST SERVICE, WON'T GO THERE AGAIN.   Ehhhh... I don't know. Foods, \"Okay\". Service, worst Ive ever experienced. I was so close to ask switch our server(Although there could be only one nominee who was so busy serving other tables, couldn't ask for him).  I'm usually not a picky person at the restaurant, , because I used to work at a restaurant for years and I know what it feels like to serve the table when customers are being picky.  When we were ordering, the waiter did not know anything about the menu, absolutely nothing.. Seriously, YOU HAVE TO TRAIN YOUR SERVER RIGHT, OWNERS! He even took out the take-out menu out of his pocket and circled the ones that we were ordering, showing it to my face every time we add one. Our server forgot to bring the soup for the hibachi, I had to ask for one. Also, when I asked for some more ginger for the sushi, he just slid, or should I say \"threw\" it onto table?, making a face. No refills. because we ordered one beer and waters for others.  Well, here's the my main reason why I won't be going to this place again and giving a one star. There was a BUG in my water, politely asked for a new one, mentioning of the bug in the water, the hostess/waitress(b/c our waiter rarely came to our table) just said \"OH!\" and ran into the kitchen.  Our waiter brought a new cup without an apology. I do understand there might be a bug/hair or whatever can be in the food/beverages without a purpose, but no apologies? That, I cannot understand.  I tip very nice. I even tip the cashier when I make take out order. I tip the baristas when I go to a coffee shop. That's my way of appreciating the great service.  I felt sorry for the guy who served our table tonight. I truly believe he did not deserve any tip at all, but for a sake, he brought our foods to table at least, did SOME work.  I did not make a complaints, because I knew I wasn't going to come back and even if I say something to them, I could see there will be no change. Instead, I gave him 10%. I know this is such a horrible thing to do, but he seriously did not earn 20-25%. When we were leaving the table, the guy snatched the check and checked the amount of tip to calculate how much I tipped him, gave me a look(again). If he asked me for some more, I was going to say that service was the worst and was even willing to take away the tip I gave him previously. THAT WAS SO RUDE!  I should've tipped the sushi chef, realizing I spent my $$ on wrong person. If anyone who works at the restaurant reads this, please thank the chef for me, because he did a nice work on sushi.  So, here's a penny for my thoughts for the service that I received on my birthday :)   Again, TRAIN YOUR SERVERS RIGHT, Owners. That's all I can say."}
{"text":"Been going here for years! The food is always super yummy and fresh. The chicken is usually always white meat too which is a score!"}
{"text":"We stopped at this restaurant last night. As we walked to the door, we saw they have a \"C\" health rating. I have never actually seen a restaurant with this low of a rating. They also had handwritten signs with markers on the windows about their \"full bar\". It would have looked more professional if my 6 year old had written them. Based on their health rating alone, we turned around and left. Sounds like some serious issues especially when you are dealing with sushi. Pass this one by."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant, but well thought out. There are two private booths near the sushi bar on the side. I think they would be ideal for those more intimate dates, or for people hard of hearing, or for those who get easily distracted. The rest of the seating was either open booths, tables, or the bar.   The menu had many delicious looking entrees and very well priced! I got the bento box...and I needed an extra stomach to fit it all in! To start off, my husband and I got the wonton looking \"chips\" with sweet and sour dip. Then we got salads and soup. My main course was hibachi shrimp, rice, California sushi roll, shumai, and shrimp and veggie tempura. That was just mine...  They serve loose leaf tea in cast iron kettles...heavy...you will need two hands to pour.   It's a new restaurant and yes, like all restaurants there are kinks to work out. We spent 1.5 hours here, the first 50 minutes waiting on the main entrees. However, we loved a slow dining experience that was well paced with the first course tiding us over. Our server was great and all the employees were hustling around and there was only one sushi chef for the entire restaurant. They seemed to handle the rush and stress well.   My favorites were a bilingual receipt (Chinese/English) and a bilingual fortune cookie (Spanish/English). Our total bill was under $25 (w/o tip) and the food was very good! I'm not one to drive far and this is not close to my house, but I see me visiting this place again in the future...and often."}
{"text":"Kinks to work out in this new sushi bar.  The service was slow.  Than bringing our orders confused us with another table & than mixed up the orders at our table.   The rolls were fresh & pretty reasonably sized.  No special roll to distinguish itself or flair to how they were created.  Place was humming & was packed.    If you need a quick sushi fix, this is your place but call ahead for take out as eat in took us a total of 2.5 hrs to get everything right."}
{"text":"Went to hanako to pick up lunch. My roll was 7.95 but with the charge for a eel sauce/Spicy mayo(which I've never paid for in my life, and I eat sushi every day almost) it ended up being over 10 dollars! Plus the roll was mediocre and the sauces did not taste like spicy mayo or eel sauce. Eel sauce is sweet and this was salty and spicy mayo is slightly spicy sweet and this was salty and gross. The avocado on the roll had very bad spots in it and the salmon on the outside was slimy. The only waitress there was deathly shy and asked her boss everything like should I give those people menus now. Should I take their order now. And then when she wasn't doing that she was watching tv. It took them 2 15 min to make one roll and they were not busy."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Hanako though they've been open for a while now.  It's a nice, small restaurant with affordable, good Asian (mostly Japanese and Chinese) food.  Service was great, entrees were reasonably priced and the bento box was huge.  The sushi was good, but they don't have too much too choose from.  That's the only negative so I will be back.  Oh, I almost forgot about the complimentary dessert - fried pineapple.  Yum."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant... Nice and quiet on the inside, great food with friendly staff.  They are slightly on the slower side, but not any slower then another sit down restaurant.  Great prices, good food, need I say more?"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi  ! and they have good Chinese food but the prices are ridiculous"}
{"text":"We called and ordered for delivery and the woman who answered was extremely pushy, unprofessional and rude. I asked to speak to the manager Or owner and the woman repeatedly ignored my request and hung up on me. We waited well over an hour for our food and when the delivery arrived the driver didn't speak any English.  Very frustrated!!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Hibachi chicken is my usual, it's delicious. I also love the Vietnamese noodle soup with chicken. Teriyaki chick is good too.  Quick service, calming atmosphere to get out of the office during a quick lunch break. The owner knows me by name and she knows what I order. Highly recommend not getting any of the Chinese options (honey, orange chicken etc) it's just not their strong point"}
{"text":"The two stars are only for service, the meat and seafood did not seem fresh at all. Highly disappointed with the quality of the food. You can pay a little more for good sushi at Jade at the ballantyne village, Go there instead."}
{"text":"I go here regularly and always get sushi. I've never had anything I didn't like. Love the Red Rain Roll the best! The staff is very friendly and we've always had good service."}
{"text":"Friendly service, terrible food, tasteless, dry, generic, disappointing. Chicken tough as nails and tasteless (yakatori). Hibachi shrimp and beef, dry, tasteless, tough! Fried rice= brown rice a couple of cut onions that's all folks! No peas, carrots, egg, flavoreless!"}
{"text":"Not the best place for Japanese Sushi.  Seems to be run as a generic \"Asian\" restaurant.  Ambience is too hot for sushi, table was sticky, didn't offer a damp towel to wash your hands before handling the Sushi.  Service was by young kids that were more interested in conversing with each other than providing service, but they were pleasant enough.  Pretty much a basic offering that catered to an American consumer they assumed didn't know any better.  Prices for Sashimi were higher than better establishments I've visited in Charlotte area.  Could be better for Chinese offerings since I didn't experience any of those dishes."}
{"text":"A Friend and I were in Hanako yesterday...the Lady who owns this restaurant yelled at a customer that asked her for somemore tea.  I don't understand how she keeps her customers!! Also, I ordered Lunch Hibachi Shrimp w/vegetable and the Shrimp was horribly undercooked.  Before when I had the lady for some scirracha I got it in 30 minutes.  Everything is an upcharge!  I mustve paid .50 for two tiny orders of Siraacha!!  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone because of Attitude and hatefulness.  We really didn't have to eat there but we did and I am so sorry for even being there.  Don't understand why she is so ugly to customers...they are the ones that keep her in business!! Maybe she needs \"Temper\" training.  Will Never go back!!"}
{"text":"Every time we have been there is takes almost 1 hour to get food. The old lady that works there is very rude. It's a shame because the food is actually halfway decent. The problem is that they seem to only have 1 chef. When the restaurant is full, prepare to wait a couple of hours for food."}
{"text":"Massive menu for both sushi and \"savory\" stuff. Salads and dressings are really nice. Honestly, I've been there about 4 or 5 times and the food doesn't WOW me, but it's not bad considering the location and price. Nice wait staff, relatively low wait time. Pretty decent!"}
{"text":"I have NO IDEA why people are complaining! I have been here MANY times for lunch and have always been very happy. It's my Go To place when I'm lunching with my foodie teenager. Great sushi, great service, great Japanese food -- and I am Japanese! The presentation is always beautiful, and the taste is always top-notch. This is definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Have eaten there a few times and found inconsistency with food and service. Went in at lunchtime last week, asked for a menu and whoever was there seemed to be bothered by my request.   Recently went there for dinner and now would not go back. Entire Menu has price increase stickers over old prices , some areas blacked out. Saw a dust bin propped behind a booth, not appetizing. My tea cup was chipped.  So no attention to detail which can make a big difference in overall dining experience  Food was mediocre. My  Hanako Delicious : not delicious! broccoli with shrimp, lobster, crab, in a brown sauce. Shrimp was very chewy, broccoli tasted bitter, 3 shrimp, one scallop, imitation crab to my taste, brown sauce was thin and not at all tasty in my opinion, wasn't sure any lobster was even present.. My dining mate said the chicken teriyaki was ok nothing  special though.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive and food was plated nicely and brought out hot.  Overall a dimly lit restaurant, inconsistent food and service ."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. We've been there several times. Each time, the service has gotten worse than the time before. My son is on the autism spectrum and sometimes dining out can be a challenge. They have two booths in the back of the restaurant that are enclosed and have a sliding door. He loves sitting there and it's a great way to help him stay focused.  The last two times we've been, the same older lady has been at the front to seat people. We asked for one of those booths when we went today. It was 12:00 and we were the only people in the restaurant. She honestly acted like we were asking her to cut off her right arm. She acted the same way the time before but we chalked it up to a bad day. Apparently, it wasn't. So, we were led to the booth in silence and handed our menus in silence. Then we hear a couple of other customers come in. They get seated and the lady was being chatty with them. We sit and sit and sit. Then we hear her taking the orders from the two other tables that had been sat. After about 15 minutes, we decided to leave. She's standing at the entry. On my way out I asked her if she forgot about us since the other two tables who were seated after us had already been served drinks and no one had ever been to our table. She said she didn't forget about us and barely acted like she cared that we were leaving. I let her know we would not be coming back to their place...ever.   I'm pretty sure she's an owner. They were nice when they first opened. I suspect that's because they were new and were trying to get customers. The biggest problem with most new restaurants isn't necessarily getting customers through the front door, it's keeping them there and closing the back door. Clearly they fall short. The food is nothing special to keep customers coming back. If you're looking for great Asian food and fresh sushi, do yourself a favor and hit Wild East Pan Asian. They treat you like family and the food is dynamite."}
{"text":"For a local quick spot in Indian land this place is really not bad. Super cheap and fast. No it's not going to hold up to some of the best sushi spots in Charlotte, but this place is great for what it is. Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, Saturday.  Place was empty when I arrived around 12:00 but got progressively busier.  I sat in a booth and was given a lunch menu.  I thought this was more of a \"sushi\" place but they really offer everything (hibachi, Chinese fare etc...).  I was in the mood for sushi and their lunch menu only had a few options and maybe I should have asked for a regular sushi menu but stuck with what I was given.  For $7.25 I had 2 extremely mediocre sushi rolls (Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Crunch) salad, and miso soup.  The miso and salad were pretty much what you get everywhere, nothing earth shattering.  The sushi was pretty meh....it lacked flavor and the shrimp crunch was just topped with panko crumbs nothing spectacular.    I eavesdropped on the next table after my food arrived and they ordered off the regular sushi menu.....why didn't they give that to me?  From my experience today I will stick to Jade or 18 for good, quality sushi right down the road.  I may return to try the Hibachi."}
{"text":"Not bad but nothing special, I have seen the place and seen people on our neighborhood FB page talked it up. So last night we got a delivery from them  and it was just alright. Sushi wasn't anything special and sorta tasted like sushi  you can get at Harris Tetter . Will try again maybe just didn't get the right rolls tonight."}
{"text":"We've been sitting here for 30 minutes, still no appetizer, the waitress seems to hate her job. If you want anything(like to order) you have to flag her down, then she will just stand at your table mumbling. When our tools finally do come out, one is wrong. The food was actually decent, but the service was sooo bad.  As for my ratings, I always put a higher priority on device, I'm a good cook, if I want perfect food I make it myself, when I go out I want a perfect experience"}
{"text":"This is a terrible place to go for sushi for so many reasons. The portions are tiny, the customer service is rude and awkward and it is not authentic at all. The first time I went I had a sushi combination. I am not an expert but I have been eating sushi for about 25 plus years and it just seems really thrown together and cheap. It lacks the presentation that Japanese sushi is known for.  For example, the cuts of fish were tiny and the rice was very dry. The rolls were rolled way too tight the seaweed was chewy and nearly impossible to bite into. It was served with a miso soup that tasted way too salty and not fresh at all. They served it with Chinese soy sauce which is completely different than Japanese soy sauce and should never be used on sushi. I found that to be pretty unforgivable. BIG faux pas! Even though I didn't love it, I decided to try it again the following day because I was hoping to have a better experience and planning on making a substitution if possible. When I went in to place my order, I'm pretty sure I was speaking with the owner or an owner. She was pretty rude about me substituting salad for miso soup until I mentioned that I tried it the day before and didn't care for it. Suddenly her attitude changed when she realized I'd come twice in a row. She allowed it. But, she was still very clearly displeased. I mean, I felt really really bad just for going in and ordering from there. She then began yelling at the guy making the sushi (I don't think I can call him a sushi chef based on what I received.) They were having a full on argument. It was very awkward. Finally, she returned with the food which was just as disappointing as the first time. She said \"see you tomorrow,\" as i left. I had ordered to go and was so mad when I got home and found there wasn't any wasabi or ginger in it. Boo. Not going back ever."}
{"text":"My friend and I discovered this place quite by accident when the bar next-door closed early so we thought we give it a try just to have a beer. We looked around it what other people reading and decided to try some of the food just sitting at the bar and were delightfully pleased by the quality and taste of the sushi. Very decently priced."}
{"text":"Just opened on the edge of the Ballantyne area is a new Asian Sushi Bar. The restaurant is located behind Bojangles next to Carolina Bistro. We have stopped by a few times and everything has been wonderful. I generally get the Sashimi and the pieces are large and fresh. The sushi rolls are the same large and fresh and their prices are very reasonable compared to others in the area. They also have a Chinese menu and a Teriyaki and Hibachi menu for those who do not like the raw stuff. A friend of mine had the Hibachi and loved it. If you stop by, keep in mind they have just opened and are having the usual growing pains of a new business. One last note, there is no alcohol being served for 30 days due to local regulations. But they will have a full bar soon. They are open for lunch and dinner 7 days a week!"}
{"text":"We really like this place. Very friendly staff. The selection is wide ranging and very good. They accommodate special requests. One more awesome factor is that they deliver. They are our go-to place. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Think of the freshest fish you can possibly imagine. Now take the opposite of that and turn it into sushi. This place is dirty, and the food is gross. Hurry up and close down to make room for a better restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant I give it a 2 star, its a real nice place small and cozy and very clean!!!! They serve there food in big white elegant plates. The food is ok not the best."}
{"text":"This was a neat little find. I do like \"hole-in-the-wall\" sushi places and this one hit the spot. My friend suggested it (I really need to get him on Yelp!) and so we stopped in here for a late lunch.  We both ordered the sashimi special, which comes with the usual salad topped with ginger dressing (does it have to be so cold??) and a bowl of spicy egg drop soup (mushrooms??). But the main course was where it was at. As with so many sushi restaurants, a great presentation. Each piece of fish was individually set in a wooden boat, garnished with crab salad and a carved lemon. You have to look at the picture to see how well this chef did.  Price is a little high, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry to say that I do not like their food. I'm not sure what kind of seasonings and things that they used, but I couldn't eat my meal it tasted so horrible. I did take my sushi home with me because that's kind of hard to screw up, but the main part of my meal was just bizarre tasting. I've had all kinds of Asian in Japanese and Chinese food specifically all over the country and I've never tasted anything this weird in my life.  Now the service on the other hand, was perfect. The people that own the place are delightful and extremely friendly I just really wish their food tasted better or that they would change whoever they buy their cooking supplies from. Because my first experience was so violently bad and made me so sick I don't know if I'll ever be willing to give it a try again.  The sanitation appeared to be quite nice and clean.  The only reason why I gave the two stars was simply because of the quality of service and the cleanliness of the restaurant, but it had nothing to do with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Food was awesome but the service needed some work. Food was a 10 service was a 5.  Price was comparable to other restaurants.  The waitress was a little unfriendly to our table but showed a more friendly demeanor towards another family."}
