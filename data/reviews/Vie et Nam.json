{"text":"First time here at this place in The Montreal Area.  It is inside the mall near the Courtyard Marriott within walking distance.   There was no line when I was there so the service was fast.  The gentleman taking my order was friendly.  I ordered the pho dac biet regular size with the vietnamese ice coffee.  The food was good for mall food, but not as good as your traditional vietnamese pho restaurant.  I would come back for another meal the next time I am in town for business."}
{"text":"I ate there a couple of time, I enjoyed the spring rolls and the grilled chicken. They are pretty quick during the lunch hour, so if you're in a rush and in place vertu thats the place to go!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise this restaurant is! I had passed it by numerous times even though the menu photos of the Banh Mi beckoned me every time. 
I finally decided to try it. I ordered a Beef Banh Mi trio which includes a fairly large sandwich, a small bowl of Pho and a drink.

The sandwich was fantastic! Great spices on the beef within a crispy fresh baguette but what makes this sandwich great are the pickled vegetable that they top it with.

The Pho was a pleasant surprise as well. Clear very tasty broth with noodles that have a great texture.

I have already been back here three times since my first visit. I haven't had the opportunity to write my review until now. The staff is exceptionally friendly and the establishment is spotless. 

I can't imagine what more you could ask for from a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Double rainbow all the way* at this Vietnamese eatery.

Try the Rock Star. Vie et Nam's rendition of the popular banh mi sandwich is filled with a medley of moist pork and chicken chunklets plus cilantro and jalapenos, atop a respectable baguette. Their pickles are sliced rather large, but I'm still a fan of this rock star; it holds its own against competing sandwich places.

Don't like banh mi? Don't worry: They offer dishes besides sandwiches.

{"text":"I mean to take pictures of the food every time I am here but it's so good I gobble it down before I can take pics. 

I am a big fan of Vietnamese Pho, what I love the most is the sandwiches that they make here. This being Montreal they have a French name \"Baggette\". What ever language they are delicious, especially when they are made to order. The pork on is my favourite but here they have this one called Rock Star its pork, chicken, and beef - so so so goooood. All combos come with a small Pho soup and you can add some fried bananas so sweeten the palette afterwards. 

I highly recommend this place, it's family own and operated so the service is exceptional in my opinion. They are in a mall, Place Vertu, so keep in mind that they have mall hours which means they are not open late."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for this food court joint. Service is lightning quick and the variety of meals is good enough for me that I visit at least one a week. 

Recommendations :

Their Vietnamese baguettes are delicious and hit the spot.

Their Tonkinese Soups is very good. 

Their grill menu has a nice variety and I've probably tried them all at this point.  Marinated in lemongrass? Yes, please! Vermicelli or side as a side option completes the lunch meals very nicely."}
