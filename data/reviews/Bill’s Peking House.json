{"text":"Have ordered twice and both times very impressed. Fresh, hot and good quality. Delivery can be long on weekends but it really seems like the only good quality take out Asian restaurant in our area. Friendly customer service on the phone and at the door, have yet to go in to the restaurant though."}
{"text":"I'm from New York and for the last 13 years I've been searching for the simple, delicious, authentic Chinese I've grown accustomed to. I'm still looking. My \"Tell\" is fried rice, it has to be made with long grain rice, not be sticky, oily or mushy, use green onion and fresh vegetables, no corn and egg prepared correctly. Fried Rice-fail.
I also ordered Salt and pepper squid. It was dusted with flour but the flour had congealed with oil and moisture, which usually means the said was still frozen when fried. Very salty with little pepper.
Salt and Pepper Squid-fail
The chicken Almond Soo-Gai was OK, but a little dry, -pass. The Wor Wonton soup had a nice stock and nice mix of meat, wonton and vegetables-pass. And the  Ginger Beef was over cooked-fail. It's a 2.5 star rating from me. 

Disappointed again."}
{"text":"Overpriced with so so food. Tries to be a fancy dining experience, older clients probably keeping this place going. Clean and good service just not impressed with quality of food for what you pay."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've ever had. Great selection, my family has been coming here for years"}
{"text":"Have heard of good reviews on this place. Went for NYE and I have to say, I will never go anywhere else. The quality of this food is exceptional."}
{"text":"First off - I'm Chinese and I know my Chinese food. This is by far the best Chinese restaurant in Calgary and especially amazing that it is in the south and don't have to go to China Town or the north for good Chinese food.

The decor is pleasant and very clean as compared to other Asian joints. It's on the second floor of the building so there's a set of stairs (believe there is elevator access) but the view is pretty nice if you get a table by the window. 

If you are looking for authentic Chinese dishes the best thing to do is ask for the Chinese Menu if you can read or ask the waiter to recommend some dishes. The chef usually has daily fresh market items which are not listed on the menu! The English menu has a mix of authentic Chinese and traditional western dishes as well. My personal favourite includes the Peking Duck, Lobster with noodles and Soy Sauce Chicken.

The service is generally pretty good, the staff are very knowledgeable and have been there for awhile. Definitely a lot better than most asian restaurants. 

Price wise it's on the mid to high range compared to other Chinese restaurants but the quality and freshness of the ingredients is def much better (you get what you pay for). They're also the only Chinese restaurant I know that doesn't use MSG - so you're not drinking 10 glasses of water, an hour after the meal. 

Good tip is to come on weekdays when they're generally less busy, if you come on the weekend try to get a reservation as it may be hard to get a table. Note: They're only open for dinner."}
{"text":"Order 3 course Peking duck combo .. soup : fried rice and Peking duck .... honestly the moment Peking duck was served and I found that the drumstick and one piece of duck has hair or feather on it ... my appetite shut off right away I'm not sure if it is normal :("}
{"text":"I must say I was impressed with this place went here for dim sum an it was better then a lot of places in China town service was great an prices were fair"}
{"text":"Awesome place for Chinese. Family favourite for many years. Delivery, take out or dine in, good food and good service. We love bills!"}
{"text":"Had take out twice from Bill's...top shelf both times.  Great rice, dumplings, special chow mein, hot & sour soup, beef in black bean sauce...best in town!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are regular customers for few years. I find their food quality is one of the top in Southern Calgary. I have tried few other Chinese restaurants in the area and they are not as good. For the prices and the dish size, they are fair. They are always so busy over the weekend for dine-in. I brought some Asian friends over to the restaurant and they say the food are pretty authentic. Then again, who am I to say?"}
{"text":"A lot of good reviews and all very valid.  If you live in the South East and can't make it downtown to China Town Bill's will get you satisfied.  We have been going for too many years to remember and I agree, good food, expensive, great service (really to get you in and out quickly).  I'm pretty sensitive to MSG and haven't had an issue; if anything, they are over salting in lieu of MSG.  I know because after eating at Bill's with 'healthy' choices, IE., lot of veggies, with stir fried shrimps, nothing deep fried/sugared, I gained 5 pounds and it took a week to get rid of!  A wonderful restaurant just located up the road called Mina's in Avenida is my first choice now for Asian food (they are Vietnamese)."}
{"text":"This is Calgary, that is why I give it a 3 star rating. Typical a focus-on-white men place. Any Chinese express at any food court in any Vancouver mall can do better than this place. But again, this is Calgary."}
{"text":"We got delivery. The ginger beef was burnt and the shrimp were mushy and inedible. I took the food back and asked for my money back and the staff were very rude!"}
{"text":"Allllrighty then! Tonight, I had my second experience here and I was completely satisfied and my poor take out experience was practically erased; hence the edited review.

I did order the duck again (3 course version no less) and its even better when dining in. But, just so you know, take out duck is just as delicious and probably the best duck I've had in Calgary - scout's honor! My wife ordered this pork dish which I can't remember the name of because she said it in Mandarin, but it was basically braised pork belly in caramelized onions... I think. Too strong for me, but my wife enjoyed it so thats all that counts really lol :P

We brought our baby here and being a Thursday night, it wasn't that busy. I know I won't be dining here on Friday, Saturday or Sundays because I know they're really busy those nights and not the best time to bring a baby because its too noisy. But nonetheless, the staff were very accommodating and even held baby a little while so we could enjoy our meal and they could enjoy hold the baby! :D 

This place is really a hidden gem. The name, \"Bill's Peking House\" doesn't really say, \"hey! I'm an authentic Chinese restaurant\", but thank goodness for Yelp and other reviews because I know I'd be reluctant to try this place if I didn't see my fellow Elites give this place 5 stars let alone undoubtedly great reviews.

You must eat their duck, the experience with the wraps, onions and cucumbers is calming. I have yet to try more than 2 dishes on their menu, so I'll definitely be coming back for that... in good time, all in good time.

I lived in Calgary more than half my life and I can't believe I only recently discovered this place even after living in Lake Bonavista and Shawnessy for several years - crazy daisy!

Peace"}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this place. It is a hole in the wall above a bunch of shops, but OMG it is incredible! 
The eggrolls are a must, they are so crispy and the spices will give you foodgasm. All the dishes were so fresh and delicious that we were in heaven the entire meal.
The sweet and sour pineapple chicken balls have always been my favourite, these had large chunks of pure white meat.
Seriously, go here now."}
{"text":"This restaurant has what other chinese restaurant fails to achieve. Service was very quick and servers are friendly. The prices are just slightly higher than most but we'll worth the difference! You walk in with a sense of fine dining environment. Menu contains all that an authentic chinese restaurant would have. The hot pot was the best I've had in Calgary so far! (I've been to about 15-20 chinese restaurants). So far this place tops out to be one of the best chinese dining experience I've had to date. Big props to the owners for doing a great job!"}
{"text":"By far the worst Chinese food I've ever eaten. I wasn't even able to stomach a full plate."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, the only real complaint I have about Bill's is their prices are a little higher  then other chinese restaurants. I guess you get what you pay for. I usually order the peking style porkchops, fried rice, beef & green onion hotpot, and salt & pepper seafood. 

Also by checking the CHR website like I usually do when dining out I found they've had more then a couple of health violations."}
{"text":"The food was good. Traditional Chinese food this menu reminds of 20 years back. Could be more up to date new items. Over all not bad but not much choices when you are in south Calgary for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Best dim sum I have found in the south. Tried the sticky rice and enjoyed it with some sauce from the steamed curry squid which was delicious. Hostess was extremely helpful and very friendly. Had good service with tea and water being topped up. Spareribs in black bean sauce was a different take then the usual but still good flavour"}
{"text":"Hands down my #1 'western' chinese food restaurant. Nothing even compares. 

Avoid take-out when you can, like all chinese food, the in-restaurant taste is 10x better. Why do you ask? My theory is because when the package up the food for delivery, the steam softens some of the tastier items, specifically Ginger Beef, which while originally crispy loses a bit of its edge.

Left overs from Bill's is awesome too, for best results reheat in the oven."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here ... 
I ordered delivery for my food . 
I was so excited to eat it until I opened it up and there as 0 sauce , was chewy and unbeatable ! 
When I called the manager to tell him it was gross and I wanted a refund he told me he could not provide me with a refund and I would have to basically suck up this disgusting food!!! NOT impressed ! Only thing he offered me was extra food next time I order . I will never eat here again.."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery, told me I had to order $45 worth...website says $35.
Blandest food I have EVER eaten...never, ever again!
Palace chicken is tasteless crap!"}
{"text":"Delivery was extremely fast!!  Excellent food.  Very fresh. Driver was friendly. 

Highly recommend Bill's."}
{"text":"Being from the US, we have a lot of Chinese restaurants in our area, but we travelers agreed that Bill's had to be one of the best that we have eaten.  This place is one of my cousin's favorite, and we can see why.  We were not very hungry, but we could not stop eating the food.  The food was delicious from the egg drop soup, to the Mongolian beef to the chicken and cashews in bean sauce.  The two items that were our favorites were the chow fun and the palace chicken.  The palace chicken was crispy and the sauce was delicious.  It is marked as hot, but it's very mild.  I highly recommend it,"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. With a hungry two year old, after two hours (20 minutes seating time which turned out to be 45 mins and ordering time to no food over and hour. Others that came after were seated before for the reason of table size?!). We left with empty stomachs. No apologies or explanation from then. They were not prepared for the busy father's day rush. Terrible."}
{"text":"i'm from toronto and i know good chinese food when i eat it.. this place is actually pretty good considering its in calgary!! (no offense!) but this is one of my top go to places for authentic chinese food. came here for chinese new years expecting it to be pretty busy..which it was.. For good reason!!! staff was super friendly and good... even on a busy night like chinese new years! food was prompt and our food was so good! hot and sour soup was pretty good!! my fave!!"}
{"text":"We met up with Toronto's Chris P for a UYE who turned out to be a Calgary native that went to the same high school as me and Kenny M! Small world! Go Grandin GHOSTS...*cough*.  Also Chris got a chance to marvel at the sight of Asian Spock :)

See previous review. Not being lazy but seriously, why waste words repeating the same message over and over again! Although in our recent visit Bill was awesome enough to end our meal with complimentary candied fruit. Goes to show how well he treats his patrons! Also Andy D is too lazy to admit it but even he was impressed in this last visit...three stars...PFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTT!"}
{"text":"13 of us went for dim sum. You order from a sheet
Had 3 dishes from the regular menu and 20 orders from the dim sum sheet. Great food 
 Every one was stuffed and took 5 orders home. $25 a person before tip. Highlite was salt and pepper squid legs"}
{"text":"Delicious food, awesome atmosphere, but bad service on my last visit. I have dined at Bill's a couple times a year for the past 30 years - it's our family go-to Chinese restaurant for special occasions because of its excellent food, atmosphere and No MSG. Chinese New Year is a big deal for me, so on the Year of the Dog 2018, I made a reservation for 7. They had plenty of staff on. Got a fantastic table by the window. All smiles, happy day. First lovely Holly took our drink order & brought our tea.... Never saw Holly again at our table. Then lively, smiley Rick took our meal order - but he said No Dim Sum tonight - yet in the past I have had Dim Sum on a Friday & they advertise for Friday, Saturday, Sunday & holidays. So we made it easy, a couple group combos, plenty of food. Half hour later, a couple egg rolls & spring rolls. 45 minutes after, still no food, no water, no refill hot water for tea, no chopsticks, no knives. Tried to stop other waiters for glasses of water but got the \"too busy\", \"look away\" and \"walk faster\". I see a couple tables around us get Dim Sum .. !!?? A large family table and a couple smaller date tables. (Not cool, Rick.) An hour & 15 minutes in, we get rice and vegetables. Then over 20 minutes after that, the rest of the dishes slowly leave the kitchen and make it to the table, one at a time. By the time the delicious Ginger Beef gets there, we are done. Rick only came by table three times in two hours. I was disappointed for my guests that night because they had never been to Bill's and I had told them great things about it. They enjoyed the food but we all commented on the lack of table service. I would still recommend it as a decent place to dine in at, just hope they do better next time."}
{"text":"Bill's Peking House is located in the Lake Bonavista neighbourhood in a small strip plaza. 

I came on a Thursday night planning on getting some dim sum, having heard that it was good here. When I arrived, I requested the sim sum menu only to find out that dim sum was only offered Fri-Sun from 10-3. However, the manager/waiter in charge talked to the chef and let me know that about half of the dim sum menu could still be made. With about 30 items on the dim sum menu in total, this was fine by me.

For a group of four people, we ordered 8 items from the dim sum menu plus a beef and green bean dish. This ended up being the perfect amount for four people and came to $80 before tip.

Highlights included the pork and vegetable dumplings which came in a hand wrapped thick breading, the beef and green beans with black bean sauce and the bbq pork buns.

I look forward to coming back on the weekend to try the full menu."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here in over 20 years. Best Chinese food around. We are particularly fond of the ginger beef and lemon chicken."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. It is the only Chinese food restaurant I have been to because I love it so much and don't want to go anywhere else. I need to spread my wings and try other places but if I like what I have then why change a good thing? 
I have been going there for years so I know how to get there obviously. Some people who have never been there before get lost. It is in a strip mall in the beautiful community of Lake Bonavista in a strip mall and it is on the second level so sometimes people are confused about how to get up or in there. 
Don't give-up though if you start getting frustrated because it is SO worth it. I specifically really like there meals for the specific amount of people that are in your group because you always get so much food and it is a very good deal opposed to getting all those things separately. Even the meal for one is more than enough food. 
They lose just one star though or the fact that they use styrofoam containers for take out instead of paper of cardboard take out containers. Chances are depending on how hungry you are- you will always have leftovers but Calgary can't recycle styrofoam yet so thats why they lost one star."}
{"text":"My son and I went there for dinner, before our movie. I dont know what it was, but we were treated with disdain. We felt unwelcome, as if we were being judged like we weren't going to leave a large tip like the other parties. We waited at our table for half an hour before our order was taken. The dumplings were cold and SO oily. Not impressed, and will not go back. Probably would have been happier spending money at the Vietnamese restaurant a few shops down."}
{"text":"Although we waited here for 15 minutes before we got a table. Partly our fault for not reserving a table on a Saturday night. Still we were greeted with great service and good food. Food was great especially their Ginger Beef and their Peking Duck. Definitely coming back to try their Dimsum"}
{"text":"NEVER going back. NEVER.

We arrived at 11:45 and placed our order at 12:00... it was rung in at 12:24! 1st dish arrived at 1:05. then NOTHING unitl 1:25 ... like 90 minutes after arriving - at Dim Sum yet! We asked a few times if they forgot about us - 5 minutes ... 5 minutes... .5 minutes. The tables around us turned 2 or 3 times BEFORE we got any food!

We CANCELED the rest of our order at 1:45. YES. Cancelled the REST of our order AT 1 hour and 45 minutes LATER and WENT for donairs on the way home. Left more hungary than when we arrived. That has never happend to me before. EVER.

The staff could not have cared less ... 

Words can't. even. THE WORST EVER."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is fresh, service is good and honestly my favorite Chinese place!"}
{"text":"This is great dim sum.  Have been looking for a dim sum Resturaunt in the south and glad I found this one. If you are a dim sum beginner it might be hard as you need to order off the menus and there are no pictures. It is an English description but you do need to know what you like by name. My suggestion to them would be to have a picture menus for newbies. However the food and service was great. Quality was good and came fast. Hostess very friendly and made us feel welcome. Not always the case in dim sum restaurants. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"2018.02.13. before the valentine's day, my boyfriend took me to Bill's Peking House for dinner. It is a local Chinese restaurant and the most famous dish serves in this place such as egg foo yong & Peking duck. It was our first time having dinner at this restaurant.

Environment:

We arrived restaurant around 4:30 pm right after my work before the dinner time. The restaurant was just open. The restaurant was on the second floor of the building. It was empty inside. We grabbed a seat directly when we walked into the restaurant. Inside the restaurant, there are many tables. Most of them were a table for four people. The whole environment was very organized, nice and clean.

Service:

After we sat down, the server brought the food menu to our table and began to serve us drink. Our table server is a Chinese lady. She is very nice and friendly.

Food:

After looking at the menu, we decided what to order for the dinner. We had Peking Duck 3 courses and starter platters. The starter platters include Sesame shrimp toast, Dumplings and salt & pepper ribs. Peking Duck 3 courses, which includes Wraps, Soup & Choice of fried rice, chow mein, and bean sprouts. All the food came out with large portions. They were all well cooked and very tasty.

Prices: 

The prices of food were OK. Comparing with other Chinese Restaurants, it's very cheap.

In summary, we enjoyed our dinner at Bill's Peking House. Besides the dinner menu, this restaurant also offers Dim Sum for breakfast. I would like to try their dim sum too. Highly recommend people to try the food at Bill's Peking House. Great customer services, Great food, Great prices."}
{"text":"Yummy and freshly made dim sum.  They make their own egg tarts pastry as well.  Peking duck was very tasty.  It's as good as what you get in good places in Hong Kong.  Chef must be from Hong Kong."}
{"text":"It's a favourite. Good, hot and quick westernized Chinese food. They have the real stuff too, but that's not why I go there.

Ginger chicken and to a lesser extent the ginger beef are the best I have had anywhere. I miss Calgary's white people Chinese food..."}
{"text":"Bill's has the market for dumplings. Doughy, thick, and delicious. Never had a better dumpling before Bill's! 
The items we ordered came quickly and were all delicious. The sauces were less sweet than sauces tend to be which I really appreciated - no mouth-pucker or tooth-cringe.
This place tends to get pretty busy so I advise reservations. Believe me, the last thing you want is to smell all the delicious food go by at Bill's when you're starving while you wait for a table.
The only thing we were disappointed with was the Salt and Pepper Squid. It was super, suuuuuuper chewy and not that tasty. For almost $20 a pop we expected something a lot yummier. But the rest was great."}
{"text":"Update:

Holy heartburn!  We were here for a function last night and I don't remember having MSG nightmares like that for a long time.  They don't even use this much MSG in food court Chinese food anymore!

Service was still mediocre, but the Peking duck was good."}
{"text":"How... HOW did I not head down here sooner? For real. When Yelpers say there's a Calgary establishment and I need to drive halfway across town to get to it, I need to get my ass in my car and go. 

Bill's. Where has your ginger beef been all my life? What's that? Right in your kitchen, served on your tables, mouths and mouths before me having devoured it's gingery and crunchy goodness while I went without even though I knew better... the reviews told me better.

I am a ginger beef fanatic. I love the stuff, always have ever since I was a wee tot and old enough for my mother to feed me Western Chinese food. There were 3 things I would eat. Chicken balls, chicken fried rice and ginger beef. Except if I had had Bill's, the rest would've been spoiled for me after that! And now... this will be the case. 

It's not just the ginger beef here that gets my 5 stars though. It's that it's just a consistently solid experience. Just like everyone said, Bill himself was there to greet us at the door when we walked up the stairs. We snagged the last table for 2, the rest of the restaurant was full. And we ordered way too much food for two people.

The meal consisted of:
Ginger beef
Shrimp sizzling rice
lemon chicken
egg rolls

All of which you need to get. The sizzling rice was fun! I've never had it before. But it was kind of like pouring a thick sweet and sour soup over top of rice that crackles and sizzles as the liquid hits it. Besides the ginger beef, that was my favourite part.

No doot aboot it, this girl's coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Oh Bills! One of my favorite restaurants in this fine city. Perhaps its all the special occasion dinners that were flawlessly executed,or perhaps the super awesome and very consistent service. The food here is some of the best western chinese in Calgary for certain, and thats no joke!

 I hold Bills dear to my heart. and Bill himself is a classy host and knows how to run his restaurant like a well oiled machine. He goes out of his way to please customers and seems greatly respected by his employees. 

Notable dishes at bills...

-Ginger Beef (one of Calgary's best IMHO)
-Pork Dumplings (My second favorite dumpling EVER!)
-Lemon Chicken (my Pa's favorite)
-Mongolian beef (exotic flavour in chinese style)
-cantonese chow mein( yummy egg noodles with sauce and little treasures like shrimp, bbq pork, chicken and veggies)

Another thing worth mentioning is the way that veggies are treated at Bills. The cooks take great care in making sure that the veg is cooked the right way. Never overcooked. Always fresh and crunchy and delicious!  At other chinese places I have noticed that sometimes the technique and quality of produce can be quite inconsistent but bills is bang on every time! 

I have to say if you want bills at its best don't bother getting take out or delivery. like any chinese food, it is best eaten right from the kitchen, fresh and hot. 

I highly recommend bills to anyone! Come and be marveled by the service of bills finest waiter! Spock himself!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food restaurant in Calgary, to the best of my knowledge.
Fried items are crisp and stir fried were properly done at high temp (smokey aroma and chewy inside).
You know it's a legit place when it's packed with Chinese customers who look 120% main lander Chinese"}
{"text":"It's OK. Not bad but not great. 

This was my first time at Bill's. We went there as a family event and it was recommended by my wife's parents. 

I am very fond of Peking style Chinese food and we seek it out every time we come to Calgary. 

Bill's has all the standards on the menu, ginger beef, pot stickers, etc.  The potstickers were pretty good, the ginger beef was just okay. You can find better as there are lots of Peking style restaurants in Calgary. 

I won't be rushing back to Bill's."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in South Calgary. The service is phenomenal, which quick and old-school personal service (if you're a regular, they know your name and often your favorite dishes), and of course the food is always delicious. Bill himself is a very friendly and approachable guy, and is committed to charity: he puts part of his proceeds back into the Bonavista community that has supported him since 1988, and he also runs a pizza place (Pizza Delight) where kids eat for free.

Bill's is often our go-to for special events like birthdays and rehearsal dinners: get a round table with a lazy Susan, load it up with plates of ginger beef, sweet & sour pork, fried rice, squid, lemon chicken, chow mein and veggies, and go to town. It is on the second floor, so you can even get some exercise afterwards. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"As a teenager I used to come to Bill's regularly. But until last night I hadn't been in for about 5 years. It's great to see that things here are just as great as they've always been.

It's western Chinese food but it's top notch. They have all the basics that you would come to expect plus a few more. The menu is large. I dare you to see if you can't find your favorites on it.

The place is always busy so best bet is to make a reservation ahead of time.When you do get there, make sure to order the dumplings."}
{"text":"The epitome of western style Chinese food!.....not the greatest but better than Manchu Wok. though It possesses no stand out dishes, it is satisfying enough to get you through your hunger pangs. The service is also great......

based on the last meal:  The fried rice was bland....ginger beef good....dumplings tasty...chow main okay and the sautee beef utterly forgettable.

I would definitely recommend other Chinese restaurants over Bill's but I have to say it does get the job done on most nights.

If Harbour City or Sun's is booked up or too far Bill's is definitely a viable option."}
{"text":"Ahh, Bill's.
Nobody satisfies the \"white-man's-Chinese\" urge quite like you.

On the whole, everything is very well-prepared. 
Bill's will leave you feeling full, but never gross.

I am hard-pressed to find a dumpling better than Bill's. 

The service, however, is really what sets Bill's apart. 
Ever-attentive, ever-professional, these white-polo-and-denim-clad masters are ready to serve you at your very whim and command.
And none more masterful than the great Spock himself.

For this reason (as well as the freshness of food) it is always a better choice to dine-in than carry out (or worse still, delivery).

God bless you, Bill. You have changed my life."}
