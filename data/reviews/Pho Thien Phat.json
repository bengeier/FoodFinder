{"text":"Had a decent lunch here where we ordered a Pad Thai and a Thai style noodle. Both items came relatively quick and the owners were extremely friendly and accommodating as well. 

The pad Thai came with a decent portion and was pretty authentic, with noodles that were textured just right. The Thai style noodle basically is a rare beef noodle in Tom yum soup. The bill came to around 18. 

Overall I'll definitely visit again if I'm craving pho in the area as I do think they're better than some of the other pho chain restaurants around"}
{"text":"After a night of drinking, nothing hits the spot like a good bowl of pho the next day (or the night of haha). Unfortunately, there are not too many options by my neighborhood. So I am always on the hunt to find one relatively close by. 

Drove over by the Thorncliffe area as I remembered seeing a Vietnamese restaurant there. Hidden amongst the bustle of people out enjoying the nice weather is Pho Thien Phat. 

The restaurant is spacious with lots of seating compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. We were greeted by friendly staff. The seating area was clean and looked renovated. 

We ordered fresh shrimp rolls to start. They were tightly wrapped and had the right amount of each ingredient.  One bite into it and it didn't fall apart as I've experienced at some restaurants.  Then we ordered a large bowl of rare and flank beef pho as well as a pho bo kho. Both were satisfying.  The pho broth was flavourful and not too salty. The pho bo kho definitely hit the spot. It had mild flavouring and again not overly salty. The three dishes came out to be just under $30 before tip. 

We were quite satisfied and will be back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Drove 25mins for lunch on a Saturday, place was empty: not a good sign. Had a large rare beef & flank pho for $10.50 which was bland & more like a medium size compared to other Vietnamese places. 

Super disappointing considering that yelp gave it 4/5 stars. Guess I'll be sticking with Pho88 or the original Pho dau bo forever."}
{"text":"My favourite Pho restaurant, delicious food, good price, large quantities and the staff are very friendly"}
{"text":"Ordered the bún riêu (tomato broth with crab/shrimp paste) and bún bò Huê.  Broth is a bit lighter and not as tomato-y than I expected but still good especially on a cold spring day like today."}
{"text":"Came for dinner (had dinner for two). 
Very clean and nice inside, host was super friendly. 

We had pho with rare beef (medium), a viet pork sandwich, and cold rolls (p2, vb1, a2). It came out to 18$ total. 

Pho was very good, beef was pink when it came out. 

I found the sandwich super sweet and the bread kind of stale, but my dining partner loved it, best he's had. 

Rolls were delicious and fresh. 

Overall, great experience! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"We come here every other day. The viet food here is legit!! Tastes like grandma's :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Curry Beef vermicelli but I substitute Rice Noodles instead.  Every restaurant has their own recipe but I think theirs is 2nd best in the city behind Xe Lua Chinatown (choo choo train).  The brisket was very tender and fatty, exactly how I like it!   I order beef brisket from all Viet restaurants. 

Spring rolls were decent, and the menu is more vast compared to some other Viet places."}
{"text":"Amazing! I have been here now 4 times and have never been let down. The staff are extreamly friendly, and get the orders out pretty quick!
I usually get their pho, but I recently tried their vermicelli and was not disapointed. 
I will continue to come back here!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Had the Pho rare beef and vegetable spring roll. Both were very good. Broth was hot and there was a good ratio of noodle to meat. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"An unassuming spot for excellent pho. Funny thing is this guy seems like a one man show. He does everything and does it very well and enjoys it all. Service is huge to me which is why I say so. He's got a new gold necklace today he's also got Vietnam history vids playing on his laptop. Very thoughtful service never been disappoint and v authentic imo. I'm Chinese/viet so I think I know lol. Their menus got everything I love. Found out his name is Tom. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Pho spot! We've through Vietnam north to south so finding a good Pho spot in our neighbourhood wasn't easy! My boyfriend loves Pho Bo kho and this place has it! Food is great and staff is amazing, he works his butt off! Will always go here!"}
{"text":"A family ran joint with the husband running the front and the wife running the kitchen. These people know how to make a damn good bowl of pho; in my the best in the GTA. What makes their pho so great is the broth. The broth is pristine, not overly salty and balances well with the noodles they use. Portion size is excellent. If you're going there for the first time, and you're a big eater, I would recommend getting a medium P1 (pho), VB1 (bbq pork sandwich.... It's amazing) and the spring rolls. You'll feel great about supporting this family business and enjoy one of the finest bowl of noodles in the city. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I would consider this an average to less then average Vietnamese restaurant. I just ate their Vermicelli with a side of broth. For the price which is $9.95 I thought it big and colourful but it was something any place could whip up. The broth was good so I might try their pho next time but doubt I will come back."}
{"text":"Really good food. Ive come twice, I've had the pho and the rice dishes, all really good. It's not the most unique tasting pho, and I've definitely had better but it definitely does satisfy a craving. They have a lot of options ranging from spicy, non spice, chicken, beef, vegetarian. The broth they use is absolutely delicious, super creamy and not too salty. 

The prices for the portion sizes are great too. Nothing over 10$. 

When I came here a second time, the service was really bad. They give you hot tea automatically, so we asked for ice water, but they didn't give even after we left. I came in a group of 6, they gave all out foods at different times which I found weird cause we had similar dishes. They forgot two people's orders and didn't end up giving it till we were about to leave, which at that point we just asked it to go."}
{"text":"Pho was overdosed with cinnamon. There were only 2 pieces of meat. Ordered bun with pork meat and seasoning was horrible. Portions for both dishes were sad. It was so little had to go to Mcds to grab more food."}
{"text":"This is probably the worse pho place I've been to. Its possible that it was an off night as it appears that they were short staffed, since there was only 1 person manning the tables. I could overlook the service and give it a higher rating, but the pho wasn't good. Ordered the large house special pho and it was the saddest looking pho ever. Meats were so sparse and noodles were very little. The seafood fried rice was sad as well, very little of anything. 2 shrimps, 2 fish balls, and 2 slices of squid. This isn't really my definition of seafood fried rice. The drinks (bean with coconut) weren't mixed and the coconut was just a blob of coconut that I had to mix in myself. I really don't know how the other reviewers have it such a high rating. 

P.s. arguing in Vietnamese in the kitchen doesn't mean the customers can't hear you from the dining area."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here but the service is awful! I called to order and after I placed my order the guy hung up on me! Didn't even tell me the price or any indication that my order was put through. Change your attitude cause it's seriously affecting your business!"}
{"text":"I had P7 and it was pretty good! After having vacationed in Vietnam, I can say the dish is 75% authentic."}
{"text":"We came there yesterday. Before we placed an order, we told the waitress the food allergy and also wrote down. We showed the waitress the picture of vegetable (coriander) that my friend is allergic to since we noticed other pho restaurants may put this kind of vegetable. My friend had zero tolerance on that vegetable. So we double checked with the waitress, who said she checked with the cook and manager that no coriander would be added to our order. 

My friend accidentally ordered the same dish twice (since we need to write down the order myself and he did not the meaning of the number in front. He wrote down 2 because he just thought the ordering of food. In fact, it is the quantity.) 

We were a little sad to find out that we two ordered three dishes with the same dish twice. But the waitress said that's what we wrote. Fine, I asked the waitress to pack the extra one to go. Then we started to eat. But my friend immediately found that the coriander in his dish before he started. I immediately told the waitress and told her this is food allergy! 

She told the dish away and come back in 2 minutes. Instead of remaking the food, they simply picked the coriander out from the dish and gave back the same one!

We were pretty upset. We told no coriander in all our orders, but found it in every dish! They did not treat food allergy seriously. 

We then left the restaurant without eating. But I paid more than thirty dollars. When I paid, I told a female manager that this is really food poisoning and  said \" if my friend went to hospital due to food allergy, would you pay for that?\" (Fortunately we discovered before eating).  After we bought other food nearby, I regretted paying more than 30 dollars for nothing, and not our fault. We told the food allergy beforehand, and discovered the coriander before eating. I went back and asked for refund. There was a man, who seems to be the owner of the restaurant. He told me he could refund half of the price, and I asked why should I pay for the other half. I tried to explain why I should not pay. He was not listening. He then asked me to choose: half of the price or leave. I asked him for a moment to think. He had no patience and yelled at me \"get out now\". They do not respect customers! Very rude. I was thinking about calling the police, but it was quite late and I had other commitment later in the night. Really did not have time to argue. I took the half of our bill back and left.


Terrible experience ever!

No care about the customers! Very rude! 

We don't want to risk our health.

Avoid if possible!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday night with 2 hours to closing and it was my first time here. They seemed to be under staff with an older man and woman (possibly the owners).  Didn't get any refills on tea.   Got SR8 was suppose to be a deep rich red beef with carrot dish but came out as yellow curry with beef that I'm pretty sure was pork and the curry was frozen because the potatoes had the texture for anyone how has made stew and froze it for later knows what I'm talking about. The curry was good besides the fatty pork and awful potatoes. A1 CHA GIO was great but tiny for $4.95 2 pieces cut to 4's. P1 PHO DAC BIET was good asked for no tripe but had it in my bowl,  could use more meat.  W10 MI XAO BO was good too.  Lots of options so we tried as much as we could fit.   Overall I would recommend if you are in the area.  Clean inside too.
***curry didn't come with a baguette but some sesame seed loaf."}
{"text":"I go to this venue quite frequently, as it's right beside me.  I wasn't too familiar with Asian food prior, but this place is awesome!!  The staff is always pleasant and professional. Even when it's very busy, we are always served quickly.  The atmosphere is great, too!  Very comfortable seeing, appropriate music, and CLEAN washrooms!  To top it off, the PRICE was very affordable.  Highly recommended, check this place out!  - Blaise"}
{"text":"I love stop by time to time this place.this plcae gave me the best bang for food all the time."}
{"text":"It's hard to find places that make the crab noodle soup Bun Rieu.  They make a delicious one here! Great service and hefty portion size.  We'll be back often to Pho Thien Phat!"}
{"text":"Solid choice for a team meal post game. Service is fast, separate bills are easy and food is good. 
Nothing particularly to make me want to go back or crave it over any other standard viet food, but would go back if I was in the area. Prices are good."}
{"text":"I had a large rare beef and tripe pho, and an order of fresh roll

pho broth:  good flavour and not too greasy 
portion: good amount of noodle, could have used more beef and tripe for large size bowl.

Fresh roll with shrimp: 1 order comes with 2 decent sized rolls. They were tasty and the peanut sauce was solid.

I'd go back again.


s: $7
m: $8
L: $9"}
{"text":"Nice place, very friendly guy who took my take-out order.  We got vegetarian fresh rolls, mango salad, shrimp fried rice, and pho.  All delicious!  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cook like friendly and truly from Vietnam. Food is good and best time to go is weekdays."}
{"text":"Gave it a shot again this evening for dinner. Ordered chicken beef roll vermicelli (B18). The taste is ok. I'm used to the thinner noodles and more meat. The cucumbers were cut too thick. The service wasn't great or anything. We're always on the look out for pho better than pho metro on warden/lawrence. Going to try pho 88 don mills tomorrow."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5-star for having very patient and accommodating staff on top of great food.
They do their best to serve the customer here. There was an overly dramatic customer when I went in one day. He was upset that there were noodles in his pho (pho = noodle soup, right?) the first time it came out. He then had a fit the second time it came out because they didn't add more soup and meat in lieu of the removed noodles. He then made a terrible scene in the entire restaurant saying how unacceptably he was being treated. 
I applaud the staff for being so patient. I would've been a lot less gracious. You can tell they try their best here. During that same dining experience, they also accommodated a large group with noisy kids, and a vegan who couldn't eat what she had ordered due to a mix-up on the menu. In all cases, the gentleman server (who I assume is the owner) treated everyone with the same respect and did his best to accommodate everyone.
Onto the food. It's a solid pho place. The soup broth in their pho tastes really good. I also recommend any pork dish, since their pork is light yet flavorful. I always get a side of either their shrimp salad rolls or spring rolls too, which go really well with the entrees.
Five stars for patient, hard-working staff and excellent food."}
{"text":"So I was craving pho and this was the closest one to us. We walk in, grumpy server told us where to sit. We order, another grumpy server took our order. Lol the pho was ok, a little bland and needed some love but once we got the sauces in there we were good to go. The deep fried spring rolls were delicious! I wanted more! I would probably come back, its cheap, big servings, and close by. I want to try more things off their menu."}
{"text":"The place is a clean hole in the wall located in a somewhat sketchy part of the town so going there during the day light hours is imperative.

The setting is clean and bright but they definitely didn't hire an interior decorator. That's okay as the food is great. 

I had a traditional Vietnamese dish- grilled chicken and pork chops on rice. 

It was perfect! Great taste for $9.99. You can add a third item for a few dollars more. 

A go to place that is worth a visit if you are in the area but remember, go during the day light hours. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Efficient service and the noodles were pretty tasty. Had the dry seafood noodle and it hit the spot!"}
