{"text":"Excellent service, great wings (love the spicy teriyaki), and a nice place to take the family."}
{"text":"You're a soccer establishment but you don't allow soccer shoes in your restaurant?????  What a joke!!  Who runs this place?  It's like playing golf and then being told you can't wear golf shoes in the clubhouse. IDIOTS!!!  Food is frozen food and service was bad!  Parking staff was great though."}
{"text":"Cute set up bar.  the food seems to be canned and or all pre made type items. Staying safe and consistent does not always mean places must buy frozen made items or use canned items like sauces or cheese. Great staff decor is sporty but they need to work on food quality and freshness."}
{"text":"Since the birth of my son, 20 months ago, I've prided myself on being a hip mom. I still refuse to put one of those soccer balls on my vehicle. But yes, I'm now officially a soccer mom. 

Lost Nation Sports Park is a pretty neat place. It's located inside of an old airplane hangar. How cool is that? 

In Northeast Ohio, we can't make great use of the outdoors all year long. Having an indoor space to play is a great thing. Although, they do have six outdoor regulation soccer fields and two sand volleyball courts for the outdoorsy types. 

LNSP offers a lengthy list of activities: baseball, basketball, indoor golf, inline hockey, soccer, volleyball, flag football. And LNSP programs aren't just for kids. There are several adult leagues as well. They even have a restaurant with a full bar on-site. You know, just in case your kids are driving you mad and you need some beverages. 

The staff at LNSP are wonderful. They'll be great with your kids, no matter the activity you choose to place them in. I'm really happy with LNSP and pretty glad that I became a soccer mom -- no matter how creepy that sounds."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, they have decent outdoor soccer fields, indoor fields, batting cages, and an attached bar.  They also have some basketball courts.  Overall it's underwhelming as it is aged pretty well.  All the tvs are old tube style, some of the flooring is peeling up --the kind that you peel and stick yourself.  Walls need painted, the batting cages are constantly in need of the pitching machine needing unclogged.  Everything is dirty and could benefit from a good sweeping and fresh paint.  Old video games sit against the wall, some burned out and unusable.   The upstairs is where the party rooms are.  

The bar is pretty cool because if you've ever watched a kids soccer game you may need a drink or two.

The place is situated on the grounds of lost nation airport and appears to be an old hangar.  It also appears to be run by high school kids as most of the employees are very young.   

Overall it's pretty busy on a Saturday night.   The parking lot is bombed out and will challenge your suspension too."}
{"text":"Good service and quick. Food was pretty standard, but its a good place to eat if you are here for a game."}
{"text":"It seems some of these reviews are including the restaurant/bar on site called The Players Club. They do have a separate YELP page. I'm sure it's convenient for some to have a restaurant option on site, but I've never made use of that option and will not be reviewing it. 

I've been at this park for multiple sporting events for my children and to virtual golf. This is a multi sport indoor facility with new outdoor fields for soccer now available. The variety of options is nice. There're indoor  basketball and soccer fields, indoor batting cages and a virtual golf room upstairs. There are small lockers and showers in the bathrooms. They run a variety of sports leagues out of this facility and give options for skill levels neglected by the ever growing market of travel sports to participate in sports. For that, I appreciate what they're doing.

On the other hand, the facilities are filthy and deteriorating. They have began repairing some of the parking area. You'll never be acknowledged by the staff without hunting one down. The fees are high for the quality of referees as far as I've encountered. 

I appreciate having such a facility in our area, but I'm not sure the owner appreciates the area back. Cleaning it up a bit and upgrading courts and equipment would be nice."}
{"text":"Great service, solid food(especially the wings) and a nice atmosphere makes Lost Nation a good place to throw a party or just meet some buddies for a drink. Give it a shot if you are in the area, you will not be disappointed."}
