{"text":"Weird and amazing and very very extra. I'd say this is pretty decent (not spectacular) ice cream but the aesthetic appeal and crepes are amazing.   The matcha is very intense/on the more bitter side - be warned. But the mochi on top was fun and added great texture.   Oh and who doesn't want to drink taro milk tea out of a light bulb?"}
{"text":"Love the crepes. Really surprised me. Strawberry flavor is better than mango. Also tried durian ice cream that was just ok"}
{"text":"I went in for their soft opening today and had a pretty good experience. I got one of their Strawberry Yogurt lightbulbs drinks and it was pretty good. The container wad cute and you were allowed to keep it. They're having a 20% promotion up until the 20th so that would be a great time to drop in.   Atmosphere: 5/5 I really liked the decor. The environment was well lit, well decorated, and the decorations were really nice. They had games available and plenty of places to sit. The only complaint I have is that the music is a little loud but it's not a big deal.  Food: ?/5 The pictures of the food look really nice and the prices are good. I haven't had a chance to try it yet.  Drinks: 4/5 The drink I got was really tasty. However, it was a little expensive and I think a lot of it can be attributed to the lightbulbs shaped container (which I wish there was an option to opt out of for a discount.) Some drinks also don't come with a lot of liquid whole others are filled more generously.  Service: 4/5 The service was a little slow and the cashier was confused at times. I attribute this mostly to the fact that they're new and still getting into the swing of things."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with this takoyaki. Where's the sauce? The flakes? It'd be nice to receive what I paid for. I get that I did come in pretty close to closing time (9:45PM - closes at 10) but that's why I asked the cashier if the kitchen was still open and if the takoyaki was still available. He said yes so I assumed it'd be fine to still order it, otherwise I would've gone to Kung Fu Tea instead to order some. Idk. This is just disappointing, the least they could have done is tell me they couldn't make it. Also, I believe there's supposed to be 6 in the order, but I only received 5. So there's that."}
{"text":"Awesome ambience and one of the best places to have Thai ice cream and crepe! Couldn't try the crepe but it looked delicious for sure. Also planning on trying the takoyaki they serve here the next time I go!"}
{"text":"Came into town for the weekend and popped in for dessert after dinner. Cute spot near U of I campus.   Ambience: Paris theme, inside there are some table and couches with cubes chairs. There are some games upfront if you want hang out for a bit. Connect Four, Uno, Jenga.   Food: great options for rolled ice cream, either get it in a cup or in a waffle taco. Or you can get a scoop of ice cream in a crepe that holds other flavors like Nutella or chocolate. Our friends had the rolled ice cream and crepes. I'd recommend the coffee addict, so good! Hope I can try a crepe next time. They also have some fries snacks like tater tots and lattice chips.  Drinks: you need to try these cute lightbulb drinks. We had the honey lemonade and I got to try the sparkling blueberry mojito. Both were awesome! And the lightbulb is too cool to pass up on.  Staff: Efficient and friendly. Fun to watch them make the crepes and rolled ice cream while you watch! Owners are great, they happened to be the staff for the night.   Overall, awesome spot and we'll be back when we're in town again.  Price: $4.95-$7.60, snacks run about $3.00. Good deal for what you get."}
{"text":"Tried their Thai ice cream with toppings of Oreo cookies and a raspberry. Took slightly longer than I had thought it would but no biggie. I was taken aback by the odd visuals (the ice cream underneath the toppings looked like an interesting mix between tiny logs and hair braids--at least in their shape)... I'm new to the Thai ice cream experience. So this is no knock on the food item itself. Just my own \"cultural\" ignorance. As such, just SEEING ice cream in a new form that I was not familiar with might have been worth the price of admission. It's the best thing to traveling I have these days. To be fair, prices are a bit steep for this cheap skate reviewer (around $6) for a single ice cream selection. But the portion was surprisingly big. And it tasted great, so that's all that mattered. Went there late night, which is one of the highlights of this place. I think it closes at midnight. Inside, the floor is sort of a futuristic light show that reminded me of the light aesthetics of the Dubai fountain (Google it and you'll see) with all the ocean-like blues and whites. The rest of the interior is what you'd expect (and continue to see in most of Asia) of a fancy, \"Euro-inspired\" slash \"Asian fusiony\" design of long boards, fancy tables, couches, and other random furniture bling. There was a relatively large number of young students in the place playing, of all things, Jenga and having a blast from the looks of it. I believe the place has board games on tap. So it appeared to be a nice place to hang with your friends and they didn't seem to mind at all how long you might want to stay. Finally, there are tons of outlets, so if you want a change of pace for studying, it's not a bad deal at all. Just make sure you expect to pay a bit more than a fiver."}
{"text":"Lightbulb drink was colored sugar water with not much else to taste.  Their ice cream was okay though"}
{"text":"This was a really fun dessert stop for my son and I on a Saturday night! I had the Nutella banana crepe (highly recommend!) which we both loved, and we also got the panda panda (Oreo) ice cream. We chose a marshmallow, picky sticks and pop rocks as our toppings and Carmel as the sauce! Everything tasted great, the atmosphere was fun- they even had games you could play while you were there (uno, Jenga etc) we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yummy food and a fun experience! Summer is the best on campus...less busy. We tried the Chai Thai Lightbulb drink...interesting.  I was probably over-adventurous as I had no idea what it was and still don't. It was a carrot orange color though I don't think there were any carrots in it and it lacked what I think of as \"chai\" spice. It did have an interesting texture element with the clear gummy rectangles floating in it."}
{"text":"The Chocolate Lover crepe is INCREDIBLE. If you're a fan of handheld dessert crepes, you're definitely in luck, as they have several unique options. Their lightbulb drinks are decent and worth a try as well. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"There was another Thai ice cream place that I used to go to but I really like the ambience of Paris Super Crepes a lot more."}
{"text":"I have honestly never felt the need to review anything on here, but oh my god, my experience was absolutely terrible and I have never been so annoyed with a purchase.   1. The atmosphere is actually the worst thing I have ever come across, especially for a restaurant attempting to be trendy. Silver garland that changes color should stay at my great-aunt's Christmas party, not a restaurant. Mismatched wood wall accents EVERYWHERE make the place look like the designer stopped at a lumber liquidation sale and bought everything, whether it went together or not. The seashell tiling is atrocious and doesn't fit the vibe at all, if one can even call the aesthetic of this place a vibe. And who thinks velvet seating with RHINESTONES is okay for any restaurant that caters to anyone older than 6? And super limited seating, but I didn't want to stay in the place long enough to deal with it.   2. The wait was ridiculous for having ordered one basic crepe with absolutely no line in front of me. I had to stay in the hell hole way too long for comfort.   3. Finally, the food. It was mediocre, if I'm trying to be nice. My real issue was the pricing of it, though. You'd think that for $7.50 you'd at least get two scoops of ice cream. There's a little scoop of ice cream on the top, but it wasn't proportionate to the amount of crepe I had to eat. The crepe was shaped like an ice cream cone, so once the small amount of ice cream was eaten, you were left with a  dry, plain crepe.   Needless to say, I will not be returning. Please replace with a better restaurant, because I love crepes and would love to eat them regularly, but not at this place."}
{"text":"A super chill place for drinks and desserts. They opened within the past year and this place is among my favorite spots on campus to chill. Their crepes are really tasty, and I like that they serve snacks like takoyaki (octopus balls) and Taiwanese sausage."}
{"text":"We came here for a low key day date. Enjoyed the takoyaki (rice flour covered squid) for a little snack, and then the matcha crepe. It was amazing and beautiful. I sure want to go back and try their other flavors."}
{"text":"This was a fun find just a short walk from the Union. I was delighted to try a hand rolled ice cream that had fresh berries in it. It tasted wonderful - so fresh! It was fun to learn than it came with three toppings too. Not too much, just enough to be a nice accent. The fun fabric couches could use a little cleaning from wear or use, but overall the shop is a nice experience with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter who attends the U of I and tried their berry crepe. Perfectly cooked and the custard they used inside the crepe was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a huge matcha fan so I was delighted to see matcha dessert options at this place. The matcha crepe and matcha rolled ice cream is very good. However, it is a bit pricey. After tax, one item can range from $6-8 which is enough to buy a meal. However, I think that it's still a nice place to go to once in a while to treat yourself. Overall, I really like the items that they have here and the location and decor is really nice. :)"}
{"text":"Cool to watch being made, almost like an art. Ice cream was pretty good. Great post-dinner place, ambience was nice. Good for couples or a small group."}
{"text":"The place is nice and the decor is cute. The crepe that I got was tasty. It was strawberry truffle and I added a scoop of ice cream . The only reaso I wouldn't go back is the price. What you see below was about 8$-9$! More than what I pay for a whole meal!  It is a nice place to try out once, but not as a regular place ( unless you are rich! :D)"}
{"text":"This place has amazing crepes and ice cream. Came to check it out when visiting from out of town and was not disappointed. I am so glad this place wasn't around when I was in college - otherwise I'd be much fatter and poorer."}
{"text":"This place has really good ice cream! They use real fruits and make it in front of you! They give you a lot too!  The atmosphere is really nice with a weird Japan/Hip vibe to it! It's super cute! They also have board/card games available to kill time and have a good time!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Haven't tried as many things yet, but I liked what I ate!!! Had the cheesecake crepe and the takoyaki. The crepe was SO GOOD. I felt the Takoyaki could be better, though. But I really enjoyed the crepe. The interior is SUPER cute but it seems really small to me. They also have drinks in cute lightbulb cups. Looking forward to next visit to try more of their menu!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes! We got 2 and didn't even make it back to the room which was literally a few steps away so had to go back for more to ensure everyone was happy! Definitely try it if you're around..."}
{"text":"The shape of ice cream was pretty and the Thai flavor was good. Selected blueberry as topping, and it was fresh and tastes great with the ice cream. However, I waited for 20 minutes to get this which was far longer than I expected."}
{"text":"I went for a soft opening and omg their crepes were so good.  I've had the mango-raspberry and mixed berry crepes as well as the avocado kani rice ball.  The rice ball isn't worth the price ($2.50) but the crepes are amazing.  They come out nice and crispy with a slight sweetness from the yogurt cream.  There are also crunchy chocolate rice balls at the bottom of the crepe to make up for the lack of crispiness there which is so nice!! I definitely recommend this place for their crepes. I've yet to eat the other things like the lightbulb drinks and ice cream, so I'll update once I try those."}
{"text":"This place is new and currently has soft opening but still the service was efficient. The staff is nice. During the soft opening time period, this restaurant is offering 20% off on all the menu items. I ordered Takoyaki and coffee addict Thai ice cream with toppings of marshmallow and macaron.  Takoyaki tasted good and the ice cream had a strong kick of coffee. If You love coffee, you will definitely like this flavor. Macaron was yum too. Overall, both the items tasted good. They also have board games and cards. So you can enjoy appetizers and games with your friends.  Next time I will surely try their crepes."}
