{"text":"The place has amazing noodle bowls! I had the house special and it was delicious. The staff was extremely friendly and let me know what was in every dish. They even have Boba tea! I had the high Thai tea and it was top notch.  My friend had the California poke bowl and it was really fresh. You can even pick your own ingredients for your bowl!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect but we headed here for some ramen and it did not disappoint. I had the house special and my husband had the miso. Good mix of veggies and delicious broth in both. They have a little something for everyone with a wide variety of appetizers and poke on the menu as well. The restaurant has a fast casual vibe which will be convenient for the lunch hour. I will be back to try a poke bowl soon!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today at Haiku Tokyo. OMG - loved it. Ordered the soup, and they were so able to accommodate my seafood, veggie only diet. Healthy, filling, energizing lunch."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. The staff is friendly and helpful.

The food quality is not commensurate with the price. While Haiku does give you more fish per serving than, say, Ahipoki, the quality of the toppings and fish leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight and everything was amazing! We tried the poke bowl and ramen bowl and they were both excellent! They also have a good selection of Bob's teas. The coco heart smoothie and mango tea  were really good. We will definitely be back to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Stopped on a whim while shopping & treated myself to a poke bowl and octopus salad ... this was a stroke of genius. Poke bowl came fully dressed and the octopus salad was tasty & just the right spicy at the same time. I'll be back to try their  ramen next"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on March 4. Ordered 2 kids meals, Custom poke bowl, and a Tonkotsu ramen. 

The good:
Ramen broth was delicious but noodles tasted like it was out of a package. 
Both kids loved their fried chicken and orange chicken
Service was good. 

The bad:
The poke bowl sucked. The tuna was so fishy that it was inedible. The squid topping was too hard and rubbery. Also inedible.  The shrimp was also fishy but was at least edible.  I would doubt the freshness of the fish and seafood. 

The boba drinks suck. We had the Thai tea and it was so sweet, even the kids wouldn't drink it. 

If you want good poke bowl, go elsewhere. If you want Ramen, go to Nishikawa."}
{"text":"The food is so good at here I have a poke bowl and high Thai tea is amazing  I will come back next time"}
{"text":"Over all it was a good meal, from a ramen connoisseur like my self though I have had more flavorful tonkotsu at other places how ever don't let that stop you from coming here. It had a nice clean atmosphere with plenty of drink options including soda, room temp water and iced water. Service was quick and on point easily will go back here again when in the area. Also ramen came with a little bit of everything in it for a reasonable price. Some places nickel and dime you by the time you get all the standard items (egg, corn etc) in a bowl you want the price has drastically increased however here it is not like that which is fantastic!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here to get some Boba and have some ramen.  The staff were friendly, the place was clean however we were deeply dissatisfied with the Boba.   It felt like all the Boba that we had ordered were filled with just ice and little juice.  We asked why it was made like that and the worker in the cashier said that the owner wanted it to be made like that.  We were amazed how she never offered to even make it better.  We have been to many Boba places and trust me, it was never made like that.  The ramen was average at its best, this will be probably the last time we go here."}
{"text":"I had never tried anything like this. But I order the Hawaiian poke with shrimp and scallops. Not bowing it was like a salad I had white rice and I mixed two dressings it was so very good. I will return there and eat again."}
{"text":"This place is clean and staff are friendly.  We ordered the orange chicken, Shoyu and Tonkatsu ramen.  All 3 dishes were very good.  Staff were attentive, checked on us twice.  We'll come back again."}
{"text":"These guys have been open a couple weeks and I was in the area so figured I'd give it a try. Wow, was I impressed. The Hawaiian pok√© bowl was fresh and tasty with loads of flavor. The Ramen was also full of flavor and tasted very authentic. The guys working there were friendly and answered all the questions I had with a smile. The dining room is newly remodeled and looks great. Definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Bomb ramen. Dank spring rolls. Boba tea on point (little on the sweet side but not overwhelming)."}
{"text":"The food was great, but what really matters when you go out to eat is the service. Amanda was extremely rude and short with my family. She rushed us when we were building our bowls and interrupted us when we were indecisive and when we didn't answer quick enough she kept repeating the options over and over. She seemed like she was the manager so unfortunately there was no one to complain to. I was shocked how rude she was to us. Not a great employee for your business."}
{"text":"Highly recommend to not order or try the boba. Flavors are bland and taste like they were pre made. Boba is tasteless and not well cooked. The size is ok and the wait isn't long. I have yet to try the food but my parents went here and tried it. My mom is vegetarian and the employee told her that one of the ramen bowls was
Vegetarian but the broth is meat based, so she had an adverse reaction. If you want a low-budget and quick Asian fast food place this might be something up your alley."}
{"text":"In Arizona it's not easy to find too many legit Ramen spots, but this place was not bad at all! Came here on a late cold night and it warmed me right up with their delicious ramen. The menu is small but huge in flavor! I ordered the pork belly, which is pretty standard for me at any new ramen spot to order and it was great. The meat was tasty and the broth was rich and flavorful. The staff did give my friend the wrong ramen bowl but quickly got her a new one, and in the new one forgot the egg but were again quick to help, so the staff here was great for us! If I'm at San Tan craving some Ramen this place will definitely be the move!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service and wait was crazy. Went with my family and ordered two poki bowls and a bowl of ramen. Poki came out after about 10 minutes which was a long time to mix up a bowl, considering it wasn't that busy. The ramen on the other hand took almost 30 minutes to get to the table. By the time it got to the table everyone else in the group was done and ready to go. I was about 30 seconds from getting a refund and just leaving. Ramen and bowls had good taste, but I would not return just based off the crazy wait times and lack of service. The guy at the counter was clueless when ordering."}
{"text":"I had Tonkotsu with Pork loin - just the right spicy.I honestly love the broth and the Japanese noodles with a flavor of sesame butter.If you love hot pork or beef broth you won't go wrong with this Tonkotsu. Price (around $10) is below average for Ramen compared to California. Mango Boba is perfectly sweet.This store looks like in chipotle style offering quick Poke bowl but I can also sit down and let the waiter serve my big bowl of Ramen."}
{"text":"WOW CALI POKE BOWL!!!! JUST GET IT!!! I cannot even come close in words to do justice to the explosion of goodness that happens in my mouth when I eat this!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place on my days off, I love the clean and casual atmosphere. 

For their ramen, the meat they use is lean but stewed so that it falls apart in your mouth (I'm not a fan of the fattier pork belly usually included at other ramen places). Sometimes the broth is too salty, but the noodles are good. 

I like their strawberry girl tea and Thai tea, cheaper and less sweet than Bubble Bee's which tastes like syrup to me. 

I also like their pepper tuna poke bowls, the price is reasonable, and they don't drown the bowls in sauce or serve the raw fish with hot rice, not to mention the workers are super friendly. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was leary of going to a strip mall ramen house, but my mom insisted that this place was legit. She tried the poke bowl and was hooked. It is located in between Barnes and Noble and Kona Grill. Ordering is similar to Pei Wei and they bring the food to your table. The prices are affordable ($10/person) and make for a great casual sit down meal. 

I had the House Special Ramen with beef, and it was the perfect cure for my Sunday hangover after eating and drinking at the PHX Night Market event the night before. I was really craving a hot bowl of noodles, and Haiku Tokyo did not disappoint. My noodles were perfect (can't stand soggy or undercooked noodles!) My egg was perfectly boiled, and the broth had a mild spice, just enough to give flavor, but not overpowering. Just a classic bowl of noodles done right. #comfortfood 

Sriracha at each table for those of you who want more kick. Complimentary drinking water and lemon water was awesome! Daughter got miso soup, the portion size was huge and we speculated that the kids Shoyu Ramen with a drink (they serve Boba! :D yah!!!) may have been a better choice for her. I was a pig and ate most of mine. Poke bowls are supa dupa fresh and mom devoured every single morsel. 

This place is super duper yummy, great service and is trendy Asian food that is sure to satisfy even the biggest appetite. Never thought San Tan in Gilbert would have a ramen house that blew me away, but here we are. Can't wait to go back next time I'm hungry from shopping my heart out."}
{"text":"The boba was a little flavorless the cashier, Amanda , was very nice and sweet the shoyu ramen was good it had a little American taste ( don't know how to explain)  but overall it was good but not my favorite"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent.  Food was subpar.  Boba was watered down, Ramen was the instant kind, my poki bowl was slimy tasting."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good ramen option in Gilbert. Daughter liked the shoyu and i had the tonkatsu. Both very happy.  Gyoza was great too.  And it was fast. Anxious to return."}
{"text":"Located in the San Tan Village Mall, they took the suite that Wok Box was in. I had the Miso Ramen with extra pork belly, squid salad, and High Thai tea. All in all the food was tasty, although nothing stood out as spectacular. Employees were nice, and the young lady busing the dining room was sweet. 

The ramen had a good, but not authentic flavor. Tasted a little \"packaged\" to me, compared to say, Nishikawa or Tampopo. ...but still, I like ramen and thought it was tasty. The pork belly was tender enough, but not as fatty as I personally like pork belly to be. 

The squid salad was simple. Cold sliced squid over mixed greens, and a few bamboo shoots with ginger and a vinegrette.  Ingredients were fresh. I would come back for this. 

The High Thai tea was just ok. Not as dessert like, as a boba shop, and the boba was a little too chewy. I probably wouldn't order it again. 

All in all, it was a good experience. I'll have to come back and try the Poke and some gyozas."}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped by while shopping and I was not disappointed! I got a Poke bowl which you can customize any way you like. It was delicious. They also serve ramen and boba. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I recommend Haiku Tokyo! Great service! Friendly staff. Excellent food with lots of choices!"}
{"text":"Lost and hungry we stopped here. The place is nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. I placed an order for miso and gyoza. Wow. Wasn't expecting such a high price for soup and dumplings. (16.00) English is not the main language here, which seemed like a good sign being the food was taking forever. Mind you there are only a few people in here. 3 tables are full. Communication wasn't difficult tho.... table next to us just got their food and we are STILL WAITING. Finally I asked for it to go. They separated the noodles from the soup so when I was able to combine it fell in like a big blob. The gyoza, typical Japanese frozen, nothing to write home about, HOWEVER, the Miso THE BEST! Once I was able to incorporate the noodles it was a small slice of heaven. Miso was fresh, egg just slightly above soft boiled and the pork fell apart on the soup. If it wasn't for the soup, we'd never return. A great find however next time I will remember to have more time to wait for the soup."}
{"text":"Good place for ramen out east side.
Service was fast and friendly. 
Price is reasonable .clean dining area too"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. I've been craving good ramen for a long time. I try to find the best ramen no matter where I am in the country. So I can say, I've tasted super good ramen, and just ok ramen. I am now elated to know I have an amazing ramen place within just a mile or two from home! 

 I tried the house special with the pork, and I was so happy with the tase. Perfect amount of kick! 

Found it on yelp last night and couldn't resist.  I was not disappointed! The location may not be fancy, but the ramen is top notch! I tried a bite of my fianc√©'s poke bowl, and that too was very delicious! Tuna was fresh, and the whole dish was phenomenal! 

I will most definitely be coming back many times!
Only complaint is I wish they had fountain drinks, but that's not a real big deal."}
{"text":"Ramen and poke both at the same restaurant!  How awesome is that! 
Poke is fresh and they have yellowtail for no extra cost!  Great variety of toppings and the sauces are not too salty.  I will definitely come back for the poke.
Ramen is good: tasty broth, noodles done just right.  Chasu is the probably the weakest link: it's good but not the big slice of pork belly I expected. However, they are probably the only ramen place in Gilbert so if I'm too lazy to drive to Tempe for the spectacular ramen, this is a very good alternative.
Extra points for very friendly staff and family owned biz."}
{"text":"Loved this place - was craving something healthy and filling and it hit the spot. Great customization - lots of options."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in Arizona. Everything is under $11 and large food portions.  10-11 for large ramen bowls.  Kids meal was under $6 and could feed an adult. Pleasantly surprised 6 spring rolls came with one order for an appetizer. Really good customer service. They all work as a team.  Definitely fresh noodles, not dried. You can taste the difference."}
{"text":"I had the special with beef. It's a fast food like restaurant. I thought the ramen was okay. I wouldn't come back though.."}
{"text":"Dumping heat ( too spicy) on pork based broth negates the flavor - not a good move. Yellow noodles that taste and texture of instant ramen didn't help. With noodles like that, not worth coming back to try."}
{"text":"The menu here is small which is nice for people like me that are indecisive. I've only had the ramen, since I'm not a huge poke fan. It's always been amazing and really high quality ramen. The service is also great. They have a really good team here."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly a delicious little place in San Tan mall. Friendly staff, fresh food and you get the opportunity to make your own plate.
Very unpretencious place that delivers a great experience and tasty, fresh food.
Its in my list to go back"}
{"text":"delicious food although the ramen has less serving compared to our staple fave Nishikawa. i deducted 2 stars because the boba drink has so much ice! you only get half as much of the drink.disappointed bec my kids were looking forward to their boba drinks.
i guess the only time we will come back for their ramen is if we are too lazy to drive to Nishikawa in Chandler."}
{"text":"The food was alight basic mall food, stood in the eatery for a while before I was helped. They probably just need more staff or better training."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place opened in Gilbert. The large poke bowl is much larger than the one at the poki bowl place up the street and I think it's the same price or a little cheaper. I also love their house ramen with pork. So good! They are also very friendly and the food comes out very quickly."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch after finding that another nearby sushi restaurant was closed for lunch. She suggested we come here for poke bowls, and I happily agreed. Otherwise, I would never have known they served them!

The best way to describe it is like chipotle for poke. You get to pick and choose what you want in your bowl and they make it in front of you. You get either 2 or 3 scoops of whatever protein you want, and then unlimited veggie toppings. They also have multiple sauces to choose from. This was my first time making a poke bowl, so I just sort of winged it. It was so freaking delicious. I love them so. 

The only downfall to this place is it is super confusing to first time customers. The menu isn't very clear and the line set up is a little odd. Also, they don't have fountain drinks which was pretty disappointing. Never the less, I will totally be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant and the food is authentic and delicious! Reasonably priced for what you get. I will continue to go there often."}
{"text":"Their ramen is incredible! So much flavor. I got the tonkotsu and my husband got the house special. Both have about the same amount of spice."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp poke bowl and it was delicious! There are many selections to choose from and several sauces."}
{"text":"Went in and had one of the prettiest and best looking poke bowls I've ever had. The man who made my bowl, Michael, was amazing and so beyond nice. Would come back just to have his service. The only strange thing is I went to ask the manager his name and he didn't know it. Had to go ask another employee. So 5 stars to Michael and the food!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! I had the tonkotsu noodles and it had perfectly cooked noodles and delicious broth! So glad a good ramen place opened up in San Tan."}
{"text":"The food was good but my 3-star review is based more on having to wait 30 minutes for my food to arrive. 

I ordered a Chicken Salad Poke Bowl and as much as I enjoyed it having to wait over a half-hour made the meal a little less tasty. I'll admit I get pretty \"hangry\" and today was probably the worst for me so part of my negative review is a bit more emotional than it should be and I can only hope that when I return that I won't have to wait nearly as long."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious ramen ! I'm extremely picky about the broth and the house ramen was excellent will definitely be stopping in again"}
{"text":"One of the BEST poke spots I've ever been to! The ingredients are so fresh, they totally load the bowls up and the prices are great. And the staff is super friendly! So happy they came to Santan, I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved this place. I had the tonkotsu ramen and he had the house special. Also tried the Thai tea with boba and orange chicken. Everything was amazing, however the boba wasn't as soft as other places but some people like it this way. The orange chicken isn't the average chain-restaurant style with tons of breading, it had less breading and more unique flavor. We actually ate everything, we were so stuffed. I would definitely recommend this place for some good Japanese food. Really wish we could come back and try the poke bowls!"}
{"text":"Love the poke here. It's all I come for. The boba tea selection isn't that wide. The rice menu was pretty basic, nothing stood out. I have yet to try the ramen because I only eat the poke, lol! There are many toppings here that other poke places don't offer, so that's a huge plus."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight and food was actually surprsingly good. I say surprisingly because we walked in and it felt like their system on how to take orders was a little unorganized so expected a little less on quality HOWEVER the staff was extremely attentive and I can tell they are all very hardworking people. What really bothered my husband and I was the man who was sitting by one of the tables when we walked in. I recognized him in one of the pictures when I was looking up this place and I knew he was either the owner or the manager and I should tell you all he absolutely did nothing to help out his crew when things started to get busy. He literally stood there and watched his staff as they worked. Nonetheless, I liked the food and would recommend it"}
{"text":"I tried Haiku Tokyo for the first time yesterday. I had a spicy tuna and shrimp poke bowl. It was quite good, but there was a bit too much sauce on it for my taste. I am by no means a poke expert; this was only my third time trying it. Next time, I'll ask for the sauce on the side. The High Thai iced tea with boba was good, but not very creamy. I am excited to go back and try the ramen!"}
{"text":"A nice bowl of ramen. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Will come back and try more menu."}
{"text":"Such a good place. Staff was very helpful in making my selection. I wasn't sure what sauce to get and they let me tasted 3. I ended up getting wasabi and sweet chili. In my large Poke bowl of tuna and shrimp, brown rice, all the veggies, it's so fresh and flavorful! Had no room for appetizers though we ordered Spring rolls and they came out fast. Outside seating is also great compared to the Chipotle next door. I love supporting a good local business like this. Definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"The ramen was just okay. It lacked presentation though. All the pictures they have posted are much nicer than what you actually receive. We got the shrimp as our protein and we're really disappointed. I would have been happier with o
Two or  three prawns instead of a bunch  of small shrimp. The kids meal fried chicken was tough and chewy, the quality wasn't great."}
{"text":"My family and I love their ramen! We also usually get the orange chicken. The shoyu is amazing and my daughters also love the ramen. Maybe someday soon I will be adventurous and try a poke bowl."}
{"text":"Love the Poke Bowl - Best in town by far and I've tried most of them - got hooked on Poke in California, took a while to find strong place locally - This is it. Enjoy"}
