{"text":"My boyfriend brought my family and I to this restaurant. I like the idea that the chef cooks in front of you and our chef was hilarious, which made the environment more welcoming. However, the food was still too simple for me. The shrimp was marinated pretty well and they give large amounts so many of you will surely feel full."}
{"text":"It was good very funny the cook would have been better to serve all the food together and not part by part ! Meaning he cooks the shrimps and gives it cooks chicken gives it cooks rice and gives it ! Man im hungry i wanna eat loool"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience chez Kobé. Nous y sommes allés pour le 60e de ma mère et c'est un endroit parfait pour un anniversaire. La nourriture est excellente, tant le porc, les crevettes, mais surtout le filet mignon! Les chefs sont plein d'humour et savent faire un show impressionnant. Pour les fêtés, 3 serveurs viennent à votre table et chantent \"Bonne Fête\" accompagnés d'un gong. Bref, du plaisir pour les yeux et les papilles!"}
{"text":"As a treat for my sister's 40th birthday, I wanted something special and that we never tried.  I read some of the bad reviews here (and on tripadvisor), but still chose here because they have free parking and a Sunday to Thursday menu which is about $10 less per person. (it helps a lot when paying for 5 people). I would have preferred Toyo downtown, but it would have cost way too much.  We arrived a bit too early when they opened and were the only ones there, the service took a while to get going. Once we got apps and drinks, things improved  The tempura and chicken wings were delicious, the spring rolls were good, but only 2 small rolls for $5.  Once we finished, we met our cook who was very polite and cordial but not as flashy as some of the cooks I saw on youtube.  Yes it's cheesy and tacky and it feels like the 70's inside. Real Japanese people probably don't eat like this, but we had fun, which is what matters. The food was pretty tasty and we were all full when we left.   You get soup, salad, the Teppanyaki of your choice with tea and dessert, and a nice little show for about $20.  They also gave us a couple of bamboo calendars. The service is pretty good, but they wait for a table to be full before sending a chef, so you might be dining with strangers. but it's the same at other Japanese steakhouses.  This place is a bit out of the way, but there is free parking and it's about a block from the Metro Langelier Subway Station."}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars because after reading the comments, I thought I would be disappointed. We actually got Groupon for it so that's why we went. The portion were extremely generous and the meat was fresh. The cook was funny and entertaining, we actually enjoyed the experience. I wouldn't necessarily go back but I didn't feel like I wasted my time and/or money."}

{"text":"Depuis le temps que je voulais essayer un teppanyaki à Montréal, j'ai du faire un choix entre 2 adresses et celui-ci me semblait plutôt attrayant.  Je réserve donc une table pour 4 un samedi soir, mais, quelle surprise en arrivant de devoir attendre plus de 10 mins devant le comptoir avant d'être placés! Pour mon anniversaire, je souhaite commander un bon saké, malheureusement sur les 3 affichés sur la carte, seul, celui que je trouve à la SAQ que je bois \"tous les jours\" disons, est disponible... Ensuite, le resto s'appelle \"Kobe\", je m'attends donc à mettre le paquet et me prendre du buf à l'huile de massage (blague à part) mais évidemment il n'y en a pas, néanmoins le filet mignon était succulent... Nous commandons tous (avec les 5 autres convives à la table, le côté traditionnel japonais des tables chauffantes), bref, nous attendons tous plus de 20 mins que le chef arrive pour nous faire son show. Et c'est parti! Beaucoup d'humour, ambiance bon enfant, le sourire, feu sur la plaque, tout le monde est servi, merci bonsoir, au suivant.  J'aime:  - L'attention aux allergies pour ceux qui le sont aux crevettes etc... - Le show, mais j'ai connu des cuistos japonais qui jonglaient avec leurs couteaux, c'était pas mal plus impressionnant!  J'aime pas:  - Le côté usine, clients à la chaîne, d'immenses salles et des chefs surbookés. - Les toilettes bouchées!!! Les 2 toilettes des filles non fonctionnels, c'est honteux! - La carte (vins et mets) beaucoup trop simple et restreinte. - Le gras, on aime le beurre, faut pas que ça colle, mais y'a des limites! - Le prix, trop cher pour ce que c'est.  Grosse déception :("}
{"text":"The service was good. The show was awesome as was the food. Nothing more can be said. The price is a little too much for everyday meals but that is why you reserve this place only for super special occasions.  I also loved the cocktails they served. Verypretty and tasty."}
{"text":"Tried out this restaurant because we had a Groupon and seems like everyone else did too. Located above a cheap hotel, this restaurant is more spacious than it looks, with several grilling tables that can seat about 8 or so people at once. We had a reservation for 7 and had to wait for another family to arrive before the chef could prepare all our food since it is cooked at the same time. Even after they arrived, it was a long wait. Avoid this place at all costs if you have allergies since everything is cooked on the same grill with the same utensils.   The concept is simple, you pick your choice of meats, either one, two or three choices which will be served with soup, salad, vegetables, rice and noodles plus ice cream for dessert. Oddly the noodles were spaghetti pasta mixed with bean sprouts, cooked in a teriyaki or soy sauce and sesame type seasoning.  Their sauce makes everything you order taste more or less the same, its sweet and easy to please but I have no clue if any of the food was representative of true Japanese teppanyaki. The chef used a lot of butter to make up for flavor.   As for the show experience, our chef started off with good enthusiasm and tried his best to crack jokes but everyone could tell it was the same lines he uses with everyone and it ended up feeling dated and tired. There was no fancy knife works, flip of utensils, or special food presentation such as the stacking of onion rings into a little volcano or cracking of eggs into the rice. Basically most things I expected from watching videos and TV were lacking. There was this moment where he did set the shrimp on fire when spraying it with oil and that was the most entertaining bit. It raised the rooms temperature by a lot, beware, this restaurant gets really hot especially with the low ceilings, and constant burning of the gas grills, all I smelt were fumes and ended up getting dizzy.   After almost 3 hours we finally left and felt disappointed that it ended up being more expensive than we thought. Even with the coupon we purchased, we felt it wasn't quite worth for the quality of food or entertainment. Other than the protein, things like rice and beans sprouts really cost pennies and that's what I got full from. If you're really curious and looking for something out of the ordinary, I still recommend the experience but I wasn't wowed."}
