{"text":"We had the Triple Delight Dry Pot. Delicious, spicy as you would expect from a place called Chili King, and very friendly service. Please come with an understanding most of the menu is authentic as can be and may not have much you recognize. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food was good enough but the delivery experience was a complete failure.  The order never arrived, they didn't answer the phone despite several calls, the VM was full so I couldn't leave a message, and when my husband finally went to the restaurant itself to pick up the food, no one spoke English well enough to address the problem, let alone refund the delivery fee and tip."}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time. Almost too authentic for Madison. Entrees feature many parts of animals not traditionally used in Americanized Chinese cooking. I'll leave it at that. Spicy Chicken with Chilis was interesting; small, dry-rubbed and deep fried pieces of chicken topped with scallions, garlic, and sliced red peppers. My companion ordered the Pork Fried Rice which did not have the color or consistency of any fried rice I had ever seen, complained that it was bland. Had to ask for soy sauce to add flavor to his rice - twice. Hot & Sour soup was good, but contained only tofu, no meat. They do not have a lunch menu. Portions are sufficient. Table smelled like urine after we first were seated which left me wondering what it had been wiped down with. We were two of three patrons who visited through the entire lunch hour. Not a great first impression of Madison for my out-of-town guest. Probably will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"This restaurant seems to have at least three names but whatever the name it serves excellent food.

It is currently the best Chinese restaurant in Madison. The food runs spicy -- hot but not
so hot as to overwhelm the various food flavors."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Szechuan style Chinese food!. Owners were very attentive to all the customers, helping anyone who needed help with ordering. The food tastes 100% authentic and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Legit!

If you are looking for authentic or Americanized Chinese food you are in for a real treat!!!  The food is the real deal & delicious.

We ordered two different eggplant dishes and both were so good, I can't decide which was better. We also ordered a custom dish that they made up to appease my picky wife- she loved it!  

Service is friendly and fast. Sometimes hard to understand with thick accents but take your time and you are sure to enjoy your meal. 

Also a great place for takeout!!!"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, excellent service , fresh but quickly cooked food. It has a very pleasurable spice: enough to be noticeable , but not overpowering. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch yesterday and it was yummy! Ordered the spicy sautéed pork and it had some really great chili flavor with tons of freshly cooked jalapeños! Really nice people working there too!"}
{"text":"Restaurant seemed to be in the process of changing name to mandarin kitchen/stone fish.  Chef Cooked in China for twenty years before coming to US.  Traditional Chinese was excellent.  Had hot pot with fish and was delicious.  More food than we could believe.  Pea pod shoot tasty.  Great service.  Some of the best Chinese food we have had anywhere."}
{"text":"I thought I was just going to another Chinese restaurant in the 600 block of Park St. and BOY WAS I WRONG!!!

Ok so here is the skinny so far.... Chili King has taken the place of Angkor Wat and while the overall atmosphere didn't get much of an upgrade I was extremely impressed with the quality and authenticity of the food! I am hopeful that the atmosphere will improve as the staff become better acclimated to their new surroundings and maybe they find a way to pipe in some music or something.

I can only judge by what I know and the Vegetarian Sauteed Triple Delight in Spicy Sauce was YUMMY! The bean curd, bean sprout, and Chinese cabbage were spot on and I am not sure what the sauce is made out of but it had more depth of flavor most dishes I have tried in the past. I asked for mine \"extra spicy\" and got about 10-15 extra chopped up Serano peppers which really turned up the heat :) The sauce was the perfect amount, the food came out quick and piping hot.

My other half ordered the Tofu w/Country Style Sauce - this dish is much milder and was perfect for her as she definitely is not a fan of the spice. I thought the portions of both dishes were spot on and her came with mushrooms, snow peas, bell peppers, and carrots. I felt this dish was also very authentic tasting and not overly \"Americanized!\" 

Now they do have two sides to the menu - on is more \"American\" style food and the other is the side we chose to order from. They have a very large selection of choices and I do not think anyone will go away hungry - (though keep in mind they are a newly opened restaurant and as such didn't have all the menu choices just yet ie. they didn't have egg rolls available just yet)

As we were walking up and past the other two Chinese restaurants on the block we were a bit skeptical about how this one would fair (especially after the last place to try this locale) but we left pleasantly surprised and happily full!"}
{"text":"When a yelp rating is so far off the mark of my experience I think it's only fair to post my own.  At the time that I write this Chili King is 4 stars with 25 ratings.  Unbelievable, because this is the first time in my life that I have taken 2 bites of a dish and pushed the plate away.  The texture of the chicken was like chewing hard rubber and there was absolutely no way to eat it.  It was more bone than chicken anyway.  My plate was also dirty with some visibly sticky mess still on what should have been a clean plate.  Plus they serve hot tea in a tall water glass.  Otherwise this is a pretty average Chinese restaurant.  The service, location and decor was ok, but when the food isn't even edible, why bother."}
{"text":"This was such a surprise. I went here with a friend today and we were the only people in the restaurant plus the one lady who greeted us. She was very nice ! I'm vegetarian so I usually get a tofu order of the orange chicken at any restaurant. It wasn't on the menu but I asked her if they could do it and she said yes. It was so good!! Probably one of the best plates of orange tofu I've had in years. 

I highly recommend giving this place a try- I'm definitely going to be back."}
{"text":"Loved Big Bowl of Cauliflowers ????, Sautéed Triple Delight in Spicy Sauce ?????, and a chicken dish (????)."}
{"text":"If you don't speak/understand Chinese, this is NOT a restaurant for you. Period. We should have taken the advice of earlier reviewers who reiterated this issue. Seems like new management has huge problem with clients speaking English language.

The menu has English as well as Chinese descriptions. We ordered by pointing exactly at menu  with English & corresponding Chinese dish, and reconfirmed. Still, the server made multiple mistakes during ordering. Even equipped with her Google translator, the server kept on fumbling...For example: The vegetarian dish contained pork/beef pieces even thought the party ordered from \"Vegetarian section\" with just Tofu. While serving, the waiter mixed the dishes (the server had no idea what the dish is, so just put random dishes at random places for us to figure out). The food itself was very oily. Some dishes showed good quantity, but later realized that those were padded up by bunch of chewy/dried red-peppers. Looks like they want to be true with their name : \"Chili King\". The Lunch menu runs from $10.99 all the way to around $29.99. At that price, any other Chinese takeaway can beat this on quality/quantity and especially on service.

And surprisingly after all this multiple goof-ups, the server expected (huge) tip! We include the tip in CC payment, still the lady asked cash. (Yes, waiter can speak \"cash/money\" in English!)."}
{"text":"I arrived here at 4:00 on a Wednesday and, as expected, was not met with any crowd. I was quickly seated and handed a menu that listed tons of dishes. I opted for the Mongolian Chicken dish with a side of fried rice. As I waited for my dish, my waitress kept my water filled and I could hear a chef in the back singing - I thought that was kind of funny. The dish combined moist flavorful chicken bites with sautéed onions, scallions, and small chilis. With the fried rice this dish was a good portion and satisfied my hunger. While I won't be racing back anytime soon, I would like to come back to try one of their duck dishes or some other stir fry. Aside from the food, the atmosphere is warm and the place seemed well kept."}
{"text":"Horrible service, unless you're Chinese. We waited 10 minutes to get seated even though there were plenty of open tables. Then we waited 15 minutes to even get menus, water, and place settings. Then we waited 15 minutes before someone took our order. Then we waited 45 minutes to get our food. All the while, we watched tables of people who arrived way after us get service and food way before us. Pro tip: knowing Chinese and knowing the waitstaff can get you faster service. Hm. First time and last time. *And we were Asian too. Just not the right kind apparently."}
{"text":"The service was good, we came during lunch ordered 5 dishes total. Mostly authentic dishes, we all loved it! The portion seemed not too much, but tasty! We were happy to come here to try out their food!"}
{"text":"Employees were very kind.

Seseme and orange chicken weren't real chicken meat. Just gooey soft mushy stuff. Kind of gross.  The rice and broccoli were good but the chicken ruined the whole meal. For the price was a waste. Chins Asia Fresh or Happy Wok for me."}
{"text":"The place to go if you are craving authentic Sichuan food. And of course, if you love the numb, tingling feeling on the top of your tongue from the Sichuan chili or at least can handle it. The Sichuan cuisine heavily based on its famous chili so don't be surprised if you see Sichuan chili in all your dishes. If you cannot handle super spicy like me, the restaurant do offer choice of mild or hot. 

I came in on a Friday night and the restaurant was fairly empty. The service was very fast and the menu is very diverse. We had family style pork belly which was very good and well flavored. But my favorite was the eggplant casserole. It was just amazing from the flavor to the texture. This dish is something I couldn't cook at home because it requires very high power industrial oven. However though, eggplant soaks up a lot of oil so the downside is that it is not so much a healthy veggie dish. The beef noodle was a bit disappointing compared to the other two authentic dishes. The broth was not as flavorful as I expected and definitely did not have the umami taste. 

I would come back here to explore more dishes on the menu, especially sharing a whole fish when I go in larger group."}
{"text":"We've been to Chili King twice now, once for dine-in and once for delivery. The first time, for dine-in, we took my parents, who are native Chinese and hard to please. They love Hunan-style food and were not disappointed by the fare. The second time, we ordered delivery, which was a few minutes late but proactive in calling us to let us know they were on their way. 

Both times the food has been amply-portioned, flavorful, and adequately spiced. The dishes are not as oily as other Chinese food places around town. The Hong Sue Eggplant Casserole and House Special Sauteed Fish are menu standouts. 

The staff is very friendly and goes out of their way to make you feel at home in the restaurant. They seem knowledgeable and genuinely interested in providing attentive service and authentic food."}
{"text":"I ordered the cumin beef on a suggestion from who I assume is one of the owners. I don't think I've ever seen cumin beef on a Chinese menu before. The more I thought about it, the less I was sure I was tasting the same kind of cumin I know from Mexican and Mediterranean cooking though. Maybe they use a different variety? The dish seemed a bit salty and very well-spiced. I would've liked more veggies, it was maybe a third veggie. It also has a lot of cut up chili peppers, which made me wonder just how spicy it was going to be. Well, no need to worry unless you have Midwestern spice tolerance. I actually ended up eating all the chili straight and had absolutely no problems (no sweating or anything). The portion is large, so I'd recommend coming here with friends and splitting a few dishes, there was more food than I needed for lunch. 

I also got the milk tea, which is solid but not special yet -  I wouldn't come here just for it, but I liked adding it on to a meal. The pearls were overboiled and too soft. It's possible they weren't as fresh since I came around 1:45, after the main lunch crowd. It's only available on weekends as it's homemade. I asked the owner how they made it as my attempts come out very differently. He explained that he uses high quality black tea and half and half with just a little brown sugar, \"to be healthy.\" He was very interested in hearing my thoughts about the tea (I'd like to taste the tea flavor more), so I'm looking forward to going back for some more food and see how the milk tea is the second time."}
{"text":"VERY good! The menu has a very large variety of both authentic and Americanized Chinese food. The servers seemed polite and kind. Pretty good sized portions, for the American Style part of the menu, at least. Had the orange chicken, sesame chicken, and crab rangoons--great flavor, seemed very fresh and \"real,\" loved it all around! Would like to come back!"}
{"text":"It's so refreshing to have a Hunan eatery amid an over crowded Sichuan/buns/dumplings/noodles market! 

I've been to Chili King twice and both experiences have been solid. Their menu obviously promotes authenticity, but there is a small panel devoted to the western palate. In general, I think their vegetarian dishes outshine their meat dishes, which is an accomplishment on its own, considering that vegetarian dishes are more exposed by its simplicity. 

I've tried a variety of items including ribs, pork-belly, winter melon, watercress, intestines, and other simple stir-fries. If you love some legit spicy food but aren't crazy about strong ethnic spices prominent in Sichuan cuisines, you'll love their stuff. 

Most importantly, their service is warm and inviting. Although unrefined and lacking in formality, they project a sense of sincere familiarity that characterizes Chinese hospitality, reminiscent of a hole-in-the-wall, (in the most loving sense possible) family-run, side-of-the-street restaurant in China. 

Is their food off the charts delicious? No. I think I can do a better braised pork-belly at home. But it is a fair representation of legit Chinese home-cooked meal. And to the Chinese people in Madison, this place will feel like home."}
{"text":"Spent Chinese New Year here and it did not disappoint. They have great service and the food also of high quality. Definitely one of the most underrated Chinese restaurant in Madison area. We really enjoyed their salted egg fish, sauteed eggplant,  and fish fillet. We will come bak more often. Thanks again for the  great hospitality!"}
{"text":"This is real Chinese food, including dry pots. But there is a variation of Ma Po Tofu that is super yummy. A lot of times you'll find a so-so dish prep that is pretty much a sin on those poor little tofubies. But here, they do not sacrifice themselves in vain. Bathed in a truly spicy sauce with wonderful flavor, the dish shines. Nom."}
{"text":"This place is legit. When I need my more traditional Chinese food fix, I come here. I love the sweet and sour fish dish, eggplant dishes, string bean dishes, clay pot dishes. All has such great flavors. Even their American Chinese food is good like the chicken and broccoli and fried rice. I've been here like 4 times now and all have been great experiences."}
{"text":"The spicy fried beef was like Philly meat, and didn't really have a good flavor. Too much cumin, I think. Plus, hardly any vegetables, except for a TON of Thai chili's which were un-chewable. My boyfriend's fried rice was meh at best, a long with the miso soup. For the price, we expected more. Don't think we'll be ordering again. Other places taste better for cheaper."}
{"text":"The best Chinese places in Madison and it's so hidden. They specialize in Szechuan and Hunan cuisines, so be prepared for some spice in most dishes. They have the basic American versions (chop suey, fried rice) but I definitely recommend things like dried pot, hot pot, and whole fried fish."}
{"text":"The host is very nice. The dishes taste very good, not too salty not too oily compared to other Chinese restaurants. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time, and enjoyed it. The food is tasty, home - style Chinese food, different than what some of the other establishments in town are serving, and the ambience is simple and comfortable. The service is a little nervous and hover-y, but that will get better.  Our server, when asked, offered some recommendations.. We liked the dish she suggested, a country style tofu with vegetables. A bowl of spicy chili soybeans was provided as a free snack to get things started, and a plate of sliced watermelon was offered for dessert on the house. We'll be back."}
{"text":"There are some places that just have service that is above and beyond what is expected, and Chili King is one those that will make you feel like royalty. 

Located at a place that has previously been other restaurants, we had not initially realized there was a new place here aside from the interesting new white paint spelling out Chili King on the corner top of the building. Walking inside, the interior decorations is slightly different but not dramatically from what used to be there. 

We came by Labor Day, and while it was not our first choice, we weren't planning to eat in. So even though the hostess seated us and cleared off the desk, we expressed that we just wanted to do take out. Hostess calmly and politely shuffled us to another table near the cashier, and bought us a cup of water. 

After we ordered and paid, we waited patiently for our order, which didn't take too long granted we took some time deciding what to order. Although, there was a slight language barrier. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience and to our surprise, there was two free bottles of water in our take out order.

There is a mixed of authentic Asian cuisine with plenty of options of American Chinese foods to please anyone and hopefully everyone. I'd love to come back and dine in next time for the full experience."}
{"text":"This is a compromise rating, 4 stars for the food but 1 star for service. 

If you speak Chinese this is a place for you. If you don't it will be hard to get answers to your questions. My wife was here once before and had a tofu dish with mushrooms that she loved. But the waitress on this day had difficulty understanding a question about what came in a dish other than tofu. My wife was frustrated and didn't order anything. She's vegetarian, and it's not useful when the waitress can't explain whether there is or isn't meat.

Instead we split my dish. I ordered the vegetarian triple delight, and it was as it should have been with the vegetables bright and crisp-tender. 

My wife said if the restaurant wants to cater to an Asian clientele it's their choice. I agree, but the signs and menu were in both Chinese and English, which invites non-Asians. I was in a Salvadoran restaurant in Detroit once where the clientele was clearly defined by the Spanish-only menu and Spanish-only staff."}
{"text":"I had recently read an article about Chili King so I decided to check it out. I had egg rolls and chicken with Szechuan sauce. Everything was delicious!  The waitress was great even though she spoke little English. Be patient and help her learn by pointing to your choice. She was wonderful!"}
