{"text":"100 times better than previous ownership. My wife and I both got sandwiches and beer on a Saturday night and were very impressed."}
{"text":"Fish tacos, great beer selection, nice whiskeys, excellent service, fun fellow patrons.  I had a blast!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Friday Night Fish.  We had a beer at the bar first - nice selection, although they were out of the Pilsner.  You have many local beers to choose from.  You can also get a Bud and Bud Light if you feel the need.  It was a gorgeous June night so we opted for a seat outside on the deck.  We ordered the baked Walleye and fried Perch.  The choice of potato were fries, sweet potato fries or a green salad.  I tried to make the meal a little healthier so I chose the green salad.  It came with a light vinaigrette dressing. It was quite good.  I also stole some sweet potato fries from my guest.  Next time choose the sweet potato fries.  The Cole slaw came topped with blue cheese - different but a nice change.  The perch was the best I have had in a long time.  My wife's Walleye was also very good.  The view from the deck was nice, we stayed for a long time talking and enjoying our beers. This place is worth the trip.  The price is a little more than most bars but worth it."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few nights for the fish fry and have tried all the different types.  All are very good and price is reasonable.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The apps were decent, but our first server was so rude when I asked to see a wine/cocktail list. The second server was much more pleasant. The wine was sour... It had clearly been open and sitting out for too long, but I didn't say anything bc the bartender was initially so grouchy."}
{"text":"My wife, and in-laws wanted a place to enjoy a nice Sunday afternoon. We were hungry and found ourselves watching the Badgers Basketball at the Tap Room. We were told the food is fantastic. 

We ordered the Pulled Pork, Portabella Mushroom Burger, Cuban Sandwich, Walleye Breakfast. Everything was FANTASTIC. I never expected such delicious food from a little clubhouse on a golf course. 

They also had plenty of beers on top, New Glarus, Capital, Lake Louie, Ale Alysum and many more. The waitress told us that they offer a fish fry on Wednesday and Friday nights. 

If I had to highlight one thing about this place, it's the fish. 

Go here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am pretty sad that this place is closing. I have just recently been back and the food is amazing. I had the Southwestern Avocado salad (no avocado) with grilled chicken. They do a blackened cajun seasoning that makes your nose run and your mouth water. It was so good. It was a nice balance to the otherwise simple salad. It came with a chipotle ranch which did not have much flavor but was a nice cream option to the chicken. 

The service is great. The place is comfortable. Unfortunately, the doors are closing."}
{"text":"We are new in town and live in the neighborhood so went for lunch. The atmosphere was a typical sports bar-type place with large TVs. It is bright and open. The food was just OK. I had a glass of Chardonnay and the cheese quesadillas, as did the table next to me. It seemed it took a long time to get the food and then when it came my quesadilla was burned on one side. The neighboring table's was not. I wondered why the kitchen would let the burned quesadilla go out when clearly it was over cooked. When asked how our meal was I told the server that mine was \"well done\" but edible. He looked at the plate, walked away and returned with another glass of Chardonnay, saying it would help wash the burned quesadilla down. So, not the best experience, but the service was good and they did offer the free glass of wine to make up for the burned food. Since we live in the neighborhood we will most likely try this place again."}
{"text":"Been there twice so far with a group of four, and everyone has been very happy with the food, atmosphere, and service.  The truffle fries are awesome, and the housemade corned beef for the reuben was top notch.   We just moved to the westside, there isn't much other than the big box places near Westfield mall, and this is going to be our 'go to' place when guests are in town and want a quick yummy lunch or dinner.    Hope we get to try the Friday Fish Fry Soon!"}
{"text":"12 taps; great apps; great selection of bourbon. Going to eat there again today. The pork loaded french fries are great. I also tried a special fish taco dish that was really good as well. It's not that crowded on Saturdays when we have gone for lunch and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I used to come here and then avoided the place due to poor service. Recently I decided to give it a try again and Wow!  The Portobello mushroom burger, I'm obsessed with it!  The backend walleye is superb, and the fish fry is outstanding!   I consider these menu items to be the BEST IN MADISON!  And yes,  the service is very good.   Forget the sweet potato fries,  get the regular fries, they are fabulous."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine and to have drinks in town. I'm a beer geek and the tap selection more than meets my needs. The people that work here always bring a smile. The food? Yum yum. Try the steak sandwich. That sandwich has some kind of magic going on. Clam chowder on Friday nights is some of the best in town. These guys own the Free House in Middleton which is also in our top 5 places to dine in town. If you love great beer and food you gotta visit."}
{"text":"Chose this location close to home to celebrate a parents' birthday.  Was pretty excited about it after reading a few Yelp reviews that the new owners had really improved the place...I wasn't that impressed...

I really enjoyed the decor/ambiance and the many beers they had on tap.  I think it would be a great place to meet up for an after work drink or to watch an afternoon Badger basketball game.

It was not a great place however, for dinner.  We started with chicken nachos for an appetizer.  They took way to long to arrive and when they came, they were cold!  So cold that much of the cheese had not melted!!!

The rest of the meal was fine but the the service continued to be pretty slow.  I would say the tortilla chicken soup was the highlight of the meal.  All in all a little disapointing..."}
{"text":"Nice view, good food. Just don't call in an order after looking at the website, it's out of date and apparently the order takers don't realize some things aren't an option anymore."}
