{"text":"I'm happy to have found great Mediterranean food! Had the mixed plate so I was able to try the beef and chicken, both delicious. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"After traveling to 40 different states, and eating in countless Turkish, Greek, Mid Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants, only one place had the best baklava in the US. And none came even close. It was Med Fresh Grill. Baklava was just amazing. To die for. Crispy on the top moist and sweet at the bottom with generous portions of pistachio in the middle.  Even only for the baklava they deserve to be the best.   The Kebabs are excellent as well, get the mixed kebab plate. Amazing garlic sauce, amazing meat.  I just loved this place, and wished to live in Phoenix just to eat baklava anytime I want from Med Fresh Grill."}
{"text":"Med fresh owners and cooks smoke in the back of the kitchen. Ummm...illegal much. Whatever happened to health inspectors?"}
{"text":"I had a nice lunch there this week. The Lady who took my order seamed extra pleasant. The food was good/ok. I will try again to see if there are any items that are really good. I had heard that the humus? is very good. Maybe I will increase my rating if it is a standout."}
{"text":"Food is really really good. They make an effort to source good ingredients and make in house sauces/dressings.   I have eaten here over 100 times. My favorite dish here is their grilled fish. Its the best grilled fish I have had in America. Their kebabs are on par with the best I have eaten on my travels.  I do have one gripe though. Their food prepared at lunch is not on par with what they make for dinner. They seem to have the more experienced family chefs cooking in the evening. I usually go for dinner.   I am also glad to see that they are expanding their beer selection. Thank you !"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and made to order at Med Fresh. The portion sizes are huge which they should be since the prices are a little high. But they pile it on I like the Mixed Grill which includes chicken and some other meat, humus, pita bread, small salad, and rice. This plate usually lasts me for 2 meals but today I was exceptionally hungry and I ate it all gone. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Amazing falafal ----best falafal I have ever tried & I have had alot! I ordered the Veg Platter & it was all very good. The dolmas were delish & I generally don't like those. The hummus was pretty good (but I like mine the best). The baba was good but needed a tad more salt. The tabouleh was also excellent. All and all a great meal & I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"this place kind of sucks.    taste super cheap and bland. but they try to make it look nice.   way too pricey . and the what i assume is the owner is pretty unfriendly ..    go to munchies two blocks down the street ..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We go on occasion for lunch at work and I always get the same thing: The Chicken Doner Plate. The chicken is noms, their hummus is as good as any I've ever had, the garlic paste they give you is delicious (but lethal--don't eat it if you have a meeting later), and their rice is just killer. Only complaint is that it's a little pricey for lunch (which is why we don't go all that often) but it's worth it if you're craving some really good Turkish chow."}
{"text":"Working in the area I have been eating here at least once a week since it opened. The food is always great and the staff is very friendly. I have tried several of their dishes, but keep returning for the chicken wrap - simply amazing. It's by far my favorite spot for Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"SUPERB food and atmosphere. Excellent service, every one is incredibly kind and welcoming. Went with a friend who lived in Turkey and says its the most authentic place in town. A favorite."}
{"text":"Really think this place brings for their cost, speed, quality and location.  Their food is very good and reasonably priced and always cooked fresh upon your order.  The kitchen is extremely clean and makes you feel good about what you are eating.  The chicken is fantastic as is the falafel, salads and hummus.  The fries leave a little to be desired but you really shouldn't be ordering those at a place like this.  This is not a place that you would bring a date to or be looking for a night out.  If you are looking for quality food at slightly higher than Subway prices than this is the place for you.  Also if you haven't had this type of food before this is a great intro to it and unless it is very busy the staff will offer you a sample."}
{"text":"If your looking for some good Mediterranean food I would go here.  They give you a bang for your buck, a chicken kabob platter comes with salad, hummus, and 4 pieces of pita that is amazingly delicious.   I will definitely come back for a meal to go.  I would even suggest ordering before you go because it takes a bit of time to cook so you know.   Recommendation: To anyone on mill not going to the bars and is hungry and in the mood for some pretty damn good hummus."}
{"text":"Two words - Grilled fish and Baklava. I am always willing to make the long drive for these two. Located at the heart of Mill Ave, a dinner on the patio with good friends and amazing food. Thats what i mean when i say bliss."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to tell yelpers about this place...But silly me, the yelpers seem to have known about this long before me! You guys are so in the know!  Well I'm happy to see that everyone loves this place as much as me! I discovered this place when I used to work on Mill ave. Let me tell you it only took one hesitant lunch before I was craving it every night!  First off...they deliver! For a fat kid on the go, This is always a plus! To find a place that delivers that is neither Chinese or pizza is pretty freakin cool!  Second...The owners are super nice! They always great you with a smile and work hard to make sure that you are satisfied with your order. It is a little hard to understand them, but it just means the food is authentic. At least I think so!  And the most important...The food is really good! I love their vegetarian plate and the desert is wonderful! I would choose this place over big fat Greek any day of the week! really beyond good.  The only bad that dropped it from a 5 to a 4 star...location, location, location. Mill is such a pain in the butt to drive on. and the parking is no better. But I will always brave the crowds of students and snow birds to eat there any day!"}
{"text":"We went for a family lunch and were hoping for decent Mediterranean food.  What we got was more than decent, it was excellent food.  Although we got there a little after noon the place was not crowded (It is game day at ASU so most people were getting ready to tailgate).    The hostess was friendly and let us choose our table.  She gave us menus and took our drink order while we looked it over.  There are not 4+ pages of choices; just a couple pages with the classic meals you would expect from a Mediterranean restaurant.    I ordered the Falafel as an appetizer.  They were served on a plate with hummus, some sauce, a little side salad and a small plate of warm pita.  The flavor was amazing.  They were not over cooked nor full of oil. I liked them so much I ordered another serving to take home.  I cannot remember the last time that happened.  For my meal I had the lamb kabob.  The others had the chicken kabob and beef kabob.  All of them came on a bed of rice with more fresh humus, another small side salad and a roasted jalapeno pepper garnish.  The meats were all seasoned and cooked just right.  We all enjoyed our meals and none of us had anything to say but how good it tasted.  My daughter got their balaclava for dessert.  The layers were crispy and she made quick work of it.  She didn't leave a trace on the plate and said it was a good way to end a very enjoyable meal.  By the time we left they had filled up quite a bit.  The aromatic smells from the meals were beginning to drift into the dining room.  The prices were quite reasonable for the size and quality of the food.  We are adding this restaurant to our list of places to definitely return to when eating in Tempe.  If you like Mediterranean food then you should give MedFresh a try."}
{"text":"I used Med Fresh Turkish Grill for a large catering event and Eddie the owner made it all come together with great freshness and wonderful flavors.  All the staff was fantastic. I would recommend Med Fresh Turkish Grill to everyone who loves great flavored food."}
{"text":"Really good Mediterranean food. Home made dolmas and hummus. Greek salad was good. My six year-old scarfed down the kids chicken grill. Nice sidewalk patio allows Mill Ave people watching. Cold beer and soccer games on the tv. Will be back."}
{"text":"Food took forever and when we received the food we  were  really disappointed. My wife order mix grill plate ( Adana and chicken) Adana was so dry and awful looking, and rice was cold. I had iskender doner. It was just ok but it wasn't a real Turkish doner ( I can tell because I'm Turkish) I think it was frozen Greek gyro. Anyway we weren't happy with the food and it took forever. There was a few more negative things but I'm not gonna say anymore. I wouldn't go back to that place."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  The food is plentiful and always fresh.  I always walk away stuffed with leftovers.  The decor inside is very nice.  The staff is friendly and provides quick service.  Love Med Fresh!"}
{"text":"If you look at Med Fresh Grill from the outside, you might ask yourself: What is this place?  And right you should: there's outdoor seating, there's \"grill\" in the name, and behind the fast food style counter, there's bottles of liquor, it's all very confusing.  Med Fresh Grill is a low profile restaurant with high-end turkish food.  Their falafels are moist, and scrumptious.  Their portions are generous, you will NOT leave hungry.  Do not pass this place up.  It is a hidden gem of Tempe."}
{"text":"First time I went it was really good, but the second time it wasn't and customer service was really bad and they overcharged us.....what's up with that?"}
{"text":"This is arguably the best Mediterranean/MiddleEastern/Turkish restaurant within miles. The food is full of flavor, especially the kebab plates. It is family owned (I think two families own it) and they seem to care a lot about the quality of the food.  Service is a bit slow at times, especially during busy (lunch) hours, so be prepared to wait a little---your patience will be rewarded.  When out-of-town family and friends visit, this one of the places where I treat them to dinner.  The prices may be a bit higher than expected ($10 for a salad) but I think its because of the attention to quality of ingredients.  I wish they would add a dish-of-the-week or seasonal dishes from Turkish cuisine (non-grill items). Their menu does little justice to all that Turkish cuisine has to offer outside the grill."}
{"text":"I had never had Turkish food before we went to Med Fresh. It was really good. We have been back twice since! I really love the salad and they have great falafels and hummus. The lentil soup is also super good. Yum!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick healthy fix before my flight! Food was VERY FRESH AND TASTY! Would go back in a heartbeat! Barak, our host was gracious and helpful with suggestions! Chicken kebab dinner with salad and rice was  perfect!"}
{"text":"Med Fresh Grill is, in my opinion, the best Mediterranean food in the metro Phoenix area. The beef and chicken kabobs are excellent and the hummus is outstanding. The people are really  nice and the service is great. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Some of the best you can get in Phoenix.  Great falaffel & schwarma.  Very consistent.  Always good."}
{"text":"This is one place that never disappoints. Food is always fresh and delicious. Don't always get the chance to eat here but when I'm in the area a must! Love the dolmas...my favorite. Love that they allow me to order the kids plate for me so I can get the dolmas too!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, since it is run by one of the guys from Efes.  But I couldn't even finish my meal.  First of all, the meat is pre-cooked and microwaved to order. So if you enjoy chewing on tasteless meat for 10 minutes per bite, then you may enjoy this. The price is not cheap enough to forgo proper (and simple) cooking techniques.  The hummus was, however, tasty. Although very familiar. I believe they may have bought it from Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli on 16th street.  The salad that came with my meal was uninspired and I also found what I believe to be a fingernail fragment in it. I don't know. But it was unexpected as it crunched in my mouth.  This place has some potential, but they really need to provide better ingredients and especially better preparation. As is, it's embarrassing to be called Turkish/Middle Eastern food. It's really the McDonald's of the genre.  Also, please. The Mexican hot sauce does not belong in your restaurant, and especially not slathered on your pita bread."}
{"text":"I was just passing through town to get something to eat and I came upon this restaurant. The service is great. Ali and Salda run the whole show and are warm people. The food is delicious and plentiful. I had the mixed grille and found everything to be really tasty. Compliments to the chef and staff. For a college town, this cuisine adds great diversity to the spread of choices. Thanks very much! Good choices and prices for a substantial meal."}
{"text":"My Neighbor is Arabic and I am Mexican. By suggestion my neighbor invited me to try Med Fresh Grill. I have never had any Turkish/Arabic food before, so I said okay. I was very pleasantly surprised. First of all, it is my belief that if the staff is speaking the native language of the restaurant you're in. Good sign. Ha ha. I loved my experience there. The place was very clean and quaint. The food was presented in a colorful manner and it was simply delicious. The Adana and Grilled Chicken was tender and flavorful. The salad was crisp and tasty. The rice was a welcome and tasty surprise. Dunking the pita bread into the hummus (garlic spread) with the meat was sooooo good. I really like it. Plain and simple. I will eat there again."}
{"text":"Fresh food, clean place, good prices, highly recommend.  I always get the gyro and love that the meat isn't greasy!"}
{"text":"Eat first before you go!!!! Ok food, but kid portions, spent $90 for a family of four and left hungry! Added insult is 18% mandatory tip for parties of 4 or more( I thought the IRS changed the rule about that). So in short, first and last time!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great food amazing service! The staff treated my sister and I like family. Discovering this hidden gem on Mill made our night! Had amazing hookah, food and people. If your out on Mill check it out!"}
{"text":"Favorite Mediterranean restaurant with great service. Some of the best hummus and falafel in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is one of the few gyro places who actually cooks meat fresh. Most of the cheap places will heat frozen cooked gyros which is gross. MedFresh is not cheap because food is great and location is premium, but food here is so good..Their plate combination are also very creative and yummy..In winter try lentil soup.."}
{"text":"I gotta say this place is great and WELL worth the money. When in town I frequent this place for lunch on a regular basis. No microwaving for sure! EVERYTHING I have ever eaten there has been made fresh in front of my eyes!!!! Even the soup is heated to order on the stove in a pan!!!! NO microwave! The greek salad is huge and though the dressing is different its good.... This has a definate turkish flair and is awesome and priced right. The hummus and Baba is great. I love the beef donner wrap and load it up with the chili sauce!!! The GF loves the kabobs and Dad usually gets the LARGE and I mean large salad with chicken kabobs.... You cant go wrong"}
{"text":"Best turkish food in Arizona that I have tries yet. I get the chicken plate and love it with the yellow rice. The owner is incredibly welcoming and love that they are always playing soccer matches on tv. They also have excellent baklava for dessert. Authentic turkish food. Highly recommend if you are looking to leave a place with a full belly and satisfied."}
{"text":"Easily the best food in Tempe!  The customer service is top notch,  your treated like family here. I've had just about everything on the menu and it would be hard to pick the best, but try the Adana kebab!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there recently. We are both from the Mediterranean and absolutely love food. I had the lamb kabob and I loved it. The meat was juicy and tender, perfectly seasoned. Their rice is everything but blend. First bite into it and all the spices hit you at once, definitely worth it. I was a little disappointed in the baba ganoush dish as I expected it to be more like the aydari. My husband totally loved the shawarma, chicken combo and the garlic spread. Though a little bit on the pricey side, it's worth trying it."}
{"text":"everything was perfect, very friendly. We ordered the big plate serving 4 people include of 4 screws of 3 different kebobs. That was really fresh and delicious. If you r a fan of meditrainian, this place is located right in the middle of Tempe, downtown and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Great food.  However I am severely lactose intolerant, so every time I come here I ask for the falafel plate with no dressing. Over half the time they put the dressing on the food.The first time I decided to just go with it, and I learned that if I eat the dressing I will be completely empty within an hour. I wish I could trust eating here."}
{"text":"The food is all so fresh and flavorful! The service is wonderful as well- so friendly and attentive. A great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I looked them up on Yelp! and ordered a take out order based on their website menu.  When I arrived to pick it up both items that I ordered were 2 + dollars more than their own menu.  When I mentioned it to the cashier she was not at all apologetic and did not offer any concession on the price.  No one behind the counter seemed to care that they had just shafted their customer.  They cared even less when I told them that I would most likely NOT be back.  The food was good, although I can get good Mediterranean several other places around town.  My prediction is that there may be a restaurant available on Mill Ave if this is any indication of how much they care about their customers."}
{"text":"The presentation of this small restaurant isn't much.  The tables and chairs are uncomfortable and are more indicative of a fast food joint.  That's about all that's mediocre about this place though.  The sandwich combo I got was tasty.  I got a Turkish tea that was a unique, pleasant experience.  They have free refills!  I finished my meal and people watched on the patio as I enjoyed my Turkish tea.  It reminded me of drinking Pilsners in Prague last summer.  I'd give this place of try if you live in the area and have never been.  I wouldn't go out of my way just for the food if you're out of town, however."}
{"text":"My husband and I are hard core Turkish dining fans - my hubby is from Turkey.  We were so excited when we found Med Fresh a few years ago!   The best dish is not even advertised on their menu board - Iskendar.  Crispy pita bread topped with beef doner meat.  A tomato sauce is poured over the top and topped with garlic butter. Dollops of yogurt sauce completes this dish.  It is out of this world!!!!  We have had this in Turkey on  a few trips and I prefer the Med Fresh version.     The chicken kabobs are lemony and moist.  The plate comes with rice pilaf, yummy salad, hummus, pickle and pita bread.  I usually split it with my daughter because it is so big.  The chicken doner is a nice treat either on a bed of rice or as a pita wrap.  Salads are generous in size and we love the dressing.  The ingredients are fresh and healthy.  The restaurant is always clean and the owners are very nice and welcoming.  Prices are reasonable especially for the amount of food you get.    A real treat is the homeade baklava.  It is flaky, buttery and made the authentic way - with sugar and not with honey.  The chai (tea) is delightful.    We have eaten here every few weeks have never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"We lived in Europe for six years and I have been searching for an authentic Döner in Arizona for three years. Today we found it at Med Fresh Grill!!! We will regularly be back!!!"}
{"text":"I do like their food but sometimes it's only ok.  We orderded our food and it's honestly kind of a mediocre portion.  We sat outside and i believe the owner was smoking even though there was a no smoking sign.  It was pretty obnoxious.  He then went inside and brought our food out...gross.  It's next to my work and it's something different to eat."}
{"text":"I just visited this place one time and was a great experience, food was great , staff were great, very good place for Turkish experience, thumbs up"}
{"text":"Ok, I created an account specifically to reply to some of these idiots who post on here. First of all, no one microwaves the meat at Med Fresh. They cook it right in front of you. Second of all, I am a chef specializing in a fusion of Mediterranean and other cuisines, and they do it right here.   The food is very authentic. I don't know where \"Paul R.\" went, but the salad is excellent there. Comprising of only romaine lettuce, fresh tomato, red onion and their excellent dressing, it is as simple as a salad needs to be without missing out on ingredients (and taste). What crunched in his mouth was probably the fresh produce on the salad.   There is no Mexican hot sauce on the pita bread, it is a roasted red pepper puree of some sort, and is completely native to the flavors popular in Turkey. Clearly, the previous reviewer Paul either is completely void of any knowledge of food critique, or he is incapable of enjoying a good meal. Whichever of these is true, however, is irrelevant because it is clear that he has no real insight on the great food to be offered at Med Fresh.  The garlic/horseradish spread is excellent. I personally love the Chicken Kebabs and the rice there as well. I like to take a pita half, spread the garlic spread on it, put some rice and red onion on and top it off with chicken, roll it up and eat it like a mini chicken gyro! This flavor combination is unmatched by many local mediterranean restaurants.   Don't be scared by some of these reviews, take it from me and I promise that you will not be disappointed. I have been to Med Fresh approximately 10 times and I have never once had a bad experience. Oh and if you're in a hurry, I wouldn't necessarily recommend Med Fresh. It does take some time to get your food, but again, no one is claiming that it's fast food.   Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Too expensive. Considering the price of the food the portions are small. I got a chicken kabab plate and there was barely a tablespoon of hummus. The dolmas were good but the quality of the rest of the food we ordered wasn't very good. Haji Baba on Apache or the Greek Pita at Tempe Marketplace are better options."}
{"text":"My wife and I have tried so called Mediterranean food all over the valley and nowhere have we found anything to compare to Med Fresh. The ingredients are always fresh and cooked to perfection . While we are open to try anything we always come back to Med Fresh. My favorite us the Mixed Grill but Everything us wonderful."}
{"text":"Many gluten free options!  Have been here several times and have enjoyed each time.  Would have to agree with some of the other reviews that the gyro's are not the item to order.  The french fries are very good though.  The mixed grill is a great way to go.  You get 3 different meats, hummus, pita bread, a small salad, and rice.  Yes it sounds like a lot, but actually the portions are a bit small.  All items were very good and worth a repeat.  The restaurant can be very noisy at times making it hard to have a conversation with the person you came with, but they also have outside seating when the weather permits.    Will definitely return and recommend to friends.  Love the open kitchen!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a strange mix.  It seems like a take out place, and yet they have pretty nice seating.  It's like they're trying to make it an eat in place, but can't quite get the atmosphere right.  Anyway, the people are very nice and enthusiastic.  They make great food that they obviously take very seriously.  If you've never had Mediterranean food before, this is a good place to pop your cherry."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Love the gyros. Awesome location on mill Ave.  Always clean and friendly.  Baklava is divine."}
{"text":"Tried this place today at the suggestion of a friend and I am so glad that she did!  I had the chicken gyro plate and was very impressed.  The amount of food is quite plentiful; seasoned and sliced chicken gyro meat atop a bed of saffron rice, small side salad, pita wedges, garlic sauce, hummus and their own brand of hot sauce.  Chicken was grilled and sliced perfectly thin.  Garlic sauce packs a punch.  This platter and a large drink came to about $13, but they do have smaller portion options as well.    I've eaten at a number of Mediterranean places in the area, some have come, gone and/or fallen off my list of places that I care to patronize.  Now that I've discovered MedFresh, I don't miss them at all.  Additional details -- It is in a great location on Mill, within easy walking distance of offices, parking and even light-rail.  The interior is very comfortable and spacious.  The proprietors at the counter are very friendly and happy to have you in their establishment.  Oh, and they serve Coke products!  ++"}
{"text":"The reason for why to go to MedFresh is for the gyro wrap for $3 on Wednesday!  I've been here a couple of times before and have gotten other things, however the deal I mentioned is a steal. You can either pick the regular gyro meat or chicken gyro which comes wrapped with garlic sauce, tomato, lettuce, pickles; it's served with a side of tzatziki. It's definitely very garlicky, so if you're not a huge fan, make sure to ask for little or no garlic sauce.  Otherwise, I think that some of the other options are a bit overpriced for the quantity. Keep in mind that this is a very popular lunch spot, and they don't provide the quickest of service so give yourself a bit of time to go grab lunch!"}
{"text":"The lady behind the counter was very friendly and welcoming. The food came in appropriate portions for the cost. The food tasted amazing! This was our first time eater my Turkish food and we loved it!"}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner here before our Gammage play and we really enjoyed it!  The restaurant was empty of customers when we arrived which made us hesitate for a second....but the owner came out and greeted us like old friends so we went for it, and are so glad we did.     We started with the hummus and it was very good...I personally like mine without the heavy Tahini influence, but my teens loved it.  It was creamy, fresh and the two accent olives were all mine!   The pita was warm, too.     We each decided to get a different entrée so we could share a few bites of each....so we had the mixed grill (the chicken was wonderful, juicy and spiced just right, probably our favorite off all the meats we tried that night), the gyro doner (i.e. dinner) and the lamb.   Note:  The mixed grill description on their website says it is chicken, beef and and Adana, when in fact the in-restaurant menu leaves off the beef....a bit disappointed in that.      They were all delicious and fresh, though like I said above, my daughter's chicken was the highlight.   My lamb was soft and cooked to perfection, but I was a bit disappointed in the very tiny pieces after looking at their menu photos.  I'd say they were about 1/2 that size (the photo shows the pieces laid side by side from edge to edge of the plate...reality they were tiny little bite size pieces that had plenty of space in between, no need to cut as they were already tiny bite sized)....and for the price ($17.95)  it was just too little meat.   But it was delicious as was the rice.  Each dinner came with another serving of hummus which was nice.  The salad was rather plain...iceberg lettuce some good tomatoes and a drizzle of a nice spicy dressing.  Tasty, but I was expecting a little feta and olives.    Dessert:  the baklava was flaky and soft (something hard to find around here as most baklava is dry and crunchy)....and loaded with pistachio and honey.   I'm drawing a blank suddenly on the name of the other dessert, but it's flan-like, but has a rather strong coffee taste to it.     This was a very nice dinner, delicious and the staff was very attentive.  I certainly hope that they have more business at lunch, because we were nearly done with our meal before another customer came in.   I imagine that the commercial My Big Fat Greek Restaurant less than 1/2 block away grabs people's attention more than this small but wonderful place does.  Having eaten several times at MBFGR, I 150% prefer MedFresh Grill.     As we walked back to Gammage for our play we glanced into many other restaurants......considering that it was a little after 6pm, it was a bit surprising how empty most of the restaurants were.....the bars were hopping though.....but this is a college town, I just expected more diners before the theatre, but I guess they ate at home, lol.   Sad, because places like MedFresh Grill definitely make a great start to an evening at the theatre."}
{"text":"In my first experience with Med Fresh Grill, I found the food to be average. It was the service I received that makes this ranking so low. Horrible."}
{"text":"Pros: Adana kebob is tasty.  Other kebobs and gyros are supposedly good but haven't tried yet.   Cons: Too pricy for such little portions! Rice is bland.  Hummus is good but you only get @ 2 spoonfuls.  Mint salad is just cucumbers, tomatoes, barely any mint or other flavors.  Fast food feel to the restaurant based on ambience (or lack thereof) and cheap plastic plates.   In short, it's the kind of place that is probably best at 2 a.m. after college kids are kicked outta the bars and need something substantial to soak up the alcohol they've consumed. So their quality may work for their location on Mill. Other than that, not worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have gone there several times with a colleague from Turkey and he vouches for it being genuine. The food is great and the service fast."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken kabobs are my favorite. Every day they make fresh baklava and other desserts. The side salad is tossed in a homemade garlic lemon dressing served with cucumbers and tomatoes. Healthy and yummy. Family owned. Owners are originally from Turkey so the food is very authentic. I have visited Turkey several times and actually prefer the Inskender here to the ones I had in Turkey. As someone else mentioned - this is not on the menu but really worth ordering. Takes time to prepare because there are lots of steps to the dish. Toasted pita bread, then doner, then tomato sauce, then yogurt and finally garlic butter poured over the top. OMG. So good.   Hummus, veggie options, falafels, fruit smoothies, etc.  Lentil soup is made from scratch and hits the spot.   Everything is made fresh to order. Love that there is a locally owned healthy eatery near ASU!"}
{"text":"I  loveeee the food here! I recommend the chicken wrap. If i could rate JUST the food I would give Med Fresh 5 stars. If you're lookin' for some yummy food at a decent price and don't care so much about the appearance i would say Med Fresh is for you.   As you may have noticed I tend to rate bathrooms....If a business has a cruddy bathroom it can really bring the rating down a star or two... I don't know about you, but when you use a dirty bathroom in an okay restaurant, it makes you wonder what their Kitchen looks like.  As for Med Fresh....they share bathrooms with other nearby businesses. I wasn't a fan. You had to borrow a key that is on a wooden rod form the front. I was grossed out by the idea of other people holding onto that key after using the restroom. yuck"}
{"text":"There are plenty of places on Mill Ave. to get Mediterranean food, and this small restaurant is one I frequent regularly.    I mostly get my food to go because the atmosphere isn't all that inviting, and as others have stated, the chairs are uncomfortable.  Their hummus and rice are both excellent, and I'm a big fan of their doner kebab meal.  Munchie's has a tastier Gyro combo, but Med Fresh grill has tastier meals.  The rice and the side salad really add to the fullness factor, as I always feel like I've eaten too much."}
{"text":"Med Fresh is delish... Always get the Chicken Kabob .  Our visit last friday was very enjoyable!  The food is cooked fresh and the service is superb.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, the hummus was very creamy.  The salad and dressing was so fresh.  Every flavor on the plate complements each other and to top it off the garlic paste is to die for!  My son had the Beef Gyro and loved it!  All in all this place is great!"}
{"text":"Waited thirty minutes for a vegetarian platter. The woman behind the counter looked annoyed when I asked if my food was ready yet. Even worse there was no one else except another couple in the restaurant. They were just slow. No thank you are sorry for the wait, would not return Food was mediocre lousy salad, kind of pricey for what you get. Will not return, there are much better Middle Eastern food so much much better than this place in Tempe"}
{"text":"Made an impromptu decision to check out a new place close to the university.  Food is excellent. the place is clean and nice. try the chicken gyro ... wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Had the chicken kabob. Meat is delicious. Hummus and salad are delicious but the portions are extremely small. You might get two forkfuls out of the hummus.   Tons of rice though. Since it's cheap, presumably.  I'll try it again in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Just picked up an order from here, the beef kebab and the beef gyro plate. $26.00 for skimpy portions, and no pita bread. Needless to say I live too far away to go back. Very disappointed. Food is nothing above average either."}
{"text":"Huge thumbs up to this place, i don't understand how 2 of the reviews are so bad? how does one person say the meat is microwaved when its actually cooked infront of you either on the barbaque if its kebob, ect..or on the Big skewer for Shawerma?   The owners are from Istanbul, Turkey and i have been there myself, their food is very authentic and has a great taste. Turkish food is very similar to Arabic, mid-eastern food and its full of spices and taste, ect...  Their red special secret sauce is incredible and i have not had it before!   I suggest you try this place!  Also i don't get how the owners are not friendly *although i have heard this before from someone* they are usually very nice to me, i think sometimes if you go at night when only 2 people are working and they are very busy they are a bit tense!  Try this place you will love it, order the Beef Shawerma!!!"}
{"text":"Wow... so great! Good portions. Awesome flavors. They got it right here!"}
{"text":"Good choice for Mediterranean cuisine... My daughter and ex-wife are vegetarian and there are many choices for vegetarian fare. The lentil soup is excellent"}
{"text":"Great gyros, especially the chicken gyro! I love their tzatziki too. Food is always up quick and the service is good. Their greek side salads are also very tasty."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has $$ - there are plenty of under $10 options that will fill you up.  I got their lamb kebab and lentil soup.  Lamb kebab - super tender and tasty. Lentil Soup - it was good, it was a bit of a thick consistency, not clear.  While still good - I guess I'm looking for somebody else to make me Wally's Cafe lentil soup  in Oakland, CA.  Anybody else know what I'm talking about and have a rec?  Friendly family staff. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent place for dining , Excellent for lunch as well , simple healthy menu , everything is made fresh to order, this is my new favorite place"}
{"text":"I only had the chicken pita and it was  good.  Not great but better than most of the food on mill.  I would recommend it for a casual or quick bite."}
{"text":"This place is wonderfull!! I eat there at least once a week...the food is flavorfull and delightfull...I have spread the word about med fresh and my friends agree its wonderfull! They never use a microwave and prepare everything in fron of you.  This place isn't fast food so don't compare it to Mcdonalds, it gets the job done and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Liked it lots. I had the mixed grill, that had marinated grilled chicken, grilled steak tips, and a ground meat strip with spices. The accompaniments were a yummy salad with some yogurt dressing, lovely creamy hummus, and a small dollop of creamy roast garlic. They had grilled the pita and used the inside of it to slightly \"soak \" up the juices from the meats. It was just enough to moisten it, then it was sliced in about 8 pieces. It was fresh, light, perfectly herbed. Just the right thing at night time. Not really busy like other places"}
{"text":"The food here is great! The staff is always polite too, which is nice on Mill.   Within the past year or so they have changed it to a 'sit down, and we come take your order'  style restaurant... I wish they would go back to walking up to the counter style though. The new way seems kind of stuffy for a restaurant on Mill."}
{"text":"Attentive service, fresh grilled food, relaxed environment. Easily becomes your go to comfort food. Fresh baklava is a must have after the meal."}
{"text":"The service and the food is truly amazing people need to open up to new foods this is the place to do it"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot and the food was fantastic.  This place used to be underrated and then all of a sudden it became really popular.  Ever since that happened, the food started to be lower quality and just not taste very good.  I give it 2 stars because it used to be good, but really it should only get 1 now."}
{"text":"I am Turkish and Med Fresh Grill does not do a good job to represent Turkish food. Their doner (gyro) is not good at all. Their Adana kebap was ok when they started their business but now it is disaster to eat. It was only choice to eat some Turkish food in Valley. Luckily, now, there is a new Turkish restaurant (called as Turkish kitchen on Warner Ave -between Arizona and Alma School Rd in Chandler) opened last week. If you try their food, you can definitely understand how Turkish food should taste. I hope with this  new Turkish restaurant, Med Fresh Grill can reconsider their menu again to find the true essence of Turkish food."}
{"text":"best Mediterranean restaurant in the East Valley. Tasty Kabob is great too. There is absolutely no need to ever go to Pita Jungle, ever."}
{"text":"Bad salad, old lettuce taste horrible . sandwich size smaller than regular size. Bad customer service"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places on mill. We need to support more local businesses. Although the prices have gone up a bit it's still worth a visit."}
{"text":"Everything I consumed was pure deliciousness.  I will probably have occasional day naps where I dream about my meal. We got the small beef kabob,  gyro combo, and hummus platter. I tried all of it and every item was great (even the rice).  The beef kabob also had a little spice too itn the perfect kick.  I will definitely be back. Yum yum in my tum tum!"}
{"text":"I love going to this place! Their food is always great. Service is good as well. Hookah is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Charged my card 45.00$ more than my bill... Make sure you check your statement if you are going to use a credit card. The food was just enough to make you feel you ate something. Does not fill you up at all and it's not all that great. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Decided to have lunch here today.  Ordered the special \"chicken gyro\" with rice and side salad.  I requested no rice and the woman asked if I wanted extra salad so that was fine with me.  When I finally got my plate of food after about 20 minutes and one table ahead of me, it looked like a \"salad\" with chicken on it and what appeared to be Fry's store bought pita bread on the side.  I know different places present food differently, but this did not look like any gyro plate I have ever had!  In any case, I was hungry and decided to take what I got...  The serving of what appeared to be tzatziki  came in a puny plastic condiment cup that was not even half full.  Plus it appeared to be mayonnaise based instead of yogurt based and was extremely bland.  As far as the food goes, like the tzatziki, bland.  I frequent Haji Baba quite a bit and the MedFresh Grill does not compare.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Servers we extremely warm, friendly, and accommodating. Clearly passionate about the food and care about their customers. We arrived at noon on a Saturday but we only one of two guests there, although the place did start filling up throughout our meal. The food arrived very promptly. One server even gave us a little sampler plate of something we didn't order. We got the mix platter (~$13), which had beef, chicken, and adaba skewers, and the and the beef gyro plate (~$10). Everything was really tasty but I particularly loved the beef. It was soft and the flavors were amazing. They also came with an average side salad, hummus, and pita bread. The best part, however, was the freshly baked baklava and Turkish coffee that we had for dessert. Omg, amazing. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tried this cute little place while on Mill Ave with my boyfriend. Pretty good food, and the people are wonderful! Very personable. Didn't get to try the dessert, but the fresh pineapple juice is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the food at this place. We frequently get their chicken or beef shishkebab plate for dinner. Food is consistently good. Sometimes the customer service isn't as good as I would like, but I'm willing to tolerate it for the good food."}
{"text":"The food was pretty bad. Enough for me to sign up and write my first review on Yelp.  I was in town for business and wanted some middle-eastern food. Checked Yelp and this place had a good rating.  Inside looked nice and I saw what I wanted which was the Adana (ground beef) kabob. The picture looked tasty. With a drink the total was $15, yes $15!  Got my food and it looked nothing like the picture. Small portion of dry overcooked flavorless beef with a bed of awful Spanish rice and a salad with a little bit of honey Dijon dressing. Hardly authentic or flavorful especially for 15 bucks. I suggest you look elsewhere in town for good kabobs because the food was just plain bad."}
{"text":"I am over this place. There are much much better places to eat in town like Haji Baba which KILLS this place in value and flavor. This is probably not one of the best with the amount of middle eastern food available in Tempe. In-fact its not even close to being the best.  I will not go again. I use to think I like this place but I find the owner (lady) less than fun to deal with and the food has become less flavorful and portions less. Put a full scoop of freakin Hummus and Baba! Not a scoop then take most of it out with the swipe of a spoon creating a crater to the styro plate. Talk about jipping the customer especially since their food is WAY OVERPRICED!! Just not that good. The reason for their high prices and skimpy portions? Because they are never busy!!! They rather jip you and charge more instead of making it a value and quality of food worth bothering to come in for. I will hit my favorite place on Apache instead. Way way better food. Done with this joint, screw this place."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch, dinner that's another story.  I have been here multiple times, I feel their entree plates are better than their gyros wraps and sandwiches.  For dinner, this place is a lot more low key and not as many people frequent it.  Overall, I think is great, service could be a little better but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Real good. Ordered delivery on a Friday night. The banana smoothie was ridiculously good, and I'm not that keen on bananas. Veggie combo is best as a two person app."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for lunch during a bike ride to Tempe. It's a small place, not much ambience and looks more like a fast food food joint.  I ordered the gyros platter, so mediocre!!!! Meat was decent but the hummus and rice had no flavor. Also on the plate was considered a \"side salad\" but it's just few pieces of romaine one tomato slice and one cucumber..again no flavor. The pita they give was definitely store bought low quality.  My wife had chicken kabob plate and the chicken was good but she too had the same sides I did and we didn't touch much of it.  Prices are fair but I can't recommend this place..it's not bad but not good either...it's just there."}
{"text":"ASK FOR/CHECK YOUR RECEIPT!!! The waitress (who forgot to submit my to-go order until I got there) decided that she deserved a 15% tip without asking or providing service? I took it to who i guess was the manager, asking what this 15% \"service charge\" was, and she looked annoyed and asked me sarcastically if I wanted my dollar back... I told her to put it in the tip jar, she said she already was going to get the tip... Wow. I actually have used Yelp for a long time, but never felt compelled to write a review until today.. I proceeded to wait 15 MINUTES for a takeout I had called in 25 minutes ago, and they said it would take 10 or less.. Unbelievable, HORRIBLE service. The place was COMPLETELY empty too, there was two parties outside smoking hooka, no food and 15 minute wait? Not to mention the chicken pita mysteriously looked like beef when I got home. George's up the road on rural and mckelleps (across Ttown bridge) is 1000X better, and the same price without a deal or a 15% unwarranted tip."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start but if you want to be treated like shit then this is the right place for you. It is extremely pricey compared to other Mediterranean restaurants and it is not an authentic Turkish restaurant as they claim.   There is a cashier lady (an old Turkish lady) in the restaurant that is an extreme lair person and rude. If she is handling the cashier counter, be aware! She might rip you off.  Amazingly, even if you give her a tip, she will give you negative attitude and make you feel that you should be thankful that she is talking to you! As for the food, the only dishes I like are the french fries and the grilled chicken. Other dishes such as, beef kababs, hummus, the Shawarma sandwiches, and the soup were poor and hard to digest.  The only positive thing about this restaurant is their cook. He is very polite and welcoming person, but the old lady who is managing the restaurant is ruining it up. You might get lucky and get treated appropriately on your first visit, but rest assure you will see the negative treatment on your next visit.   Overall, it is not worth it. Save your money and dignity.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"There are many Med options out there, and like one person has noted, there are a handful on Mill that cater this type of food. Unfortunately for the others, this one is the best. Aligning the walls of this establishment are awards for their outstanding service and food. The owner is Turkish and has developed an amazing array of handmade dishes he undoubtedly learned to love in his native country.  I appreciate so many different things about this place. The gyros are great and the food feels fresh, not processed or stale. The salads are good, as is the humus. Being a smaller business, they make their dishes in house, and the processed foods are swept away, making this a quality and enjoyable meal. It might taste different to you, and that's because it is.   There are many fine Greek restaurants out in the valley that push out amazing dishes, this is not a \"fine dining\" establishment like others, filled with waiters and high priced side dishes. What Med-Fresh does is  push out amazing food at a good price, and the locals have steadily fell in love with it. I was worried with the economic downturn that this start up might not last, but ASU students and locals have embraced it.. Also, notice all the ethnic and minority groups that frequent this place. Its a very good sign of whether or not its a true-blue restaurant, or non-traditional. I always notice many foreign students sitting and enjoying the food, which assures me that considering where they are at for the time being, this is their best and favorite spot.  Try their Gyros first unless you are a big Med food geek, which in that case you can expand further of course. Start small, then go from there. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Good food is good and the service matches it. Friendly and attentive wait staff. Food was fresh and the staff seemed very open to customizing it a bit. Came here for dinner and would certainly go back.   My only slight disappointment is their pita bread but not a big deal at all."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food, obviously, for the taste, and also for how guilt-free I feel when eating it because of how healthy and protein-packed it is for a vegetarian like me.  I went to MedFresh Turkish Grill on Mill Avenue, a place I like for its awesomely filling Vegetarian Combo ($8.95). The large plate came with pita bread, hummus, baba ghanouj, tabouleh, dolmas and a Greek salad with homemade Greek dressing I would gladly replace my favorite ranch with any day.  Go there for the food, not the atmosphere, since it's a fast casual, order-at-the-counter type place. It's great for people-watching along Mill, though."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now.  I can't say that I have seen problems with service either time I was here.  The atmosphere in here is nice enough.  The workers were all smiles, and moved very quickly to get the orders out.  It was busy, but I was still able to find a seat and eat my lunch.  The problem that I had was with the food itself.  It wasn't bad, it was just... bland?  I ordered the Gyro plate, and it wasnt as good as I had hoped.  I have been to other Mediterranean restaurants, and the food seemed to have more flavor to it.  The pita was fine - but the Gyro meat was not very seasoned, and the rice was rather plain.  Maybe I will go back in a few weeks and give it another shot, just to see if things were off when I went these last few times.  It would be good to have tasty gyros near where I work."}
{"text":"I am happy that I saw this place on Yelp!!!!   I was traveling for work and looking for an easy and healthy place to grab dinner.   This place totally hit the spot!!! The food was super fresh, well spiced, perfectly cooked and the service super friendly!   I don't come to Phoenix, AZ too often, but if I come back anytime soon I will be sure come to this place again."}
{"text":"This is a smallish owner-run place on Mill Ave. in Tempe. We were warmly greeted when we walked in--there were very few other customers, although I have no idea why because everything was delicious and freshly made. I had the chicken kebob plate, which came with a side salad and various dipping sauces. All tasty and well made. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good place near the college in Tempe.  Prices are decent and the food is pretty good.  I ordered the Mixed Grill to share with a friend.  It fed both of us with enough to take home.  Although we weren't very hungry to begin with."}
{"text":"Food was very well cooked but service was far from good. We were just a party of three and the server charged automatically the tip to my card: when we asked he said he was doing that because most of their foreign customers don't tip so he had to teach them. He was being very rude and felt offended when I told him the tip amount was up to the client to decide."}
{"text":"Looooove this place! Went here for the first time a few days ago and ordered the lamb kabob pita - addicting. The wait was a little long, which was annoying because I was starving, but when I had that first bite... oh my! Worth every minute of a wait. The tsaziki sauce is served as a side so the sandwich isn't messy. The lamb is cooked exactly the way lamb should be cooked - not too chewy, not burnt, not raw - seasoned, soft and delicious.  My co-worker ordered the Iskandar plate, which she raved about as well. It's located on Mill Avenue but it's tricky to find - you have to park and then walk into a small plaza, then make your way to the back until you see it tucked in the left-hand corner. Go here and enjoy real Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb!  I have eaten here several times and have never had a bad experience!  My co-worker suggested My Big Fat Greek, and I drove right past it to get to Med Fresh.  The portions are very generous, and most importantly the food is DE-LISH!  For the price, you get a lot of amazing food.  The chicken kebob is my favorite, and it comes with saffron rice, hummus, salad, tahini and pita bread.  The staff/owners are incredibly nice and will happily chat with you about the food if you ask them questions.  I would say it's not quite a \"hole in the wall\" but definitely not a chain-gang restaurant.  GIVE THEM A TRY -- You will earn your membership into the \"Clean Plate Club\" for sure!"}
{"text":"Updating to 5 stars. I've been coming here now for a few years, it's become my default place in the Phoenix Metro for good, inexpensive food. Everything consistently good.  They served a new type of rice a few months ago, but last time I was there it was back to the old yellow rice ... not sure if they gave up on it. I preferred the new rice ... 'Turkish' style, they told me - white rice with small fried noodles broken up into it, if I recall correctly. Regardless - all good!   It's a shame that Mill Ave is mainly focused on bars and 'cheap food'; this place would do well in a more refined environment."}
{"text":"I often have a self debate on which cuisine I would chose if I could only have one for the rest of my life.  It's an epic battle between Middle Eastern and Mexican, but a coaled fired pizza is a close contender.  So, when I was downtown I was stoked to see some Turkish cuisine.  I went for the chicken kabab, which is one of their specialties.  It was served with Basmati Rice sans my beloved vermicelli, hummus, salad and pita.  There were two skewers of tender, juicy, nicely marinated breast meat.  If it came with some toum, I would have been on cloud 9.  Another specialty is the doner, the Turkish version of a gyro, where they slice the meat off the spicket in front of you.    I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"SPECTACULAR! They catered an event at my place of employment and it was a hit! It was a true pleasure coordinating with Eddie and Selda on making our event as authentic as possible as our CEO is Turkish. We ordered mainly appetizers ( Baba Gunnuj, Dolma, Falafel, Hummus and Baklava). Everything was divine! The food was perfectly seasoned and the delicious aroma filled the room. I would use them event for any catering event. I'm excited to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Came here with our Wild Dining meet up group and we were glad we came. We started off our dinner with the hummus appetizer. The hummus was very good - creamy, with just the right amount of paprika and olive oil on top. The pitas were warm, soft, and fresh. We then shared the Greek salad and it was huge. It had plenty of feta which is just the way I like it! For dinner we shared a traditional Turkish entrée, Iskender Kabob, which was very delicious. It was a plate with fried pita bread covered in gyro meat (beef and lamb) and tzatziki sauce (yogurt) covered with tomato sauce and then baked. We did not get dessert because unfortunately they had not made any of the one that we wanted to try. They did have baklava available but we were too full to try something that we've already had many times before. The bill came to $36 for the two of us - not bad considering we brought some of it back home. We would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"A friend told us about how great this place was and we decided to give it a try. My boyfriend and myself have over 30 years in resturant and customer service experience and I always take a moment to compliment great service, however this time  I was so incredibly disappointed that I felt it was necessary to speak out about how not only was the food FAIR but the lack of customer service was borderline pathetic.    The hummus had no flavor, and the pitas were about the same. When we placed our orders, they were out of the three dishes we had inquired about. After about 20 minutes my boyfriend's meal came out and it was cold, I then sat there for 7-10 minutes awaiting for my salad wondering why it was taking forever and as to why you would bring out one meal and not the other with zero explanation. I have had mint salad at other middle eastern restaurants however this was not so amazing, and should really be served as a side dish and not a meal, especially being $9.00 I also asked for chicken to be added which consisted for an additional $4.00 (4 pieces).  The guy who took our order was too busy in conversation with everyone else and never once checked on us, although he was sure to make eye contact with me about 5 times. Eventually, the gal who was working (Brittany) stopped over to fill drinks and see if we needed anything...she was the only positive thing about this experience.   I expressed my concerns to Brittany who went to tell the owner that we were not happy with the experience and all she can say was sorry sorry sorry and never offered to make things right,  and pushed for us to have \"a little dessert to go\"...which I did not want. I wanted my \"meal\" comped which would have been the right thing to do, aside from the apology and to leave.   The guy who originally took our order came over to apologize and did nothing but give me a list of excuses on why he may have dropped the ball... in which I called him out on, this guy really should look into another profession because customer service was not his strong suit tonight.   Bottom line, I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are many middle eastern restaurants ASU who have superior service and much better food."}
{"text":"Mediterranean on Mill that tastes like Mediterranean on Mill. Very few places can do  Mediterranean right, and this is not one of them. The salad was mostly dry so I only ate two bites. The hummus was very bland and worse than store bought. The chicken was not seasoned well and was burned in several places. They were more like 6 chicken meatballs that tasted gummy if you didn't cut them into tiny pieces. The rice and aioli sauce were okay. I was not pleased to pay $25 for a meal for two.   All of the high reviews tell you that this is right in the middle of collegeville and from people who have never had real Mediterranean. I'm sure their cheeseburger and fries are decent though."}
{"text":"Always a good place when I'm in Tempe. Generous portions, a little slow but worth the wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this place on a Sunday afternoon when we couldn't decide exactly what to eat. Boy were we glad we did! The food was absolutely fantastic - fresh and tasty and the service matched the quality of the food.  We both ordered a lentil soup to start which was pureed - a way I have never had it before - and I can tell you I can't wait to have it again. They included a lemon wedge with the soup which enhanced it's flavor beautifully. We then shared a Vegetarian plate which was plenty of food for two. The hummus and baba ghanouj was some of the best we've ever eaten and the grape leaves were incredibly fresh as well. I am of the opinion that grape leaves can be really hit or miss and can sometimes leave a bitter taste in your mouth - these did nothing of the sort. In particular, the tabbouleh salad was some of the best either of us have ever had as well. Fresh, full of parsley and mint and good to the last drop.  If you're down on Mill - It's a place you must try."}
{"text":"Wow! I took my Turkish in-laws here, and we were all very impressed with the quality of the Adana Kebabs. The entire restaurant was packed for hours during New Year's Eve, and the employees consistently had smiles on their faces while serving their excellent food. We will definitely come back again! :)"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Med Fresh's falafel, so I thought I'd give them a try. It was so yummy! Usually you get big falafel balls, so each bite is either all falafel or no falafel. Med Fresh spreads theirs out so there's an even falafel distribution. This is very important. (Is there a Yelp award for using the word \"falafel\" the most times in one review?)  I went there for lunch to escape the office. Some people feel awkward eating alone, but almost everyone there was enjoying lunch solo. The guy at the register talked me into a strawberry-banana smoothie, which was sweet and tasted fresh."}
{"text":"sorry have to knock this place down a notch since they charge 50 cents for a water cup... Don't think this is even legal in AZ.  Still great food though!"}
{"text":"For the most part I love Med Fresh. Their salad dressing is amazing, and the meat is great. You can see the meat being roasted, and the food being prepared. Great for vegetarians as well...my friend loved her vegetarian meal. They are very clean, and for the most part very friendly. Wish the prices wouldn't keep going up, however I still keep paying it! Make sure you ask them for the their hot sauce, it not only ads spice to your meal, but a wonderful flavor too!"}
{"text":"What a gem in the middle of the desert. The tabuli salad was excellent. The Adana Kebab, though not as spicy as I like, had good flavor and very moist. Baklava and Turkish coffee to top it all off."}
{"text":"Man...I hate myself for not going to Phoenicia Cafe when In Season Deli didn't have there tables set up.  I met up with a gf on Mill and we decided on this place after finding In Season Deli didn't meet our qualifications for girl time. The poster outside said eat healthy and live longer.  And since I'm always trying to eat healthy, I thought this would be a great place.  So I decided on the small Greek salad and my friend got the hummus with chicken.  I know, not a lot of food, but bike riding in 113 degree weather on a full stomach sucks.  The food came quickly, and that was no small Greek salad!  They also had pita along with the salad, so it looked like a lot of food.  The salad itself looked fresh, but the dressing was overkill.  For being a \"healthy\" place, a dressing that tastes and looks like mayonnaise all over a salad does not qualify as healthy.  Something was off there.  As for my friend, she said the hummus was bland and no where near Pita Jungle's.  While I don't agree Pita Jungle is the best or most authentic hummus, to each their own.  This place gets a pass from me next time I'm hungry and on Mill.  Off to Phoenicia!"}
{"text":"Haven't stopped here in a while, but always see folks dining and enjoying the patio. Service is good and the place sparkles. A great stop for a lunch or light dinner, the hummus and chicken salad are tops."}
{"text":"The food here is some of the best middle eastern / turkish food in the valley. I would go here more often if the prices weren't so high. $16 for a lunch is more than I care to spend everyday."}
{"text":"Had a falafal pita. I've had it many times at other places, and let me just say....I've had much better. Two other people I went with also said their dishes were just ok. One of them wanted to go there to have the turkish tea, but the lady who took our order said it was too early for them to make tea... mmm, it was past noon.  I wouldn't recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I came to the restaurant expecting the worst, reading out negative review after negative review jokingly to my friends. I don't know what I expected when I went here  -- I guess I was feeling adventurous. Maybe I would find a hidden gem of a restaurant everybody else thought was crap. Maybe it would have a great authentic Turkish vibe nobody else has felt. But it really is as bad as it seems: a completely flavorless restaurant in both atmosphere and food. The prices are absurd, the food is completely bland and unfresh, and the only semblance of atmosphere are the travel photos of Turkey that hang haphazardly upon the wall. We had the gyro, which tasted as if they cut the meat years ago, boxed it, and kept serving it. Just save your time and ignore this place."}
{"text":"I got a combo plate, and I thought the food was fresh, flavorful, and fulfilling. :)  I mean, I definitely thought some meats were better than others, but it's a personal preference.  The chicken was juicy and well-cooked.  I don't think this place deserves those bad reviews, but check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"First impression absolutely fantastic customer service.  My friend and I came here for dinner.  She wanted a salad and I wanted lamb shish kabobs.    The gentleman who greeted us made some outstanding recommendations for our dinner.    We had a large house salad; a combo dinner (4 different kabob skewers); rice; and hummus.  One of the best Mediterranean dinners I've had..  We walked away very satisfied and very full."}
{"text":"The grilled meats are good but nothing extraordinary.  The side dishes on the combo plates are, for the most part, simple and fresh.  The rice is the low point (bland and falls short of traditional cracked wheat) while the balaclava is the high.  That it is fairly expensive coupled with the inconvenience of parking means I won't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give this place fifty stars, not just five. Selda (I believe this was her name, as I am horrible with names), was so extremely personable and friendly and just.. WOW. She may have been the owner, but I am unsure. She knew how everything was cooked, with whatever ingredients they were cooked with, all the way down to the oil that they grill with. I eat healthy, clean food, and Selda made sure that our food was prepared the way we wanted, hot and fresh. We found this place while wandering down Mill Ave and decided to try it out. I couldn't have been more pleased. We will certainly be revisiting, especially to hang out with the kick butt owner/manager and her awesome server. The two ladies ROCKED our food and our experience!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. :/ the stuffed grape leaves are pretty good but I've had better in chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Med Fresh each time I've gone.  Their skewered and grilled chicken seems to be what I order the most.  It is always very moist and tasty.  I've also gotten a combo platter that has a little bit of everything and I haven't been disappointed in anything in that either.  Their salad is simple but good.  The pepper spread on the pita is a nice addition as well.  As many others have said, their garlic sauce is very flavorful and is good with just about everything.    The place is clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot on Mill Ave!  I've had tabbouleh, the chicken salad and the vegetarian plate - all have been spot on.  My co-workers also like the chicken donner and the kebabs.  Two drawbacks, though:  First, it's expensive.  Whenever you add chicken to a salad, they add $3.50, which brings your bill up above $10.  Second, service isn't exactly speedy.  I realize that fresh, quality food isn't cheap and takes some time to make, but I have time constraints and a different price point for a work lunch.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Last day in AZ, and my friend and I were looking for a quick bite to eat before heading toward the airport.  We randomly walked in to Med Fresh Grill because it seemed healthy and wasn't too crowded.  I had the vegetarian plate which came with hummus, baba ganouj, falafel, tabouleh, dolmas, small salad, and pita bread. Wow, I wish I had discovered this place sooner.  The hummus was one of the best hummus that I've had. Creamy, but not too oily, good flavors. Best item on my plate.  I didn't care for the tabouleh, but I liked the dolmas and baba ganouj.  The hummus though really stands out.   My friend had the chicken pita wrap combo with fries. When they called our number, they only had the fries and forgot the wrap! The guys apologized, but it was still a little annoying since it wasn't crowded. I'm not sure how long we waited for our food, but it wasn't fast.  On the other hand, everything did taste fresh, so I'd rather wait for quality food.   Parking can be a pain, but the food was definitely worth it. Great find in Tempe. Get the hummus."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Seems pricey but the taste makes up for it.  I am always down for the Chicken Kebab.  I get the small.  Six pieces of chicken perfectly marinated on top of heaping serving of saffron rice.  In addition to a side salad, they give you a pita with a teasing of their hummus.  I always think it seems like not much food, but I go away stuffed.  The place is nice but the lady always seems like she is having a bad day.  Doesn't bother me, especially if they give me the garlic sauce with my food.  Gotta have it!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. It is always fresh and tasty. My favorite is the chicken donner.  It comes with hummus and a salad. Most everything I have tried is really good. The only thing I wish that they had was a restroom inside the actual restaurant, (not outside in another location). Also the biggest change was that you used to be able to go to the counter and order then just pick up your food and sit down. They have changed it,.... now they have a wait staff there to seat you and they take your order. This happens after 3:00pm. WHY??? I won't go there if it is after 3:00pm because we have experienced the service and it is spotty at best. Most of the time we wait for them to come over to get our order and to give us our checks,....I can't see spending money on a tip when it was so simple before to just order and wait for your food. There have been many times we've opted out of eating there because we just missed the 3:00pm time. Lots of good places to eat in Tempe where you can just order and seat yourself. This place missed the mark by changing it into a \"formal dinning\" situation when it really shouldn't be. Go before 3:00pm, the food is good!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has 4 stars since it is certainly not justified. I also don't know why they have the word \"fresh\" in their name. I did not see any justification for that either. I stopped in for lunch a couple weeks ago and it was probably the worst meal I have ever had at a Greek place ever. I opted for the chicken gyro but rather than a light and healthy sandwich, the meat was dripping with oil and had sort of disintegrated into little bits. Very unappetizing to look at and not very tasty either. Instead of the usual gyro herbs and spices I mostly tasted garlic and salt. I was happy that they did not use tzatziki sauce since I am trying to avoid dairy right now but they did feel the need to add two very limp pickle spears that were radioactive yellow in color. My side dish was the small Greek salad consisting of wilted lettuce and mealy tomatoes. The dressing was not the usual lemony dressing on a Greek salad but instead something that looked like Caesar. It was not a good salad.  Even though it was pretty dirty when I was there (which to be fair was the tail end of the lunch rush) it was a cute place. And the staff was friendly. So I decided to give them an extra star. But due to the fact that I did not enjoy my meal I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"We enjoy eating here typically every time we hit up the mill avenue area.  We tend to get the meat kabobs and a fruit milk shake.  These shakes taste fantastic.  I only wish they had more sauces for the food. Is it the best Mediterranean food ? Probably not, but the location is great and the food taste fresh."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on our last trip to AZ and it was GREAT. I had the \"sampler\" that came with three meats and all three were flavorful and perfect. My wife had a salad that had chicken on it and she loved it. There wasn't a part of the meal that we didn't like! Service was also great. I don't think there was an employee in the restaurant that didn't stop by at least once to see how we were doing."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews here. When I see a lot of the criticism focused on serving size, I usually take anything that reviewer says with a grain of salt. We order takeout every time we're in Tempe, and it's always amazing. The kabobs rock harder than Def Leppard on meth and their falafel is the best. Unless you are one of these quantity-over-quality folks, don't hesitate to try MedFresh."}
{"text":"Found this spot while roaming around Mill Avenue and saw the gyro & beer special $8.99 posted outside..   We sat inside but they also have an outdoor sidewalk patio with misters ..   We had the beef & lamb gyro with a side of French fries.. the gyro was a good size .. the veggies were different then I'm used to but it was great.. I'd never had pickles in a gyro .. but it worked..   Good service, fast and friendly .. wish I'd saved room for a piece of baklava.. maybe next time!!"}
{"text":"Three hungry girls sick of eating the same old crap, we decided to check this place out since we were nearby. All three of us lived in turkey at one point in our lives so we have all had good Turkish food. Anyway, we got the yogurt drink which was delicious. Two of us got the beef doner plate and one got the chicken doner plate. I think we got the left over scraps because we went late so chicken was dry and the beef was greasy. The salad had a spicy dressing which didnt mesh well. The hummus had little flavor. We expected better pita, but they used the usual arabic pita. I hate that pita. i was hungry but I could finish my plate, it just wasn't good.   The older gentleman who served us (I think he was the owner) was very polite and personable. I just wish I could have liked his restaurant."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken kabab. Grilled skewered chicken that is just bursting with flavor. Served on a bed of yellow rise with a small side salad that consists of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and some type of dressing. A pita on the side with some hummus. Everything tastes great and seems healthy to me. Great lunch for under $9 the owner is always at the register and knows who I am and is always nice. Always clean with a couple TVs with sports on. Usually soccer."}
{"text":"One of the last family owned places left in town.  I love the chicken kabobs/hummus.  They're very accommodating as far as food allergies etc.  The family makes you feel very welcome.  I hope this place never goes away. So yummy! It's nice to be treated well too!  They genuinely  appreciate your business. What a concept! Healthy too"}
{"text":"This is a small family owned restaurant that I visited almost once a week while working on Mill Avenue!!!  OMG so yummy!  And definitely fresh.  Everything is so good loved the humus especially!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, minus the over-salted fries (though I can't expect a Mediterranean restaurant to get fries right). I'm usually satisfied with the gyro I order, especially on $3 gyro Wednesday.  Unfortunately, this place is WELL understaffed for as popular of a lunch spot it is on Mill Ave. From the $10 minimum for credit cards (only enforced by one lady) to the lethargic cook, you can tell this place cuts corners in order to remain open. I can't stand waiting 30 minutes for one gyro, especially when I watch as 1 guy is cooking with absolutely no sense of urgency. ONE guy cooking for 20-30 people waiting for food.   The 2 stars are for the good food, but the food isn't worth the wait or bad service. They are nice, but they need to spend more money on staffing."}
{"text":"Good food.  Small portions, especially for a Mediterranean joint at the prices they are charging."}
{"text":"Ate here years ago when it was good. Now the lentil soup is the only best thing to eat there and the hamburgers, ha! Pretty sure they are store bought. Dolma was oily. Now, out of now where, kebabs are made spicy. Except for the chicken which wasn't seasoned at all! Sadly, not coming back. I used to frequent this place and I was excited to introduce this place to family they love Mediterranean. But even they knew this Mediterranean food wasn't good quality. I don't care about the customer service, or the lack there of, but if you are going to have a poor attitude, your food BETTER be the BEST in the city."}
{"text":"I was with my sister on Mill Ave looking for some food to eat. We thought Greek would be awesome but then we saw Crave was gone and My Brg Fat Greek burned down. So we came across MedFresh and decided to give it a go. We both ordered gyros with lamb and beef and some hummus. First of all, the hummus had a strange aftertaste, I decribed it as if there was whiskey or some sort of alcohol in it. It was tolerable to eat but I wouldn't order it again. Then our gyros came out and I didn't like the flavors that came with it. It had too much stuff in it like pickles, lettuce, onions, not sure what I normally have in a gyro but it just didn't taste right. So we left and my plate had half a gyro and a lot of stale fries that I couldn't eat. The staff was very nice and attentive but the food quality will cause me to never return."}
{"text":"Very friendly.  Great food at great prices.  Cabernet was served chilled... not used to that from the northeast.. maybe a hot weather thing... Excellent for the place that it is.  Do not expect luxury but a relaxing environment with hookah"}
{"text":"I am a hummus fiend. I have made tabbouleh so delicious that the heavens parted and rained down tears of joy upon its consumption. I will cut a bitch over the last dollop of garlic dip. Don't even get me started on baba ghanoush.  So it's almost a guarantee that I will like anything that draws upon a Mediterranean flavor palate.   Med Fresh is no exception.  It's technically Turkish, but I don't split hairs when it comes to Mediterranean. The pitas are fresh and flavorful, the tzatziki is kickin' and the gyro meat (beef and chicken) are always moist and delicious. Everything is prepared as you order it and you have a clear view of the goings-on in the sunken kitchen. The staff can be a bit terse at times but they're always professional and quick to disperse a busy lunch rush.   The platters are priced well for the mound of food you receive, and while I have had some tonsil-scraping dry chicken on occasion, the majority of the time the kabobs and koftas are moist and tender. If you simply can't be pressed to make up your mind, go with the mixed grill and get a bit of a variety.   The pita sammich special (#16) is the best bang for your buck on the menu. Pita, meat, tomato, lettuce, weird pickles and secret sauce. Served with tzatziki and their killer spicy red sauce. Salad or fries on the side. $6.95.   Oh yeah."}
{"text":"We were a party of 5 ladies. As soon as we entered the restaurant we felt very unwelcome but we were very hungry so we sat down. I ordered a babaganoush for appetizer but the food came before the appetizer so i cancelled it. The chef started to yell from the kitchen it is a sin to waste, he made sure we heard it he repeat it couple of times. I didn't take it seriously but that was very rude. It is not my fault that the appetizer didn't come on time. I liked the food it was good  I got a beef doner wrap it came with salad which had a spicy dressing which i didn't enjoy. And the most disappointing of the whole night was that when i was exiting the restaurant I grabbed couple of mint candies that they had. I was facing the door the chef called out again saying TAKE ONLY ONE. I wasn't robbing the candies i only took three.It wasnt what he said it was the way he said it. It was belittling. Overall i felt a negative altitude toward us although we were all very nice saying thank you, complimenting the food. They were much more attentive to the other customers. three of my friends were wearing hijabs, i have a strong feeling that the staffs negative altitude towards us had to do with that. No one  deserves this kind of treatment because of the way they choose to live. I dont wear a hijab but I will not go back to this restaurant because i dont want to support a business who discriminates people based on their religion practices."}
{"text":"We hired MedFresh Turkish Grill to cater a work event to surprise our boss, who is from Turkey. The food was phenomenal and extremely tasty! The falafel were the best I've ever had in my life, the hummus and pita chips were a hit, and the Baklava had everyone going for seconds! As a vegan, I was very happy as most of their food was vegan. I would definitely recommend Eddie and his team for anyone planning an event."}
{"text":"The main reasons why I order often is because I work in the area and they deliver. Overall the food is good.  The chicken and beef kabobs are great, hummus and rice is ok and the salad is boring.  The portions are too small for the price.  You get lucky if you get the young kid or the husband to help you, they are very nice but the wife is super rude and unfriendly."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a hookah, it never came. We kept being told that we had to wait for the \"authentic coals\" to be lit.  Later he admitted he did not know how to make the hookah.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Get take out, the smoke was insane. It's not only the hubbly bubbly smoke but cigarettes and cigars were puffing away. Inside the music was on full bore loud! Deafening....  But the food was outstanding. Get take out unless you like your ear drums blown out and early lung disease."}
{"text":"This is a popular lunchtime spot with my coworkers. In the evenings it tried to be a little more upscale by having waiter service. The food is decent and it makes for a quick meal.  There's not really much more to add!"}
{"text":"When my wife and I went, the place wasn't that busy.  We had no problem getting our food and the girl that took our order was nice.  We had the chicken Kabob which if you are new to this type of food you can't go wrong.  They gave me a chili pepper that almost burned my head off, my wife had a good laugh watching me suffer.  We would eat here again, fair price, the decor is nothing to write home about but the food is very tasty"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night before a show at the Gammage looking for a good quick bite to eat.   The waitress was quick to seat us, take our drink orders and recommeded a Turkish pilsner that we decided to try.  My friend recommended the chichen doner, equating it to chicken shawrma, but I still found my self torn between that and the lamb kabob wrap.    Ordering the chicken doner with a side salad, my friend decided on the falafel plate.    While it took a bit to get the food out, under any other circumstance time would not have been an issue, but since we had to be somewhere and we were hungry it felt a lot longer than I am sure it was in reality.   My chicken doner was served fresh and  piping hot off the grill  with a side of tzatziki and a spicy tomato based \"salsa\" and the salad was fresh romaine lettuce, tomatos and cucumbers, drizzled with a rich spicy dressing.    The Chicken doner was seasoned superbly and garnished with pickles and tomatoes.  I enjoyed this much more than the chicken shwarma at Al-Hana.   My friend's falafel plate looked amazing with a salad, 4 or was it 6 good sized pieces of falafel, hummus and some warm pita.  The turkish pilsner accompanied the meal well.   After we were done, the waitress offered hot tea on the house, and had we not had somewhere to be we would have stuck around for some hot tea.   The service here was excellent and the waitress was very friendly.   So why 3 stars and not 4 or 5.  Well later in the evening my friend started feeling ill, poor guy.  By the time intermission rolled around he was feeling queezy and by the shows end the guy was hurting. [Don't blame it on the performance...that was pretty good.]  While I was not feeling bad, admittedly he did have a few things on his plate that I didn't have.  I need to check on him this morning."}
{"text":"Wow, the chicken was too burned and they charged me $1.99 for grilling the tomatoes and onions but didn't tell me. When I objected they just said, \"Oh well.\" Not for me. There are too many other good Med places in Tempe."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is always fresh and tasty!  I have picked up food to bring to my work peeps a couple times, verybody raves about it!  Thanks MedFresh!"}
{"text":"Med Fresh has all the ambience of a take-out place, but without the cheap prices or speed.  For $10, the chicken was dry, lukewarm, and boring, the hummus was grainy, and the rice was sad. This might have been because I visited after the dinner rush; everything seemed like it had been sitting just a little too long. The pita was good, as was the salad. The sauce was great - I wished there was more! - though I did add some extra hot sauce to it.   There definitely wasn't a microwave- the food was all laid out, and you could watch them prepare it.  I really wanted to like the owner I met, but he spent the entire time I was there talking to another customer, while customers piled up waiting for food. The guy who took my order and prepared my food was new, and couldn't keep up with everything that needed done. He seemed like a sincerely earnest guy though, so maybe in a few weeks I'll come back and love him.  Two stars for now, but I want to come back and give it more."}
{"text":"This is by far my  most favorite Turkish place. I have been to this place countless number of times and was never disappointed. In fact, now that I don't stay in Tempe anymore, I always make it a point to visit this place whenever I go to Tempe.   I  love their chicken kabob platter. Chicken skewers are always perfectly marinated and moist. I also love their rice, pita, garlic dip and salad served on the side. I have tried falafel and chicken gyro sandwiches as well and those were pretty good, too. I would highly recommend this place if you happen to be in Tempe downtown."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious lamb kabobs and not too expensive. This place is a legitimate Turkish restaurant."}
{"text":"Ridiculously friendly service. Chill environment with amazing Mediterranean/Turkish style food. Great any night of the week"}
{"text":"I just moved right down the way from Med Fresh Grill and love Mediterranean food  so you can imagine my excitement  to learn this place was here.  First chance I got, I went down there and ordered the steak kabob and hummus to go.  A few steps from the door, as I was happily walking home with my bag full of goodies, it occurred to me to stop and check the order and sure enough, no pita bread.  That does still come complimentary, right?  Well, I'm a pretty happy person so I just turned on my heal and headed back, no big deal. I walked up to the front to let a gentleman know and he begrudgingly provided the forgotten item as if he was doing me the favor.  I thought, he must be having a bad day.  I went home and indulged and I must say, the hummus is amazing, has a distinct earthen taste, very, very good.  The steak in  my kabob was not anything to write home about but still not bad.  Two days later, went back with friends, ordered the same thing and it was a different sandwich.  The kabob now had a mysterious red dressing that completely changed the flavour...not so good.  The girl who took our order offered a small side salad and I thought, sure, why not?  the side salad added 4.50 to the bill and had a terrible dressing that pretty much made it garbage.  So ya, 4.50 for garbage, yay me.  Sorry Med Fresh Grill but I'm going to make the extra effort to go further for my Medditerranean fix, you had your chance.  Don't worry, I don't actually think you care."}
{"text":"I've hit up the usual \"Middle Eastern/Mediterranean\" spots in Tempe (We luckily have a quite a few)...and I am so surprised that I have yet to review MedFresh.   I am enamored. Their hummus is divine, their Gyro plates are sublime. Let's talk about the fact that they have chicken and beef/lamb roasting all day...top that with their delicious red sauce (what the heck is that stuff!?)...and it's pure satisfying delight.  They also give you a little side salad, for a well balanced, complete meal.  Now, what makes them stand out? THE QUALITY. Hands-down. Some other places (which shall remain nameless, you've been there, I've been there...they're open late and you needed some drunk food fixins) serve up the nastiest cuts of chicken/beef/lamb. I rarely eat meat as is...so when I do, I don't want gristly, cold, marbley fat meat.  So here we go...in short, just try it once. What can you really lose? You'll find out it's better than the other spots, for the same price, and suddenly you don't have to eat food, while intoxicated, to appreciate it.  Win, win : )"}
