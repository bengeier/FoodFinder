{"text":"Convenient, fresh and delicious food for a hotel restaurant in Ohio . I ordered the veggie pizza with added chicken and was not disappointed. The pizza came right out of the oven, the ingredients were fresh and the portion was very generous ( 12 inch for $13. 00). I would definitely recommend this great little restaurant to anyone staying at the hotel who wants quick, delicious and fresh pizza. The service was also prompt, efficient and courteous."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars. Written as a guest of the hotel. You would come eat here if you had options, but for a convenient meal in the hotel it's fine.   Stick to the pizza if you're getting dinner. The white pizza with prosciutto was good and I liked their crust.  Overall, not bad for hotel food. Clean, bright atmosphere. $5 beers. The breakfast buffet is included with your room and pretty decent.   I don't understand why people are complaining about the dry salmon, etc. Of course a hotel restaurant isn't going to serve amazing fish, order something harder to screw up and you will be fine.   Nice staff and service. No complaints as long as you know what you're getting - hotel food."}
{"text":"Great little place right up against the Cleveland clinic campus. Stopped in for a quick bit and some coffee. Stop in and say hello if your ever close by."}
{"text":"Had stayed in the hotel due to close access to the Clinic.  Ate in the Moce out of need.  Food is overcooked.   Day 1 had a garden salad with grilled salmon. Salad was $7.00 , the dry overcooked 2\" piece of salmon was $6.95.    The service is slow and over priced. They serve free coffee from a beverage bar that is so bad I watched two people besides myself throw it away after one taste. We ordered a 12\" pizza the next night called the Cleveland.  Burned dough, over done , sausage crispy cheese dry and solid. We paid $15.95 for this dandy!!!  Go to Burger King across the street. The Moce is over priced, over cooked and not that tasty.   Learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. But the food... is just ok. Mostly like a cafeteria. If you are at the clinic. It's an ok option. Coffee is good. Staff is nice.. but not very attentive."}
