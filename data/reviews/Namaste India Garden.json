{"text":"First time here. I have been a regular at the original India Garden for a long time.  The food is very different but equally great!  Service was wonderful. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is excellent! Fav items: butter chicken, garlic naan and the gobi 65. They have a large menu and you can choose your spice level. The staff is wonderful and are very accommodating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The butter chicken and naan were delicious! I love that you can select just how spicy hot you want your entree prepared. The service was excellent... our server was so friendly and pleasant. He invited us to sample their mango lassi which was amazing. I will definitely be going back to try more entrees on their menu!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service!!! Our waiter Ryan did an exceptional job. Highly recommend paying a visit."}
{"text":"It's a good place. Tried the mysore Masada dosa, gobi 65 and lb chettinad all of them were worth it."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic place. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the food is amazing. The gobi 65 is delicious and my favorite entree is the chicken chettinad. I feel like you really can't go wrong with anything you choose here. Definitely stop in! My mom, who has never had Indian food, really enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Upon entering with my wife (at 8:30PM - not an abnormal time for dinner), the guy who later self-identified as the manager didn't say \"welcome,\" but rather curtly told us that \"the restaurant closes in 30 minutes, so [we'd] have to order and eat fast.\" Pretty terrible start.  After our dinner order began to take an inordinate amount of time to arrive, a waiter appeared to ask \"Uhh...what did you guys order?\" Wish I could've told him, but the pressure to order was so great that I pointed at something vaguely familiar on the menu and hoped for the best. I responded with \"Indian food.\" Fortunately, it arrived a few seconds later.  Mid-meal I asked to order some garlic naan to-go (you know, because we were being rushed out of the dining room). The waitress told me she \"wasn't sure\" and \"would have to check\" if it was possible. Miraculously, the to-go naan appeared a few minutes later, literally thrown onto my table by a drive-by waitress. This prompted a woman dining at nearby table to lean over and ask: \"Did I really just see her throw your naan at you?\" Yes, you did, friend. Later, this same woman asked a waitress why all of the customers were being treated so poorly if the sign says \"open 'til 9:30PM\" - turns out they accept take-out orders until 9:30PM, but it's simply unacceptable for the dining room to be open past 9PM.  Throughout our entire dining experience the staff was abuzz with their closing duties: rapidly clearing plates as soon as they appeared half-done, the manager barking orders to quickly prepare and deliver food (even though they didn't know to whom it belonged), and reminders to diners that the dining room closes promptly at 9. Diners were visibly annoyed/angered.  The food was good, but not THAT good, you know? Next time namaste home and order a pizza."}
{"text":"Best food. Best ambience. Extremely friendly customer service. I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good Butter chicken ! You can decide between different degrees of how spicy you want your food. The staff is really friendly. We got take out, but when we got the food it looked cozy in there. I love their naan bread. If you have a sweet tooth you definitely have to try the Mango lassi... so good. Over all a very good experience!"}
{"text":"Great service and extensive South Indian menu! The indo-Chinese dishes are really good too! It was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"First time actually eating at an indian restaurant! I felt overwhelmed by the menu so I decided to ask the guy for help. He sat down with us asked some questions and guided me to the perfect dish! The staff was friendly, prompt, and totally on top of everything. Would highly recommend=]"}
{"text":"My husband & I are always on a mission to find great Indian food on our travels... excellent food & service! A plus, all gluten-free options marked on menu. Walk off a fully belly with short trek to Lakewood Park!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Chettinad was sublime. I ordered it 8/10 hotness and it did not disappoint. Most of the other Indian style restaurants I've ate ate have been mostly northern so a lot of the dishes on the menu I had not had before. The Chettinad is my new favorite! Paired with a Southern Teir 2xIPA and I was in heaven on earth. Can not wait to take some friends here!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful flavors without too much heat. Tried the chicken Korma and the butter chicken. Both were outstanding!  Many vegan and dairy free choices.  Southern Indian udupom and idly.   Great beer menu! Service is good.  Waitstaff is very knowledgable.  Wish we'd found this place sooner, but we're making up for lost time."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Indian restaurant in cleveland! The food is fantastic, our favorites are the Navaratna Korma and the Mughalai . Super accommodating, they were even able to make the chicken Mughalai into a vegetarian dish for my boyfriend. Ryan, the manager, was very friendly and if you are unsure of what to order he can help if you let him know what type of dishes you normally like. Any entree suggestions he has provided we have thoroughly enjoyed. The atmosphere is bright and clean, the staff will make sure your water glass is always full. If you run of out rice they will always fill it back up for you. Also side note: this place is BYO for wine.  If you haven't been - you should check it out - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ordered a take out on a sunday night. And the food was really good and tasty. We loved the chettinad chicken, and the chicken 65."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have ever had (and I've had a lot)! I got the the aloo bonda appetizer and bagara baigan entree and they were so good. My friend recommended this restaurant and got the butter chicken, then raved about it. Great for vegans or meat eaters alike, I can't wait to come back to Lakewood and eat here again."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Waiter was very helpful in selecting menu options for our co workers."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner last night with my in-laws. This is the third time we've been to Namaste India Garden. First time was with my parents for my dad's birthday, then we came back with some friends, and then last night. My family and I used to frequent Udupi Cafe in Parma, and when they closed we were so sad because we couldn't find any comparable South Indian food in the city. We have found our replacement!!! Namaste is at least as good as Udupi! If not better! Everyone we have brought here loved it as much as myself and my husband do!! The staff is so wonderful, welcoming and attentive. The decor is beautiful and simple enough for a casual dinner, but nice enough for a Saturday night out. One of the owners, Ramesh, has been so welcoming every time and always has recommendations or answers to our questions, or just friendly conversation. Best of all, every single item we've ordered was delicious!! Depth of flavor, plenty of heat, all the best things about South Indian cuisine! I highly recommend everyone pay a visit to our new favorite Indian restaurant"}
{"text":"India Garden has been my all-time favorite Indian restaurant for quite some time. I was really excited to find out that the owners had started a new place with a different type of Indian food. I've had a lot of Northern Indian food, and was skeptical that this could really be too much different, but I was wrong. Northern and Southern Indian dishes are extremely different, and this place is definitely worth a try. I now have two favorite Indian places."}
{"text":"Our family (3 generations worth) came here for lunch during the Cleveland Aradhana festival. Andra dhal and palak paneer for the kids, masala dosa, podi dosa and onion rava dosa for adults. Food was really very good with balanced spices and the service even better (and I would say our family can be quite critical). I would recommend this place to anyone hankering for some good South Indian food."}
{"text":"This is best Indian food in Cleveland hands down. I don't eat much Indian food out bc U gave friends that make home made authentic Indian food. I have seen them cook it and I know how much time it takes to make one dish...forever if you are hungry!   With that said I'm always unwilling to try restaurant food.  I had the fish curry, naan, paleek pane er and all was great flavorful and good. So even though it's not near I will travel for good taste."}
{"text":"I really like this place - but the food is unfortunately a little inconsistent - with some menu items made extremely well (Bagara Baingan, Butter Paneer) and some not so much. The place stresses South Indian food - but have some North Indian items on the menu - though I don't think these are the chef's strength.   The naan is REALLY good though.   Ask the server to guide you as to what the chef makes well - and you should be fine."}
{"text":"We had lunch on our way back to Michigan. The food was excellent. We ordered chicken 65, chicken dum biryani, chettinad chicken, Naan and Haka Noodles. Nice place to eat and the service was excellent. The dining room was well kept. Very good authentic indian place in Cleveland. Execellent place highly recommended if you are looking for good Indian food."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times - great service and great food.  I am happy they are representing south Indian food - while I like Indian Garden, you can get that type of Indian food anywhere but there are not too many places nearby that have dosas!    I love the dosas and the Gobi 65"}
{"text":"Been going here regularly since I moved to Lakewood and it's my favorite Indian food restaurant in the area. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very good Indian Food, Nan is very good and not oily, the food and service in general was very good, would visit again"}
{"text":"We took our family to Namaste tonight for a special night out.  The server/manager Ryan was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, helping us find selections that match our likes and dislikes.  The food was beautifully seasoned. I recommend the vegetable platter appetizer and/or the fried cauliflower.  The lamb biryani was a symphony of flavors; the lamb curries spicy, warm and delicious.  We will definitely return.  Thank you for a lovely dinner."}
{"text":"Despite being busy, the service was fast and excellent! Food came out very promptly and was all delicious, we had the lamb vindaloo, chicken mughalai, and vegetable chettinad. Manager Ryan was very courteous and attentive, definitely would return!"}
{"text":"Always order take out from here.  My favorite Indian restaurant in the area so far.  Love the paneer butter masala and the spinach pakora.  Their mango lassi is also very thick and dessert like.  Definitely recommend.  The staff/owner are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Completely different flavors, but just as good as the original India Garden! Definitely try the Gobi Manchurian, I have never tasted anything like it! Fried cauliflower tossed in a spicy/sweet/savory chunky chutney like mixture.  Hard to describe so you just have to try it! The mango lassis were amazing too, perfect combo!"}
{"text":"Great service, cool atmosphere and awesome food! They took time to explain the menu and were patient with us."}
{"text":"I recently dined here with a large group of friends and had an excellent experience. The updated restaurant looks great, the staff was very friendly, and most of all, the food was delicious! Everything that I tried I really liked, but I would recommend the Gobi 65, Punugalu balls, Methi Chicken, and Chicken Mughalai. Another great perk in my opinion, is that the restaurant is BYOB."}
{"text":"Poor customer service I ever experienced. The manager was rude and disrespectful. Wanted us to leave the restaurant at 9:15 without even us finishing up the food for a 9:30 close."}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday for the first time.  I can't wait to go back.  The food was absolutely delicious!  The staff was gracious and lovely!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Ryan was very accommodating and courteous! Gave us complementary lassis. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This was the second time we visited. The food is amazing there's nothing bad to say about it. The service the first time we went wasn't  good, the girl that waited on us was a very unpleasant  person.  This time however, the service was amazing the gentlemen was very attentive. He made us feel at home and very welcome.  When you visit this fine establishment you need to at least order the Gobi 65 and Mysore Masala Dosa !!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and quality service every time. Options for the whole family, but my husband and I do come sometimes on our own when we start craving the food!  My favorites are the chicken mugalai and the biryani. Wait staff is very gracious, explain choices and keep you apprised of food status. Manager/owner always visits tables to ensure everything is as expected. Restaurant is fresh and clean."}
{"text":"Super excited to have a south Indian restaurant in town!  The interior was clean and modern and the dishes were all nicely presented.  I would definitely come back.  No changing tables."}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner last evening. The server and manager combined to make it a very enjoyable evening. We asked a lot of questions and they patiently explained all our questions. In the end the meals we got were very, very good. Between the appetizers and the meal, I could not finish mine. I'm looking forward to finishing it this evening. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food and ambience was very good.  Worth your buck.must try the rasmalai. The waiter and the staff were very friendly.  Awesome bread basket."}
{"text":"I've been ordering takeout from Namaste the last couple of years, and it is reliably wonderful. It's not your traditional average Indian food - everything is just a little bit better. Their paneer tastes fresher, saag is ground a little more smoothly, and they don't rely too much on butter/ghee to make the dishes rich/heavy. Their food is more rich and light. It's enough to make anyone who doesn't like vegetables want to eat them all the time! I don't think I've ever regretted ordering from there. They deliver on Grubhub which is very convenient."}
{"text":"Service is almost as wonderful as the Korma. You won't be disappointed! I've been a few times now and the manager is always friendly and very helpful if you are looking for suggestions."}
{"text":"I had never tried Indian food until I came here. The service was incredible, attentive, and helpful. Not to mention the food being absolutely fantastic! Will definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"This place was simply delicious. Originally planned on getting Thai but drove by and decided to switch it up a bit and so glad we did. Hands down best Indian food I've had. The butter chicken was amazing and the owner even sat down at our table to discuss the menu with us to decide what to get. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this food. It's the best Indian around hands down. So I had to change my rating. I could literally eat it daily! And the owner is really sweet. You also get a ton of food! Well worth the price. If you order carry out its done within 10 minutes of calling."}
{"text":"I've eaten at every Indian restaurant I have found over the past 6 years (at least 8-10) and haven't ever come close to my first, perfect, introduction to Indian food (in FL), but Namaste has finally done it! I am so very thankful to have a restaurant near me that has such perfect cuisine. The food is bright, fresh, and flavorful, but most important I can see and taste the care they put into making the food. It is delightful. Portions are a great size; enough to eat if you're completely starving or a nice lunch for the next day if you're not. Prices are reasonable and similar to other nearby Indian restaurants that are no where near as tasty. The atmosphere is nice, clean, and new."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The spicy 65 cauliflower is awesome!! The owner is always so nice and looks happy to be at his job and is always so welcoming. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night and the restaurant was almost one hundred percent full, which I was extremely happy to see because many other Indian restaurants don't seem to have any more than 3 or 4 tables so they must be doing something right. They have a pretty good selection of different bottled beers, a lot of IPAs. They don't serve wine but we brought our own bottle and they presented us with two wine glasses and a wine opener which saves you about $28 right off the bat. Pricing and quantity of food is pretty similar to  other Indian restaurants I've been to, but the food quality was excellent. We ordered a paneer dish, lamb korma, and butter chicken. I'm not much on Paneer, I can take it or leave it, but this was really good, like I would consider ordering it myself. The butter chicken was one of the best we've had, and the lamb korma was fantastic! Service was just a little slow at the end when it came time to box up leftovers and get the check, but otherwise they were very attentive and the food came out quick. All of us agreed that this is probably our new Indian restaurant of choice."}
{"text":"Best Southern Indian in Cleveland. Period. The Bonda reminded me of my college days. And they are probably the only ones in the area offering Bagare Baigan!"}
{"text":"Namaste is the new sister restaurant of India Garden. Both are location in Lakewood.   My husband and I had a great meal at Namaste! The staff was friendly and the atmosphere of the restaurant was great. We told our server that this was our first meal at Namaste and after a few questions about our likes (spicy?, vegetarian?) he offered to order for us to surprise us. We agreed and were not disappointed! The food was delicious!!  My husband and I shared a Dosa (filled lentil savory pancake), vegetable chettinad, garlic naan and saffron rice. We even had leftovers to take home.  Tip: Because the restaurant is new, they are don't have a beer and wine license yet. We were told we can bring our own next time we visit. I ordered a mango lassi (like a smoothie) to drink and it was was delicious.  Thank you Namaste, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here with my GF today . Being Indian I was totally surprised to see all Americans here (good thing ) . Their hospitality was good .. prices are little bit on higher side. Now the very disappointing fact ... I ordered hot n sour soup they served us tomato  soup instead."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Friendly & knowledgable staff. Will return 100% - love the Gobi 65 & chicken curry!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were excited to try Indian cuisine for the first time and namaste did not disappoint. We stopped in at 4 pm Saturday and we're promptly seated . The decor was nice with beautiful Indian artwork on display. Being our first time the server sat with us to help find an appetizer and 2 entrees that would satisfy are curious palettes. We settled on chicken 65 for the starter. It was small fried chicken pieces with great flavor and a mint chutney dipping sauce. The meat was juicy and the spices were unique and balanced. For the main course I chose the lamb chettinad with an 8 on the servers spicy scale. My fiance chose the lamb sukka spicy scale 0. Both of us were very satisfied and it's going to be hard waiting for our next visit."}
{"text":"Had a bad service experience when it first opened, but glad I gave them another chance. As someone who has traveled to southern India, its so nice to have a place to get southern Indian food, which isn't seen often on most Indian restaurant menus.   My mom and I recently had lunch there and our server was very attentive and helpful. We were both very pleased with our meals, which were flavorful and delicious. Our server also presented us with a paper copy of the menu with our orders noted, as well as suggestions for a future visit.   Can't wait for my next trip here!"}
{"text":"As longtime fans of India Garden, we were looking forward to trying Namaste and we weren't disappointed!  Service was excellent, they took the time to explain the dishes, and everything came out quickly!  And the food we tried was very good... Some similarities to the Northern Indian food at India Garden, but with completely different flavors.  The Gobi 65 appetizer is amazing ... And the flavor just kept growing on me the more that I ate!  That's a keeper!  I do recommend the dosa, a HUGE crepe made of rice and lentils that can be plain or filled (we opted for one filled with paneer chunks).  Tear off pieces and dip them in the accompanying sambar or chutney dips.  The sambar is really good.  I ended up using it as a dip with my Gobi 65 and spinach pakora (also delicious though very different than pakora I've had at India Garden) because I didn't want any of it to go to waste.  We also got the Chicken Chettinad, which was good, though not a favorite.  It was perfectly fine, but the flavors didn't do much for me.  I still ate it all, though!  All in all, a great addition to Lakewood!  Now we have TWO great Indian restaurants in town.  We're looking forward to going back and exploring the menu further!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service! High quality food, nice ambience and friendly staff. You will not be disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"My first visit today for lunch was such an unexpected treat. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Best Indian food I have had in years. The flavors all blended so well. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"We had a lunch at this place on Saturday and had bad experience. The ONE star is for friendly staff and owner. The restaurant claims to be a south Indian restaurant but unfortunately you do not get those  flavors and taste. I am sure most south Indians will not appreciate their taste. The floor is very bad and dirty too. Overall, will not step in next time."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've picked up dinner at Namaste and it was amazing! The owner is there to greet you with a friendly smile and recommend dishes. I got the Pepper Chicken and garlic naan and it was delicious. I highly recommend this place for takeout or dine in, it's got a cozy atmosphere and the staff is excellent!"}
{"text":"We went to here after a long drive from Watkins .. Idly was awesome with Indian chutneys and sambhar .. Chicken biryani is also good .. Best restaurant till date in U.S."}
{"text":"I liked it.  I love Indian food and eat it quite frequently, but this time I went way out of my comfort zone and ordered a dish that was essentially cloves of garlic in a delicious sauce.  I won't even try to spell the name. Anyway it turned out to be shockingly mild for pure garlic and the sauce was delicious.  I'm sure that whatever magic they applied to make such a harsh ingredient so delicious, when applied to more naturally palatable items, would yield even more amazing results.  I was there with a group of about 10 and everyone was more than satisfied with their dishes.   The service was attentive and made sure we all got all the attention we needed. I will be back for sure, though next time I will go for something a little more in my wheelhouse.  Palak Paneer?  Oh yeah."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious. Each dish was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, and and smelled amazing! The staff were friendly and attentive. I can't wait to come back, but right now I might need a nap."}
{"text":"Okay. This was delicious. I was apprehensive to try indian food in Cleveland (simply because I hadn't tried it before!). Wow. I really recommend the Gobi 65 (cauliflower never tasted so good) and palak paneer. Great food. Friendly service. What more could you want? Come on, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I personally believe that this is the best Indian Food in the Cleveland area. I've had other \"quality\" Indian restaurants and they never even come close. Brian is an awesome waiter, he is polite every single time and it's always a pleasure to dine in. It's perfect to me because it's never quite too loud or packed it's always comfy. I love the briyani! Freshest I've ever had, also the naan which is great always. I've tried multiple curries and I've yet to have one that left me unsatisfied. The spices are not overbearing and it always tastes just right and balanced. This is my standard now and I recommend it highly. Service 10/10 Food 10/10"}
{"text":"Before I even get to the food, the service here is top notch. When I asked a question about a dish, one of the waiters (who ended up being the owner) asked if I had any food allergies. I told him that I do not, but I do have some dietary restrictions. He sat down at the table with us and asked me a few questions to make sure he fully understood what I could and couldn't have, and then recommended some dishes that he thought I might like. I found the way he went about the whole situation extremely helpful and courteous.   So, I ended up trying a spicy goat dish (Sry i can't remember the name) which was absolutely delicious. The only thing I didn't like is that there were no vegetables. It consisted of meat with a perfectly spicy sauce and some rice. That being said, I took leftovers home and ate twice off of that one meal! So needless to say, the portions are definitely generous.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes traditional Indian food or is in the mood to try something new. Also, one of the members of our group was a picky eater and was still able to find something she liked. They do have some more \"normal\" foods for the person who isn't quite as adventurous. If you really like spicy food, this is a must. They have a 1-10 heat scale for their spicy dishes. I can handle a lot of heat and the 6 that I ordered was hot enough to loosen the sinuses but not enough to mask the taste of my food. Perfect!"}
{"text":"You can always tell when people care about their jobs, their food, and their customer service. Namaste has given me one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a long time.   I can't get over how great this restaurant is, or how great my experience here was. I had the perfect birthday dinner here.  My boyfriend and I came here around 7pm on a Wednesday and there were not that many people in the restaurant. We were EXTREMELY well taken care of by both a waiter and the manager, who repeatedly came over to answer our questions about the menu, refill our water (I drink a LOT of water and my glass was never empty), and asked how our food was or what they could do for us.   Each menu item is made for you, based on the spice level you request (1-10). The food is DELICIOUS! I am not super familiar with how authentic Indian food is, or if this was authentic or not...but this was amazing. I got the Chicken Curry and the prices were very reasonable for a large amount of food. The garlic naan and white rice that came with the meal was delicious as well.   It seems like a lot of people come here for takeout, but the inside of the restaurant was really nice. I have literally no complaints and would recommend this restaurant, and I have to many of my friends.   I will definitely be back for some wonderful Indian food by a staff and manager that legitimately care about their service, customers, and food."}
{"text":"The food was beyond our expectations. So flavorful. My husband was also very pleased that they could vary the level of spiciness  because he always likes things very spicy and they delivered! Huge portions. Naan was so fresh and warm. We will be going back..."}
{"text":"Not very great place. We read reviews and went for this place but didn't like it at all. Main course items were still ok but appetizers were pathetic. We ordered Gobi 65 and veg platter and both of them were taste less.."}
{"text":"Everything that I've had from here has been amazing.  This is my new favorite Indian spot. It's much less Americanized than most Indian joints.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food and impeccable service. Everyone was friendly from the owner to the server and manager who checked on the table. We had butter chicken and a lamb dish both amazing. They let you decide your level of spice from 1-10 which is cool because I've realized everyone's medium is different. Fresh cilantro on the dishes made them even better. I tend to shy away from desserts that are unfamiliar but we opted for fried little fritters in honey sauce that were very good. Highly suggest you try this place, we for sure will be back."}
{"text":"This one is Located on Detroit road in Lakewood across Lakewood hospital is known for the southern Indian cuisine. Reasonable price for the quantity but hit or miss on the quality.  The service was quick and friendly.  Kids enjoyed the warm and soft idli but not so much the soft and slightly soggy vadas. The sambar was fine but not the chutney. The gobi 65 was colorful, crispy and flavorful.  Coming to the main course Nan's were soft if eaten when warm. The chicken dum biriyani was tasty but I prefer the one from India delight. The chicken chettinad, the reason for going to the restaurant in the first place was a letdown. Too much gravy without the chettinad flavor and the chicken was stale. Overall a hit or miss place with a benefit of doubt."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find an Indian place that cooks South Indian food. Not only does Namaste offer the dishes that my South Indian-born husband craves (idly, sambar, dosa, biryani), they do them WELL. Very authentic taste and the service was phenomenal. The dining room had a nice comfortable atmosphere. We came in the afternoon and were served by Ryan, who is also the manager. He went above and beyond with suggestions and checking with the kitchen about ingredients. I appreciated that the menu is clearly marked when items are vegan and/or gluten free. I had rasam soup (very spicy but yummy) and dal tadka and my husband had chicken biryani and a chapati that he ate with my dal. This place knows what they are doing, even serving the biryani with fresh red onion slices, lemon and a hard boiled egg, they way it's traditionally served in South India. FYI, the chicken in the biryani is on the bone, not cut into chunks. The dal was good and my husband felt the chapati was very well executed. We will be back to eat in or to take out for sure!"}
{"text":"Namaste is quite good; I've been here several times for lunch given that I work close by, and would rate it as my favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland that I've been to thus far. I was pleased to see a South Indian place go up in Lakewood, given that most of what you encounter by way of Indian food is North Indian, particularly in any medium sized city. I also appreciate their offering of Indo-Chinese dishes, which are also not prevalent in the plethora of cuisine in most towns. Their chettinads are full of flavor and absolutely delicious (I would recommend the goat), and I've always had very friendly service. They've got a great menu selection, and I've yet to try anything here that I haven't liked."}
{"text":"As a big connoisseur of Indian food, this place makes it right. The well known and famous chicken 65 that is fried and covered in amazing Indian spices, chilies, and herbs was very delicious. It was the best chicken appetizer I ever had. Chicken pepper fry was amazing, the butter garlic Naan was so good. They give you so much Rice! I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Ate there on Sunday November 23rd 2014. Space is bright, warm colors and welcoming staff. Extremely clean and crisp. The staff was very helpful with the menu which is large. There is no lunch time buffet so be prepared for that. Tried the dosa (huge and tasty, good for two or three people to share), the garlic soup (never had a more savory garlic soup), an eggplant dish and a chicken dish. My wife and I have eaten a lot of egglplant and chicken at Indian restaurants but nothing like this. The eggplants were whole and slightly charred. The chicken was thoroughly sauced. The service was excellent, water always filled and helpful explaining the menu. If you like heat this place will more than satisfy."}
{"text":"Very, very good! We started with potato banji appetizer. It was very delicious!  The minty dipping sauce was so good I almost Licked it clean! I got the Methi Chicken plate! It was very savory and the chicken was amazing! Hubby got the aanji chicken! His was a bit spicier but was really good!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've gotta get something outta the way first, I don't really know shit about Indian cuisine. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't expect me to be comparing my experience to \"that time I was in Mumbai\" or with \"the lamb I had that was baked inside a hole in the desert sand in Pakistan\". Don't get me wrong, I've had my share of chicken tiki masala and curry sauce on various meats, I just won't be diving that deeply here.  Namaste India Garden reminds me of what Aladdin's would be like if they did Southern Indian food. The atmosphere is comfortable in that stripmall'y sort of way and the dining area is brightly lit with light from the big front windows. It's clean and decorated with Indian artwork (I'm guessing).  I don't know what makes this different from Northern Indian food, but that's what they supposedly specialize in here. I really didn't recognize any of the dishes on the menu using familiar words like \"chicken\" and various vegetables to guide my choices. There are also helpful descriptions underneath each of the dishes and when we asked our server for recommendations he was more than happy to assist.  On the service side of things, no complaints to offer up. We were immediately greeted with a smile when we walked in the door and our server was both attentive and friendly.  We started with the Punugulu (deep fried lentil balls). These little golden brown goodies were something I could snack on for hours. I Didn't find the actual balls themselves to be all that flavorful, but the two sauces served with them - a coconut curry and tomato chutney) were delicious. A single serving is shareable.  Next we shared the Rasam soup. This was like a very spicy vegetable-based broth. Incredibly salty and loaded with spices. If you don't like heat in your food, you should probably stay away from this.  Before I delve too deeply into our entrees, I've got to mention something. The entrees, all of which come with jasmine rice, are more than enough for 2-3 people, especially if you get Naan (which you should). Just keep this in mind when you're ordering. We opted for two entrees because we wanted the leftovers. Moving on.  Get the bread, you'll need it with the sauces. We got the garlic naan. A bit more like crispy flatbread than the chewey pita-like stuff I'm used to, but still damn good. I really liked the charred, crispy bits, too.  My wife, not a fan of heat, went with the Palak Paneer. It's a slightly sweet spinach sauce (thought I tasted some coconut in it) served over little cubes of Paneer cheese. The cheese's texture reminded me of firm tofu and it didn't really have all that much flavor on its own. The sauce was very tasty, though, and made for a nice Naan dip.  I ordered the Lamb Chettinad. Bits of lamb in a thick, stew-like sauce. I loved the flavors, so complex and filled with big spices, but the lamb was a bit of a disappointment - chewy, fatty and not all that tender. I don't think I'd order this one again.  If I had one gripe it would be with the choice of serving vessels for the main courses. They used these boat-shaped, shallow curvy things, both of which were filled to overflowing - literally. Sure, they look fancy, but not all that practical for sloppy, saucy foods. Bowls people. bowls.  Well, that's about it. My first foray into Southern Indian food was a pretty successful one. Aside from the misstep with the lamb, everything was delicious, plentiful and crammed with flavor.  P.S. The music was a little strange. If I remember it was some sort of top 40 crap. Call me silly, but shouldn't ethnic places have some ethnic music in the background?"}
{"text":"This place was aweeeessssommmmmmme! And I'm not just saying that because they have a ton of vegan options (but I mean come on, huge plus!) The food here was incredible, and really reasonably priced! I went with my boyfriend on a whim and was not disappointed. I highly recommend the spinach pakora appetizer. I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered it but man was I impressed. My curry was amazing too, and the portions were pretty big so I ended up getting lunch the next day out of it too!"}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. They have a wonderful selection of vegan entrees and they're all really tasty."}
{"text":"GREAT Southern Indian food. I've been a big fan of India Garden's other restaurant in Lakewood, going to the lunch buffet there for several years on a weekly basis and loving it. But not until today have I tried Namaste and I'm really glad I did!  We ordered two dishes to share, the goat chettinad, and Bagara Baingan (eggplant), plus garlic naan and rasam soup. The soup was AMAZING. They were even nice enough to bring us two bowls when we were sharing one order of it. The Naan was the best I've ever had. So much garlic!  The serving sizes were pretty big, not huge, but enough to have a little left over since most Indian dishes are very rich. I could've eaten the whole thing, but I knew I would be uncomfortably full.   The prices were reasonable, a little higher than I usually like to pay, around $15 for a meat dish and a little less for vegetarian. After two entrees, naan and soup, plus tax and tip it was $44 for two people. Not terrible, but not an every day outing. I could sure eat it every day though!  The service was superb. Very nice people."}
{"text":"The reviews do not lie, I am from jersey and have been to atleast 100 southern Indian restaurant over the course of last 5 years but this one beats all of them.  The ingredients are very very fresh and the staff is fantastic, go there to eat uttapam and idlis (they are the most soft idlis) I have had in a while.  The place is legit and will surely go again when in Cleveland:) keep up the great work !!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! We enjoyed the dosa & butter chicken. Recommend to others, especially if you're looking for Southern Indian food."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Northeast Ohio. Indian is my favorite food and I have gone to SEVERAL restaurants in downtown, outside of the city, etc... this is by far the best I've had. The servers are knowledgeable about the menu and service is really good!"}
{"text":"Nice food. Tried rava dosa and veg biryani, both were good"}
{"text":"Namaste is such a great addition to the Lakewood area! Incredible south Indian food- my favorites are the masala dosa, which is huge & easily shared between 2-3 people, and the palak paneer. Just as with India Garden you can order your food as mild or spicy as you like, on a scale from 1-10. The service is always excellent. My water glass was never empty! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very pleasant.  It's nicely decorated and very clean. The service is excellent.  Staff did a great job of explaining the menu and making recommendations. The garlic naan is was delicious as was the vegetable chettinad. So many vegetarian and vegan choices!"}
{"text":"I went to Namaste when they first opened with the Cleveland Supper Club and if I recall correctly we all enjoyed our experience. I decided to get take-out recently and I was not disappointed.   I really enjoy their Garlic Naan, it's soft and you can see the chunks of garlic. Their Butter Chicken dish is right up my alley as well, also big enough for 2-3 meals depending on your appetite. The yogurt sauce in their Dahi Vada appetizer is awesome, but I did not like the \"donuts\" that came with it. The Gobi 65 was tasty seasoned and fried cauliflower (I dipped them into the yogurt sauce mentioned above).  Namaste and India Garden are sister restaurants so expect the same quality and customer service. Namaste serves Southern Indian cuisine and India Garden takes care of the Northern Cuisine."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Love the gobi manchurian! Perfect blend of spices and crispy deliciousness!  100% worth the drive from the east side!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  I really enjoyed the vindaloo. Also, be sure to order the mango lassi. Wish I had discovered this place while I still lived in Lakewood, but it's probably still worth the trip across town since it's not easy to find good Indian food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We loved it. They were very helpful when it came to picking out our menu choices. Food was great. Clean. Friendly. A+."}
{"text":"I used to leave in Cleveland. I could not find  a good authentic Indian restaurant till yesterday. I yelped Indian restaurant and I saw good reviews. I gave it a try. Food was delicious.I loved a environment. Hosts are so polite and caring. If you like indian food, you should try this place. Chicken biryani tasted delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hakka noodles as a pick up order. When I got home to my surprise they looked pretty mushy. I tasted them and both the shrimp and noodles were over cooked. The dish also taste very bland. I tried to salvage it by adding some Indian spices that I had in my cabinet but I wound up tossing then entire dish. Very disappointing. I'll stick with the original India garden down the road."}
{"text":"Nice quaint joint! Authentic...amazing flavors. Service was great also. Even if you don't know Indian cuisine, definitely need to try it! You will be hooked!! Love love love this place. Will definitely be back. Great for take out too :) Thanks for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Nice Indian restaurant in Lakewood.  I had the rava masala dosa.  It's about 12$ but the dosa is huge!  You could definitely get two meals out of it.  In fact I'm looking forward to eating the other half for breakfast tomorrow.  I only tried the idli and dosa.  I think this place is known for its South Indian cuisine.  Theres ample metered street parking that's free on weekends.  If you're here stop by Lakewood Park, less than a mile away to see great views of downtown cle across the Lake."}
{"text":"Best biryani I have had in Cleveland.  I have had A LOT of biryani in my life (Hyderbad, Doha, etc).  Service is wonderful."}
{"text":"Hm. So bummed with 75 percent of my experience here, especially after reading so many positive comments.  So let's start with the good. Service was prompt and our waiter was attentive. Thumbs up too for the recommendation on an appetizer.  He recommended a cauliflower dish which was delicious and spicy, definitely not something I would have gotten on my own.  Then there's the not so good...I ordered chicken korma which is a fave of mine at many an Indian restaurant. It was not good here. The sauce tasted not great like it was out of a jar. Frankly, if I wanted something out of a jar I could have done that at home. I asked for medium and it was pretty effing spicy. I had to order a pop to help ease the spice. And for the cost, it was pretty unenjoyable. And naan is $3 for one large piece."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered tasted great! Everything was spot on. The cauliflower with the mint sauce was delicious. Can't wait to return and try something different!"}
{"text":"So I'm a little late on trying Indian food in Lakewood, but if this is how the food taste at their sister restaurant down the street, then I've been missing out.  We went with three dishes suggested by the owner and they were all amazing. You can never go wrong with a lamb dish. We had the Lamb Chettinad which had a sweet and spicy flavor. I could go just this dish alone."}
{"text":"The food and service here was excellent! The palak paneer was probably one of my favorite iterations of the dish I've ever had! Wonderful flavor with enough spice to notice but not overpower. Great atmosphere, friendly service. A great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy. Saw high praise for this place on yelp and happy to have finally tried it. The Indian food I had was outstanding and as a man of Indian descent, I consider myself an expert in the matter.   Going against my carnivorous instincts, I ordered the palak paneer off the vegetarian entree list. I had a hankering for some cubes of cheese and this dish exceeded my expectations. The palak or spinach curry was deliciously rich and creamy. Definitely not for those on a diet or counting calories - you could see the cream just from the light green color of the curry - but damn it was fantastic.  Trump's Taste of Kerala and Tandul in terms of taste. Will be back here again."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Lakewood. The service is excellent. The pricing is reasonable and the food is authentic and amazing. The Chicken Tika Masala is just the right amount of spicy, plenty of rice comes with it and I always order a side of naan which comes as two huge pieces lightly toasted and perfect for dipping into the yummy sauces. You will leave this place planning your next visit. Hope it lasts as the last 3 places in that location did not fare well. I have a feeling this place is safe."}
{"text":"One of the best place that offers Indian food. They serve Southern Indian food.  The food was tasty and perfect. The waiters were very caring and friendly.  I would definitely comw back again."}
{"text":"I love namaste! Always great service, food quality and quantity! My favorite appetizers are the chicken 65 and chicken lollipops. Lots of flavor in a small package. I've tried most other dishes and they are all great! The heat scale they use is very accurate in my opinion. The employees have been there for a while and it seems that they take good care of them. Everyone is so so so friendly! Usually the owner greets you in the front and takes you to your table. It creates a really nice personal connection. You usually see a lot of Indian families eating here so you know it's good!  If you like Indian food you will LOVE namaste."}
{"text":"A couple of friends went here with me on a Sunday afternoon. We all ordered different dishes and they were all delicious. I'd never been anywhere with Southern Indian food before, but the guy who served us was incredibly helpful and gave me an idea of dishes that I might like based on some Northern Indian food I said I had liked. It's relatively inexpensive and definitely worth what you pay!"}
{"text":"We ordered baby corn Manchuria ,poori and veg biriyani .Everything was really good especially Delicious poori curry and friendly staff.I will definitely go back and eat again."}
{"text":"Our server Ryan was amazing.  The food was amazing.  It as fast and hot.  Super big fan of Indian cuisine, this is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had lunch on a Sunday afternoon and had the place to myself. What a crime! The restaurant is beautiful, the staff were great, and the food was everything I'd expect from India Garden. Most delicious Naan. Perfectly seasoned entree. Now that I'm moving back to Lakewood I'll be going here a lot!"}
{"text":"Great Southern Indian style cuisine paired with a passionate staff!  If you are looking for melt your face off spicy, try their sister restaurant down the road, India Garden around the corner from Vosh in Lakewood, it has Northern Indian chefs.   This place is all about slowly simmered spices that pack flavor more than heat, and is really well known for their Dosa, specific to the southern parts of India, and the Gobi Cauliflower is a great starter.  Really anything you get you can't go wrong, but the Goat Korma was a favorite.  Throw on BYO wine, and this place is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Well....The Gobi 65 is a must, they are crispy florettes of cauliflower marinated in some kind of masala sauce. Chicken Korma, Butter Shrimp, and Aloo Gobi are a couple favorites of mine that I highly recommend. It's little pricey compared to other Indian restaurants/buffets however, it is worth it. Maybe for a special night out with friends or a date. They don't have wine or liquor, but there is beer here =) Thankful for this Indian Restaurant in Lakewood...Namaste =)"}
{"text":"Probably the best medu vada sambar I've had in the US! Must visit for a south Indian breakfast fan"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat in Lakewood. The food is amazing and the service is great. The food comes out pretty fast and always tastes great no matter the spice level you choose. They have a good variety of vegetarian and vegan options which is great."}
{"text":"Ever since Charkha closed, we've been searching for a replacement.  Happy to report the search is over!  This place is awesome.  We shared the gobi 65 appetizer which was fantastic.  We also shared a rasam soup which was great and a dosa which was the best dosa I've ever eaten.  For entrees (I know.  We seriously pigged out) I had a vegetable chettinad and the husband had a chicken dish.  The chettinad was delicious with a very nice kick to it.  The only downside to the restaurant is that they don't serve alcohol, but there is a place across the street where you can get beer and bring it to the restaurant.  For me, this is hands down the best Indian in Ctown.  I literally cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"\"Sadoken mein uchhaal\"   literally translates to sh!tting in the streets.  That might be a common practice in Ahmedabad but in Lakewood the mousey suburban, yoga types and Millennials hardened by living on the mean streets of \"Hingetown\" and \"Gordon Square\" would never come through if it were to named that...so Namaste it is.  Safe, and suburban.  Got takeaway here a few times.  Had the Vindaloo (thanks, Ramones c.1978), Naan and fish curry.  All were \"on point\" and fresh.  I am more used to the British/Indian styles like Bhuna, bail naan and the like but this suites me fine.  Not sure if this is Northern Indian or Southern Indian.  I will let the others mull it over when they showing how worldly they are sipping their locally sourced IPAs.."}
{"text":"Had dinner with s group of friends and one of the waiters had to go home due to illness. Ryan provided excellent service despite being short handed! He also provided wonderful explanation of the menu. Thank you for an enjoyable dinner, Ryan!"}
{"text":"Words fail to describe the food served here! Service was fast and food delicious. The chef Guna Saravanan, even came met us, was extremely kind and asked us how the food was. Mark was so patient with our requests and helped us make the right order.  The ambience friendly and exquisite.  A Thursday afternoon lunch felt like a Sunday brunch, and only a handful of places can give that feel!  Must go :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. We visited here for a work lunch today and it would have been impossible to get better service. The managers were incredibly friendly and easily conveyed the intricacies of the menu. We tres various lamb and chicken dishes with naan that was to die for. I will surely go back and hope the manager know that the Coast Guard in Cleveland appreciates him and his business!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary food from appetizers to entrees. All four of us who have dined together over many ethnic foods in many cities thought it to be authentically delicious. Goat korma, goat chettinad, lamb vindaloo and masala dosa were perfectly spiced. Naan was scrumptious.  Our server, an Irish chap, provided spot-on advice and made the meal even more enjoyable. One caveat: we found the punugalu a bit plain for our taste."}
{"text":"There is quite a dearth of good Indian or Pakistani restaurants in Cleveland. Since I live in Lakewood I decided to check out Namaste Indian Garden having heard decent things about it. Suffice to say, I will not be recommending this place to anyone.  1) we ordered the chicken biryani and mirchi chicken and requested it be spicy. The waiter insisted a level 2-3 was spicy enough which is what we proceeded to order. On arrival, it was bland, lacked flavor and worst of all was cold. Not luke warm, but cold.  2) I live masala dosa. And, you'd wonder how could anyone get that wrong? Well you can when you bring out a dosa that's clearly been sitting out for sometime ie soft and cold.   When I complained about it to the owner, he brought us a new masala dosa but then came to our table and said to my friend - It's best not to deal with \"mad\" women.   Nope, definitely driving all the way to Beachwood to Choolah next time I'm craving home food."}
{"text":"It's really nice to have a different style of Indian as an option in town. With southern Indian specialties on the menu, I found a lot of flavors and textures that I've not found around these parts before. Service is already polished and we got our food quickly. I'll be back to try more new-to-me items soon."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Indian restaurant since moving to CLE. This places as awesome chicken tikka masala (butter chicken) and garlic naan! We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, mourning the loss of my favorite south Indian place, and this place has filled the void quite nicely.  The first time I went, I tried goat chettinad for the first time in my life. The portion was large, and made sense given the price. They had fluffy, delicious Naan bread. The most remarkable thing was how legitimately friendly the staff was. I didn't feel like someone off the street- I had been there for 10 minutes and felt like a regular.  The second time I ordered off the \"Indo-Chinese\" menu, specifically Gobi cauliflower. I could eat that every day, without hesitation.  The price is a bit stiff, but for the quality of product and service you get, it makes all the sense in the world."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Cleveland. There are plenty of Indian places in the area that are good but this is the only non-vegetarian South Indian restaurant in northeast Ohio. I lived in India for 3 years and can attest that this place is not only delicious but completely authentic. Sooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first night dining in at namaste, and it was a great dining experience. Our waiter, Ryan, was very attentive and friendly. The owner was also very friendly and checked in on our table a few times. The food came out at a great time, and was perfect. Good temp, great flavor. I couldn't stop thinking about how good it was after I left! I will definitely be back and I will be sure to order come carry out soon.   SO GOOD"}
{"text":"The Gobi 65 and the Maysore masala dosa was delicious. However, did not like the shrimp biriyani. The decor was nice, and service was good!"}
{"text":"Gross. Worst Indian I have ever had. Cold bone in chicken thighs in my Biryani is not cool."}
{"text":"Best southern Indian cuisine in the Cleveland area. Authentic as it gets here.  Might seem pricey but for what you actually get its fair. Two entrées, rice and some nan might run you $32 but when you take into account the portion size and quality, it is well worth it."}
{"text":"They had awesome rasmalai. We recommend paneer chettinad which we had for the first time. It was spicy n awesome. It was great experience"}
{"text":"More recently opened and serving more South Indian food.. Including delicious dosas! I had the Rava masala with a perfect coconut chutney. We also enjoyed the Gobi 65. Service was very friendly too. Would definitely recommend this spot! No liquor license so you'd have to go to their other location for that ;)"}
{"text":"Wow.  This is my favorite place to eat in Lakewood.  I am a vegetarian and order the Gobi Manchurian every single time, because there's no better dish anywhere.   I introduced my co-workers to it, now almost everyone (mostly carnivores) order this same cauliflower dish because it's so delicious.  There's nothing else like it.  The staff is very friendly and the food is to die for. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I walked in to Namaste almost on a whim- we were hungry and craving Indian food! From the minute we walked in, we were immediately hit with a very strong smell of spices. We started off by ordering the Gobi 65, which was delicious! I ordered the Vegetable Curry, with garlic naan. My fiancee ordered the palaak paneer. Both dishes were delicious and very filling- we went home with a little bit of both. The vegetable curry was a little spicier than I typically like, but still very delicious. My fiancee said that the palaak paneer wasn't as spicy as she would like, but it still tasted good. I also ordered a Sprite, which was very syrupy and not very carbonated.  The bathrooms were well maintained and clean. All of the staff was friendly. Overall, it was a fantastic meal and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I ordered and loved the butter chicken marsala and garlic naan. My husband ordered the shrimp vindaloo and it was amazing too. The waiter was so nice and helpful, we were both new to Indian cuisine. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend.   6 of us went and not a pleasant experience;  Lack of services;  Noisy; over smelling of food cooking;  worst Rava Masala Dosa and onion dosa and rubbery gobi manchurian testing like tomato ketchup; Sambhar was sweet. Prices comparing to other south Indian places high.  It may be ok for a non Indian to go and enjoy but being an Indian and foodie u would rather go to other places which has much better testing food."}
{"text":"AMAZING food! SO helpful! We had aloo bondas and Poori Curry.  We are vegan and they were very accommodating! Lots of meat entrees as well for the meat lovers. Spacious dining room and brightly painted colors. Definitely making this our go to Indian restaurant! Staff was so kind!   Update: We have since visited weekly, and still get the Poori Curry and Aloo Bondas. They are amazing, but we will soon try other items. The owner, Sunny and the General Manager, Ryan are both amazing and will accommodate to your needs, level of heat in the food, and whatever else you may need! Parking can be found on Detroit Road or on the side streets nearby! South Indian food blows the North Indian out of the park!"}
{"text":"I am not happy with the food which I chose. I ordered chicken briyani and some basic tomato chicken gravy, the briyani is not tasty, it was plain curry rice with chicken chunks and the gravy was very bad."}
{"text":"This is the first time I ordered here. I ordered a pickup order of butter chicken masala with extra rice. I have not dined in before but will Definately do so in the future. The sauce of the masala was great. Great taste, and fast and exceptional customer service. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Two words- eat here. Seriously- really delicious and wonderful, helpful, informative staff/owners. So glad we stumbled upon it!!!! The two chicken curry dishes were amazing and I overheard the manager recommending the cauliflower- so now that's on my food bucket list. Best Indian food I've had in Cleveland, hands down."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second chance and had a much better takeout experience. The food was excellent, and to my great surprise and pleasure, very spicy like I asked for.  I'm writing this like 2 months after the fact so I don't remember exactly what we had, but I had a lamb dish and my wife had a vegetarian dinner with 2 orders of naan.  Fast and friendly service and very tasty Indian food, so I'm happy to upgrade my original review."}
{"text":"Good food, good services. This is coming from 4 very picky foodies. They do both north, and South Indian food; we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. Flavors came together well. We ordered Dosas, chili chicken, noodles, and veggie appetizers."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with this restaurant. AMAZING service. The food was impeccable and any questions regarding the entrees, the staff was more than happy to explain. The food was so good and I am thinking about coming tomorrow too just so I can try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing southern Indian cuisine! Ryan was fantastic and provided exceptional service, and great recommendations. Their butter masala is DELICIOUS. Could not stop eating it. Best Indian food in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Awesome ambience, neat, South Indian food, most important it's CLEAN!! No buffet for lunch, but they have a sister restaurant down the street (?) North Indian, which has a buffet it seems!   Food ordered - idly, pongal , vada, salt lassi, Sambar, chutneys, Rasmalai.   3 people   Large enough portions   The chef as well as the floor staff were awesome!"}
{"text":"I went in on a Saturday afternoon and although the ambience isn't too Indian, the food definitely is! I first ordered for a paneer tikka masala which not only had the right blend and was cooked well, but also had just about the right texture. Only wished I had a bit more to savour.   I then had decided that I had to try the dosas as well and thus went in for a Spring Dosa. Although it was not what I expected, it was a different mix of veggies and the coconut chutney was simply the best!  A highly recommended dine in place if you want to feel what Indian cuisine tastes like :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Namaste India Garden this past Sunday with the family.  We were greeted very warmly and seated right away. Our drinks were delivered to our table very promptly. We were given an adequate amount of time to look over the menu. I was very pleased with our wait time - we did not have to wait more than 15 minutes for our food. I split the Quail Masala with my sister - very nice flavor! If you're really hungry, don't share it. And if you don't want to pick out a bunch of little bones, go for a different masala. I also had a bowl of the Rasam Soup, it came out steaming and very spicy - which I love!! My mom ordered the Dosa with paneer - it came with three very different and very delicious dipping sauces and the dosa was huge! We ordered two desserts: the Rasmalai - cottage cheese dumplings soaked in sweetened milk and sprinkled with cardamom and the Gulab Jumun - milk balls dipped in honey syrup. Both desserts were delicious and all four of us got a taste (which was all we needed after all the delicious spiced of our meal)."}
{"text":"I'm already a huge fan of India Garden, so I had a feeling that this restaurant, which has the same ownership, would be a great addition to the Lakewood restaurant scene, too. I was right!  The portions are very large, and like India Garden, not cheap. But totally worth the value. We started with Gobi 65, which are like chicken wings, but made with cauliflower instead of chicken. A great alternative to a game-night appetizer for those who want to be a little bit healthier.  Then we split the traditional southern India cuisine, a dosa. The owner was walking around making recommendations. We were leaning toward the Mysore Masala Dosa, and he recommended the Rava Masala Dosa because it's crispier. It wasn't very crispy, so I wonder how the Mysore one would be. But the filling was delicious - potato and peas, I believe.  We also got an order of the Navaratna Korma, per the owner's recommendation. Delicious. This may have been my favorite thing we ordered. Mild and manageable for the non-spicy eaters. Of course, we also had garlic naan, one of the best I've ever had (super garlic-y). We were completely stuffed with the three orders, probably could have done without an appetizer.   Check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I love Indian food and they are super good! Also I love to see the owner around to make sure everything's fine hehehe."}
{"text":"Love the place, spicy spicy food, kind service.  Want to try everything."}
{"text":"Awesome stuff for a new place! The paneer chettinad is a must try. The other chef's specials are brilliant as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and authentic.  I've had the butter chicken and the chili chicken.  We either take out and eat in here on a weekly basis.  Very friendly staff too!  So happy to have this in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My SO and I ate here recently...and were blown away! The owner found out that it was our 1st time there, came over, and gave us some info on the food, with a smile.  We loved everything, especially the spinach pakora. Outstanding! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really good buffet we had on a Sunday afternoon.  We went instead of watching the Browns game one Sunday because my wife's brother was in town and he doesn't really do football.  Well, the Browns won, so I guess we should have gone back every week to keep that tradition up.  Food was really good and fresh - which is most important with buffets."}
{"text":"Stellar service. Great dosa and sambhar. All South Indian delicacies are worth trying. I have tried naan and curry but the best dishes are any of dosa."}
{"text":"This is India Garden crew's take on Southern Indian cuisine. I came here with my dad and vegan brother and enjoyed every dish that they brought out. Both lamb dishes were excellent. The dosa was super large and looked like a giant burrito. They did a great job renovating the restaurant. It is a far cry from The Highlander restaurant which was the surrounding retirement communities favorite restaurant back in the early 90's."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They have plenty of vegetarian dishes and the Paneer Chana Masala was awesome! The staff was super attentive which was refreshing. We were planning our next visit before we even left. You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"I've got to say this is my favorite Indian place, and probably my favorite Lakewood restaurant at the moment. Unfortunately, I can't come here everyday because it's a little too expensive for that. Both times I have been here I ordered the Andhra Chicken Curry. I'm not sure what makes it Southern Indian, but it's a lot like most chicken curry dishes that I have had in the past, just much better. Both times I have been here I tried a different appetizer. First we tried the Masala Dosa which you can see in the pictures. It's a big rolled crepe. The Masala one had potatoes and other veggies inside. It came with dipping sauces and was awesome. The second time I came here we had the vegetable cutlet. It looks like an egg roll but was a very delicate fried vegetable roll. This was also delicious. Also, you must get the naan with your meal.   The service is great as well. I've been coming here for Sunday brunch and they serve the dinner menu at that time. I could probably come here more often if I just go during the lunch menu. I just wish this place was closer to my place of work."}
{"text":"Fried cauliflower appetizer is amazing! Biryani is always solid, the lamb biryani has been one of our favorites. Portions of the biryani are huge, so it'll be well worth your money."}
{"text":"We went on Sunday evening & order stuff came in or less then 20 mins & food is fresh & hot. Chicken 65 is better then most of the other Indian restaurants. Chicken dum biryani was a joke  nothing closed to be called a Dum biryani."}
{"text":"We have made two trips to Namaste so far and I am impressed! As others have noted, we have a dearth of authentic, fresh, and healthy Indian restaurants in Cleveland. Namaste fills that void - and thank goodness!  Everything at Namaste is fresh and flavorful. You will be awash in fragrant spices, but unless you request it to be hot & spicy, the food is served on the mild end of the Scoville scale. But mild, in this case, is not the same as bland.   At Namaste, you can taste the individual spices at play in your dish: amchoor, asafetida, cumin, coriander, and cardamom! You can see the spinach leaves in your Palak Dal and identify the nigella seeds, too. This stands out when you compare it to many Indian restaurants where your dish has been aggressively stewed for hours to the point of being an indistinguishable glob of greasy (but delicious) mess. (Yeah, I'm talking to you Saffron Patch!)   I'll tell you (for the 20th time): you seriously need to try the Gobi 65. Don't mess around. Maybe get two.   I'll look forward to visiting Namaste again and trying some more from the menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is good and there's a lot to choose from, something for everyone. It would be more than a stretch to say that I am a connoisseur of world cuisine. I'm fine with a taco or pizza any day. So I wasn't sure exactly what to order. All I had to do was ask my server and after a couple of questions he got me all squared away with a traditional Andhra chicken curry. I can do hot, but I'm not a masochist so I got a 6 on the spiciness scale and it was perfect. Get some garlic naan and you're good to go!   The staff is very friendly, greeting you when you enter, checking up on you periodically and helpful with recommendations. Even the busser was friendly.  Like a lot of Lakewood spots, parking is on the street, but it's free weekdays after 6 and weekends and holidays. The serving sizes are generous so be prepared to take home some leftovers. Be earth-friendly and bring your own :)"}
{"text":"Verryyy impressed by Namaste's Southern Indian cuisine!  I admit, when I think of Indian food, I often think of your typical Tikka Masala type.  I eat it quite a bit, but that's generally what I think of.  Namaste was refreshing in that it was different!  I brought a large group and we sampled a wide selection of foods.  We looooovveed the South Indian dishes - which we used as appetizers.  The Dahi Vada was indeed a donut in yogurt sauce.  I really liked the Punagalu balls served with coconut and tomato chutney.  There were plenty to share and had a really nice taste.  (and they too tasted great with the yogurt from the Dahi Vada)  For the main entrees, we tried a few of the Kormas and Curry's and the winner was Chettinad.  It had a deep stewey taste and nicely complimented the lamb or goat that we paired it with.  They were all good though!    In short, this may well be my new favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland.  That's saying something!    Service was great and with our larger group they were even happy to split the check.  Bonus points there, Namaste - so thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was great. The servers were very friendly and efficient. I ordered the chicken chettinad and the butter chicken and both dishes were perfect."}
{"text":"So - best Indian food in Cleveland. (west side at least bc I don't venture east often)  The decor is nothing special but the food is worth it and the staff is fantastic (Brian, the manager, waited on us and gave great suggestions and was very attentive overall, but not overbearing - you know the type)   We had the butter chicken, paneer chettinad, garlic naan and spring dosa. Would have to say the chettinad was the winner for me but my date preferred the chicken. I don't think you can screw up naan bc it's just fried bready goodness, and we will probably not have the spring dosa again, although it was good, just too many veggies made it a little much (but the sauces that came with it? Heaven.). My Date had come there before and said the Mysore masala dosa is where it's at.  Just go here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great Indian Restaurant. Friendly, knowledgeable service. Very in sync with spice and flavor preferences. Many gluten free and vegetarian options that taste great (full disclosure I'm an omnivore.)"}
{"text":"D and I came for a Saturday night dinner. It was a cool fall-ish day so we thought Indian food would be nice and warm and perfect for the day. I was pleased to find some dishes I was not familiar with on the menu.  We parked on the side street right by the place and as soon as we got out of the car, we could smell the spices. Smelled so good and I couldn't wait to get in there and start eating! When we started eating, the food was so good and really hit the spot on this cool day.  We started with the Gobi 65 - I had no idea I could love cauliflower so much. Wow. Get this. Just do it. And, definitely use the lemon that it comes with and the sauce.  For our meals I got the Mysore Masala Dosa - impressive, large portion. Wonderful flavors. Had a spice, but not spicy-hot. Warm flavors. So good. Loved it with the white sauce that came with it, but all the sauces were good.  D got the Chicken Chettinad. The flavors were warm and so developed. Went great with the regular naan. I love naan. Naan, naan, naan.  The portions were big enough that we both had lunch for the next day. The whole meal cost about $53. Not too bad for price, seeing that we got enough for lunch too. I will absolutely be back to this place. Frankly, I'm embarassed that it took me this long to try this place out!"}
