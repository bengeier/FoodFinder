{"text":"Terrible place. Should've followed my instinct and left as soon as I smelled the sweaty odour that hits you when you walk in the place. But it was busy so figured it must be good.  We ordered a few of their dishes that were marked spicy but it was bland and the spring rolls were mushy and bland. Never going here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's not a date spot, it's nowhere nice, but the guys that own the place are awesome and it's cheap, fast and satisfying. I work until 2am most nights and I love to stop here on the way home to have something quick and comforting. The only downside is the fact that there's Alot of drunks in so it can get rowdy and the crowd is a bit sketch. But what can you expect at 3am?"}
{"text":"The Pho was amazing! I highly suggest ordering the Shrimp Spring Rolls they have so much flavour, the Beef Stir fry was a little bit too watery for my liking and the Shrimp Pad Thai was good but not amazing if you don't like Peanut Butter sauce. Overall the waitress was friendly and the food was good!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great portions and friendly staff. Couldn't ask for more. Not to say that it was the most amazing experience I have ever had, but I will definitely be there a few more times.   Make sure to try the spring rolls (fried version)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying different restaurants cater to different taste, and Pho Do Thi being a Vietnamese restaurant does not cater to the traditional Vietnamese Palette. I ordered the grilled chicken Com Tam which was actually not grilled by deep fried and the rice was regular full grain jasmine rice and not the proper broken rice as per the namesake of the dish. The Dish lacked any flavour and I could only imagine eating something of this quality if it was 1 AM and I was seriously intoxicated. We also ordered the Pho Dac Biet the staple of any authentic Vietnamese establishment. A Pho broth should have complex flavours/aromas and be full bodied resulting from a days worth of bone marrow simmering in a pot. The Pho here tasted like Sugar water and MSG equivalent to that of an MAMA instant noodle bag - so set your expectations accordingly.  Looking around I saw mostly Non Asian patrons which is fine but this is a clear sign Pho Do Thi  does not cater to the traditional Vietnamese flavors and is more akin to a Manchu Wok dining experience of Westernized Low quality Vietnamese food. Please do not eat this and call it Vietnamese food..."}
{"text":"This ends up being my default pho place in Mississauga, even though I try to venture out. I usually have the house pho (which I enjoy), but I've also tried the spring rolls, vermicelli noodle bowls, etc. My friend ordered a dish with rice and giant shrimp, and they were definitely giant! Good spot for lunch, quick and friendly service, affordable."}
{"text":"As a late night pho spot, this is probably one of the better ones in Mississauga.  If i was to rate this place as a overall pho place i would give it a 3. I've tried a few others and I've chose to come back to this one every single time for late night pho. If you were looking for another lunch spot there is better pho places. This place is advertised as viet, thai, and chinese but i havent tried anything but the pho 101 special and the meat rolls here.  The Pho broth is pretty normal.  With the large i got a lot of meat. I like to eat my pho by putting a bit of noodles on my spoon and dipping my meat in sauce and putting it on top.  Most places I will run out of meat and have a lot of noodles left but here the meat portion is much better.  The meatrolls here arent to my liking but they aren't bad. Theres only a few spots in Mississauga and one in Brantford where i do like the rolls.  I like my rolls packed with meat and little to no vegies in them and they need to have the right crispyness and crunch."}
{"text":"Pho met my expectations.  Good flavor and quick service.  Ambiance is so-so.  Staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Each ingredient in their Tonkinese soup is very rich in flavor.Especially the broth.The recipe itself is, in my opinion, the best one compared to their competition. The staff are super friendly and accommodating, always in a good mood.  I recommend this establishment for any occasion!"}
{"text":"This is the after math of our last meal here with them.... I mostly finish my pho cause I love it but today somehow it's main content was noodles I like meat veggies and some soup... Very disappointed with them..... Good bye to this location ..."}
{"text":"Excellente soupe tonkinoise au boeuf saignant, pour un prix modique (8,50$) Le bouillon est vraiment excellent, salé et goûteux.   Le service est charmant, l'endroit est situé bien en vue sur st-denis en face du pavillon A de l'UQAM, donc accessible aux étudiants. Ils prennent la carte débit, donc pas de stress pour le paiement.  Je n'ai pas grand chose a rajouter puisqu'une bonne tonki, c'est une bonne tonki ;)"}
{"text":"Good pho! Their prices used to be lower a few years ago but I guess after their renovation they may have had to increase prices. This didn't stop me from continuing to visit them though. The best thing about them is their hours of operation, they close at 4AM!! It's nice to be able to get some comfort food any time at night. I only go to them for their spicy shrimp pho since the broth is so good! I didn't like the quality of beef they use, it tasted a bit like paper on the first occasion and then I gave it a shot during a separate visit and this time it was too fatty but no flavour."}
{"text":"Always down for some viet cuisine during my break! I had the vermicelli + grilled chicken + spring roll. The vegetable soup as an appetizer was quite delicious, and the prices are very decent. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We tried this place since it is one of the late night joints. However, we are sorely disappointed. The food is far from Thai food. They have barely two or three dishes of Chinese but just for namesake.   The food we ordered was under cooked and lacked taste. There was barely any chicken in the chicken dishes and the vegetables were not cooked. Pad Thai noodles were al dente and they were not properly stir fried with the sauce and the rest of the dish.   Waste of time and money since we had to throw away all the food. I would prefer to stay hungry all night or eat at Burger King (which I dont prefer) instead of eating here again.   Not recommended!"}
{"text":"Une excellent endroit pour manger une bonne soupe, ce petit restaurant deviendra assurement un de mes spot pref pour l'hiver ! Une bonne soupe chaude pour se rechauffer cest toujours plaisant !!!"}
{"text":"I don't like this place. Such low quality of food. Only good thing is there bubble tea."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times and I love it most days  but today was not one  of those days .  Our server had the worst demeanor possible. He gave off the sense \"my family owns this place so I don't care how I treat you\"   The food came out quickly which is why I gave it 2 stars  but the spring rolls didn't taste fresh and seemed like they came out of a box ....im pretty sure they were stale or freezer burnt  Also when my plate came it had a loose hair on it   He never came to give the bill we had to go to the front and even when I was paying our server never made eye contact with either of us once and seemed like he would rather be ANYWHERE else on the planet than serving us  Worst part is I was on a date so it would have been nice for this to have gone ALOT  better"}
{"text":"Super nourriture, prix et service! La serveuse (qui semble être la propriétaire) est tout simplement adorable. Le service est rapide et courtois. Le pho est délicieux, et un gros plus pour le apportez votre vin. J'y retournerai pour essayer les autres plats!"}
{"text":"Opened untill 6am this place is the GO-TO pho place for late night snack/munchies.  The prices are fantastic, food is well done and staff very friendly.  Food: most items on the pmenu priced between 8-12, the portions are average. The food is super flavourfull, a little on the salty side but always served hot.  The only down comment i have is regarding their spring rolls being unnormally small.  They dont use the regular meat balls in pho, so there is a bit of  change from the regular 99 chain pho places.  The drinks arent perfect but they're only 3.75   Service: is great the servers don't seem to know very muvh English but they are very friendly!   Atmosphere: clean!! They clean the place very well and it looks like its very well taken care of, staff was pretty great and making sure everything is tidy which i loved.  In all, this place is amazing and I highly reccomend it and will be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed this place. The menu is well priced and service, excellent. i look forward to going back there again."}
{"text":"We went to this place because of their opening hours. The food was alright but their cane shrimp and meat balls had WAY too much food colouring."}
{"text":"Depuis le temps que je travaille dans le coin il était plus que temps pour moi d'essayer les restos du secteur.  Très bonne soupe tonkinoise au boeuf, service rapide, ils ont même une salle en arrière lors des midis trop achalandés (on a l'impression d'être dans le back store, sans le look back store).  Je vais certainement y retourner."}
{"text":"This placed was packed on a Thursday night with a combination of tourists, students, and a few locals. They were able to accommodate a large party without issues. We ordered a combination of pho (noodle soups) as well as their grilled meats. The pho was very good, easily able to hold its own compared to those in Los Angeles and New York. The grilled pork and beef were a tad too sweet for my taste.  Service was friendly but a little slow, perhaps due to the large dinner crowd. All in all, a fine choice."}
{"text":"Dined here last evening around 8pm with a girlfriend of mine - food was really tasty and hot! & came very quickly... but unfortunately the service was terrible. We waited a long time and no menu came so we grabbed one ourselves! We were never asked if we'd like to order another beverage besides the tea you're given - and when we brought this to their attention we still weren't asked if we'd like something else! Not sure if it was just an off day for them but based on the service I wouldn't go back - but food was awesome !"}
{"text":"This place is getting worse. The pho smelled bad and was so small in terms of meat quantity. The soup had too much smelly yellow fat and diagusted me. Worst pho ever. I used to love this place tho."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and forgot to write a review on this place. This place has been here for more than 10 years and is still running great.  I'm super happy that they finally extended and renovated the place. It has a modern feel to and is a lot more spacious so you don't have to share tables anymore.   Food is bang for your buck. This place is a mom and pop restaurant and they take pride in their work. Their soup broth is yummy and has their own unique taste, so of course it does not taste like any other pho franchise."}
{"text":"Happy that this place is always open late so when you get that pho craving or when someone in the family isn't feeling well and want a hot soup they are the place to go..   And now they renovated their location so there's more space to sit now and isn't too close to other people eating"}
{"text":"Great spot of late night pho cravings!   Service was super quick, prices are great, serving sizes are fair as well. Our soups came out piping hot with all the fixings to top your soups just the way you like it.   No complaints - will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2008 so the changes in this place has been massive. I haven't gone back here for about 3 years or so and for some reason, their decor now doesn't appeal to me as it did back in the day (not that it matters to some)...but I am happy that they have more seating now compared before because it was really annoying back then especially when they were busy.   This place in my opinion has some good food. I honestly do like it. But I noticed when I came back here that even though the taste is there, the portion in their rice menu got a little smaller. Quite sad about that since the prices are a little more expensive now. The noodle menu is still also good though if anyone is wondering. But how they are went from 5 to a 3 for me in terms of quality and portion.   I would still come back here for sure when am in the area. I do really like the place (nostalgia reasons) plus the staff is really nice and service is quick. And they are open till 4am so it's good if your hungry and would  want something to eat really late. Just be mindful when you do come in late in the morning...SOMETIMES there might be some rowdy people and it can be annoying to enjoy your food.   But overall and most of the time, it's a good place to dine or take out food from."}
{"text":"Pho or phony?    This is where I USE to stop by when craving a late night bowl of broth, however after my last visit it might be time to find a new place.   The quality and service is not what it use to be. I order 101 Pho do thi special which comes with a mixture of beef balls, well done flank, beef brisket, rare steak, tripe, and tendon. You'd expect a lot of meat right? WRONG! I received at least 70% of the meat I use to in the \"good ol days\" the broth was meh nothing over average. I ordered a honey dew melon bubble tea after to see if they could redeem themselves, sadly they did not. Tea was still warm and the powder they used wasn't fully mixed.  I write this review with a heavy heart as I've been coming here for years and I have been impressed, if it wasn't for my last 2 visits I'd give this place a 4 star rating. Hopefully they'll step up their game and I can updated this sour review."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch. At first I was skeptical because their menu seemed limited from what I'm normally used to at Vietnamese Restaurants.   I ordered the lunch special, beef and shrimp skewers with imperial roll on top of vermicelli. The presentation was okay, and I thought that the portion size was smaller than usual.  Every aspect of the dish was very well seasoned and marinated. Even with different flavours, all the elements mixed together fit perfectly. I was also wrong about their portion size, it's the perfect amount for lunch.  I definitely will be back and try other stuff on the menu!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. On top of that, the waitress spilled water on my iPhone and wasn't even apologetic. She was laughing and smiling while I was trying to wipe away water from my phone worried that she broke it. Horrible service and way overpriced meals. I'll never come back here again."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Hence, even late night most of the tables are full. The place attracts all sorts of crowds and that is why I am taking away two stars. Some late night drunks like to frequent this place and sometimes they get out of hand and the staff have a hard time dealing with them. Also, the place is pure run down. It looks shabby and something of a third world feel. Another star off for that. If you can get past the particular crowds and shabby, run down decor, then go for the food. Try the grilled beef with rice like I did. It was a solid good dish."}
{"text":"A nice place for Vietnamese food... especially if you are looking for a meal at really late night!! We went there around 12:30am on weekday night, and the place was nearly full packed!!!  The food quality is good, tastes fresh. Good service. The pace is pretty clean too."}
{"text":"Excellent pho!  Had the rare beef and added some hot sauce.  Such great flavours!  Service was very speedy and friendly.  My mom had the chicken with mushroom peanut sauce and also enjoyed her meal.  Very good prices for what you get as well."}
{"text":"Omg the most recent times iv been coming the service just keeps getting worse and worse. Iv been their customer for a long long time. The newer people they have working here are definately making this place go down hill. Iv come when its not busy and they make you wait for so long for your soup.   Iv also tried to order their bubble tea on a friday evening at 8pm and i get told they have no more. She also had a huge attitude in which im not sure why. So my cousin ordered the bubble tea from someone else and guess what...she got exactly what she ordered. I told my cousin what the other waitress told me and so we asked that waitress why she said there wasnt any more and she lied straight to our faces and said she didnt say that. The other waiter then said something in vietnamese to her and they both started laughing and looking at us. I couldnt believe it...lazy much??   The original people who have been working here are good but the new servers have got to go. Definately bringing the buisness down."}
{"text":"Formats très gros pour le prix. La soupe Tonkinoise est d'un délice et les gens très accueillants. C'est également un apportez votre vin. Quoi de plus fantastique? Un bon spot juste à côté de l'uqam. Parfait pour une petite pause entre deux cours."}
{"text":"Open till 4 am :)   Broth is decent and hours are amazing  Lots of seating and menu options   Good price for the sizes"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant.  Only got 1 stars because the atmosphere isn't bad compared to a lot of Phó spots and the mango shake was good.  I got the rare beef and beef balls which is almost impossible to mess up but the veggies in the soup tasted like the were soaked in chemicals.  I also order a vermicelli roll with meat and shrimp and the shrimps were smaller than a dime \"literally\" by far the smallest shrimps I've ever seen in my life.  The person I was don in with got grilled pork with vermicelli and the pork you could tell was re-cooked at least twice. It was hard, too salty and full of oil.  Only one server for almost 20 guest, so when we asked for one fork we received a huge container of knives, forks, spoons that remained in the middle of our table for the meal.  Lastly, when I finally poured my tea I had a fly floating around in it!! I wouldn't go here again!! There's too many better places in the area."}
{"text":"So I've been on a Vietnamese food kick for the last three days. I was weary about this place as soon as I sat down and saw that there was not a pair of chopsticks in sight. Even the people eating pho were using forks.  WTH?  Service was quick and no nonsense. When you're done with your meal, go to the counter to pay.  I forgot I was in the French side of town so my not understanding what the waitress was saying in English seemed to annoy her. I know, I know...I should be learning French. One day, people!    I enjoyed the people watching very much today. My favorite was the man with a red bamboo fan, fanning himself at the table. It WAS a fairly warm day.  Or was it the combination of the heat and eating pho?  Does he always carry a fan with him or was it for pho?  Regardless, it matched his outfit so bravo to him for accessorizing well.   Despite my suspicion, I was very happy with what I ordered. Bun with chicken, shrimp skewers and egg roll. Everyone 's food looked amazing though. Definitely returning so I can try the bird's nest noodles. Maybe bring my own chopsticks?"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pho Do Thi. Our son has been getting take-out from them for a couple of years and loves that they're open until 4am.  The restaurant was pretty quiet for 1pm on a Saturday, which was nice for us as we often have to wait for a table when we go out for Vietnamese lunch. From what I understand, they're much busier later in the day.  The dining room is fairly large, bright and airy. Both the dining room and bathrooms seemed very clean.  My husband ordered the My Tho Style noodle soup with glass noodles, shrimp, squid and imitation crab. It also came with a shrimp cracker on the side. The soup was tasty with a fair portion of protein and plenty of noodles. The cracker was crispy and tasted like the oil used to cook it was fresh.  Our son had the bbq pork fried rice. It had plenty of fair sized pieces of bbq pork and quite a few veggies. He thought it tasted good but there were parts of it that were a bit salty.  Our son also had the fresh lime juice with soda. He has had this at at least 10 different Vietnamese restaurants in the area and he says this is one of the best he's had.  I had the vermicelli with shrimp on a sugarcane, grilled meatballs and spring roll. The shrimp was quite dried out and overcooked and was also a small portion (as compared to other Viet. restaurants in the area). The grilled meatballs were actually 5 very thin slices of sausage which were also overcooked and a bit dry. The spring roll was quite good, nice and crisp and with lots of taro. One thing I really did like was that the nuoc cham sauce is on the table along with small bowl, so you can take as much as you like. I like to soak my vermicelli with it and often find there isn't enough, so this was a big bonus.  All in all, we enjoyed the food and will probably return. I wouldn't order the same vermicelli dish as it was subpar as compared to most Viet. restaurants in the area, but I would try the pho for sure and perhaps a rice dish."}
{"text":"If you have a craving this place will satisfy.  I don't think they make anything extremely well but they don't make anything bad either. The spring rolls are really nothing special.  I do like the phone noodle soup and they do give a very very generous portions.  If you are hungry and it's 4am,  don't forget to stop by."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to have pho after a late night out!  We arrived around 1:30am and it was packed inside.   We ordered it to go. Around $8.  The pho was decent, nothing fancy, but definitely will satisfy your pho craving after a night out. :)"}
{"text":"This place is great for after hours as they're open extremely late- this is honestly one of the main reasons I keep coming back. If you're looking for amazing pho with great customer service, you'll be kind of disappointed. But if you're hungry, looking for an in-and-out spot that satisfies your craving or even an after drinking spot. THIS is the place to go to. Their pho is pretty good and portions are good. The one thing that's disappointing are their spring rolls. They're really oily, dry and seem like they were refried over and over for the guests when they order."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ever tried pho, around 6 years ago. So I had nothing to compare it to. To this day, despite trying numerous vietnamese restaurants, this place is yet my brothers favourite, which I feel is because it was where he first experienced pho too, and so it holds a special place for him.  Currently my favourite thing to order whenever I go to a vietnamese restaurant is the grilled lemongrass chicken on vermicelli. I love it! I finally decided to re-visit Pho Do Thi after 6 years and was shocked at how much they have expanded and redecorated, from a whole in a wall to an actual decent sit-down restaurant. I ordered the grilled chicken on vermicelli and the rice paper rolls. The server did not know English very well, but that wasn't a big deal, since everything we wanted we had to write down. The rice paper rolls were good. Then came my 'grilled' chicken. Immediately I could tell that the chicken was deep fried. It was extremely oily, to the point where my finger was drenched in oil with one touch. I called the server to clarify that I had ordered the GRILLED chicken. Apparently they grill the chicken and then deep fry it!??!! I returned it and asked for just plain grilled chicken. He came back 5 minutes later with a plate that looked exactly the same as the one I returned! I sat there not knowing what to do, and starving at the same time. Reluctantly I called him again trying to explain to him that it's still fried. His explanation was that the chicken is drenched in oil before grilling, so no matter what it will be oily. I gave up and decided to go to the vietnamese restaurant down the road, which made amazing grilled chicken the last time I went. My brother happily took my meal from Pho Do Thi to-go as a late night splurge. So basically I did not enjoy my experience here and have tried much better places in the GTA."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is simplistic, bare minimum - but no one goes there for the environment.  It's open late & this place has great pho tai! Get take-out & take it home with you."}
{"text":"Splendid food, low prices, bring your own wine. Good times, I go here once a week !"}
{"text":"We drive all the way from Brampton just to eat pho. They did recently renovate which is great. The place is now nice, open and spacious! We love this place. Will recommend to anyone."}
