{"text":"Servers were very nice. Our chef was hilarious with his tricks and jokes and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and engaging, but when it comes to the food, well mind I say the most overpriced and overrated I've ever encountered in Toronto?   It feels like you've walked into the 1990s where people crowd around teppanyaki as a form of exotic oriental performance, that said, the food is inevitably secondary to the performance they've put on.   I truly do believe there is a lot of work, effort, and skill each and every chef invests in, but as a restaurant itself, I can't bring myself to say I would ever come here again or pretend to like the lacklustre-uneventful taste of such a theatrical meal.   You're paying $30+ for a performance, a seat at a orientalist facade. With all that being said, service was friendly, but the food comes before all decor or presentation"}
{"text":"If I could, I would have given this no star. I am a big teppanyaki fan and have been to many other teppanyaki restaurants outside and inside of Toronto. Yet it was not only the worst Teppanyaki experience I have ever had, but also one of the worst restaurant experiences overall..  It's been few weeks since I had my first (and hopefully the last) visit to Hibachi. Two of my girlfriends and I came in right on time for our reservation. The hostess approached us then said our table was not ready. It was understandable at first since it was a busy friday night. She had us seated at the bar and we ordered a cocktail each just to kill some time. Everything was great until then. The cocktails were tasty and we were all in a good mood. We didn't know it'd take more than 40 mins for them to actually \"get our table ready\". We finished our drinks after 20 mins and very kindly asked the hostess when our table will be ready. She said she will figure it out for us then left us for another good 20mins without giving us any heads up. After some time, FINALLY the other hostess (different one from the one who sat us at the bar) told us the table is ready and we HAVE TO settle our bills before we leave the bar. So we settled our bills.   We were seated at the table and not after so long, the server approached us. We already knew what we wanted and ordered. He said we have to wait for the table to be filled. So we waited.. again. Skipping to the conclusion, the whole process of waiting for the other customers to arrive, to order food, and to actually have the chef show up to the table took ANOTHER 35 mins. We were starving.   The show began and it was just mediocre. Same old onion volcanoes and some other basic tricks that you see at other teppanyaki restaurants. For food, we ordered a green dragon roll to share as an appetizer, then fillet mignon for myself and two other things from their teppanyaki main menu for my friends. The green dragon roll, I still remember just because of the poorly cut avocados on top of the roll. Wanted my fillet mignon to be cooked rare and turned out to be cooked medium. My friends and I were actually too tired out to make complaints by the time we were served. The food, to be honest, was not the worst but not the best either.   In total, it took hibachi 75MINS to put just any food into our mouths. I understand how the teppanyaki restaurants work.. but this was just overwhelming.  And yet, the best part hasn't come out. We were just about half way done eating when we heard something unexpected. Apparently, who seemed to be like the manager or the supervisor was YELLING at one of his staffs in front of all the  customers. It was really REALLY uncomfortable to witness the whole yelling, shouting, and swearing while eating. Yes, swearing. We didn't finish our food. We just asked for the bill, paid, then came out.   The staffs were nice and friendly, but that is actually the only nice thing I could say about this place. If anyone wants to try teppanyaki, just go somewhere else. It's just not worth it to spend the amount of time and the money for such place."}
{"text":"I has been a while since we had visited a teppanyaki place and the first time for my kids.  It was a success.  The place is new and very nicely decorated. The staff were all superb - very friendly and helpful.  The cooks were skilled and the kids had a blast watching how he prepared the meal and handled the utensils. As we are not downtowners, it was still easy to get to and there is a parking lot just across the street so much appreciated as mom has a bad knee. My husband works downtown so just walked over. The food was cooked well and there was a good serving size.   Price was okay for the amount of food and entertainment any more and would be out of our pocket range."}
{"text":"Had a late night diner at teppanyaki table yesterday. At 9 pm our table was the only one seated  and the service still was slow. Chef was nice but he looked tired and show was boring. The real show started when they started seating their separate room. It was about 20 loud young people who had no respect towards other guests. Servers started running around them and we felt absolutely neglected. After that they let this group turn on their loud and offensive music in the restaurant. This ruined our experience. We expected dinner at a family restaurant and definitely didn't get it. On the good note: food was delicious,reasonable pricing and place looks really beautiful."}
{"text":"I found it interesting that I made reservations the night before just in case that it would be busy during lunch time (at 1pm), but when we arrived, there was only one other couple eating. Anyways, the interior is decorated for what feels like more nighttime dinner experiences. In the daylight, it felt empty, but our server was kind and ensured we were comfortable. We came for the lunch menu, which I think is a fair price (~$30 for two of us incl. tax) considering the food options and the chef's show. First we were served the miso soup, followed by the salad, both alright. It felt awkward that we were the only ones there by the time the chef arrived, however we were still happy to see him do his work and see our food cooked at the same time. The portions of salmon and striploin steak were just right, including the veggies. We did not opt for any upgrades or additional menu items. Would recommend for the experience."}
{"text":"We took my niece here for her 16th birthday.  Our cook was more on the quiet side.... did the standard show with the onion fire volcano, but no talking beyond \"how do you like your steak cooked?\" hence only 4 stars.  Over all the food tasted great and we had fun watching our food get cooked."}
{"text":"Delicious summerlicious!  We went during the summerlicious week from July 7-23. It was a 3 course dinner for the price of 28$ per person. It was well worth it as the portions we got were pretty big! I got the California rolls as a starter, sirloin steak as the main dish and matcha cheese cake as a dessert!   The teppanyaki show was amazing he was working that skillet! He put on a little show for us while we watched. The service was good as they kept us entertained and well fed!"}
{"text":"Delicious meal! I dined here with my boyfriend this past Saturday! I got the salmon combo, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken & scallops. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The portions were huge! Definitely get your money's worth. Excellent service, our chef Justin was awesome! Really good first experience, and I will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Although off to a confusing start trying to find the place, we found out it was located in the Thompson Hotel. Wide teppanyaki tables so you're not completely on top of each other if sharing with other parties. Very good food and very entertaining chef!! I've been to a fare share of teppanyaki restaurants but was equally as impressed if not more by the chef's act regardless of some similarities. I won't spoil anything but love how our chef challenged the men at our table to catch a piece of broccoli in their mouth. It brought all strangers and ourselves together for some good fun and laughs. Definitely give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for a friends birthday. The place was really nice inside because it's fairly new. The staff was super nice & the guy making the food in front of us was very friendly. He did tricks with the fire and food which was really cool as well. Great place. Would defiantly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just highly disappointed. Not sure if in myself or in this place. The show was terrible. Afterwards the chef stated that he was tired of working there, wiped his hands, and walked away. All I really wanted in life was a rice toss, or an onion flame volcano thing. We got nothing. I decided to look past this and enjoy the food. After all, with the price tag it had to be something special, and hibachi is always good right? Welp, NOPE. Not at all. As a group we had chicken/shrimp/steak, white/fried rice, and vegetables. I will say that the miso soup was good."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here at Hibachi. The food and service was good, the price is okay but it's definitely worth it if you go every so often for that experience. The chefs put on a little cooking show and it's nice to watch, I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and they had the cutest/funniest birthday package (couldn't stop laughing). Overall it was a really nice experience."}
{"text":"I can't lie Ive been wanting to go to a Hibbachi restaurant every since I watched the Office. Corny I know  Honestly the food was fresh , trendy atmosphere , our chef was entertaining and parking is so convient. If you havent been you should"}
{"text":"There was only one thing that I liked about this place - a beautiful ornate gold mirror in the front room. Other than that, I completely disliked the experience.   Upon arrival, the hostess greeted us and then proceeded to bash the owner while we waited for our table. She spoke poorly of him saying that \"he can't figure anything out, he doesn't know how to market the restaurant, he doesn't know how to compete against the Thompson Dinner,  he's been switching the hours of operation and closes too early, blah blah blah\". It was extremely awkward for us  (new patrons of the restaurant) to hear such criticism from a staff member.   It was a relief when we finally escaped the belligerent hostess and were seated at our table. The novelty of the atmosphere made me kind of giddy and I was excited to see the Teppanyaki Chef throwing knives amongst the flames at the neighbouring table. Unfortunately the euphoria wore off quickly once the food started to arrive. Our starters and sushi rolls promptly arrived at the same time the Teppanyaki Chef appeared to prepare our grilled dishes. We felt very rushed and asked the Server if the Chef could wait awhile to prepare the Teppanyaki so we could take the time to enjoy our starters and sushi rolls. She informed us that it wasn't possible because he was going to prepare our dishes at the same time as the food for other 5 people at our table. Long story short, we were forced fed. Deplorable customer service.  See ya never Hibachi."}
{"text":"We came here as a large group (25) people to celebrate a birthday party on a busy Saturday night.  They gave us a very large and intimate room with two cooking tables.   The customer service was fantastic!   The only thing was that the music is alittle loud in the private room.   I was sitting right under the speaker so maybe that did not help as well.    The food was really good!  I had the combination Teppanyaki with Steak and Shrimp.   My steak was cooked just as I liked It and the shrimp was tender and juicy as well.   My meal came with miso soup and plain white rice.   They also give you two types of sauces to dip your food into.  The chef who cooked for us was very entertaining and he made the experience  very unforgettable.   We had a blast and we were so happy that the restaurant let us bring in our own cake!  They even cut It into 25 pieces for us!  That was a very nice gesture.    The Decor and atmosphere of the place is modern and It is located under the Thomson Hotel in Toronto.   We had a blast and would defiantly recommend coming back!  Thank you Hibachi!"}
{"text":"We went to HIBACHI for a work function and had a great time. Our party of 12 had a private room. Cocktails were made well, service was spot on.....friendly & personable server and teppanyaki chef. The chef put on quite the show while cooking.....impressive skills! The food was delicious! Great prices & decor. It was pretty quiet in the restaurant during lunch......I'm sure it's much more lively in the evenings."}
{"text":"Overall great experience! Food was delicious. We had the select 2 combo and chose chicken and steak. The chef was entertaining.  Service was friendly"}
{"text":"We were there for Groupon. The service was very good from the ladies. That's where it end. The atmosphere is very poor. The lighting makes me feel dull. The cook doesn't even know how to make the atmosphere enjoyable. It seems like he just want to get the cooking over with and barely have a smile. He price is definitely high for the cooking and taste of this restaurant."}
{"text":"D & I came here for a Teppanyaki dinner for two. It was on a Groupon deal that I purchased a while ago. I had a hard time looking for the entrance to be honest because the address that was listed was not the exactly where the main entrance to the restaurant was. The inside of this place tries to give you a hip and chill lounge and then there is an area for Teppanyaki.   I have never been to a Teppanyaki before so I was looking forward to the experience. Overall experience was good, the service was good but in terms of the food I have to say it was just okay. I did take a look at the menu to see what they offer and what is the pricing like (because like I said before we came here on a Groupon deal for a set menu). The pricing I thought was on the pricey side and food wise I guess I was expecting something more because of the location and other choices available in the area. Don't get me wrong the food was good and I was very full after my meal, but I guess I was expecting more.   It was a fun dinner experience, but would I come here for Teppanyaki, I am not sure because there are other Teppanyaki places that I can try. To be honest, there isn't really a wow factor what will make me think of this place when I want Teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! The food preparation was exciting and entertaining. For st asters we got signs and dumplings and for my main I had the AAA filet mignon and it was impeccable! I highly recommend this restaurant and the dish!"}
{"text":"I went to hibachi for a birthday dinner with my fiancé and it was a fun experience.    Hibachi is a very large restaurant with multiple teppanyaki tables and bad signage outside.  I actually circled the entire block before finding where the restaurant is and wasn't too happy about that since it was a cold day.  Once inside, the staff was friendly and the decorations were nice.    Along with several others, we were seated at a large spacious teppanyaki table that fits 10 guests.  Our servers were mostly attentive and the chef put up a good show with the onion volcano, fried rice and cooking the food.  I ordered a steak and shrimp teppanyaki set and my fiancé ordered scallops and salmon.  The portions were fairly large and we were satisfied with the quality of the food and the seasoning.    For me, hibachi was lacking the wow factor as nothing in particular stood out.  Nevertheless, the food was excellent, the teppanyaki chef performance was good and service was attentive.  Overall, a good teppanyaki place that I would visit occasionally.  3.6 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Entrance is very dark and uninvited, but it was Christmas Eve and nothing else is open. We greeted by hostess and asked for our drink order, after giving the waiter asked us for our order again. My friend assumed that when ordering Sashimi that would get piece if you asked for one and three if you asked for three. He ended up getting enough sashimi for a table of four and this was definitely something the waiter could have advised on. Later, I spilt my tea and I mentioned it to the waiter and hostess and both didn't bother cleaning it up from the time I told them about it till an hour later. To make things worse that Tea dropped off the table on to both of our pants. Expensive as well"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went since we got a Groupon. Ambiance was nice and the food had a lot of variety. We got served veggies, rice, scallops, lobster, shrimp, steak, chicken, sushi, salad and soup. It was good value for your money on Groupon but I don't know if I would come back here. The experience was great and the chef was talented but the service was poor from the host that welcomed us to the server who was absent from our section for 80% of our meal. We asked a host to take our picture and she refused and insisted that we call our waiter. I didn't get it. I have to say that it looked like they were unstaffed tonight, however, our party's plates were not cleared up for a good 15-20 mins despite other parties in our section had their plates cleared and their bill settled.  Overall, I would say do it once (with the Groupon) for the experience and hope to get better service than what we got tonight."}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner with friends. The place itself is very beautiful and clean. The food was average. Nothing special. The Chef wasn't enthusiastic at all. He came, cook everything in about 10 minutes and just left.  The salmon, shrimps and chicken meals were ok. Not much flavour. The gyoza appetizer and sushi appetizer were good."}
{"text":"Got a voucher from travelzoo for 7 courses for 2 ppl for 44 dollars. What a deal. It was a nobrainer especially when the restaurant was so close to me. The restaurant may be hard to find since its located in the Thompson Hotel with no visible signage out front. There is also street and public lot parking out front. So parking was not an issue for us.  When we arrived, the staff had been nothing but courteous and making sure that we as guest have the best dining experience. You get seated around the cooking area where the chef will prepare the main dishes. So there's some entertainment while you wait for your food. The other small dishes will arrive via the waiter.   It was taster menu but the amount of food is quite generous. The filet mignon was done well and the tiger shrimp was also delicious. I was most disappointed by the chicken which seemed slightly dry but it could be one off error by the chef.   The overall experience was great, and because of the voucher it made the experience that much better. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a late Friday night as we had purchased a groupon ($75 for a 7 course meal for 2). The service was great, servers were overly friendly and accommating. We first got our miso soup (delicious! Not too salty and perfectly hot) then our house ginger salad (delicious as well). We then got a vegetable sushi roll which was so yummy, definitely one of the best rolls I've had and I wanted more. Next, the teppanyaki chef came and prepared our entrees! It was quite a fun show to watch especially the onion trick. He grilled some vegetables and vegetarian fried rice as our next meal. The vegetarian rice was ok, a bit too buttery tasting imo. The vegetables were yummy! For our main meal we had strip loin steak, lobster tail, chicken filet, shrimp, and Atlantic scallops. Yes, the groupon comes with all of these meats but not a full portion of each meat. It is extremely filling! I thought our steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the shrimp was wonderfully juicy. I could have cared less for the chicken and scallops though. Then finally, to finish it off we got a scoop of ice cream!  Overall, my bf and I had a great time and really enjoyed our food and the entertainment. Would come here again but only on special occasions as it it on the pricier side (paid over $100 for the groupon with tax/tip and a couple beers) :)"}
{"text":"Just opened recently and was meaning to try it. Came here on a Friday and it was easy to get a table. There was actually a good amount of patrons and a huge restaurant but it seems like not many people know about this place yet.   $10 cocktails, wide variety of choices. The two we had (mai tai and mango) may have lacked alcohol but its $10 and the flavour was good, as was the presentation.  The food was decently priced $17-40 for the teppanyaki. We got the salmon and also shrimp. They were delicious and the chef Yang was good. Some nice fire and a little spectacle but wasnt over the top. Also had a side of fried rice and it was good.   Only drawback is the cheesecake. It was too small. Don't think I would order again.  Overall, the sevice was top class, the food was great, and the drinks are cheap. It's worth trying for sure especially if you live in the area."}
{"text":"The show of teppanyaki is fun! always fun seeing the onion volcano, the fire, etc etc.  That does not fail you.    The service is friendly, fast, and polite.  We came in on a weekend and had no wait time to get seated.  Now for the main part: the food Our sushi roll was decent which we had as an appetizer.  and the beer was cold. (was not feeling saki). I had a steak and chicken combo, my friend did shrimp .  we both had fried rice.   The portions was filling.  The steak and shrimp was delicious.   I found my chicken though bland, compared to other Teppanyaki places i been too.  Oh one of the biggest complaints for me, was payment.  For its location, and ambiance, you would expect them to take all Credit and debit.  But fine, they don't accept AMEX, but they don't take debit either?"}
{"text":"This is the best Teppanyaki I've had. I got the lunch special that comes with grilled vegetables, steak, rice, miso soup, and salad with miso dressing. All of the flavours exceptionally amazing. The steak is perfect. And it's only $16. Their lunch menu ranges from $11 and up. Really reasonable and lots of options and choices."}
{"text":"I went there last night with my wife. I have read all the reviews, and the ones that are negative should be ignored. The food was fresh, well prepared, and portions huge. The show is fine, do you want to be entertained or eat ?  I wanted to eat, and wow, no complaints from service, décor, wine , or food. All outstanding. Cant wait to return. The staff from the Manager to wait staff were fantastic. Well done, you should all be proud, and your business should flourish."}
{"text":"These guys are great & they took our party of 40 without deposit without advance notice & gave us excellent service. The food was excellent but the thing that impressed me the most was that when I told them about my unique yet deadly allergy to raw carrots, they took it very serious & cooked all my food separately in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and service. I am not a teppanyaki lover so I didn't particularly appreciate the effort at show-cooking but I am sure some people would.  The food was good (I had a mix of scallops, prawns and lobster), I actually enjoyed the small starter of sashimi so also the raw fish bar could be worth it.  Price was okay."}
{"text":"this place was a really nice date spot! my boyfriend and i went on a tuesday evening, and the service was very prompt. the chef cooked our food in front of us on the grill which was pretty entertaining. we also got the $75 groupon which included 7 courses, which included salad, soup, sushi, fried rice, grilled veggies, and assortment of meats including shrimp, lobster, scallops, chicken, and steak, and we also got ice cream. this place is also good for small groups of friends an families. a little higher end then your average restaurant, but a very different and pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"I came by this place with a friend last Friday. Despite all the reviews I think this place deserves a better score. Yes teppanyaki can be expensive so use the Groupon which gets you 7 courses with lobster tail and scallops for under $100 tips and tax in. The food is excellent, environment is ok and my waitress Cherry is awesome. I would recommend this place and would come to dine again."}
{"text":"We had been eyeing the new Hibachi Grill which opened up this fall at the Thompson Toronto, as we literally live a block away. So on my husband's birthday I decided to make reservations.  We ended up going with the prix fixe menu, with some upgrades. This  includes soup, salad, fried rice, sushi rolls, ice cream on top of the grilled meats and veggies. The fare was pretty standard for a hibachi grill, steak, chicken, scallops and shrimp. They did add lobster to the mix, which was nice touch. The scoops of ice cream were nice-sized, which is good cause my hubs loves ice cream.  The most entertaining part of course were the antics of the chef juggling his tools and setting food on fire. (See the two videos I posted.) I had previously asked to add on a birthday package, but as the evening drew to a close I saw no sign of it. Even my mother-in-law commented that a candle and cake would have been nice. A couple of gentle reminders later, the wait staff did serenade my husband with drums, a chef hat and really nice green tea cheesecake (yes, with a candle ) They even gave us a framed photo, which was a nice memento of the evening.  The only down side was that although mostly courteous, there is a little bit of a language barrier with some of the wait staff. This was a bit unexpected given the venue. None-the-less, it was a really fun evening.  My Rating: 3.5/10. 1.5 points deducted because food although good, was pretty standard, no delectable surprises. 1 point deducted for wait staff forgetting the birthday package and potentially embarrassing me in front of my in laws.  Pro Tip: When you make the reservations, ask to purchase coupons at the door. You get a 2 for 1 deal on the prix fixe menu, which works really well with the wallet."}
{"text":"Went there with a groupon.  Including the cost of groupon it ended up being 50$ a person.  Service: (5 stars) + great accommodations with the weird groupon rules - 4 of us went with 2 separate groupons and they were accommodating to have us at the same table. (they did not have to) + the bill included tax and tip and they notified us of the tip ahead that tip was already added .   + generally friendly    Food: (4.5 stars) These were all the food that we have gotten:  Miso soup House salad with ginger dressing Chef's selection sushi roll  AAA Strip loin Steak, lobster tail, chicken filet, jumbo shrimp, and Atlantic scallops Teppanyaki vegetables Veggie Fried rice Japanese Ice Cream (Mango or Green Tea)  The protein was pretty small, we got 3 shrimp, 2 scallops, and the rest was cut in small pieces so unsure how much of food it actually was.  However it was enough to leave all of very full at the end of the meal.     Scallops and the steak were my favorite.   Atmosphere (3 stars): The person who was serving us was nice, however he only did a few trick (onion volcano, and bouncing the egg on the spatula)  You can see the video: https://youtu.be/0gakol3OuGU The place was clean, I just expected more of a show.    Overall:  The groupon was cool due to different protein's that we got, but compared to the regular menu seemed just slightly under the normal cost."}
{"text":"Decent, BUT most of teppanyaki I have been in the past, usually a combo of $35 would come with stirred veggie and scoop of ice cream, in that case kinda disappointed...3.5 solid"}
{"text":"Our group of eight were here on my birthday.  Excellent service provided by our host Shogu (spelt incorrectly), very friendly and accommodative to our requests for shifting us to a smaller table and making changes to the price fixed menu due to dietary requirements.  Ambiance was smart casual, and very modern.  Food was excellent and plentiful, cooked with some fanfare by the chef.  Scallops, shrimp, steak and chicken were cooked to perfection as requested by each couple, sauces provided for those who needed more flavor with their meat or seafood dishes.  A really nice place to come with a group due to the Teppanyaki style of cooking right at the table, although we had to speak loudly in order to get heard at the other end of the table.  When one of my friends mentioned to the host Shogu it was my birthday, we got a cheesecake slice with a candle on it, a group  picture was taken, printed and put on a card for the group to sign ... a very nice touch.  An extra star just for this neat little surprise.  I would recommend Hibachi at the Thompson and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner with my wife.  We used an expired Groupon deal which means they give you a full credit of the deal or honour the original deal.  Prior to ordering we confirmed this policy with the hostess and server. When it came time to pay for the bill the owner came over and told us we had to pay an additional 15 dollars.  Nominal amount but it's the principal.  Food was ok but please don't try to pull a fast one."}
{"text":"Had a great experience! Service was amazing! It was great to watch the chef do his thing right in front. Food was delicious as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was a second date. I had taken great care to find a place with a comfortable atmosphere, enough noise to feel comfortable, not enough to be blinded and a menu that could work for a runway model. We didn't go there.   She met me in a coffee shop after work, nearer her, and after swooning over the snort she made while she laughed we trotted off in a torrential downpour to find some dinner. Too much gluten here, and too few people there we both decided to go to the Tapaniaci, no wait Tappenaiki, Teppanyaki (auto correct wont even get me out of this one) place.   As we walked in and realized we had come to far to turn back it became the place of second date nightmares. A lights so bright it was like being hungover in the sun after drinking your way into the groove at a 90s dance party, so quiet the weightier could hear my inner monologue saying \"don't fuck this up shes really cool\", and as empty as a king street balcony in January setting overcame us.   We were sat at one of many empty half rectangular tables on the short side, and told the rest would be filled shortly by group onnners. 5 minutes and 4 external general Custer hearing aids later we were joined by 2 lovely couples who drove down for just this show. The tapaniaci show began with a man clad in chefs get up. He wore all whites and flipped a spatula for a while with that 100 yard stare. He looked dead pan past everybody as a sudden pang of despair rang through me. I felt his depression, I felt the senselessness of the show he put on for reasons to dark to understand, and found myself falling into her eyes.   Our conversation went back and forth with some poorly timed interactions with our compatriots in gastronomical delights, then the heater in the stove top was flicked off as our entertainer turned to leave the half hearted golf clap, and it got quieter. The fart I had been fighting in could be herd screaming for freedom and my dreamy date was on her way faster that I could pay my half of the bill.   The food was pretty good. I hope she calls."}
{"text":"My girlfriend's mom came to visit us in town, and she has requested \"something special and fun\". Teppanyaki pops in my head right away, so I found this place near our location and hope for the best. It was FUNNNNN, my gf's mom had so much fun!!!! Watching the chef performs and cooks at the same time, is something both my gf and her mom never experienced. The food was good, especially the shrimps are cooked PERFECTLY, I love it a lot and would definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"Can't even give an effing 0 star.  42.50 for this amount of food from Uber Eats. Average tasting. Never ordering from this place again.  My hand roll was 5 dollars and there is seaweed, rice, a bit of salmon and sauce. What a joke."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch during the week. It was pretty quiet but they still do the full on tepanyaki show.   The meal ended up being pretty affordable for what it was. The lunch special was a great deal.   The sake was good too. They mostly do warm sake they said but can make any of the sakes cold. The one we had was interesting because it was unfiltered.   The service was friendly.   Overall, this spot is great value for a show and a meal, especially during lunch. It's great that such a place is open for lunch.   I haven't tried it for dinner but I definitely recommend it for lunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing new tepanyaki place, great service, quality food and a decent chef with skills on knives. Definitely worth a shot. Oh and $4 pints!"}
{"text":"I had a good time with my mom eating here at the hibachi for dinner. The experience was great. Our chef's name was Justin. I really enjoyed the part where he lit the onion on fire. He also tried to threw little pieces of broccoli into our mouths with his spatula. He succeeded the first two times and then it didn't go so well for the rest of us but it was a good laugh. The food was actually really bland. The teriyaki sauce they used is extremely light and the dipping sauces they provided, which were a mayo-based and a ginger/soy sauce based,were also a bit plain. And I'm not a person that usually eat salty stuff. Portion is plenty though. Also, expect the steak to be over cooked because they were chopped into small pieces.  The Groupon was $75 for two plus tax and 15% service charge already added which ended up being $97.46. I don't think it was a good deal because I think the deluxe combo which is $42 per person is somewhat similar but comes with filet mignon and salmon if I remember correctly. Groupon claims that this deal is originally $150 in value is very much an exaggerated overstatement. Overall was a good experience but I don't think it's worth a second visit. It's maybe really a 3.5 star."}

{"text":"BAD EXPERIENCE TURNED GREAT! I had an interesting visit to this restaurant for my 30th birthday. I had gone with a large group of friends and was really looking forward to the Teppanyaki experience however there were a lot of short-comings the entire night. The service we received was poor. I wouldn't say that it was really busy in the restaurant - perhaps 5 other tables at the time. The waiter was forgetting many items and the worst thing was that they gave my birthday cake that my friend had brought it for me to another table. They had also lost my friend's umbrella which they had said they would keep at the front because it was wet from the rain. This was a bit let down that it ruined the whole night.   That being said - I had spoke to the manager over a period of weeks who promised to replace the umbrella and offered to have me back to dine again. 2 months after my first visit I returned with my boyfriend. And it is safe to say they absolutely redeemed themselves. The manager - Joey was very friendly and checked up on us to make sure our experience was good. We were even served by the same waiter who we had the first time. He was very professional, polite and apologized for our previous experience. The food itself was great! I had the Fillet mignon, lobster & scallops which was all cooked perfectly! The chef was quiet but did an excellent job of making sure we were well entertained. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I have to say that what really got my attention was the service. Our server was exceptionally friendly, and good with customers overall. I had just wished the chef would have been more enthusiastic. There may have only been 4 people at our table, but the show just seemed a little lacklustre. The egg toss and fire volcano were nice, but the performance just felt very \"let's get this over with\".  Aside from the service, I have to say the food was a bit of a letdown. We used a Groupon that listed a $140 face value for 2 people, which is a HUGE inflation.The food was just average.  Sad to say that I've had better miso soup and Japanese salad at AYCE restaurants.  The chef's choice roll was pretty decent. I'm not sure if it was chicken or shrimp tempura, but the roll tasted okay.  The teppanyaki I must say provided a substantial amount of food with LOTS of variety. Lobster, shrimp, scallops, chicken and steak cooked the way you want it. They give you dark and light sauces to dip in. The dark tastes like typical steak sauce, and the light tastes like a thousand island mayonnaise variation. Without the sauce the food is rather bland. While it has a nice charred flavour to it, a little salt or seasoning would have been nice.  The green tea ice cream was much creamier than I expected. To be honest, if I closed my eyes, I probably would have thought it was vanilla.  Overall a 3.5 star experience. Food was okay, show was okay, service was exceptional! After tax and tip, it wasn't too far from the face value. I don't know where $140 came from, but I really wouldn't have been able to justify that price."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. We enjoyed our time there. I truly recommend this place for birthday celebrations and friends hangouts.."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced. They also charge extra for the hibachi fried rice which is just frustrating. I've been to a handful of places that charge extra for it and I always say I won't return. This place has now become one of those on my list. The presentation was pretty standard nothing incredible and the food was just fine. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"It was a great place to have teppanyaki!!! Lobster is so great! Very delicious and fresh!!!!!! And the service and hospitality is great too! My friend and I bought coupon and we used that $74 coupon to have a $110-valued dinner and saved much money! We had beef, lobster, chicken and salmon which is very very amazing and we two are so full."}
{"text":"ATROCIOUS. The service was slow, disorganized and inattentive. We ordered sushi as an appetizer which arrived after our soup and salad. The sushi was far below average - don't even touch the yellowtail. As we waited for our appetizers our wine came even slower and apparently sharing a glass of water is a thing. The other people at the table all received their cooked appetizers before the meal. The teppanyaki chef was dull and rushing to get through our table. Sadly he wasn't in such a hurry as to cook our filet mignon rare as ordered. In short nothing went well. The food was bland, poorly prepared and presented."}
