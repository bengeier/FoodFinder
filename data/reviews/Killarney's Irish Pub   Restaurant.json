{"text":"Went on St. Patrick's day knowing it would be busy but didn't get there til 940pm and everyone was trashed. DJ was rude and impossible to deal with despite the fact there was a band. The place was trashed, bathrooms out of order, and staff non-existent. Will not be back! Oh and the DJ was overly rude to his own omission bc im not a \"regular\"! I had $ to spend but bc of him i will spend it elsewhere from now on! Will never be back."}
{"text":"Everything an Irish pub should be! My only complaint is that they are somewhat Americanized, menu items like wings chicken fingers and nachos aren't Irish cuisine. The Irish dishes are superb, and they have a large selection of Irish beers."}
{"text":"I have a love of Guiness. Thought I drop in on wing night since all the places in airdrie have a hour of more wait. Walked in and thought it was pretty dead for wing night. Ordered a bunch. To my surprise all bloody. Had to get them re cooked twice and got charged for it. Crazy. Refused to pay for the recooking of the wings and will never go back. Now I will wait my hour or more for cooked wings."}
{"text":"Been there, maybe 4 times. Basically it's inconsistent in service & food quality. Sometimes your server is great, sometimes not. Sometimes the food is good, other times the cheese isn't melted on nachos, or fries have been sitting too long before served. Their main competitive advantage is that it is in the best location in all of Airdrie.  EDIT: Also, the kitchen closes at 10pm..."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time about a week ago for a burger and beer fundraiser.  It was very busy and the service was slow.  One person behind the bar was not enough and overall, they were not prepared for this event, which was disappointing.  The bartender kept a good attitude despite the fact that she was working her butt off but the server I encountered was short with me.  This certainly impacts a first impression and I hope this isn't the norm for regular customers.  I had a Regular Burger which was very good and sizable, actually.  I ordered the Greenhouse Salad as a side with their homemade Maple Balsamic dressing.  It was very sweet and thick but I liked it.  Domestic beer was my only option, which is stepping out of my comfort zone.  The selection was small and I managed with a Canadian.    The pub has two women's restrooms, apparently.  I only used the one near the pool table which is a single toilet.  I appreciate that because you can primp, take your time and not feel rushed or crowded out by others waiting.   I'd have no problem giving Killarney's a second visit.  Review 19 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge - Nov 2012"}
