{"text":"Sorry but very disappointed. Photos must be fake. All we saw was one fridge & you get more stuff @ metro, or iga, or lob laws. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I love Mi&Stu and I am so happy with their new place. I am gluten intolerant for two years now and in the beginning they litteraly saved my life. Gluten was not that popular and well indicated on food. I recommand this place to anyone who wants to be \"normal\".  Try their cake or cupcake! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Quelle belle sélection de produits sans gluten! Brownies, biscuits, muffins, cupcakes, pains, bagels, ... Parmi les pains, il y a une baguette de pain! J'en ai acheté une, vous vous doutez bien! Évidemment, ce n'est pas identique aux baguettes à base de blé, mais ce n'en est pas loin! J'ai appelé mon copain pour qu'il passe acheter un brie et on s'est retrouvé à la maison pour se régaler de baguette!   J'ai aussi acheté leur bagels au sésame! Quelle joie de pouvoir de nouveau manger des bagels autre que les beaucoup trop durs du commerce!   Bref, j'y retournerai certainement plus souvent, même si c'est à un bon 45 minutes de chez moi!   Bémol: du personnel souriant et accueillant, rendrait l'expérience plus plaisante."}
{"text":"I went to Copperbranch not long ago and had an amazing burger on the most delicious Gluten free bread. The bread was so good i questioned wether or not it was really gf so i asked the girl what brand it was which brought me to find Mi & Stu. It is without a doubt the best Gluten free bun out there... i went in today to get 3 bags, super friendly reception and i took a vegan brownie upon recommendation of a fellow yelper that i cannot wait to try. Will most definitely be making a monthly visit to this great newly discovered baker  Fast forward a week... just ate the brownie, WOW gluten free, vegan and not a single person would be able to tell . Moist, chocolatey decadence. This bakery is definitely my \"coup de cur \" for 2018!!   Thanks for making such amazing products it definitely eases the pain of all the sacrifices i have to make and all the wonderful gluten filled goodies i had to give up!!!"}
{"text":"Je donne 5 etoiles car a present je n'ai pas ete decu et le service est super! J'ai essayé le brownies qui est delicieux, mais un petit peu trop sucré pour moi, on sent presque pas le sans gluten. Les bagels sans gluten sont fou, trop bons! Ils fondent dans la bouche une fois grillés."}
{"text":"Holy incredible brownies batwoman. Whether you are or are not gluten free these are Hulkify with happy, call upon the superheros good. My mouth is working just thinking about it. So dark chocolately and moist. Goodness gracious. And the gluten free chocolate chip cookies are buttery and home made tasting and freaking delish as well. Plus the ladies are hilarious, I recommend going to visit on a quiet Saturday and prepare to be cracked up.   This is a small pretty storefront with a big kitchen behind where the team is pumping out gluten free goodness for lots of other celiac minded joints in town. You can get gluten free breads, prepared meals, biscotti, crackers, etc. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Review Update:   It had been about a year since I passed by Mi & Stu so I walked in today for their chocolate brownie and carrot cake muffin and was disappointed to find that I would have to buy 2xcarrot cake muffins (and not fresh - only frozen) and the fresh daily chocolate brownies cut rather small and are no longer wrapped with care with a little Mi & Stu label that list the contents (a bit of a no no in the land of specialty baked good stores methinks). I got home, steeped a nice pot of mint tea and unwrapped the brownie but the recipe seems to have changed as it was even more sugary than chocolate'y in my book and crumbled apart when I tried to take a bite. Still moist and with tiny chocolate chips but I won't be tempted as readily for this when next I pass by the store front.   They still stock lots of gluten free bread and frozen to-go cakes, brownies etc. I'd be curious to hear a review of their other wares but don't fancy the trial and error investment in this case.      Prior Review:  A very minimally decorated to-go bakery - threadbare atmosphere-wise but DANG delicious food-wise. I'm an omnivore who, from time to time, cleanses, modifies my diet and tries to figure out what things I'm allergic to. Well, if I go gluten free (but not sugar-free...) I will be a regular at Mi & Stu's. I picked up one of their gluten, dairy and peanut free chocolate brownies and it was amazing. Chewy, dark chocolate square of heaven. I recommend sharing it with a friend though because it is chock full o' sugar and the effects are felt almost immediately. ZAAAANG! For a less sugary but equally delicious option try the carrot cupcake. MIAM! I believe this one was vegan but you'd never know it...dense and moist and, well, scrumptious!   Other items in demand, according to the bakers there, include the mock rye bread and gluten-free bagels. I'll be giving them a try next time!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of enjoying a sandwich at cafe pave on the best gluten free bun I've ever had! I had to know more about these buns. After having a conversation with the owner about where the buns were from, I had to get some and bring them back to New York. We visited Mi and Stu's on the way home from our trip and couldn't have been more pleased. The owner, who was so friendly, brought out a few different things and we took them all! Cupcakes, brownies, cinnamon rolls....oh and 2 cases of buns of course! All are absolutely delicious!!"}
