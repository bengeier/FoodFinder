{"text":"Great family owned and operated place with awesome food, cold beer and top rated comics on Thursdays..."}
{"text":"Although not a place I would normally go, some friends recommended it so we all went and i was pleasantly surprised. The beer selection is nothing to write home about. Just the standard bottles (Canadian, blue, corona) and taps. Although I didn't order the food, a friend did and it looked good. It was very quiet, which I wasn't a fan of. It also made the live comedy kind of awkward. But it gave my friends and I a chance to chat with the owner/bartender who was a very nice and knowledgeable guy.   If you're looking for a place to go with friends then its a good place. If you're looking for somewhere to go on your own, don't go out of your way to try it."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices and friendly environment.... Well worth the visit if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"It was very nice and welcoming. Definitely a great place to start our vacation. The food was great and so was the ambiance. The lady behind the bar was so friendly. She was chatting with us the whole time. Pork souvlaki is very tasty and portions are huge!! Neither me nor my friend could finish our food but it made for great leftovers."}
{"text":"We arrived for after work relaxing and drinks and the bartender seemed overwhelmed with 4 patrons at the bar. The nachos came without cheese, our chicken wings were an hour and a half late without the blue cheese. It is clean and obviously family owned which is great and apologized for having an off day. Hopefully next time we give them our business we can relax, enjoy and unwind"}
{"text":"Nice family run place. I came here for a burger and fries and to watch the game. Great atmosphere and the owner was really friendly so had a very enjoyable time. Prices are very reasonable and it's a great option if you're in the area and looking for a decent meal at a good price, and also want to watch a game or a live show (seems like they have lots).   They were old school and wrote out all the orders so I thought that was pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Where to begin.  This family owned business won my heart a long time ago.  Great food.  Friendly service and a clean establishment.  We have had dinner and apps all over Toronto but nothing compares to there 'you belong here' way of serving us.  Wings...crispy and flavorful.  Burgers... my friends that i brought raved over them.  This family knows how to cook, engage and serve up food, drinks and fun!  Come one come all"}
{"text":"I've been to this bar four times now. It's not my bar of choice but there's nothing terribly offensive about it. They have open mic, karaoke, comedy sort of shows. There is a sign in the window that says there are drink specials every night. Twice when I've asked the bartender there have been no specials. Another time there was a martini special posted in the window. A female was bartending and she said I couldn't have a martini because it was too complicated. I tried again later and the male bartender was able to make it without a problem. It was a good value and delicious when I finally got it. They seem to have a great song selection for karaoke. The hosts for karaoke and open mic seem to rotate or something as I've never seen the same person twice. That makes it hard to build any sort of loyalty to a show and also it seems the hosts haven't stuck around long enough to get a handle on the acoustics so the sound can be garbage sometimes. Not a bad neighbourhood place but I wouldn't put it on your must-see list."}
{"text":"First time here, came for a friends birthday party. Ordered the bruschetta which was delicious. There was karaoke and a great friendly overall atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the bar! The service was great and we had awesome conversations with the owner and his friend about life in Toronto! It has great atmosphere. We went almost every night we were in town and drinks are reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall bar at Woodbine and Danforth. 3 stars for location, but 4 stars for the cheap drinks, good service and .50 cent pool table. We did not try the food here and I can't comment on that, but it is a family run joint and the pride of ownership shows here. Not the cleanest washrooms, and normally I would never venture into this part of town (I was here for a birthday) but give credit when credit is due. Great place to watch a game in a small bar like atmosphere at prices that are definitely cheaper than other similar establishments."}
{"text":"I love this place. The wings are excellent. Poutine is great too. And, Rob, the manager and bartender, is on the ball & fantastic."}
