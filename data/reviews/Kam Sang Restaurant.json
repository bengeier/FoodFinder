{"text":"The restaurant looks very impressive inside and out. Unfortunately the food is not very impressive. You would be hard pushed to identify any flavour in their dishes, it has to be the blandest Chinese cuisine I have sampled.


 I've used their takeaway services a couple of times, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, and have regretted it on both occasions."}
{"text":"I'm in stark disagreement to the other review on this page. On the occasions I've visited the Kam Sang - both in large parties and smaller groups, I've always found it to exceed expectations.


 The menu is extensive but nothing you wont find in most other Chinese restaurants. However, the food is always very tasty and plentiful. Prices are reasonable, if perhaps a little on the expensive side in some cases (cantonese steak - I'm looking at you here) but affordable non the less. Service is always very good and we've never had cause to complain. On the occasions we've been with large parties of 40 or more people, they've coped without any difficulties. The interior (and close exterior) is always clean and well maintained.


 I've never tried their takeaway service, although people I know who have usually say positive things about it. On the whole, while its not the greatest Chinese in the world, I;d certainly say its probably the best Scarborough has to offer and is well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I came here, I ate, I left - very, very full.. I found the restaurant very pleasant but a bit overdone on the faux dragonalia. My partner had some strange crispy spring rolls with a curious paste interior for starter and I had the Salt and Pepper ribs. No complaints, but nothing startling.
I had a very pleasant Beef satay main course and my partner a chicken in black bean sauce with green peppers. With sides of egg rice and noodles, washed down with a couple of beers then followed by Banana fritters, I thought the bill of Â£67 was reasonable. Staff accommodating and friendly.
It is not my first choice restaurant in the town but it is certainly my first choice for Chinese."}
