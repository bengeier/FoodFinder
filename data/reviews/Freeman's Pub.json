{"text":"Traveling through on business. Stopped in for early dinner on Friday night. The bartender (Skinny blond, Heather?) seemed to be pissed that I came in (I am not a regular).  The food was definitely Sam's club frozen food -OK for micro at the house, but not worth what they charged. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I've only been to Freeman's three times--each time to support live music--but each time I leave wishing that Freeman's had existed during the years I lived in Gastonia.  Back in  those days the only watering holes that I knew of in Gastonia were chain restaurants like Chili's, Applebee's and Hooters, and the beer selection is the beer selection that one expects at those places (read, yellow water).  

Fast forward to modern times, where the Gastonia-dweller has the fantastic option to quench their thirst at Freeman's Pub!  It would be a stretch to say that the beer selection here is epic, but it is by no means remotely close to shabby.  In addition to the 7 or 8 beers on tap, there is a good selection of bottled beer.  This is a place where the lover of Bud Light and a quasi-beer snob can order beer and drink happily alongside one another.  

I have not experienced the slow service the Joe B. mentioned in his review, and the bartenders are both friendly and helpful.  Free local live music and great beer make Freeman's a place that I know I'll return to many more times."}
{"text":"The bar is slow, you will stand/sit there for quite some time before you get a drink or order your food. The food is okay, but I have had better. You should get more for your money though. Great potential."}
{"text":"Great downtown pub. Good music, food, & servers w/ a touch of a \"dive\" feel. Keepin' it real in G-town...but w/o becoming \"redneck central\". Nice balance & diverse crowd. Good selection of Whiskeys."}
{"text":"We went on Friday night to see a friend's band play. First of all, we saw three great band for no cover charge! The bartenders - Brad and Heather - were incredible! The place was PACKED, and yet I never waited longer than a few minutes to order drinks. Even though I was ordering for six people and needed several different mixed drinks and shots, they still had them to me in just minutes. I was incredibly impressed with their speed of service as well as their friendliness. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night and Kelly was my bartender. She really helped with deciding which craft beer to get . She recommend noda rambler on red it was awesome new favorite of mine !!!!"}
{"text":"One of the few decent places in Gastonia to get a beer. On special event nights (Halloween, NYE) You will have to wait to get a refill. Other than that it's a fun place to hang out and watch a band."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and a bite after looking at condominiums in the area; great local hangout! The food was good and plentiful, and Michael and Heather (chef and bartender) were consummate hosts. We will definitely stop in on our next trip to the area."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the food!  We started with the spinach artichoke dip.  Very good!  We both had side salads.  Above average, for sure!  I had the Freeman's Wrap.  It was very tasty; great seasoning!  Live and good music (Friday night, two guitars players).  I highly recommend this pub!"}
{"text":"Such a welcoming atmosphere, cozy yet upbeat place to hang out. Awesome drink specials and GREAT FOOD!!
Located in the heart of downtown Gastonia- this will be a favorite weekly stop for sure! Job well done Freemans!"}
{"text":"A couple notes to add to reviews...The new menu is great!  The redid the kitchen and before everything was just kinda bar food but now it is bar food with flair.  Still good prices.  I especially like the burgers and onion rings.  The potato cuts are good too.

This is a local place so you won't get the cheesy TGI Friday's service but you will be friends with the waitstaff (or owner) by the end of the night.  Low key...never a rush to flip your table...and the first place I have been to where \"everybody knows your name\".  

St. Patrick's Day was very fun!  I have heard Karaoke is good but I am biased.  I host the trivia on Tuesdays so I know that is fun.  I really enjoy going here once a week at least!"}
{"text":"Freemans is the best little pub in Gastonia. They have great food and a very knowledgeable and friendly staff. The atmosphere is fun and comfortable and customers and staff alike are warm and welcoming. I can always count on having a great time here. They have daily drink and beer specials, multiple TV's to catch the games on, live music, and other fun events throughout the week. This is the only true Irish pub in the Gastonia area. They are open late so we frequently come here after work to decompress or catch some live local music. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good wings. Unique sauces. Good beer selection. $1 membership fee. Going back to explore some more."}
{"text":"Food here is outstanding!   Much better than typical bar food.  I like the burgers ands fries.  Monday nights they have stand up comedy."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night to see Sam May.
A local musician who plays around town.
He went to Ashbrook is about 24 years old.

He has some licks on the acoustic guitar, a decent voice and a good handle on a crowd appeal type of music."}
