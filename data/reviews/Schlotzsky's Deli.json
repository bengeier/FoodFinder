{"text":"Went here with some friends and was not familiar with the menu.  The order counter seemed confusing to me too. Got a turkey sandwich,  but think they used miracle whip not mayo.  Not a fan though."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. I like the chips and the Albuquerque turkey. The bread is a bit hard for my taste, but great flavor. There's not a lot of meat, but good quality ingredients. The menu has a lot of choices, which is nice. Not a lot of sides, but decent round sandwich."}
{"text":"10 minutes before closing time they have all the chairs upside down on all the tables and the lights down. Walked 10 minutes to order take out. I can't tell you how this experience would have been due to the customer service issue. 
Won't happen again ! This left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't even taste the food."}
{"text":"This is a chain of east coast deli-style sandwich joints that started out in Austin, Texas.  Their sandwiches are awesome because they bake them up all warm and toasty and offer a bunch of different combinations.  My favorite was always the Original Italian with double meat baked on a sourdough round with melted cheddar. So good. Too bad they don't have this place in Northern California anymore."}
{"text":"A longtime fave of mine.  
Food
Stopped in today and as good as always was.  Fresh, made with care.  Had the 'Original'.... which the website says is based on the muffaletta... didn't know that.  Because friends and family have tossed around the idea of opening a Dairy Queen (yuck, but profitable) in Defo or other (independently owned, run) restaurant or food stop in Sun Prairie, it occurred to me that Sun Prairie needs a Schlotzky's and I feel it would do well here. So, I looked at their website. .... And happened to look at Nut Info.... wow, total heart attack maker food.  Probably not any worse than MacDonalds or something, but I thought this was better than Macdonalds etc.   Fresher, etc. 

Atmosphere, Marketing, Decor
 I way prefer the E. Wash Madison WI decor to that shown on website.  Pretty plain bldg, looks like a restaurant where the food is focus, not the latest marketing strategy.   Seems like east location could use a bit of something to 'soften the lines' a bit.... hard tile floors, chrome diner dining sets..... maybe some flowers on tables and landscaping or potted plants or planters to soften the beat up parking lot?   The franchise info says they encourage outdoor seating.... how bout it?  If they are trying to attract a customer like me, Schlotzky new bldg decor and marketing strategy / image featured on website is way on wrong track.   They spell everyting they can with a 'z' inztead of an 's' - my opinion, a poor attempt at being hip.  It all  looks like a cookie cutter fastfood / modern / crap.  Even the website is blah.  Dont like all the cartoonish blaring colors..  I will say it's easy to navigate though.

 Employees seemed a bit tire, bored, worn out and lackluster.  But My job sucks too, so I decided to chat up the grim guy who took my order and got a short if nice conversation and several smiles out of him.   

The E. Wash location is now in it's 19th year (when chatted up, the guy who took my order told me).  Schlotzky's online franchise info says contracts expire/renew at 20 yrs.....   Im guessing Schlotzky's Corporate feels Schlotzky's east needs to update to be worthy of renewal."}
{"text":"I didn't know Schlotzky's was a chain until I actually ate here. It was good, a little steep for what you get though...The service was good and my sandwich was made quick. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian sammich.  It was a bunch of veggies between two pieces of spongey bread, with a hot sauce that was not flavorful, just hot.  I guess I should try something else because eating spongebob squarepants wasn't enjoyable for me."}
{"text":"They made it right!

I took the incorrect sandwiches back to the store.  

The manager took them out of the bag,  verified the wrong bread and missing toppings, then she went back and made the two sandwiches again, with the right bread and toppings.  She also upsized from the small, which was the anniversary special, to medium."}
{"text":"Was getting my car washed and this place is next door. When I walked in it was obviously my first time there ( I was giving the menu a squinty eyed look and looking around a lot. ) I then asked if there was anything in particular I should try, the cashier did give a suggestion and knew the menu well. The sandwiches are hot also in case you were wondering. Took roughly 4-5 minutes and I was out of there.. I tried the sandwich upon arriving at home, and it was.... decent i suppose. My stomach had been a bit topsy turny lately so I blamed it mostly on that... I suppose ill be back sooner or later.. but not going out of my way."}
{"text":"This place has amazing sandwiches it can be alittle pricy for the portion but the quality is really GREAT! I was suprised to see this place was empty I was the only one sitting here with my friends. The place is very colorful ad also has a large selection of drinks and teas. Dont forget to mention the free refills for a guy like me it comes in handy!"}
{"text":"Why did you ever leave me Schlotzsky's? 

I wish you would come back to Chicago. You are missed here. 

This place has warm, fresh, soft bread. This place has delicious meats, fresh ingredients, and hearty helpings.

I recommend the reuben or the original. 

This particular location has a larger, cafeteria style seating area. When I went there was a large crowd of blue-haired old-timers reading the paper and hanging out."}
{"text":"This is an awesome sandwich shop!

All of the sandwich bread is made onsite every morning.  A far cry different from that frozen and thawed kind of other chains.  It's always moist and full of flavor.  The meats and cheeses are also sliced on site daily, so you don't have to worry about older or stale tasting ingredients.

This is one of the few restaurants that I've worked at that I not only eat at, but will fully endorse.  And after 13 years and a load of jobs, that's saying something.

It also helps that the owner, Todd, is a great guy that treats his employees and customers with respect.

If you're in the area, this is a great lunch stop on any day."}
{"text":"The food was as great as I remember Schlotzsky's being (the location near me sadly closed a long time ago) but the female (no name tag) employee was EXTREMELY rude and glared at us the whole time and only grunted out responses. My friend didn't receive the cup for the drink she ordered and the employee let out a huge dramatic sigh, as if my friend was bothering her by getting what she paid for, as she handed her the cup she forgot to give her in the first place.

The bathroom in this place is also pretty gross or at least it was that day. Another thing is that although there were a few other patrons in the restaurant it was DEAD SILENT in there the whole time, kind of awkward.

I'd go back but I'd hesitate if she was working and I'd get my food to go next time!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this place was a chain but it was still decent. There were many tables for a large crowd during lunch and even parking spaces! 

The menu features sandwiches of many types -- warm and cold. Also, pizzas and new salads are on the menu. The cranberry, apple, pecan, and chicken salad was great and had the right amount of dressing on the side. It came with few pieces of cheesy bread that was mouth watering. Fountain drinks and bottle drinks of choice and many side bags of chips. From what I hear, the Reuben is amazing."}
