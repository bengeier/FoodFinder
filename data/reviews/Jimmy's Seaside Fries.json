{"text":"Okay so I've been to this location a few times (i visit Vegas several times a year) and wasn't impressed it was always good but not great. This time everything was AMAZING! I struck up a conversation with the guy behind the counter, he informed me there has been a change in ownership and I'll say you can tell. The place looked very clean, food was awesome and the quick friendly service was a delight! I'll try it again and can only hope the new owner keeps things just like my last visit!"}
{"text":"Jimmy's Seaside Fries is a new snack place at the Grand Bazaar Shops that has many locations in the US, with this being their first Vegas location. They specialize in French fries that you can customize with a variety of spices and cheeses. They also carry items such as chicken and sliders, as well as a funnel cake.

Came here and ordered a combo of wings and fries. I ordered my fries Chesapeake style with Old Bay seasoning and melted cheese. The fries were OK. The seasoning was good and I thought that the cheese on top tasted better than the normal nacho cheese that come in a can. The wings were OK as well. They used Franks Red Hot sauce to dress the wings. I would have preferred that instead of using pure hot sauce, it would be better to cut it with a bit of melted butter, to cut the sharpness.

I also ordered a funnel cake. Wasn't really too impressed with this. It was soggy, dense, and greasy, definitely not one of my favorites. The people working seemed nice.

Jimmy's is a place to stop by if you want a quick bite and are in the area, and don't want to spend the time walking into a casino to get a meal. It was decent."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. I love fries. These were so tasty. They weren't cheap (I think the regular order was $7), but they were fresh and crispy and salty and satisfying. We just ordered normal fries with no extra sauce or seasoning and loved them. They were cooked to order and ready in about 6 minutes. So, yes, I'm picky with fries. All fries are NOT created equal. Some places have crap fries, but this isn't one of those places.

It's in the Bazaar Shops near Bally's, a tiny stall in one of the shop rows. They offer different options for fries with seasonings and sauces, and also other fried offerings like funnel cake and wings.

They sell good fries. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"After being closed for quite a while they seem to have reopen. My experience today was a very negative one being back to workers were here seems to be new and they did not know the difference of what was an order of fries and what was an entr√©e such as chicken wings or sliders. My first choice could not be made because they were out of Aioli and my second choice could not be made because they were out of seaside sauce How can you be out of two sauces when you're not a busy establishment at all and you just reopened."}
{"text":"Hot and fresh chicken bites and fries, funnel cake was kind of dry, but service and food  were good."}
