{"text":"This is a great hidden gem! I travel to the area a few times a year and always make sure to stop in. Cash only, but other than that, it is perfection!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch joints. 

The owner, Heather, is really a blast.  At first, she seems kinda gruff, but is friendly, funny, attentive and she can cook!

The space is really cool. Very clean and a nice spot for a quick and tasty lunch  It is a converted house right next to a hardware store. In the summer, eat on the picnic tables out front. There is a really nice view of the city. 

Try the soups. They are all excellent, as is the chili, which is made with sausage and not ground beef.  My favorite sandwich is the turkey Reuben.  Really tasty.   The corned beef is really good too."}
{"text":"Never disappoints.  Great food, reasonably priced.  The chicken salad wrap and chili are my favorite items.  Bring cash, no credit cards accepted."}
