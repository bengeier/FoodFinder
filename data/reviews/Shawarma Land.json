{"text":"Great food. I haven't been disappointed. The portions are decent and they have lots of side options. Always fresh. I would definitely return. We order the chicken most often and find it well seasoned with good spices."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout, very large portions and great service. This is one of my favourite takeout spots and I would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Always fresh food and friendly service....good portions and great prices. Best shawarma in town ."}
{"text":"Amazing place, great customer service!   Chicken shawarma was delicious!"}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was that it was extremely clean. My second impression was incredible service.    I ordered food for lunch and got the chicken shawarma wrap. The gentleman preparing my wrap was extremely friendly and attentive to my order/needs.  He genuinely seems to love what he does and the service he offers.  It was my first time at this location and I just told him to put everything on the wrap! There were so many flavours happening, but it all worked incredibly well together. There was hummus, hot sauce, tahini and garlic sauce, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, pickled beets, tabouleh, onions and an amazing cabbage salad. The best part was of course the chicken.  These ingredients provided the sweet, spicy, tart and aromatic flavours I crave. I can't stress enough how UNREAL the seasoning and herbs tasted.  One thing I will warn people: this is way more complex than traditional shawarma. Some may be disappointed because it does not taste exactly like the simpler, garlicy version. But, you can always opt out of the fancier toppings!  The best (and maybe most unfortunate) part was the size. This thing was the size of a football. I am a small person, and there was no way I could eat this wrap like it was intended. I had to cut it in half a use a fork and knife. But, this did not take away from the awesome deliciousness that is Shawarma Land."}
{"text":"It looks like it is a  family and I asked them to consider franchising :).. As reviews stated, We Stopped by on the way back to Toronto and man, you better try it yourself. Huge portion, delicious Shawrma with fresh salad and pita bread. Will come back for sure if travelling through Aurora.."}
{"text":"I visit shawarma land on a regular basis, best shawarma around. You can always expect the same quality and the owner and associates are very passionate about their food, enriching the entire experience. If you're looking for a shawarma, lunch or dinner this is the place to go, great portion sizes that will leave you full and satisfied every time."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has 5 star rating. Fresh food abs by far the largest shawarma plate I've seen I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"It was pretty busy around Saturday lunch with quite a few people getting takeout as well.  Food quality/freshness was decent. We got the chicken shawarma plate and beef shawarma wrap, the latter being tastier as everything was well-mixed together. The price point was quite good for the amount of food you get, and there was a fair bit of toppings to choose from. Service was also pretty good.  Overall though, the tastiness factor is why the rating is 3 stars."}
{"text":"Blessed food . Blessed service . Blessed value . Blessed fast food in Aurora . Don't go anywhere else if you know what's good for you . Fills you up and you'll want to come back for more . Holla at yo Boi Tazzy  Fizzle Productshizzzle"}
{"text":"Still the best shawarmas around. The value and quality of the food here is excellent. The shawarma wrap is huge and full of fresh toppings. You can get chicken or beef,but they make a mixed for me because I can never make up my mind. The guys are expert at getting the food ready fast and efficiently,without sacrificing quality."}
{"text":"The babaganoush was so bad it was inedible. I'm not even sure there was any eggplant in it. Tasted like mayonnaise and nothing? If it wasn't out of my way I would drive back and and dare them to eat their own food."}
{"text":"I enjoy a good shwarma, and I certainly can't seem to get enough of this place! The quantity and quality are excellent for a fair price. Been there 5 times this month. Chicken, beef dinner plates or wraps are my favourite. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent shawarma and falafel. Huge portions and great flavours. Poutine is big enough for two!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma around!  1. Totally worth your money. 2. The owner gives pride on his work. 3. Full filling( Costco size) 4.  Combos are great ( any choice in meat ) frie/salad and a pop. Everything about this place is amazing. Totally recommend  it to all my friends and family and no one is ever disappointed. Best shawarma I have ever  had in the GTA"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch often and it's always SO good! I get something different every time I go and I am never disappointed. If you like Baba Ghanoush it's a must have here.  The portions are a really good size for the price, ingredients are always fresh and the staff is always amazing! They are always super nice and take a tonne of pride in their work. They are doing an amazing job and I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Mmm !!!  This place is so good. I love the shawarma, it's so delicious. I highly recommend anyone to try, such a nice place, and food is great !"}
{"text":"Excellent price for the size and delicious ! Quick service and very friendly guys serving! Great menu too! They keep it simple"}
{"text":"Wow. Well deserved reviews. Stopped by here for lunch. Gentleman who served me was very friendly, took a lot a pride in his work, probably the owner. Had the shawarma sandwich combo and it was delicious and huge. Couldn't finish the fries. I will definitely be back when I'm in Aurora. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, friendly fast service.  Every time I've been here they do not disappoint.  I tried the chicken shawarma salad today and it was delish! Coleslaw was amazing.    This is my new go to place in Aurora."}
{"text":"Great food and good food. Variety is good and the staff take a lot of pride in their product.  Always fresh food and good people working. Food is good for the type of restaurant and they are more than happy to accommodate specific needs at no additional cost within reason. Very child friendly!"}
{"text":"Must Try: Chicken Shawarma Plate, Gyro   Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (10/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:   Would never have thought that I would find such an amazing shawarma place up north from Toronto, but this restaurant really shines. Amazing chicken shawarma and gyro, very fresh and flavourful.   We got the shawarma plate, and boy was it packed. A box filled to the brim with rice, potatoes, chicken shawarma, hummus and salad. It could fill one hungry person or even two mildly hungry people.   The service was impeccable, very friendly. The restaurant was very clean and had a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and even better chicken shawarma plate!  Huge portions for a great price.  Took me two days to finish it!"}
{"text":"Great Shawarma Wrap at a good price. The portion size was good value for your dollar, and the taste was phenomenal. They had a huge variety of different toppings at no extra charge. I recommend getting hummus with garlic sauce, tahini sauce and hot sauce. UNREAL. The staff was awesome and you can tell they really put their heart into their work. Better than any other 5 dollar lunch or dinner in the area."}
{"text":"Very good Shawarma - I probably eat Shawarma more than I should - it tends to be a go-to meal on the go when I'm looking for something quick; and I'm finding that each place I go has subtly different mixes of spices for the shawarma and vegetables for toppings.  Shawarma land has a good mix of both, the flavours aren't anything that really stands out; but they are generous in their servings and have a good flavour."}
{"text":"Unquestionably the absolute best Shawarma I have ever had, anywhere. We had the poutine shawarma and chicken shawarma salad. I've never experienced a taste sensation quite so satisfying. The fries beneath the top layer in most poutines are soggy, these were crispy the whole way through and flavour-flavour-flavour! The portions are huge! The staff was friendly, the service was quick and the prices are good. The place was clean and they even had free wifi! I'm telling everybody I know about shawarmaland and I will definitely be back again. They do take out and dine in. If you're looking for a quick bite and have the shawarma craving this place will definitely satisfy you."}
{"text":"This place is a m a z i n g. Found out about this place after the shawarma place just south closed down and i was looking for another one nearby. went on yelp, saw this was just down the street and decided to pop in.  the guys are very friendly! the food is delicious, fresh every time. I'm usually a fan of the sandwhiches but here i prefer the platter. it can easily feed two people, i can never finish a meal in one sitting. i will try the shawarma poutine one day.  10/10 i tell everyone who lives around the area to try here."}
{"text":"Very happy to have found Shawarma Land.  Very tasty food, reasonably priced.  The staff are very friendly and fast.  The restaurant is clean and new.  It was busy, so a good sign that the food is good and fresh. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My expectations was  too much  perhaps, I was not satisfied with my meal, Mabe it was one off does nights, will try the shawarma sandwich next time"}
{"text":"Met the owner's son working there tonight.  Nice guy.  Place was very clean.  Food made fresh.  Flavourful and big portions.  Was looking for a middle eastern spot using Yelp when I was visiting the area and found this place.  Glad I did.  I'll likely be back for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Got to give it a 5 because when you have the best Shawerma in the city or even the neighboring city you deserve it. This place is not for people with supermodel appetites as a sandwich weighs more than your arm."}
{"text":"Great spot for a hearty meal.  Staff are friendly and professional and food tastes great not to mention huge portions.    Open late and fast fresh food!   Best Shawarma in York Region!"}
{"text":"One of the best shawarma places around. Clean restaurant, fresh food, everything is prepared prepared of you, very nice business owner that cares about customer service. It's been 3 years I have been coming to this place, if I could give it more then 5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Came back,  ordered the same salad and my chicken was cold.  The only thing worse the  chicken finished on a flat top is cold chicken. I threw half of it away,  very disappointed. This place could be amazing."}
{"text":"I've tried a few different places and this is by far the best place to get a shawarma.  Fresh ingredients and friendly staff.  I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This place gets busy at lunch so I recommend either going earlier or later hours of lunch (after 1pm).  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Plate ($13.30). It was the biggest portion of chicken, rice, salad and potatoes I've seen, and it also comes with a pita.  The portions are super generous and easily I ate the plate for two separate meals (lunch and lunch the next day! Yay!).  The chicken was flavourful and not dry at all. The potatoes where nice and crisps on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The salad was fresh and you have the option of having hot peppers on it as well.   I recommend asking them for extra tzatziki and hot sauce for extra flavour and kick. The service is quick and there are a few seats to sit at if you decide to sit in."}
{"text":"Absolutely huge portions, very generous and kind staff! I asked for extra pickles and turnips and they had no problem loading up my take out plate. Their hot sauce is delicious!   I am planning on using them for my catering for my Bridal Shower.    The reason I could not give 5 stars was that the hummus was not the best, to me it needed more garlic! This wouldn't deter me from eating there again though!"}
{"text":"Tabouli was light, fresh and very enjoyable. Loved the buba ghanoush - wonderful smokey flavour. Hummus was also well done. Happy to have found this spot. Shwarma is good. Not great."}
{"text":"Out of all my reveiws this is the first and still only place I have given a 5 star rating!!! The food is great everything I have tried on the menu have been great. The prices are fair and the guys behind the counter are  awesome. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Stunning eatery with the juiciest chicken shawarma I've ever had. Another one of Aurora's family owned businesses, there is a constant stream of customers who line up to experience their food. Portions are large, meat cooked to perfection and the assortment of veggies and rice is sooooo good.  If you live in the city, this is one of those places worth driving up just to try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to shawarma land for a chicken shawarma because I saw the reviews and photos on yelp. The meat was flavourful and toppings were fresh. And it's a decent sized shawarma as well! To top it off the lady that served us was very nice."}
{"text":"We have visited this place several times. Amazing stuff and perfect customer service.. Fresh & Delicious food.. Prices against portion size is good.. I recommend this place for all."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant but once I finally did I wasn't very impressed. I got the the shawarma dinner with salad and some stuffed grape leaves. First of all the shawarma was just ok because they put way too much cinnamon in there spice mix and thats all I tasted. Second, the so called \"salad\" was just chopped cucumber, tomatoes and a little lettuce with absolutely no salt and no dressing. The grape leaves were excellent though. I would definately recommend trying them!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch today & ordered the chicken shawarma pita combo. I didn't feel like fries so the owner substituted in a salad instead. Very accommodating & polite. The colors & freshness of the salads had me salivating. The rich pinky/red cabbage & pickled turnips were as delicious as they appeared. Next time I'm getting tabouli salad based on the freshness & taste of the prior mentioned salads. My first bite into my shawarma let me know the food was prepared with pride! It was so delish, I get mine fully loaded. I am pleased to have another middle eastern restaurant in Aurora. The eat in area is casual, adequately holds about 6-7 tables and clean. The value & flavour & freshness of their food is worth your money. I am definitely going back to try the other menu items. I also enjoyed the falafel sample from the owner, wonderful Palestinian people."}
{"text":"The best shwarma I have ever had, falafels are to die for as well as kubeh must be tried. Two awesome young guys making making awesome food."}
{"text":"Wow. Very friendly service and great tasting food. I've only so far tried the chicken shawarma plate to go and it was perfection. The portions are great and the price is right. The hot sauce is actually hot and the food, flavorful. I recently out of the blue started craving Mediterranean food and this will be my go to spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, hot and fresh, clean, great customer service. Ample seating when I came on a Saturday for lunch. Worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Shawarma Land is a great place for a shawarma. Ingredients are fresh. Portion size is good for the $.  Come to Barrie!"}
{"text":"What made this place were the two young men working there on Sunday January 4th, 2015.  Courteous, knowledgable, evidently invested in what they are doing.....and it comes through in the food! The addition of a bean salad would be a suggestion, not a criticism in any way.  Not a question of will I eat there again, it's when will I eat there again....well done guys."}
{"text":"Easily the best shawarma, north of Richmond Hill. All the meats are tender and juicy and seasoned perfectly. The sauces are particularly outstanding, which is what raises this place above others in my eyes, not to mention the super friendly service that makes you feel welcome every time you go in. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Food here is delicious and fresh. The staff take pride in what they do, and it shows in the quality of food and service. We love this place, it's our definite favourite for shawarma"}
{"text":"Easily the best shawarma in town. VERY generous portions, tasty tasty meat and sauces and the staff who take the orders hustle like crazy. Gets busy on weekends but totally worth the wait. Love to see small businesses like this one in Aurora."}
{"text":"I had their Chicken Shawarma, which was very tasty and big enough for dinner. My husband had a lamb shish kebab that also looked good, even though there weren't too many pieces of lamb in it.  I didn't have the opportunity to taste their plates or salads but from what I saw, they all look really delicious, well seasoned and fresh.  Service is really friendly, atmosphere is nice and there are plenty of options. I'd definitely return here."}
{"text":"The last time(4 months ago) went  there the rice wasn't cook probably, hard to chow plus the potatoes and I talked to the owner about it, he said nothing or offer something else and I put the rice and the potatoes in the garbage bin and left. I never backed there ever since."}
{"text":"I am a huge shawarma fan and this place didn't disappoint.  I didn't get a chance to try everything but the service was wonderful.  There are TV's to watch when you eat in and the place is very clean.  I accidentally dropped my bottle and the owner offered to replace to it with a new one.  (I didn't replace it of course,  not like the bottle broke and it was my fault for dropping it.)  When I left, they even said thank you and goodbye.     Service and friendliness is something all businesses should put as priority.  Even if I didn't like the food, their service gave me a smile.    Recommended for all Shawarma fans like me!"}
{"text":"Had chicken shawarma wraps. Good size, really flavorful, and the staff were very friendly. Awesome place, and I will come back again to try their beef shawarma!"}
{"text":"If you're in the Aurora area and love shawarma than THIS is your place to go! Great price, Pita STUFFED with meat and veggies. Cooked to PERFECTION! My mouth waters doing this review and thinking about it...Highly recommended"}
{"text":"yummy sandwiches and you. gotta try the falafel sandwich.  Good to have this in Aurora, get your shawerma uptown and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Grabbed some takeout last week as we were in the area and this place did not disappoint .  We ordered 2 shawarmas and 1 shawarma platter. Food was fresh and portions were huge.  Staff was great and were patient in explaining our options as they knew we were first timers.   Great food, great service, reasonable prices and huge portions.   Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Took the family for lunch and the biggest critics (my daughters) gave it 'the best shawerma in the universe'. The chicken, beef and gyros was very tasty and comes together very well with the  sauces, veggies and rice and the portions are decent. Price is good and great service.  Definitely a place i'll be visiting on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great place.. Big portions... Authentic shawarma... Fresh and healthy food! What else could someone ask for?! Came here a few times for lunch, staff  is very friendly.. Food is affordable and very tasty!"}
{"text":"If this was a food challenge...sharwarma vs. me! The insane amount of food got me pulling the white flag instantly !!  We came in very hungry on a Saturday lunch, the place was somewhat busy. There were two staffs working and they were both very friendly and efficient with the service !!  I liked the choices on the menu from burritos to platters and various meats including chicken  sharwarma/kebob and beef.   Ultimately, I wanted try their chicken sharwarma plate ($13.71)- it comes with a mountain full of chicken , potatoes, rice, salad, pita and hummus. Being very hungry stepping in the store, I thought I had no problem finishing up this plate.   Oh boy... I was soooo wrong....Just the pita and hummus already got me packing home. I barely made 1/4 of my food...!!   Honestly , you need TWO people to finish this. Sharing is caring...sometimes.... :)  They should put up as a food challenge. No way...anybody can finish this by himself/herself in one sitting? Don't believe  me ? Go try it...and let me know.   The chicken sharwarma plate had surpass my expectations, not only was my tummy stuffed but the flavour of the food was spot on. The salad was a nice contrast with all the meat and sauce it had. I just wished there was a little more salad !   If I'm ever around the area ( way too far from my usual hangout area!!!), I would love to come back and have another battle!!"}
{"text":"Shawarma Land in Aurora is one of my go-to spots when I want my shawarma fix. Also conveniently located near my house so that's a definite bonus!  Great little family-run place.  I'll review the chicken shawarma, since that's what you really want if you're going there!  The shawarma plate is piled high with home made sides. Rice or roasted potato for your carbs,  and salad with cucumbers and tomato with homemade dressing. The hummus is made in-house and is very fresh and also so, so good!  The chicken is perfectly spiced, roasted to perfection and there is a *ton* of it. you get a nice mix of juicy and crispy bits.  The wrap is similarly generous. They are absolutely stuffed with toppings and chicken. If you walk away hungry i'd be very surprised.  My go-to when I want to indulge is the shawarma poutine. Crispy fries, cheese curds, gravy, and a ton of chicken shawarma, topped with tahini, garlic and hot sauce. So good, and not to miss!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma place north of Lawrence Ave in Scarborough.  Authentic flavour great quality and value sized portions make this place a regular on our families rotation of meals."}
{"text":"Got the mixed plate shawarma ! 15.50 after tax! Huge serving!   Potatoes taste awesome   Good amount of food.  This place was super busy at around 8 PM on a Friday night there was at least 15 people behind me in line the chicken and beef shawarma were super fresh and was moist.   Hot sauce has a good flavour as well I'll be back!  It was honestly WAY to much meat and WAY to much food for one person.  Rice taste like instant I don't care for it wouldn't get it again.  The turnips were bitter and/or tasteless (not there fault as there not homemade)"}
{"text":"Omg... I thought pita land was good until I tried this. The portions are ginormous and its AMAZING AND DELICIOUS. It is 100x better than pita land, would get this all the time if it wasn't so far."}
{"text":"Had a chicken shawarma wrap there. Not great at all. The pita wasn't fresh as well. There are much better shawarma places, not in the area though (Mr. Laffa, Sofra grill, dr. Laffa all much better). First and last time here."}
{"text":"Found out about this place on Yelp and came here on a weekday after work for takeout.  I ordered the chicken dinner (includes chicken, potatoes, rice, tzatiki, veggie salad (tomatoes, onions, greens, jalepeno peppers) and a pita for $13.  The staff there work very quick and all the ingredients are very fresh.. the chicken was notably very moist and flavourful. The price point for a chicken dinner is a little higher than most, especially out in Aurora, but the portions are huge..definitely was enough to be two meals for me.  The store was very busy with seemingly regular customers coming in for takeout."}
{"text":"Have lived in the area for years and didn't discover this place till a couple of months ago and they have been opened for 3 years now! Since then I've been visiting it nearly every week.  The food is amazing, very flavorful though it is a little pricey but compensated by the large portion.  Service is super efficient and friendly.  I would have given this place a 5 star but took 1 off because they just changed the potatoes from the house made ones to ones that I believe were bought from outside.   The house made ones were so much better with a rich potato taste and very well seasoned whereas the new ones are quite tasteless and hard!   I hope this is just temporary and they would change it back to the old ones. Still I would come back again but not have the potatoes again until they change them back and would still recommend this place."}
{"text":"I tried their sandwiches before and i loved it. This time I wanted to try the dinner. The flavouring of the Shawarma was still amazing and the salad was pretty good (although I would prefer Greek salad). The rice needs some work. The rice and salad at Joe's Hamburger in Richmond Hill is better, but the Shawarma at Shawarma land tops it all"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time. It is another shawarma store at the end of the day - but what makes it spectacular is the pride that staff take in what they do. It's refreshing and i miss this kind of care. Keep up the awesome job!"}
{"text":"One of the best shawarma places I've ever been! It is decently priced for the portion you get. it's surprisingly bigger than the typical shawarma you will get elsewhere. I had to take out half of the food back to work cause it was super filling!   The shawarma is stuffed with a lot of meat and toppings of your choice.   Service is very responsive.   Would definitely go back !"}
{"text":"For me, cleanliness is very important, and a very good first impression and this operation is on the mark. Every time I have been here, the staff is engaging, service it great, and the food very consistent. Aurora should be thankful they have such a wonderful small business like this one."}
{"text":"Like all the reviews have said it.  This place is the best shwarma place I have been to.  Very fast service and the taste of the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Great prices and great food. Everything was very authentic and tasted great plus fresh veggies only complaint is there fries they were a little mushy but eihter then that great"}
{"text":"If you've ever had a falafel in the Annex in Toronto, you know what a good falafel is and what it's supposed to be. The falafel here was a tasteless mess. Truly awful. All the 5 star reviews are obviously from people who never go into the city. On another note: the restaurant was not clean when I was in there. I saw a lot of flies and food crumbs all over the dining area floor."}
{"text":"We just left the restaurant. The food was good but the people behind the counter were very abrupt and a little rude. Makes you not want to go back."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for some time given the rave reviews, I was not disappointed tonight. From huge portions, to fresh and good ingredients to awesome service, the place is a gem.  Kids each had a chicken shawarma wrap and I had a salad with chicken. Kids couldn't finish their wrap it's that big, I put the salad back but I was plenty full. A return to this establishment will be in order, need to try the kabobs, they looked awesome."}
{"text":"OMG!! Had the Beef Shawarma Poutine. Now I am a traditionalist when it comes to poutine....First and foremost, it must have curd cheese (not shredded mozzarella).  These guys hit it out of the park, crispy fries, curd cheese, brown gravy, and shawarma beef with garlic and tahini sauce....and a touch of hot sauce!   What a great poutine, Shawarma Land is just getting better and better every time I try something new."}
{"text":"This place is a bit out of my way but definitely worth a drive as I am a huge fan of chicken shawarma.  You can get a combo for $10, tax in which is a steal. Combo comes with chicken/beef shawarma sandwich, salad or fries and a pop.  Considering its a take out place, service was super friendly and efficient. Sandwich was HUGE and stuffed with so many toppings and generous amount of chicken. Toppings were fresh and plentiful.  Will definitely come back for this combo when I'm craving shawarma. Maybe it's a good thing that it's out of the way, otherwise I would be here too often"}
{"text":"Best shawarma ever!!! We drive from Newmarket as its so good.  Their baba and humous are homemade and delicious and beef and chicken shawarma to die for.  Staff are friendly and real mom and pop shop family run business!!"}
