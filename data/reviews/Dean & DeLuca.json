{"text":"My husband and I come to the Wine Room often because we live nearby. We stopped by to see our favorite waitress, Katie, tonight and were very sad to hear she was no longer working there.   We've noticed such a turnover with employees lately.. every time we come in, it's hard to find a familiar face. We asked our new waitress about the wine menu, and she was completely clueless. It turns out, she's not even old enough to drink! The young man behind the bar didn't look of age, either.   Our food came late, and it seems that our server was very distracted and overwhelmed because she was training someone new.   Not to mention that there has been severe price-jacking lately! We used to get a bottle of wine from the market for $15.. now we see that the bottle it marked for $33!!!! I can't believe it.   I feel that this place has so much potential, but management clearly has some issues. I didn't really see a manager on duty while we were there.. just a bunch of young kids trying to do their best."}
{"text":"Austere interior, reasonable wine prices, some pseudo-inventive menu options. If you're in the area and for some reason cannot support local business, I suppose it's ok.  Overall vibe: yuppie date night, but may have just been the weeknight scene."}
{"text":"Sandwich with a side of pretension? No, thank you.  I love a good gourmet market, but left D & D pretty disppointed the last time we went for lunch. The service was just not what I would expect, considering the price points were much higher than even Whole Foods.  The sandwich options were limited, and staff completely unhelpful.  I can not wait for A Southern Season to open in Charlotte and give D & D some competition."}
{"text":"I love this place. The wine is always fresh and there is a ton of selection available. They also offer half glass pours of all glasses available on the menu. So if you are trying to decide to have another glass this is the perfect option. They also serve a variety of flights of whites, reds and sweet after dinner wines.   The food is a great variety they have salads, dips, smoked salmon pitas and surprise sushi and if its not on the menu they are happy to make it for you.   Periodically they have live music and outside seating when the weather is nice outside. This place is a must to visit if you love a variety of wines an energetic feel and good food."}
{"text":"1 star because they NEVER answer the phone.  No matter when I call, no matter what extension I dial, nobody picks up the phone!  What kind of business doesn't pick up the phone...ever?!    I only go there now because they have a bomb red pepper and gouda soup."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. This was my second visit; first was great - good food & service. Tonight, we sat down in a freezing cold room, no server came for 15+ minutes, and we eventually had to ask the hostess for drinks. Servers all looked like they hated working there and kept disappearing into the market for very long periods of time while diners had to ask for checks or drink refills. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I really LOVE the new Dean & Deluca in SouthPark. I enjoyed the other location but this one just blows me away with its ambiance. It is classy, sleek and modern. The windows allow light in and they offer tasty flights (of wine) throughout the week. It can be pricey but with good service, live music I simply think the price can be worth it....Defintely a splurge though!"}
{"text":"\"WOW, this place is EXPENSIVE!\" ... is what I would say if Dean & Deluca cut all their prices in half.  I'm giving them 1 star because I feel that they make no effort at all to cater to anyone other than the uber-rich.   Like everything else in Phillips Place, D&D is just another spot where the wealthiest people in Charlotte can spend obscene sums of money on stuff they really don't need, while the rest of the country struggles to find employment and to stop their houses from being foreclosed upon.  Don't get me wrong, D&D has high-quality, delicious foods.  If I had a few million dollars in the bank, and didn't mind getting ripped off, I'd probably do all my shopping here."}
{"text":"the Phillips location for Dean & Deluca now offers 5 different American Sushi To-Go trays.  What makes these 'American friendly' is that the meats are cooked vs raw fish.  Steak,Lobster, BLT, Chicken and Green Goddess (all vegie) each come with a special sauce. Prices range from $8 - $13 for about 8 slices. I tried the Chicken and BLT to start and they were Very Good. The outer wrap is not the seaweed/kelp but a peach colored wrap. Fresh flavor on the Chicken wrap. There may be cheese or mayo inside the BLT sushi as it is very creamy tasting. The trays to not have wasabi nor ginger slices which I miss, so I asked for a  container of ginger. I would gladly go back for MORE AMERICAN SUSHI AND HOPE THAT D&D BRING THE AMERICAN SUSHI TO THE STONECREST MARKET STORE SOON!    FEB 5, 2010"}
{"text":"Soneone needs to seriously pull management aside and rethink their new directive to the wait staff.  Arrived here early Sat afternoon for a nice glass of Prosecco - looked on the menu and noticed they served it by the glass or bottle.  Since there were three of us, bottle made more sense.  Bottle was $16 - waitress then informed us there was a new pricing directive from the managers  - they were required to charge a corkage fee on top of the bottle - WHAT???? I could understand a corkage fee on a bottle we picked from their retail area but something listed on the menu - and to make matters worse  - CORKAGE FEE WAS $15.00!!! Outrageous and we should have moved on.  But, we wanted to try the Tuscan beans so stayed.  Needless to say I will never set foot in this place again.  THIS IS PRICE GOUGING AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL!  I repeat this was a bottle listed on the menu not from the retail.  Management must think very highly of their service and product to think that patrons will pay this exorbitant amount to open a damn bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"Let's put the prices aside - Dean & Deluca is the epitome of a gourmet market. Where else can you buy rose infused risotto, marzipan, Chianti red wine jelly? Talk about the perfect place to get a gift for a culinarian!  There's always something for everyone at all hours of the day - coffee bar, wine bar, sandwich bar, salad bar, and the deli. My favorites: garbanzo, feta & eggplant salad, and the sweet & sour sesame tofu."}
{"text":"Love the current location. Lighting, service, atmosphere, and of course the wine, were all on point. Great spot for a lingering date, after dinner and a movie (which was my case) or for the date itself. Perfect for a night out with the girls. A very convenient and popular Charlotte location. Update from spring, summer and fall: the patio rocks!"}
{"text":"Surprised to see some bad reviews. We eat here regularly and find that the staff and food are great. In particular the beef stroganoff is outstanding. The wait staff are consistently able to offer great wine pairings and take time to chat about the food and the restaurant. Strong selection of wines by the glasses and bottle. Interesting wine flights.  Close to a nice cinema, so we often eat here then walk over to see a movie."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but they don't bake all their own bread anymore, and I think the walnut raisin bread was better when they did it themselves.  Samples are a nice thing.  Atmosphere is good, but a bit crowded.  I go about 3 times a year."}
{"text":"Oy! Sensory overload.  Be careful or you might hurt yourself trying not to pass out from all the yummy choices or destroy your budget after you discover this place~"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously expensive, but being from out of town and I'm trying to experience all there is to the east coast I was brought here by my colleague.  I bought sugar cookies for my kids that were $5 each and I expected it to be top notch for that price, but all it was was a regular sugar cookie, of regular size, and of regular taste.  I tried the mocha they had and it was just ok (the chocolate they used wasn't really that great) and the next day I decided to give it a try with a vanilla latte instead and again it was just ok.  For the price and quality of it's products I'd probably look somewhere else."}
{"text":"A little too pricey sandwich-wise, but it was good."}
{"text":"Enjoying my coffee and kale & apple salad 4 early lunch.  I think this place is awesome!  Friendly service was exceptional, they deserve a raise!  I'd shop here everyday if I won last months lotto but it's definitely worth making the special trip every once in a while.  No fillers or processing agents on this ingredient label!  Thanks for warming up my morning 2 that special some1!"}
{"text":"Good selection of ready to eat foods; slightly pricey; need to bus and clean their dining tables!"}
{"text":"Went for Brunch. The food was good, the service was horrible. We waited 10 min before anybody asked us if we would like anything. Eveytime we wanted more coffe we had to ask. After food was delivered was never checked on again. The place was not crowded."}
{"text":"Sigh. I love your food.  But your prices are insane in the membrane. $6 for a tin of gummy bears I can find at the gas station for 50 cents? Hmm...I must be paying for the tin and the D&D sticker.    The salads are super fresh with premium ingredients.  The field greens, goat cheese, pine nuts, roasted red peppers and balsamic salad is delicious, but before they offered the smallest sized box, my salad has weighed in at more than $15.   The prepared foods section has always been delicious, so just buy it, close your eyes and swipe your credit card.  It helps you stomach the price. (I once bought a small container or prepared shrimp, and it was about $7 for maybe 12 shrimp. Again, the less you think about the price, the better your food will taste.   My only issue is sometimes the bakery case in the back, the desserts aren't the freshest.  They're a couple days old in some cases.  If I'm paying $7 for a tiny cheesecake, it better be from today.   The customer service is always good, which is why I still shop here.  PS:  I sometimes play the \"guess how much\" game with my friends.  Siracha hot sauce that costs $1.60+ at the Asian market is about $6 at D&D.  Same with a bottle of avocado oil. I've gotten the same brand at Target for about 1/3rd less."}
{"text":"Cons - yeah it is crazy expensive here. But then again consider the location.  Pros - we've been a few times for the sandwiches. The Ham & Brie is awesome (and pretty stacked) and runs for $7.75. I have also tried the Italian - it is also pretty stacked and yummy, more like a Jersey Mike's price at $9.50."}
{"text":"Dean and DeLuca is always a great bet as long as you know you're going to be spending money. Like others have mentioned, there are almost endless amounts of samples peppered around the store so there's a good deal to try before you buy (or just to milk a free quick snack out of them). Plenty of seating inside and out, and it's great for when you have a couple of hours to spend chatting with an old friend. From prepared foods to groceries to desserts and coffees, you'll pretty much be set here."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular wino at the former Phillips Place locale. Have given this new spot several chances and it has disappointed each time. Service is spotty and knowledge of wine / training of servers has dropped significantly. The flourescent lighting is horrid indoors and the outdoor patio is scattered with groccery patrons. Sad to say I've given up even though this is the closest wine bar to my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Had lunch today. Food is usually good (and it was), but the tables inside were dirty. Restroom toilet was broken. Outside was littered. We come here every week and the housekeeping is getting worse. When you pay almost twice what it would cost you at a comparable eatery, well, it kind if makes you wonder. Come on DD, you can do better!"}
{"text":"D&D Wine Room has a great selection of wines to choose from, and a pretty decent bar menu. We didn't try any of the larger plates, but a girlfriend and I met before a movie to have a few glasses and share some apps. The lobster sliders and mediterranean sampler (pita paired with hummus, baba ganoush and tabbouleh) were more than enough betwixt us. Actually, the mediterrean platter alone would have been perfectly substantial! We still had a lot left even after we'd both had our fill. Pricing is as little high, but the quality *is* there to account for it. The pita wasn't the best, nor were the rolls on the sliders my favorite, but the dips and lobster filling (and BACON) scored extremely high on the tasty-meter.  Just don't expect to be able to leave quickly or be on time somewhere after! After making sure we were set with food and drink, our waiter/s (we seemed to have more than one assisting us) disappeared, and took a good while before we could flag one down to get our check and go - we had a movie to get to! The location is a win though, being a very short walk to the theater, so luckily we arrived just as the credits were starting.  I would visit the Wine Room again if I wanted to relax with a glass or two of wine, but next time, I think I'd give myself more leeway if I had to be somewhere after."}
{"text":"The good was very good, lobster bisque and beef stroganoff.  The wine was good too.  All fair price.  The service was limited at best.  The noise level was too high to talk to anyone.  They need to address sound absorption issues.  Also to add to the noise issue was live music, which was good, but also complicated the already terrible noise level issue.  It actually ruined dinner.  We left with a very lack luster feeling, not really wanting to dine or drink there again.  The waitress could care less as to our presence."}
{"text":"Great place to meet a divorcee and tell her about your job doing \"inside sales\" whatever in the hell that is supposed to mean . . . you are a failure."}
{"text":"I don't have a problem paying high prices as long as the quality lives up to the pricing. D&D is expensive. However, the food quality simply doesn't warrant the cost. A piece of two layer cake, is over six dollars. They slice the cake up, then in an attempt to keep the slices fresh, they wrap the exposed sides of each piece. Good idea. However, many times, some portion of the slice is stale (who knows how long the cake has been sitting there). Their deli products, salads, etc., are not bad, but again, certainly not better than what can be purchased elsewhere for less. I guess I just expect quality comensurate with cost, and certainly don't see much evidence of it here. As a result, we are usually not patrons, too many other places serve better food (regardless of price), why eat mediocre fare?"}
{"text":"I come here way too often. I know the staff and they treat me like family, hence why I come here way too often haha. Beautiful upscale atmosphere in one of the prettiest shopping centers in Charlotte. Great coffee and tea, very friendly baristas and lots of fun products to look at. Plenty of seating in the main area, lots of outdoor patio room and even a \"wine room\" restaurant. So elegant."}
{"text":"When I moved here, I was shocked to see there was a few locations in Charlotte after only knowing it from visiting NYC. I love just wondering around in there and seeing what creative sauces, desserts, sushi, prepared meals, etc. they have. My parents love Dean and Deluca and demand we go each time they to visit and we often go there for free samples but were disappointed this last time (Lavor Day Wknd) b/c they didn't have any out, whats up with that?   While their stuff is pricey, it's worth the splurge every now and then. We all deserve something nice (and tasty) right?"}
{"text":"This Dean & Deluca makes a soup right. Soup Nazi style! Regardless of the time of day, I have a hard time passing up a shot of espresso here. This stuff puts SB to shame.   Sometimes they don't have the gray sea salt I love or my beloved papillon roquefort, but I always come back. This place reminds me of home, yes D&D reminds me of home!   See you soon!"}
{"text":"I had such a good experience today in Dean and Deluca. A super friendly employee chatted me up while he was dishing out my favorite tomato and mozzarella side dish. He was extremely polite and engaging. The exchange made me feel like I was a regular and I left the store feeling extremely positive. I'm a huge fan of business that hire people with engaging smiles and friendly dispositions. Having said that, the prices are a bit high. The food is wonderful, don't get me wrong. But, I believe I can get similar quality at Harris Teeter for cheaper. Dean and Deulca is a treat, though and today it was a really great treat!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The resturant is delicious. We waited awhile to get our food but it was worth the wait! Go there and expect to enjoy a delicious glass of wine while waiting to have a fabulous dinner!"}
{"text":"Fantastic foodie paradise, Worth the treat!  I enjoy the Cobb salad but switching to pear vinaigrette that's incredible flavor!! I crave it. Also the to go selection is out of sight with the fish, shrimp or butternut squash ravioli. I like the samples you can try from all departments--especially the sweets. The people are so helpful and I've found wonderful types of goat cheese here like humboldt fog, which helps me out (lactose intolerant friends understand this). Treat yourself to a feast, you deserve it for working hard at the gym.   Also the Wine bar restaurant has incredible food! I love the short ribs and polenta main dish. It's enough to share or eat the whole thing if you're hungry. We shared the charcuterie boards too with incredible goat cheeses. Amazing wine and friendly service! Love the live music!"}
{"text":"I love this Dean & Deluca. It has everything you could want, including an outdoor area for relaxing! If you go here knowing it's going to be on the pricey side, then you'll be fine. Make sure to order from the deli; whether hot or cold, they'll serve it to you with class. Sushi, salad, sandwiches, desserts, coffee, treats, etc, etc. I find myself stopping here frequently before movies at Phillips Place. Somehow always need a bag of treats before heading to the movie. Haven't purchased the meat/fish yet as it's a little pricey for me, but if I'm there for some unique eats and drinks, it works perfectly for me.   This is one chain that I'm a fan of :)"}
{"text":"Dean & Deluca is a fun place to browse if you're looking for specialty food items you can't find in your local Harris Teeter, like different types of pastas, sauces, oils, and herbs.  Although a bit on the high-end for my budget, they also have a lot of gourmet cheeses, deli meats, prepared salads and sushi, and desserts.   For special occasions, they have some of the most beautiful cakes I've ever seen which, too, are *quite* a bit higher-priced than your box o' Betty Crocker cake mix.   Their bottles of wines are usually pretty reasonably priced, though.   While strolling around Phillips Place before or after a movie (and I'm not in the mood for alcohol at the Dean & Deluca wine bar across the street), I like to pop into this Dean & Deluca for some coffee and a little carb treat.  Scone or muffin, anyone?  Conveniently, they have seating both indoors and outdoors, depending on the weather."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch. Salads and wraps are very fresh and delivered with enthusiasm and a smile.  Can't wait for a sunny day to enjoy the patio!  Could clear tables more quickly."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch the other day. Have to say, I was disappointed. Sandwich took forever to get and when it arrived as warm on outside but really cold inside. For the price I was expecting more. They have a pretty nice prepared food section but oddly no butcher shop to speak of. Reid's around the corner has both and better parking..."}
{"text":"A colleague and I ventured into the newly renovated and relocated wine room for lunch and were surprised to be the only people in the place when we arrived. They have revamped the menu which now has small plates as well as some larger entrees.  The new interior is more modern but they smartly chose much more comfortable seating- hooray!  They obviously have a lot of wine choices, but their flights are the most fun. For $14, you get to taste some great pre-selected wines. Wine for a lunch meeting? Don't mind if I do.  I tried the Around the World which was awesome!   But the highlight was that I was absolutely delighted by the excellent food!  My colleague got the delicious chicken, probably the most filling dish on the menu. But I had to try the scallops on french lentils and it was rich, perfectly seasoned and cooked and was absolutely divine.  I don't often rush out to get a $17 lunch, but it was absolutely worth it.  Perhaps the best scallops I've had other than the giant sweet ones from Clean Catch that I prepared at home.  I highly endorse the food.  The service was funny and attentive (the place started  getting busier as lunch wore on).  I look forward to going back for date night!"}
{"text":"Very cool place!  I love the new wine seating section they added! And that you have the opportunity to sit outside and enjoy some wine and food.  The shopping side is so unique, I love just walking through and seeing the new options they have, it's a lot of great things that you cannot find in your local grocery store.  I love the sandwich and meal options they have, they are all prepared fresh and out for you to see while being prepared.   Again, just like other reviews stated it can be a bit pricey but since the items are so unique and freshly made in my opinion they are worth the few extra bucks!"}
{"text":"After the first time going here, I could not stop going! It's more like a marketplace environment where you can order the food by weight. The atmosphere is very open and everyone was so friendly/helpful! Everything I've tried was so good, including the cheaper stuff on the end (mainly soups, and some pastas)."}
{"text":"A friend here said you must go here. Well that was some good advice. Nice size bar and plenty of tables spread throughout. Atmosphere very nice, they had 2 folks playing music that was a good mix and enjoyable. Started with a bottle of wine. I went for the scallops. They were delicious, quite large and full of flavor. Our server was top notch. Very attentive and kept the wine glasses full. They also had a full market attached to the place. All kinds of goodies to be had. we took some pies for the road. I had the pecan and was eating it on the plane, wanted to tell the pilot to do a fly by. I want more. We need this in Chicago. This is a must stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"They're open til 10pm on weekends which is nice.  Our movie at Phillips Place Stadium was sold out so we came in to grab a sandwich and easily killed an hour in the cafe area while waiting for the next showing.  On my next visit I'll browse the wine selection.  This is a great date spot with lots of hip young foot traffic."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to stop in for a bite. We started with the lobster rolls. I could see the lobster but didnt really taset it. I didn't care for thick dry buns and it wasn't exactly overflowing with filling. Next I ordered the Cuban sandwich and my husband ordered a beef dish I think. After about 15mins we were informed they were out of it. He ended up getting the pork dish. They food was ok but nothing special. The interior is nice and it was completely empty when we were there. I stopped in the store they have next store and picked out some delicious desserts to take home. I feel there are better places to grab lunch in the area but I'd  go back to pick up a dessert"}
{"text":"We had really bad service here recently. They treated us poorly and we will not be returning. All to steal a few bucks from us?"}
{"text":"Love the restaurant an ambiance but the waiter we had was horrible an did not make are 1st time there a pleasant memory. We're there for a birthday an we told the waiter we like sweeter wines like moscato an Riesling wines an he said okay repeated it back an walked off.  Didn't discuss or make suggestions offer a sample because we were planning on a bottle each. So he just brought us his selection an didn't tell us price until I asked. Didn tell us what the bottles were or about them. Just opened them up an poured.  He brought us a champagne an a semi dry Riesling. Neither of what we wanted when I said sweet. So that just killed are mood. We were not going to buy anything else. We'll after he delivered he disappeared when we said were not buying more. Took 30 min after we finished to get the check."}
{"text":"We stopped in last night to have one more glass of wine before heading home.  Since the weather was so nice, we decided to sit outside.  (It was a tough call though since they had some live music going indoors.)     The extensive wine list makes it difficult to choose... and they have a pretty good selection of brews too if you're in the mood for suds instead of vino.     The service was excellent and we had a great time!  This a is great spot to meet up with friends and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh how I've missed you! They didn't have D&D where I moved from and I absolutely love this place. Its fun to come have lunch, get some gourmet food, excellent coffee and wine  - and just hang. Beautiful outdoor seating that makes it feel a little less 'south' if you know what I mean ;)  If you are big city, like me you will love."}
{"text":"You can always depend on D&D (dungeons & dragons) for good coffee and sandwiches.  I know it is a million dollars, but it's good quality, so you let it slide.  They are offering omelets now, they have a little omelet station, a few toppings for $6., I couldn't believe my eyes.  I also had a great cup of coffee today too.  When we were leaving, they put out grill cheeses wrapped in paper to serve with a cup of soup.  What a great idea!  They also had some jars of soup for $11, just to remind you that you are at D&D!"}
{"text":"I agree with Dion...I ADORE Dean & Deluca, but boy oh boy, those prices...\"sticker shock\"!   I really enjoy coming here in the winter & getting some of their yummy soups (which change daily) & the delicious roasted sirloin sandwich.  Of course, I can't resist stopping by the snack / candy counter & getting the blackberry / raspberry candy.  I also like their fresh fruit.    I love the layout, it can be a bit of sensory overload, with the food selection, kitchen / cooking items & the candy / snack area.   I've used them in the past for catering & their presentation is  very professional."}
{"text":"Dean & Deluca is a wonderland of culinary vanity. Each time I come to this location, I want to re-peruse the aisles and find out what I don't need, but just absolutely want to have and flaunt in my kitchen. The grocery aspect of D&D is impressive and also impressively expensive! But, hey, it's not like you should do your weekly shopping here.   The coffee counter is pretty welcoming. Tons of drinks in the cooler. I love that they have glass bottled sun drop and cheerwine, tons of juices and other refreshments. The only downside? No Coke products. I'm a dyed in the wool coca cola fan and I need me a coke zero in the mornings! However, the coffee/espresso will suffice. Iced Americano is what I usually settle for and it has always delivered. Pretty pricey, but again its' Dean and Deluca.   This location is under the knife! Huge renovations happening and you can easily see how much expansion is happening. Lots more space and a wine bar coming here in the near future. Bear in mind that as this construction is going on for the next couple month, parking can be atrocious at times. Also, there isn't a really easy place to walk up to the entrance if you park around back near the construction side of the building. I've been parking on the opposite side of the building and walking down the sidewalk. Just a thought if you want to avoid any and all construction. Looking forward to seeing the finished renovation!"}
{"text":"Favorite!! Amazing food, so many options, healthy, fresh, absolutely delicious, and out of this world options for cooking, imbibing, satisfying those sweet indulgences (macaroons are out of this world), salads are my fav but if you need some carbs they have great sides, chips, etc...  Perfect wine spot and just bought some of the Kumi Tea Essentials which are fabulous!"}
{"text":"The perfect companion to the perfect culinary shop...  this place is kitty corner to the D&D Shop and serves appetizers, sushi, cheeses, fruit, hummas, etc along with an amazing wine collection, choose bottles right from the shelf to have popped or order flights off the menu..    a great place to hang out in the summer, there aren't a lot of tables outside, but if you snag one, you can kinda hang out all evening and people watch, chat, etc while you sip..  great place to go before or after a movie at the cinema located in the same plaza..."}
{"text":"Had a networking meeting here and it is a great atmosphere!  Loved it, going back soon I hope."}
{"text":"We stopped by after a movie matinee. The atmosphere is nice and the food is good, the service is just ok. It look several minutes to be greeted after we sat at the bar. We ordered the tuscan beans with crostini and the calamari.  Both were good. I don't know if the wine pour was a usual for them, but it was generous. It's a nice spot to hang out and for light fare."}
{"text":"Great wines. Sommelier was great in offering to try new wines. Atmosphere is very upscale and and romantic."}
{"text":"I have always loved Dean and Deluca. Their food is delicious and fresh and they have a lot of options. I typically get the medium salad with chicken which is $10.50/lb and mine usually comes out to around $11. Last night I got a salad here and when I went to check out the salad was $20!!! The guy put SO MANY toppings on it and then he also gave me six salad dressings.. SIX! I specifically told him this was a for here salad for me but he packed everything in there so tight my salad was two pounds. I was in such shock at the register that I paid for the salad but could not believe this. I have never had a salad that packed in there before, its like he was trying to make it cost more and I was pretty upset. I definitely should have spoken up while I was there but I just want everyone to be aware that the salads price can absolutely sneak up on you. Like I said, this has never been an issue with the same size salad at any other location, I was pretty disappointed as I did not plan on spending that much money on a salad. Of course, the salad was delicious and I could have saved half of it but I was on my way out for the evening and had nowhere to store it. I have learned my lesson."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the wine bar since it was moved acrcss the street to the market. I had heard it was not as cozy and warm as its past location bu I got lucky and was able to sit by the fireplace which seemed to warm things up a bit. The place is lofty with lots of windows. It does tend to make you feel like you're on display. I happened to be there during restaurant week and was able to order from the restaurant week menu. I had the pear/blue cheese/walnut salad, scallops with lentils that were drenched in butter (very good) and carrot cake for dessert. I was somewhat skeptical to order the from this menu because I wasn't sure it would be worth the $30. The portions were large and the food was good. I always love the wine flights here and had a white and red flight. Great chocie if you want to sample a few wines. Overall I like the new place but I still miss the coziness of the old place. I also wonder if they will be able to have live music here like they did at the other place."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice stop pre or post dinner or a movie?! Consider Dean & Deluca Wine Room. There's not more I can contribute that others have not already noted...  Like others have stated, they offer a variety of wines and edibles. Perfect for snacking and sipping over conversation!   Great use of space offering a \"just what I need\" time to relax and enjoy your company. It's classy, casual, dressy...you name it!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after dinner for a glass of wine and to relax since we had missed our movie.  I have to say my 5 stars is solely based on the wine!!  It was probably one of the best if not the best Pinot Noir I've had in a long time... the staff of 1 as it was a Tuesday night was a really nice guy and very attentive.  It has been really mild for winter and was relatively warm so we sat outside.  The 'bartender' made sure to take care of us even out there.  Definitely will go again and try more wines as well as maybe some of their tapas.  It's a great place for an after work wine-down :-)"}
{"text":"What a great place! Deli, bakery and sit down entrees for breakfast lunch and dinner! My husband and I went one morning for breakfast and both got the yummy applewood smoked bacon bfkt sandwich. It was SO good!! (just wish they used uncured meat, wah wah, oh well) While we were there we went and checked out their restaurant next door to the deli ( same building) which serves lunch and dinner, wine bar and daily drink specials. We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Wine  Friendly staff  Nice atmosphere  Bartenders and waitstaff are super nice. Always treated nicely no matter the time of day or occasion. Food is a little expensive but good. The best wine bar around!! I love this place."}
{"text":"3.5 rating - Staff was fairly rude.  We were a large party ~20.  Each of us ordered 2 small plates & at least 1 glass if not a bottle of wine.  We were in the corner towards the bar & restrooms.  The staff was a complete nightmare about us putting tables together to accomodate our party & not spread us across the restaurant.  We had called ahead to let them know & they had told us this would not be an issue.  We had 1 server & he acted as if it was an imposition to provide wine recommendations.  His attitude seemed to be just hurry up & make a selection already.  There were 2 other servers there who split the other tables.  The food itself was good.  The sushi rolls were a generous & one roll was enough for 2 people. I would have liked a little more sauce that was used. The rice was very sticky & definitely needed the wine to get it down.  Overall the taste & the combinations were good.  Sampled a bit of small plates from others - hummus was a ok, other sushi was good, & brushetta was standard.  Ambience was great.  Overall was a good experience.  With the sticky rice & service, giving it a 3.5 for now.  Looking forward to future visits."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  1) Awesome location at Phillips Place 2) Great for a SMALL group of girlfriends or on a date-- tables at D&D are always packed and it's not really a kind of place where standing around is cool/comfortable so get there early and stake out your spot! 3) I used to have really good sushi here but as I mentioned in my Nikko review, I think the sushi chef moved to Roosters. We used to sit at the bar hang out with the sushi makers and bartenders (winetenders?) and get special sushi made for us-- one time a flamer was involved! AWESOME. 4) People are so friendly! You will definitely make friends if you sit at the bar 5) Kind of a nice-dress place. Not fancy, but as Eric K. said, a little bit dressed up will be better than tshirt and jeans. Guys- khakis usually, girls- nice summer dresses or jeans, heels, and pretty tops. 6) Oh yes the wine-- it's good. You just keep drinking and drinking happily. Wine flights are okay...I prefer just picking one thing to drink, and then maybe trying something else afterwards. Flights are always popular though. It's cool that you can just buy a whole bottle there at retail price and they'll serve it to you, no corkage fee.   Definitely go. I bet the outside tables are nice when it's a pretty evening, but I usually like to sit inside. I wish they had D&D Wine Bar in other locations!!"}
{"text":"Went with the wife for a quiet night out Great place, they had live music at the right volume (you could speak) and tried the wine trios (red and white). Both pretty good. We shared some of the appetizers and loved the salads!  Staff was helpful and food came quick too. Def will be back."}
{"text":"This review is for their business catering services, as I have never dined at this location.  I spoke with Caitlin (I think, I am the worst with names, and this was a few weeks ago), who is in charge of their catering.  We needed breakfast, which I was going to pick up, and lunch, which needed to be delivered.  Going through the options and pricing, she made this a very easy process.  She was excellent with communication and everything was on time, well presented, and surprisingly at a comparable prices to other restaurants.    The boxes lunches were ooh'ed and aah'ed over, in particular the club sandwich which was huge.  I had the ham and brie sandwich, which was served on a pretzel roll, with the potato salad.  All was above average, but nothing that was amazing.  The cookies were fresh and good (and again, well priced for catering).    The breakfast (the Continental) though, left a lot to be desired - it was 90% croissants with only a couple of muffins and some sort of airy breakfast cookie (it tasted like a croissant cookie).   No danish, bagels or scones, which were what was listed on the catering menu.  It came with a fruit bowl and some OJ, which were both good, but for $120 (to serve 8-12), I expected more than a wicker tray filled with croissants.  The coffee also got high marks.  Overall, it was a positive experience.  Caitlin made the process easy, the food that was served was of good quality and fresh.  Delivery was on time and professional.  The price was typical of business lunch cost.  I would use Dean & Deluca for a business event again."}
{"text":"First time here, believe it or not! Nice wine flights as Nicole W has stated....decent Tapas style plates of food too. Got the Beef Sliders and the Arancinis. Both very good. Only warning....be careful, the bills adds up VERY quick because it's easy to order a bunch of apps and drinks which by themselves are not that expensive, but then, Voila! Your bill hits $100 quickly! Not complaining just be forwarned.....  I love the Dean & Deluca store. Expensive? You BETCHA! Great quality hard to find items like Cheeses, spices, etc.? Affirmative to that as well. BEST PREMIUM cheese selection in Charlotte. If there is better PLEASE TELL ME!"}
{"text":"Dean & Deluca is a civilized place. Classical music playing outside. Real dishes and silverware for those dining on the patio when I came for lunch yesterday. While Dean & Deluca's remodel is beautiful and their food upscale and consistently exceptional be wary of the cray lunch lines. Grab freshly made to go sushi or brave the sandwich/salad line - it will move faster than expected. This isn't a cheap lunch a salad could you run your $10 or $11- my favorite prime rib sandwich is huge but $8.50. No five dollar foot longs here. Dean & Deluca is always a great place to grab a delicous hostess gift and if you can't park by the store and their double patios just park around the corner in the deck behind the movie theatre and Upstream."}
{"text":"I don't think the quality is worth the exhorbitant prices, especially the sub-par bakery section. Can you say \"stale\"? Spend your hard-earned money at Earthfare for better price/value/quality."}
{"text":"I love D & D.  Everything is always delicious and fresh.  It's your one stop for movie snacks, a quick bit before you catch the latest Ryan Gosling flick or just a chill evening on the patio with friends and a bottle of wine.  D & D has a lot to offer from sandwiches and salads to massive brownies and lattes. I like going to Dean & Deluca when I want really good food without the fuss.  Just pick what you want at one of the counters, pay for it at the register and your done!   D&D also serves a pretty decadent breakfast.  I went for brunch the past Sunday.  The chocolate chip pancakes are amazing, packed with dark, milk and white chocolate and cooked to just crispy perfection."}
{"text":"Good selection of gourmet goodies. The guy in the meat/cheese department was helpful and friendly. Lots of bottled water and grab-n-go items.  On our way our some employees who, apparently, were recently off the clock, were yelling for each other both in the store and out in the parking lot ( \"HOPE, HOPE, HOPE...\"  I guess Hope has trouble hearing?) They were focused on speeding up and slowing down quickly in the parking lot and almost ran into our car."}
{"text":"I don't know if I would ever shop here again after buying a bag of chips for about $12, but it's always fun to stop in and check out all the cool stuff they have.  If I have the time I actually just take pictures or write notes of the stuff that I like there and try to find it around town for about 50-60% off. Now you might call me a cheapo but I'm not buying some chocolate for $80. Some items are however reasonably priced, check out the espresso bar it looks pretty decent!  Dean and Deluca I like you but I just can't afford you. However the quality of the items here is fairly high and there are always yummy samples around the store so it's worth a stop most of the time. My philosophy for shopping here is going to be eat $5 worth of samples before you buy the $10 product that should be priced at $5. Please don't judge me."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place, I find my self there more often then I want, the deserts are amazing, so many choices, the Deli is  awesome, the sushi bar is great, you can not go wrong with this place, if you want a formal dining you can sit at the full service restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this Dean and Deluca and drive out of my way when I am in Charlotte just to have lunch or dinner and do some shopping.  The prepared food case is amazing and changed frequently depending on what veggies are in season. Salads, sides, mains are all covered. They also have prepared sushi and a sandwich/panini section. All of the sandwiches can be pressed and I highly recommend you do that! There's also a bakery where you will find all sorts of cakes, cookies, brownies, macarons, etc etc. Oh and a coffee bar with cafe type of pastries as well.  The shopping is also great - everything you expect from a D&D - a crazy gourmet candy section, exotic pasta, sauces, spices, tea, cheese, meats and what not.  There is a large area inside for dining and also a few tables outside. They actually also have a Wine Bar/Restaurant but I haven't been there so I can't speak to it."}
{"text":"Charming upscale cafeteria-like cafe with speciality foods for purchase and wide variety of salads, sandwiches, pastries and drinks. If you're not in a hurry you can also sit in the wine room or espresso bar! I come here often for the \"create your own salad\" with fresh and filling ingredients!"}
{"text":"Caught them fraudulently misrepresenting a product again, scamming if you like.  All that talk about subs put me in the mood for a good NY style hero and I decided to treat myself at D &D. The board said : \"Italian Hero\", french bread, provolone, Genoa salami, spicy cappicola (or maybe it was Brescaiola?), and PARMA prosciutto w/oil & balsamic $9.50.  First thing I noticed was they didn't fold the meats, juts plopped them flat. The second thing I noticed is there was not enough meat to fold it - which explained the first thing The third thing I noticed was that I could not taste the Parma, so I take the sandwich apart and I find 1 slice of provolone, 4 of salami, two small of cappicola and one (1) slice of prosciutto, all of them super thin of course.    That cappicola was OK, the Genoa was the domestic generic type which didn't surprise me, but what did was the Parma was NOT Parma. It was colorless, tasteless, looked like paper the sandwich was wrapped in, the cheapest of the domestic imitations IOWs.   THIS is what Parma prosciutto  looks like: bright pink : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Prosciutto_di_Parma_-_affettato2.jpg/640px-Prosciutto_di_Parma_-_affettato2.jpg  I ate the transparent slice of prosciutto on its own and still could not taste any of it, you'd probably need a much thicker slice to get any flavor.   I went back inside and checked the cold cut counter and sure enough not one of their 4 types of prosciutto on display looked anything like it. So what you get in a D&D sub is a thin portion of cheap domestic cold cuts pretending to be imported.  I called the manager, he said he would talk to the chef about it (I smell bull) and refunded me. He also offered me a free lunch on the house which I turned down. I'm not looking for a freebie,  but when I buy a premium item I want to get what I paid for. Instead D&D mistook me for a sucker."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, D&D Wine Room wants to be a 5 Star Restaurant but misses the mark on many levels.  The ambiance is really nice.  The wine list is good as so is the food menu.  However, we recently went there for the Queen's Feast.  The clam chowder was excellent, the salad was not - way too much Olive Oil and not so much balsamic dressing.  The Steak came out with french fries - and we all through the steak was average. Unfortunately, the entree came out before we finished our first course - not a good sign.  And each time food was brought out the server had to ask who had what - I expect more from fine dining.  The deserts were good - especially the banana pudding but the portion was small.  It's a great place to go for after work for a glass of wine and maybe some appetizers but I can think of better places to go for dinner."}
{"text":"Let me just say that if you have to look at the price of goods, don't enter!!! Lol....This is a specialty store that is a step above a whole foods or fresh market. Personally for me, I love the baked goods and the eclectic mix of goods you don't find in other places. If you're a foodie you should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Decent coffee - far and away better than other chains. Excellent breakfast and lunch food."}
{"text":"Absolutely great! Located at the beautiful Phillips Place. Anytime I have guests in town I be sure to put this on the list of things to do! It makes me think of Chicago a bit when I go...great for small groups of people or a date...I have even went alone a couple times. If you know how to pair your wine with sushi you're gonna have a good time here. The wine selection is great...plenty of bottles to sort threw to take home as well. Very friendly staff...one nice big flat screen...if any sporting events are on during the day and you wanna go somewhere quiet, this would be a good pick, but sushi is only available starting at 5 I believe...however there is a limited lunch menu and the food is great. Outdoor seating is available, but limited. Great night time hang out."}
{"text":"Great lunch and seating outside. The wine bar is good, and the grocer is wonderful... I didn't know there were so many types of cheese in this world.  I love swinging through here to pick up dessert or some candy to sneak into the movie theater down the street!  Note: The Dean & Deluca wine bar, which used to be located across the street, is now attached to the grocery section of the store."}
{"text":"During lunch there are so many samples it's hard to not try them all.  My favorite from today was the raspberry honey mustard spread on pretzel sticks.  I got two small containers for lunch: one salmon salad and one couscous with dried fruit and cumquat called the \"jewel\" salad.  The salmon was very tender and the perfect texture, but the overall salad was too salty for my taste.  The couscous dish was the perfect balance to it with its slight sweetness.    Definitely ask for a sample before you get any container of a dish from the casing, the people behind the counter were very pleased to do so and pleasant!"}
{"text":"Please don't waste your time or money.  Fine to drop in for lunch-but... dinner is just an unfortunate experience.  Service is like a chicken with their head cut off --but not because they are slammed-just because it is a poorly managed experience.  It is no fun sitting without drinks--and I am not talking about the drinks we ordered because that never happened--just my glass of water I drank and then did not have anything left after I finished it for a good 15 minutes.  Husband went to bar to try and get drinks, but alas--that didn't work either.  We finally left with no input from manger (sent loyal customer to help us!!??) who was just as inept as entire scene.  Honestly made me a little sad-I really liked this pace before!"}
{"text":"I love Dean and Deluca in theory, but in practice they're kind of overpriced. I have no qualms about paying for quality, and there stuff is delicious, but it's not $80 a pound of whatever delicious. Their espresso bar is good, however, and not much for expensive than Starbucks, etc.  It's fun to occasionally go in and splurge on a single serving of something, but otherwise you can get the same quality for cheaper prices elsewhere."}
{"text":"I recently held a conference in Charlotte and needed the dreaded \"Boxed Lunch\" for 120 guests traveling on buses.  I could have ordered a wrapped sandwich with a cup of condiments, individually wrapped salt, pepper, mustard & mayonnaise, a cup of salad, a cup of fruit, individually wrapped plastic-ware, a wrapped cookie and a bottle of water all neatly crammed in a White Box that our guests are expected to unwrap, smear, spread, layer, open, stir and toss while bouncing said box on their closed-legged laps!  Dean & Deluca saved the day with their Bento Boxes! These things are Ahmazing! Everything you need while balancing just one simple container; just remove the lid! Filled with moist, tender and delicious morsels (about 7-9ounces) of beef or chicken, 3 fresh salads, a slice of cheesecake w/ brownie swirl and the cutest miniature salt & pepper casters nestled along with plastic-ware and a napkin and served with a unique soda.  IMPRESSIVE and Affordable...I SAVED over $2,000.00 by choosing Dean & Deluca's Bento (I suggest renaming them \"D\"ento) boxes had I chose to use the Westin Hotel to cater those aforementioned White Boxes.  These are my secret weapons now. ...I just wish there was a Dean & Deluca in Every City!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. They have a store attached to the restaurant where you can find all the ingredients. I love this place and I always go back!"}
{"text":"Guyd if you whant to dance salsa come here on Saturday and friday night is great the people here are very nice  The drink are cheap  i love to dance here me and my wife come here all the time after they close Cosmos Cafe"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. Food is average, store area is great asset. A fun venue, a little stuffy for me in the wine room.  Have a chance and see if you like it, the wife likes it so I try to."}
{"text":"After having a bad experience and informing the management, Dean and Deluca went above and beyond in improving my perception of the market.  Way to go!"}
{"text":"I SERIOUSLY LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Every time I'm in town, I have to make a stop here.  It reminds me of Atlanta's old Eatzi's.  Everything is good here!  You can design your own sandwich or salad, they roll fresh sushi, they have a case full of amazing dishes to be heated, and of course the amazing bakery & cheese area.  I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is pricey.  I really wish they would open a location in Atlanta, hint hint!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place to relax and unwind for the evening with their yummy moscato - Stev.   Venue - It's clean, classy, and comforting. I wish they turn on their fireplace and have it kept on everyday.. I just love the ambiance of it.  Price - pricey! Expect to shell it a little bit, when you want to dine or have a nice sip D&D.  Food - delicious.  I loved their creme brulee and calamari app.  Service - not the greatest.  I had a bad experience with mine, when it came to ordering food.  My waitress was slow to attend to me, and did not get back to me about a certain salami I had inquired about. I was disappointed.  So never again will I order anything other than the desserts.  Also, I will stick by the bar, where the bartenders are nice and will get me the wine I need, since it is literraly right behind them."}
{"text":"At first glance the place is trendy... and at the end of your experience you'll think the place is trendy... so basically its trendy all around. Your call if that's a plus of a minus for 'ya. It's a nice place to enjoy a couple of drinks with friends, go on a date, or just a Friday night dinner.   They have an excellent choice of wine by the glasses, beers and great appetizers. I particularly liked the goat cheese dates wrapped in bacon. Their menu has many good choices and everything I've had there has been very well prepared. I think the only beef I have with the menu is that they serve small portions (I'm again noting the original 'trendy' comment)... then again, I'm also a big eater :-/   The service was a little slow, but we were the only people out in the patio when we started, so I'm giving them a neutral rating on that one.   Overall my experience was good. I'd go back again and give it a second chance to earn at least another star."}
{"text":"I actually want to give them 3.5 stars. I came on a Friday night and was surprised that it wasn't as busy as I expected it to be. They didn't have a hostess so one of the servers seated us. We waited for about 15 minutes until our server greeted us at the table. While we were waiting, the table behind us with a party of 4 got up and left. While leaving they told us \"the service is not all that great.\" We didn't have to wait too long for our food to come out and once it came, food was hot and delicious! I ordered the paella which was filled with shrimp. The taste was just right! Overall, this place was a bit unorganized because we had 3 different servers tending to us. I did feel like we had to wait a bit for everything. From our orders to getting our checks to getting our check adjusted with the right orders, it was definitely a lot of wait time in between."}
{"text":"WInes by the glass change all the time.  A place where knowing about wine is helpful, but the choices are so well selected you won't make a mistake if you don't know anything.  The small plates are Really good.  Patio is great for people watching.  The wine flights are perfect for trying out new things! Love going here with girlfriends after a good movie right down the street(walking distance) at Phillips place theater."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that December would be a good time to have lunch on the patio at Dean and DeLuca?  That is what I did today and it was divine.   I love coming here to build my own salad.  I had the pear vinaigrette dressing and I could have sucked that up through a straw.  Even though it is a little pricey, the options for the salad bar and sandwich bar and sides are the best.  It's also a fabulous place to pick up a bottle of wine or some spices or other kitchen items.  The atmosphere here is trendy and there is usually a good number of patrons dining and shopping.  Definitely a winner in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The wine room is a great place to have a glass of wine before or after a movie or shopping. The outside patio is pleasant and the service is great."}
{"text":"Yeah, all these locations are excellent.  The know their stuff."}
{"text":"Good Irish cream latte though I will say I have been to this location twice and neither time were they friendly.  So watch out for the chill in the air.  The seating outside is beautiful with the water fountain right in front of it.  I have yet to try their food but the location is south park is much better!"}
{"text":"Went there for a afternoon lunch on a Saturday. It's really clean and the staff were welcoming an friendly. The food was great and the wine was wonderful. This is a great play for foodies or a now brunch with the girls. They have the items on the menu in the store which is a huge plus. Coming from Chicago where there are several now restaurants I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really cool place has a separate dining area with a separate menu but they have tons of options plus several free samples throughout store. They have great pastries and candies plus dips wines and pretty much something for everyone. You could spend a ton of time just walking around and looking at all the great items. I had a chicken caesar which was solid. Being from out of town its a cool place to bring guests and just a great experience. If visiting Charlotte I highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"North Carolina has 3 D & D and Chicago has zero? I love the grocery store attached to this place If I didn't just go nuts at Dillard's, I would have had room in my bags. We were there for a late dinner. I actually thought they were closed as it was just before 9. We started with a bottle of Parcel 141. I ordered the Chilean Seabass. Very light and flaky with a mild buttery taste. The server was on top of us for the whole meal. Aces to this place, as well as the eclectic mellow atmosphere. Very relaxing. We took a bourbon pecan pie and key lime to go as we had already eaten more than enough. Or was that drinking I was thinking of? Great place. Would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Worst service ever.  Such a beautiful place.   Sat outside for 20 min with no service.  Moved inside and had to go to bar to get wine. Waitress showed up 10 min later.  Will not come back until they change entire staff, other than bartender.  And no it wasn't busy"}
{"text":"Another date night and another couple of glasses of wine at this great little place.  Outdoor seating is still great this time of year as they mainly keep the inside WAY too cold during the warmer month."}
{"text":"I love to eat here and pick up specialty grocery items too. Their tuna salad with lemon zest in it is fab and so is the rotisserie chicken salad. My kids love to make custom sandwiches at the sandwich bar. I've never had anything here that wasn't delicious. It's trendy, upscale and just a great place to go."}
{"text":"Love D&D but not the prices! Wait till Whole Foods Market arrives area markets will really be hit. D&D will have to make some changes."}
{"text":"We love Dean and Deluca and head there often, especially the one in the Philips Place area. I tell you, everything there is so convenient, and there's everything: nice dining, cheap dining, movies, shopping. But I digress.   Dean and Deluca, too, is great for everything: gourmet shopping, prepared food, or a nice snack. My girlfriend always complains that it's too pricy, and she's kinda right: a small container of potato salad was like $10. But it's soooo good, and so hard to turn down.   I love their grilled chickens and their various salads: the salad bar is amazing, as are their tuna salads, eggs salads, pasta salads. If you're a lover of all types of salad, this place is perfect for you. It's your heaven.   This D and D is huge, so you can really stock up on every nice thing you need to fill a pantry or fridge (if you've got the bucks). Great coffees, too. It's the best, really. I go back too much."}
{"text":"Ok, ok yes! I am a square! This is my first time visiting Dean & Deluca. Of course the ambiance is amazing....classical music, beautiful food presentation. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. Anywho! Since I have the day off!!! Yay me! I decided to visit one of my Yelp Bookmarked locations for breakfast. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Bagel Breakfast Sandwich with a side of fruit. Seriousl!!!! I just Died 5 deaths....this Bagel Sandwich is Sooo flavorful....  I'm a sucker for smoked salmon!!!! Ugh!! Also its topped with egg, Fresh arugula and hollandaise sauce! Holy cow #FoodPorn #MyLifeIsComplete Needless to say I am highly impressed"}
{"text":"They do have consistently good salads, sandwiches, & coffee.  The gourmet takeouts are hit or miss."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan, however I can only make it to D&D occasionally.... mostly due to it's location.... but it can get pricey too.  Awesome selection of prepared  food - I like that you can eat it there or take it home to share for parties (or hoard for yourself - which I mostly do).  I wish I cooked at home more, but they have a great selection of items that you can't find in the regular grocery store.  Makes me want to aspire to one day know how to cook well.  I do want to mention that I had this strange feeling when I first walked in of someone yelling, \"Your Challenge Begins NOW\" and I had this overwhelming urge to run into the stores and think up of a signature dish.   Been watching too much Top Chef/Chopped/Hell's Kitchen/Cooking Channel ....."}
{"text":"Gourmet delicious goods. Excellent quality. A bit pricey with certain things, but you get what you pay for.   I'm here a lot. I used to come here every morning for coffee. I have since changed my routine and moved over to whole foods because the delicious pastries and breakfasts at Dean and Deluca are just too tempting. But that's a credit to the quality of Dean and Deluca.   I don't really do grocery shopping at dean and deluca. I come here for the espresso drinks, pastries, omelets, gourmet sandwiches and soups, sometimes the sushi, and the desserts. I'm in and out a lot depending on my craving.   The staff is super friendly and Dean and Deluca underwent a major renovation since first moving here. The end result was amazing.   It's also a fun shopping experience here, wandering around and looking at all of the great options that you don't see everyday in other grocery stores.   The food bar, bakery, sandwich and salads and espressos are my favorites.   Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"D&D should change their name to Tren-D.  Another place to see and be seen, but fun once in a while.  They have a decent by-the-glass selection but the actual bottle wine selection is a bit limited and not very adventurous.  I know the space is limited, but I'd like to see some more interesting choices - especially in whites or rose's.  I do like that they have inexpensive and moderately-priced selections.  The staff can be selectively nice or not but almost always a bit distant.  The small bites are not great, but the sausage tray was a fun choice.  The patio area is great in good weather."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a coffee.  Nice and clean with delicious (if overpriced) desserts."}
{"text":"This place is expensive.  Really expensive.  Expect everything thing here to be \"boutique\" quality and that means you're going to pay out the nose.  $80/lb of chocolate.  $12 snacks.  $6 coffee.  Now if you ignore price, it's a nice place.  Its sanitation rating was not nearly as high as I thought an upscale place would be (92) and it was a little bit less organized than I imagined, I guess to maintain that \"boutique\" feel.  It's also one of the only places that you can buy Christopher Elbow chocolates in North Carolina."}
{"text":"We visited after dinner last weekend and absolutely loved it.  We even fell in love with a new wine (Laurel Glenn (Cab)).  It's less than $40 and rivals that of Silver Oak.  Highly impressed.  We also sampled a Pinot flight which was exactly what I needed after the wine I had already enjoyed!  Love the set up... Love the staff... Love the wine.  Perfect fit for the neighborhood!  Can't wait to go back!  (One hope is that they will get a good Chianti)"}
{"text":"When I lived in Washington DC, I was a Dean and a Deluca regular so I was delighted to see one in Charlotte. The layout of the store is great! The dry food products are in the front. The deli, prepared foods, and pastries are on the perimeter and seating is in the middle. It felt very comfortable because there was plenty of seating inside and outside. The only issue is the parking. Parking can get really full especially on a Sunday but there is parking on the opposite side near the movie theatre. Service was amazing as always like at their other locations. Definitely stop by if you're in Charlotte because the next closest location is Washington DC!"}
{"text":"I try to stop by D&D during my Charlotte business trips because the selection is super fresh and absolutely delicious.  The price can be high, but it's worth spending when you can get such quality products.  Alas, my favorite is their dessert section.  They have specialty desserts (e.g., cupcakes, cheesecakes) in one location and a small pastry selection near the check-out register.  I feel the desserts are very reasonably price.  Even if you don't go to D&D's for a full meal, swing by for coffee and dessert - you will NOT be disappointed.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"An ode to my dear Dean & Deluca,  Oh Dean how I adore thee, And your $6 bag of tiramisu caramels, how I wish they were free.  I like to visit you before I head into a movie, And smuggle in a chai latte, that's super duper groovy.   You are a chain but I don't mind too much, Because you continuously offer me a filling, tasty lunch.   Yes you're expensive but I love your free snacks,  I sometimes pretend it's a buffet and initiate my attack.   I know I'll be back to partake in some eats, And probably leave with a bag full of treats."}
{"text":"Mixed experience here. Had we just stayed on the market side it would be fine. We bought dessert and a coffee and headed into the wine bar. A server told us to wait for the hostess and the hostess said we made a grave error by attempting to get a table while already having food. They would have to plate the food and pour the coffee into mug since they were a full service side. And that's fine, it's just the tone she used that really set us off. She suggested we grab some wine and take it back into the market. We passed and went into the market to eat and got more coffee. It worked out fine and the dessert was great. There are a lot of great items in the market that are hard to find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sushi can be hit or miss here depending on the chef, the hummus, tomato/basil/mozzarella napoleon and the tuna crisp are all excellent.  Nice wine flights and outside seating.  Also the people watching here is excellent, you see some real characters and peacocks.  Sushi is generally better than Upstream next door."}
{"text":"It PAINS me to write this review! I worked at this location part-time throughout high school and summer breaks from college for 4 years!! I mean, I am basically D&D's biggest fan, and I will go back for sure, but most likely not to the wine bar.  I LOVED the wine bar when it was across the street.  The service was excellent, personable, and consistent. I also noticed that the same staff had been there for a long time which is always a great sign.   I went last night with a group of girls for my friend's birthday.  Our waitress was extremely scatterbrained and pretty much all over the place.  She kept mixing up our orders, didn't bring us water, utensils, she forgot our friend's ketchup for her COLD fries, and I never got the crab stuffed mushrooms that I ordered.  That said, the crab cake salad and heart of palm salad were delicious.  The food was good, but the service was bad enough for me to not want to return.   D&D, you could have a really good thing, but something needs to change."}
{"text":"Be prepared to spend some most to eat here, but it's a great place to go for foodies who like to try new things. Choose carefully though, not everything is actually as good as it looks.  We had lunch and shared a turtle brownie brownie. Brownie was rather tasteless, considering the price, very sparse on nuts. Not worth the price or the calories."}
{"text":"Extra star for the amazing short rib sandwich from the deli counter. The rest of the store is whatever. They did have a lot of samples to try, and all were pretty tasty. A Japanese couple asked me to get two jars of yuzu marmalade off a high shelf. Hmm Yuzu marmalade? Sounds interesting. I turned over the jar to discover a $25 price tag. Wow. Just wow."}
{"text":"If there was a zero stars this place deserves it for the unprofessional management I recently paid 329.00 dollars for food I had ordered  here. I failed to check my order as I was 8 months pregnant carrying the order to my car. I chose to order from this place because I had an important dinner I wanted to have ready for my guest but when I arrived home the sushi that was suppose to go with the picture in the menu was not in the basket. I called and spoke to the catering manager and he told me that it was my fault and that he couldn't do anything about it. My guest had already arrived and I couldn't do a thing about it it but send my daughter back into rush hour traffic to get the rest of the food to go with the basket. The treatment I got from the staff and the catering person from this place was beyond my belief. Not only were they unapologetic but they just gave me the sushi off their ready made shelf and acted like they were doing me a favor by giving it to me like I was the one in the wrong. I ordered the food according to their pictures but the product did not come out as they posted and they blamed me for their mistakes. They charged 160.00 for the crap basket they faked and yell at their customers for their own mistakes. Why would a basket come with shrimp, chicken , wasabi, and ginger soy sauce  and no sushi. I called and left a message for the management but no one called back go figure.  Thanks for wasting my time and money"}
{"text":"LOVE the create your own salad. But no wifi or outlets? Would love to come work here but don't think that will be possible :("}
{"text":"I try to stay away , not bc they aren't the best bc they will drain my wallet  I'll come here for a healthy omelet or filling salad . Their wine and cheese selection is wonderful too. I asked the young lady at the register how she can resist eating all the delicious food samples, there's  something about spice jam and brie cheese on a grain cracker. Nom nom"}
{"text":"Design and ambiance: 4 stars;  Coffee and dessert: 4 stars;  Service: 4 stars;  Food: 3.5 stars.  Do you know that they have live music at Dean & Deluca on Phillip's Place? Well, I did not! Now, I do and did you know that they're actually alright? Not all the musicians are up in NoDa or Blumenthal.  The table we got was by the door so it was a bit chilly but I was fatigued from a business trip so it might not have been actually cold. The lighting here is just right for you to have a private conversation and not feel like everyone can see your expressions. There are enough folks here talking to mask your conspiracies as well.  The short-rib I got for dinner was not the best, but the wife's crabcake was better. I still like red meat better so no regrets. The calamari was just right for a starter, but the crown goes to the cheesecake and coffee. They were fantaaastic! (Insert Trump)"}
{"text":"I thought I'd write a short update to D&D Wine Room....  Thursday night Hubster and I went here for a glass-o-vino and to celebrate three things.  Me, My birthday, and the weekend.  LOL! I love everyone here.  So friendly, so nice, and....is that someone playing an acoustic guitar??  Such a wonderful touch!!  Sitting on the patio underneath the trees lined with white Christmas lights and listening to the amazing singer sing \"Marry Me\" almost brought me to tears.  It's the simple things in life....  I heart you D&D wine room....thank you for a great Thursday night!"}
{"text":"I haven't had their grocer meals but the restaurant leaves something to be desired. With regard to their entrees, it's a bit too expensive for their quality. I had the shrimp and grits and it was...not good. They significantly overcook their shrimp. The spaghetti and mussels were pretty good though."}
{"text":"Ah, the 90s. Pre-locavore. Every epicurean item from every corner of the globe, available for purchase and consumption without regard for seasons, distances, expense, or appearing PC. Dean and Deluca rocks that decade with panache, and not even an inkling of shame. Awesome.  Nevermind that the cheeses have no prices posted. Nevermind that things here (vinegar, certain brands of truffle oil, falafel chips, bouillion) are twice as much as they are at neighboring and (shockingly) more affordable Earth Fare, even. Prices carefully tucked under the bottom of jars, bags, boxes, as if displaying them prominently would be garish or uncouth - this is not a bargain hunter's place to shop. Small, selective section of kitchen implements - not meant to be of use in dire need, but trends - microplanes and zesters, mezzalunas. Spotless shelves in perfect order. Truffled products of every imaginable use - nori salt - the olive bar might be the only thing here leaning towards pedestrian. Chico-and-Nordstrom's-clad ladies abound. Service can be icy, but always well informed. Is the coffee superlative? Not at all, but it's not obscenely priced either.  A quick note on the cheese counter - large and global, and the few times I've bought a hunk, it had obviously been well cared for, but EF's, down the street, is larger and more locally focused. Go there instead.  Would I shop here regularly? If I made so much money that a 50 percent mark up on standard exotics didn't ruffle my feathers, maybe. It's clean, classy, well staffed, culinarily inspiring. Do I come here now? For a very short list of things sold here and no where else in Charlotte, I do. But wise shoppers know where to buy those falafel chips and truffle oils for half the price. For the most part, I'll be with them."}
{"text":"On a business trip, my colleagues and I stopped at Dean & Deluca twice: the first time for lunch, the second time for wine happy hour.  I had never been to a D&D, and I balked at having lunch there since my impression was that it was a fancier Starbucks, i.e., I didn't want to go broke buying a coffee and a microwaved sandwich. However my coworker raved about it and swore us two ladies would love it, so we went.   I absolutely LOVED it. It is a gorgeous environment, all loaded with (admittedly overpriced) specialty food items, gourmet bakery delights, candies, cheeses, a hot food bar, a luscious salad bar - and wine. LOTS of wine. If you're a oenophile (I am not; my two companions are), then you will likely be as delighted about the wine selection as they were. I had one of their weighted salads (I selected grilled chilled shrimp, goat cheese, artichokes, sundried tomatoes - a few of my favorite things!), and it came to about $11. I thought it was insanely delicious, and for those kinds of toppings not unreasonable at all (I've bought those things separately at a regular grocery for  similar salads at-home and the cost is gargantuan). I absolutely loved their salad selection.  My companions enjoyed their sandwiches immensely (and cracked open a bottle of vino as well to enjoy). My wretched diet prevented me from sinking into one of those lovely single-serve desserts on display - but damn I was tempted.  We returned the next day for wine happy hour with the rest of the office. The wine room was packed and weren't able to accommodate our party of seven. However, a super-nice young waiter (I want to say his name was Ahmad - he had a faux hawk and lovely manners) was more than solicitous, helping us pull together several tables and chairs, and timely popping around to serve us impeccably. (My knowledge of wine and how it should be served is nonexistent, so I can't wax eloquence about it. However, I was at a table of PASSIONATE wine lovers and they raved about the two reds ordered and didn't make a peep about service so I'm guessing it had to have been very good).   I'm not a wine drinker myself, so I sipped on a yummy diet cream soda (never seen the brand in a Kroger or Target myself - even the diet soda seemed exotic and fancy), and nibbled with restrained gluttony on the delicious cheese plates (rich, creamy, pungent, salty, fragrant cheese with names I can't pronounce). Prices were on the higher end, but the service and atmosphere were just so serenely luxurious that I can even forgive D&D for not carrying my top wine selection (a $5.99 bottle of Barefoot Moscato).   Overall, I loved D&D. I heard that we used to have one in Cincinnati, and I'd be quite happy if they ever thought to return back to the Queen City. Probably better for my budget that they don't though..."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service! The fellas here were super friendly and extremely accommodating. I raved lot about the amazing lunch burger they have to my friend, only for us to get there and discover it was not apart of the dinner menu.  The manager told us it wasn't a problem, he'd make sure we got \"The Burger\" as well as the truffle fries (YES!). We went on a Friday night and they had live music which was also amazing and entertaining! Love this place and would definitely recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I really love that this place is here & you can find speciality items that normal grocers don't carry. I was able to find some products I've had my eye on for a long time(the coconut cult probiotic yogurt)& ghee butter by fourth & heart.   I love that this place is close by but omg it's expensive. I was so excited to find the goods but was also shock on how expensive they were. But overall I do plan to go back & try their deli. The fresh food looked & smelled soooo good!! It's a must I go back"}
{"text":"If you're used to the \"right coast\" or \"left coast\" locations of this place, you'll be sadly disappointed by Charlotte's offerings. Super small, minimal selection, and their pastry items tend to run on the stale side of  \"a day old.\""}
{"text":"I normally get the caesar salad and love it. We decided to eat a quick dinner there before we went to a movie and I decided to try something different. I got half of a chicken quesadilla and a small serving of butternut squash ravioli. My boyfriend got the twice baked potato. We asked for all of our items to be heated up and they were thrown in the microwave for random times. While my quesadilla was hot, my boyfriends potato was barely room temperature. While it wasn't the worst thing ever, it simply tasted like microwaved food and cost $25. Definitely not worth that price. Next time I will stick with my normal caesar salad.   On a positive note, we went into the wine room. I enjoyed a glass of Riesling and my boyfriend got a Malbec blend. We both enjoyed it and the bartender was very nice."}
{"text":"Got an amaxing roast beef sandwich from the sandwich bar - made to order.  Coffee was excellent as well.  Looking through their market section & had a question - Brittany was just walking by but was quite helpful."}
{"text":"One word...CRABCAKES! We bought 8: freshly made, delicious, & mouthwatering. Took them home, sauteed them in a little butter, and added a special sauce  They are a little higher in price than other places that may sell them, but these sell out quickly when they are made fresh the morning of (by lunchtime I find they are usually out!) so if you don't live close by I recommend calling ahead to see if they have any freshly made that day! yummy"}
{"text":"If anyone has anything bad to say about this place they are out of there mind! Everything here is phenomenal! Yes something are a bit pricey but worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"I always stop in for a delicious sandwich before a movie. But, like an abusive relationship, I keep coming back for the hot sandwiches no matter how many times I get burned by the customer service."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Has a great selection of everything! There's a bakery, fresh foods for on the go, some fine groceries& even a area for candy& other treats. The only downfall is that their sushi sucks which I don't understand because EVERYTHING else is great. I always get there zucchini chocolate muffin. And always stop here for lunch. So happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"This review is for sandwich over the deli counter. They make a fresh sandwich, panini and wrap. Ordered turkey avocado sandwich and cajun chicken panini. It was fresh and healthy. But the price is a bit high. 4 stars for food and 3 stars for the price. Still it is understandable as this is kinda high-end grocery store. They have enough seats inside and outdoor as well. Good place for grabbing a lunch who works nearby."}
{"text":"There is more candy and sweets here than you can possibly eat by yourself, so bring a friend (or two)!!  The location is one of the best I've seen. It is in a very upscale neighborhood and isn't littered with people who are discount shopping.  They have some really great selections for lunch and dinner.  I'd recommend the 3 selection dinner box for 14 dollars. It is the best price for for the amount of food you get. Be aware that you can sample any of the food on the line!!  Just ask!  The place is very clean and has three options for dining.  You can eat outside, inside in a more cafeteria type setting, or in the more formal restaurant area.  There is more wine and beer here than you can possible imagine!  You can even buy single bottles of beer to have with your dinner if you choose.  The coffee is fantastic and the wine is even better.  Don't forget to grab some deserts when your done eating.   Oh, they also have a large shopping area filled with kitchen items and food preparation supplies.  My fav part is their olive bar!  It rivals Harris Teeter!   Stop in for the best experience you can hope for with food!!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"What a nice place. wish there was a bit of better explanation of what to do but it tasted wonderful. A bit pricey but I could tell that when I walked in. I really enjoyed the food though"}
{"text":"So this place is super fancy. And get ready to shell out the $$$ for the average meal or drink. But having said that, I had the greatest experience here. New in town, I stopped in here with a book one sweltering summer's day, and flipped through my pages over a delicious glass of sweet tea. When I was ready to leave, I asked for the check, put away my book, opened the little black cheque holder, and found a little note saying 'Have a nice day! :)'. It made my night."}
{"text":"Bought cheese, breads, and Pate, and Apple Turnover!! Gosh, this place is awesome!! the cheese were awesome!! Bread, fresh and piping hot! Pate, Gah!!! So Yummy!! and the Apple Turnover was delicious ( It tasted like apple pie, but it has bit of cinnamon which remind me of christmas) so it and happy day for me!!"}
{"text":"What a treat this location is. I know I have reviewed the downtown location, with only 3 stars, Phillips Place definitely outdoes it. With the food, bakery, and wine selection this store is a true gem. I wandered the aisles to check things out and decided to hit the food bar and ordered the chicken wrap, which was so delicious! And pretty big, I was definitely full! I also love the new wine bar and outside seating area, and I look forward to going back on a nice afternoon early evening."}
{"text":"They oft times have hard to get ingredients, at a huge price premium.  Coffee tastes like hot dishwater.  They let go Regina, the cheese/charcuterie lady and killed the meat and fish department.  Shot Gary from the wine property/restaurant across the street. Not a whole lotta reason to go anymore but they can sponsor a shitty golf tournament."}
{"text":"Bartenders are really friendly, helpful and know their wines. Food is really good too, with a changing seasonal menu. Don't be afraid to ask for suggestions, the staff is excellent as suggesting new things to try. My favorite neighborhood stop."}
{"text":"The selection of wine is both tasteful and extensive. I only had a small Asian salad however it was one of the best I have ever had everything was fresh crisp and delicious."}
{"text":"The Dean & Deluca wine room never fails to deliver some of the very best food in Charlotte. No pretense, just really great quality food with a creative flair, and good spirited and attentive service. And they recently added valet parking making a visit to Phillips Place on a Fri or Saturday night seamless."}
{"text":"Review of Sandwich/Salad area* I'm usually a D&D fan but this place is flat out not good. Went earlier this year, the sandwich/salad area wasn't very clean and the food quality was poor, which is shocking for a D&D. Went back with my wife on Saturday because we thought they may have just been having a bad day the first time. Sadly, this experience was so bad that a review was warranted. The two sandwich guys were rude/weird, the prep station was filthy, the food in the bins looked old/empty, and the sandwiches we ordered were getting slapped together haphazardly in a very messy fashion. When we saw the rind was left on the slices of brie going on the sandwich we simply walked out, leaving the other items we had planned on purchasing on the counter."}
{"text":"What a great concept.  I love places like this.  A swanky grocery store that has great food with quality ingredients.  It's basically a shop where you can order from the deli, and they have ginormous amounts of salads and other things you can sample and then buy by the pound. I went and had an empanada, a small sushi box, and some spaghetti squash.  Oh man, the squash was so smooth.  The workers behind the counters were friendly, and maybe it was complete luck, but the girl scooped exactly .25 lb of the squash into the bowl (I guess including the weight of the bowl) but still, i was fairly impressed. They also have a ton of great drinks like Saranac cream soda, dr roberts, izze, etc.  It is kinda expensive, but it's good food, so it's worth a splurge now and then."}
{"text":"Overly expensive  OK, we live overseas so many of the foodstuffs at this place are not that exotic to us.    In any case, it does look like a nice selection of deli meats and cheeses.  Three of us had two apps and several glasses of wine apiece.  Bill came to $150.  Fairly scandalous in my view.  Wine prices even higher than Paris or London.  And your view is a surface parking lot and not the Seine.   Macarons $4 apiece.  They only cost 2 in Paris and 1 in the rest of the country.  Anyway, if I lived here I doubt I'd hang here much.  There must be a lot better value for the $$$ at other wine bars."}
{"text":"There's something about Phillip's Place that reminds me of my beloved home in California.  The outdoor style, old towne construction and lo and behold, a Dean and Deluca!  I love Dean and Deluca.  It's a foodie's paradise packed into a small, navigable shop.  You have your ready-to-eat/deli, your barista, your bakery,  your confectionery, your butcher, cheese etc. all in one place.  The best part: the staff are knowledgeable and friendly, plus you get to taste samples.  I used to turn my nose up at ready-made dips or sauces, but this place has some great ones.  Try the Bread and Butter Pickle Jalapeno Dip by Fiesta - mix that with some cream cheese and you've got one tasty dip!  Make sure you don't accidentally buy the overly spicy Texas Longhorn brand.  Their Roasted Red Pepper and Onion dip is delicious too.    If you're looking for a hard to find vinegar, oil or seasoning - chances are, you'll find them at Dean and Deluca (albeit at a slightly higher price point).  I like buying bread there and on my way out, I grab a Chai latte - they make the best!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this establishment today. For the record, we have visited Dean & Deluca's on numerous occasions. We wanted to grab an appetizer and a drink before heading over to take in a movie, so we went to the bar. The facility is very clean and the ambiance is great. We sat at the bar, because we knew we were not going to be there long. The server helped us with our drinks and seemed to be very cordial. I ordered a Red Wine and my Husband ordered Moscato. Which were great choices for us both. Our appetizer was calamari and it was cooked to perfection. Why the 1 star? Well, while leaving, the server brought the cook out to the bar area, and they were speaking unprofessionally about their Patrons...Us! I don't know why, because We ALWAYS leave a 20% tip wherever we dine, and are never mean to the staff, for fear of them spitting in our food. My husband wanted to confront them, but I said it wasn't worth it. Dean and Deluca's, please hire more professional staff. Your staff is representing you, and it wasn't a good look   at all Sunday August 20th 2017 at 1:15 pm."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe that anyone would give this place a 4 or (gasp!) 5 star rating! I work in NYC where wine bars are a dime a dozen and I have the luxury of checking many of them out so my expectations are admittedly high. However, there is no excuse for such poor service. This is not my first trip here...it's my 3rd and service is consistently POOR. Arrived mid day on a Sunday to meet 2 friends. Bar was empty sans a handful of people. Bartender was inattentive to start and had to flag her down each and every time. Almost appeared to be an inconvenience for her to wait on us. We ordered several small bites to share including the French cheese plate. When she dropped the plates off without a word we called her back and asked her to explain what cheeses were which. She clearly did not know and then proceeded to identify the cheeses (using the menu!) for the European cheese plate. Ummm....wrong cheese plate! She never checked back to see how our food was and after we asked twice for the check she literally \"dropped\" it on the bar in front if us.   Now regarding the food...cheese plate small and disappointing...bread wasn't worth the chew. White bean dip was great and so was the gazpacho.  I'll be back to D&D but not to the wine room!"}
{"text":"First time here and never knew it was a market ! The place is clean, beautifully stocked with amazing colors and signs, and easy to move around. The place can be a bit confusing for newbies with understanding how and where to order, pay, etc. If you are new and in a rush this may not be the place for you only because figuring out the menu and their offerings can take a minute, but it's all good once you get the hang of it. There is plenty of patio seating for a beautiful day. The customer service is great, they really know their stuff and they will help you with whatever you need. And of course the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I stopped by here not too long before closing, so I didn't get to check out all of the specialty items they have for sale, but I will definitely be back. I went straight for the sweet baked goodies. This trip I bought two of their 4\" mini cakes. I wish a vanilla option was available. I chose the lemon and chocolate cakes.   This was my first time at the South Park location and it didn't disappoint. I walked past the food buffet on my way to the register, tempted to stop and take a closer look but I was on a snack mission. I wouldn't let anything deter me. I will be back earlier to buy more of their high priced offerings."}
