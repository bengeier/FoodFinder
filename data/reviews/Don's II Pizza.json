{"text":"This place made me the worst pizza I've  ever had.  My family and I are not picky at all, but it tasted like cardboard with ketchup on top. Also too expensive and not so friendly service to boot. No thanks!"}

{"text":"I read the two reviews before driving 30 minutes to cash in my $30 Double Take deal.  And after going there and checking out their website, I think Brenda (with only this review) may be an employee because her review is word for word from Don's II's website.  That being said, I don't agree with the one star review either.  

The staff was friendly and helped me with ordering since I wanted to try different things.  I ordered a large pepperoni pizza, a medium special pizza (Mom's Special) and a full Italian Hoagie.  Don's has some good looking daily specials.  When ordering specialty pizzas, they are listed in sizes M L and XL - no small.  

The pepperoni pizza was nothing fancy, just okay.  The Mom's Special, though, with garlic sauce, feta cheese, sausage and banana peppers was very good.  I liked the thin crust and thought it had great flavor.  It definitely stood up to all the toppings like a champ.  The Italian Hoagie was also a winner.  

I did think the prices were a little steep.  I'd recommend the specialty pizzas and the hoagie in a pinch.  But would I drive 30 minutes again?  Probably not."}
