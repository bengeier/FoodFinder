{"text":"Since my colleagues asked for the Persian food, I brought them all the way from down town to this place but left regretful in front of them:
One of choices in the menu was replacing the rice with salad and when one of the group member asked for that they brought the whole salad in addition to his food and charged for both, for other group member they brought a type of Kebab different from what he ordered and since we were waiting long he ignored to ask them change it again and at the end they didn't bring the rest of money to those who paid them cash. Since all these mistakes cost us more (and not them), I don't believe they were just mistakes. Neither me nor my colleagues were satisfied and won't go back their anymore!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible here and food is just OK, you can have much much better Iranian food in Toronto. 
My plate was a mess like I had 3 different pieces of Koobide from others leftovers! I asked the waiteress to change my Koobideh, she brought back an icy cold Koonideh like it was right from the fridge!!! I told the manager what happened she took the plate and brought me back my food heated in microwave!!!"}
{"text":"We had our lunch there. Same as every time I ordered \"Soltani\" (Soltani is beef kebab and kobideh and rice). I believe this is the best of Their menu. 
For starter we ordered Mirza ghasemi and Shirazi Salad. Mirza Ghasemi is made with eggplant and egg. Shirazi Salad is mix of diced cucumber and tomato and onion with olive oil and lemon dressing. 
This combination just complete with Dogh (Yogurt Drink). Good news is they bake fresh bread and we had out appetizer with fresh bread.
If you like persian food, I can say this is one of the best Iranian restaurant in Toronto.
Service was good"}
{"text":"Classic inconsistent Persian restaurant. 
Some days it's horrible. Some days it's great. 

Something is up with Persian restaurant service. What's with the attitude? 

On the good days, food is good. No complaints. 
Just hope you get the good day and not an evil waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible. 

I came across this article in the March edition of Neighborhood News and thought I would share. 

\"it was inspected Feb. 1 when one inspection item was found not in compliance (equipment, none food contact surfaces and/or linen were not satisfactorily maintained, constructed, installed and accessible for cleaning, and one item was corrected during inspection (proper storage of clean utensils unsatisfactory)."}

Shomal means \"north\" in Farsi. Persians also call the northern part of the country 'Shomal'. The restaurant is neatly decorated to resemble the village of northern Iran and in that it is successful. The food is the typical food served in most Persian restaurants. And I would recommend the eggplant dish for appetizer and either of the ground beef or chicken kabobs as the main. I have been to Shomal on numerous occasion and the Kabobs are consistently delicious and very moist. Shomal is also consistent in having mediocre service. So don't be surprised if you're waiting for up to 20-30 min for service or even to get your bill at the end. Bottom line, if you're into food and willing to overlook the not so great service, then you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Best Persian restaurant in the GTA by far.

My boyfriend (a Persian man) introduced me to this restaurant in the early days of dating so we've been coming to Shomal for the past three years. I have been eating persian food for much longer than that though, so I knew that the food would be excellent. I am a huge fan of persian food and its variety of meals. We live in Milton and this place is pretty far for us, but we make an effort to go at least once every other month. Every time we come here, we receive great service and great food.

My favourites are:

- mustokhiar
- koobideh
- joojeh
- soltani
- barg

Without fail, every time we come here the food is just excellent. Let's not even mention how large the portions are! We always get half of our food to go because it's just too much to eat. There have been a couple of instances whereby the server was a bit slower than usual but that's ok. It's still worth coming here.

All in all, this restaurant deserves a rating of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Loved all the portion and service and great meal. nice decor.
I like eggplant appetizer and marinated steaks with rice."}
{"text":"We ordered food for kids at this place first as they were hungry. It took 45 minutes for the kids food to arrive . It was cold to touch but we didn't want to delay it further so didn't send it back. By then kids had munched on bread When we complained to the server about lateness of service she said its because they are renovating the kitchen. I ordered a pitcher of \"Dough\" this is a yogurt drink with herbs. I found a huge live cockroach swimming in it. It was utterly disgusting. When I showed it to the manager she began to argue with us that the big bug is not cockroach but a moth, I pointed out that the creature has no wings and couldn't have flown into my drink.
When we asked for the bill, she had the audacity to charge us for the cockroach infested dough. Don't go here, food is over priced and service is bad. They don't care about the cleanliness either. J"}
{"text":"Amazing kebab, amazing barg...especially the one marinated in pomegranite...

the kashk bademjan is to die for... as well as the other appetizers. 

Really cool decor, and good service. My fav for persian!"}
{"text":"Perfect Food...friendly staff...
Just Awesome...my recommendations: Kabab with Pom & walnut (Kabab torsh)
so heavenly! had food there every time visited Toronto..."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Persian food, and I must say, I'm a fan. I'd recommend the dill rice, and the lamb shank. It was really tender, and everything tasted down right good. I just sort of wasn't that into the service, and I found the prices... strange?

Let's say for instance, one asks if they make mixed drinks and cocktails, and one is told that yes, they do make cocktails, so one orders a vodka and cranberry. The bill arrives and you have been charged for one shot of vodka, and one glass of juice. Also, remember that salad you asked for instead of the expensive rice mixture that comes with kebabs? Well, each one of those is an additional three dollars, even though you substituted it and did not get the rice at all. You just kind of end up feeling nickel and dimed. So Shomal North gets three stars, but Persian cuisine gets five!!!"}
{"text":"I was a regular while living in Toronto. This place truly makes you say, I'm satisfied and full with a smile. I have made it into a habit to invite newbies to the cities to this restaurant, family and friends visiting perhaps. They have never been disappointed! Food is excellent if you enjoy this type of cuisine. Service is good with no complains. It is in a hidden plaza which makes it all more mysterious to how good it is. Shomal is by far the best Persian restaurant in the Greater Toronto Area, in fact I don't think I've had any better in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a great all-around Persian restaurant, though I'd really want to give it 3.5 stars if I could since the service is definitely not up to par.

Decor is definitely cool, making the entire place look like a village from the North of Iran. The menu is varied, and you do get a lot of kebab and stew choices with northern flair, as well as many traditionally northern Iranian appetizers.

The service is typically a bit snobby, and servers insist on speaking Farsi with everyone, which can get annoying when you don't speak Farsi. Food is usually on time, but you just don't feel the love when you're there.

There isn't much else to say about this place other than the fact that it has tasty food that can bring you back. Just know that every once in a while, the food will be a miss, with either the kebab being dry or the stews being slightly off. Then again, I've never found a Persian restaurant that nails it time and time again... maybe a business opportunity exists?"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing people, the waiters are so kind!! This was the first time I had experienced Persian food ..I recommend to get the olives appetizer and the eggplant with walnut !"}
{"text":"This is the best Persian food I've had in my life, and I'm from Los Angeles, home to some of the best Persian food outside of Iran. Great atmosphere as well. The interior brickwork is charming. Make sure to try the Kabob Torsh (out of this world)."}

{"text":"Longtime customer,  sometimes if my food is not the way I ordered I would forget about it, after all I want to support their business.
I've  found hair in the doogh and told to male server but really didn't want to make a fuss ,that happened long time ago.
People like me and my family supported this restaurant and their business growth ...they opened few more restaurants like gilaneh and tachara.
I've been a fan since early 2000.
Lately I received burned food, dry and burnt kobeedeh ,received wrong food and missed items.one time I got food for a large group and that was the worst thing ever ! I went to cottage and realized there that the bread was missing.mirzaghasemi and kashkebademjoon without bread .
I don't know what is wrong with these people forgetting the bread constantly even with my take out order recently, not to mention kobeedeh that wasn't even good enough to feed it to my dog.
I hate to complain, but this is too munch.
Not mentioning receiving Soultani but the barg Kabab was 1/4 smaller than koobideh.
I don't mind to pay more but do not steal my kabab barg.and short comings orders has happened in all restaurants that above owns I think this is plain greed."}
{"text":"Great food, but service was mediocre. Granted, we came with a big group but we had to ask for water, utensils, and server rarely came by to check up on us. When the food came though - WOW! Amazing. If you go on their website they say you get a 10% discount if you \"like\" them via Facebook but I later found out that it was for Shomal Express which is not even open yet!!! That bait and switch was totally not cool."}

{"text":"Actual restaurant name: Shomal Restaurant.
Shomal (meaning \"North\" in Farsi).

Atmosphere: REALLY COOL! Feels like you are dining outdoors in the  northern Iran region. I was very impressed with the design. Most Persian restaurants don't spend money on interior design. Many non-Iranians dine here! Don't be afraid to step in.

Service: The staff here speak English! Food is served fairly quickly. 

Food: Probably one of the better Persian restaurants in Toronto that I know of. Food is amazing!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here regularly as we never leave this place disappointed. The food is simply amazing and the portions are huge. The atmosphere is great as well. They have live music on the weekends which is always nice."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's happened to this place, but I first started eating at North around ten years ago when it was REALLY good. A few years in, after a bit of a reno (if you can call it that), I noticed the quality had changed and since then, there's been a gradual decline over the years, mostly in the service. I heard there was a change in management and while certain things haven't changed, some things have and it makes eating here not so worthwhile, especially with all the other choices in the area for Persian food.

I went by for lunch last week for the first time in quite a while, hoping things might be what they were once upon a time, although not quite...I don't recall ever eating at North in the daytime with all the outside lights off, which made the place look really eerie with all the chaos adorning the windows outside. 

It took a while to be seated when the place was practically empty (we were there for a late lunch). There were plenty of staff on hand but no one seemed to care that anyone had walked through the door. Once we were seated, it took a while for anyone to come and take our order. 

The bread arrived with the usual butter, parsely, and onions. The bread was different from what I remember; it was much thinner than before so that once it cooled, it was more like a cracker which makes rolling up the onion and parsley in it kind of difficult. I also noticed the beets they used to give were no longer offered, but the parsley was half-wilted and the onion was all crusty at both ends so that required some cutting up. We were famished so having to cut the wrinkly parts became a real chore. Furthermore, my previously unmet request for cutlery meant having to wait to chop up the onion. We didn't actually get any cutlery until we asked again AFTER we received our apps/soup and our mains started to roll on in. Tsk, tsk...

We ordered the following:
- must khiar: the yogurt dip which was the same as I recall: fresh and light, perfect with our bread and meat
- Shirazi salad: big FAIL. This thing had no flavour and the olive oil and vinegar was so sparse that it just tasted like water since the diced vegs were mostly the kind that are flavourless to being with and also produce a lot of liquid (tomatoes, cucumber, onion), so one would depend on some flavour from another source. This salad isn't the kind of thing that is usually bursting with flavour but there was none whatsoever to be had.
- baghala ghatogh which was soup with beans and a boiled egg sitting in the middle of the bowl; also tasteless. It just sat like yellow mush in the bowl. 
- North special kebab platter: a honkin' skewer each of beef and chicken along with grilled tomato halves and rice, which is the thing I love most about their meat platters (besides the meat, of course!). I see they no longer offer the rice/salad combination. Too bad because the tanginess of the salad (dressing) of yore would have given a much needed boost to the low level of flavour.
- Chicken breast kebab plate: same as above but without the beef skewer. I don't normally order the breast as it is often dry but theirs is always moist so it made sense to have that. 

We didn't stick around for dessert or coffee as we were disappointed overall with the place and just wanted to get the hell out. It took us forever to leave because the bill didn't arrive for at least 15 minutes after we asked for it, but when did finally emerge, suddenly service was all perky. A little too late, people, although I still tipped above the 15%. Why, I don't know. Maybe I felt bad knowing I'd never be going back there.

The lack of beets and salad with our platters is not a huge deal although they really shouldn't be served that way, nevermind that they're free, but add to that the lousy service and it's enough for me not to go back."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot of experience with Persian food, so I can only gauge this as a n00b, but it was very fresh tasting and...interesting. I couldn't even figure out how they made these flavours or what I was eating - it was all very good though. Yogurts dips, eggplant, some sort of ground beef sausage, lots of pita bread. The atmosphere of the restaurant varies depending on where you sit, but there are a lot of fake plants and wood, which makes you forget you're eating in a strip-mall. I'll have to go back with someone who really know the region's food to figure out what to get, I think."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times with friends and I think it's ok. I have been to other persian restaurants that serve kobideh for much cheaper. I really enjoy the olives they serve, delicious! However, considering they have increased the prices and kept the portions roughly the same I don't come here as much."}
{"text":"We live in downtown Toronto and drive a half hour usually every month if not more to come to this restaurant. The food is always tasty and good portions. The décor is fun, good for a date night, out with friends, or a larger gathering. Service can be a bit slow and they do sometimes seem to ignore you especially when your waiting for the bill."}
{"text":"Very good persian restaurant with a long menu of persian items. They also offer a large variety of dishes from northern part of Iran. We tried the eggplant kebob and marinated stuffed olives for appetizer, they were both really excellent, both had nuts, so watch out if you are allergic. I also tried the \"Kebob Torsh\", that was really tasty, the beef fillet was laminated with pomegranate sauce. They also serve a fresh baked bread. The only shortcoming was the service, we had to ask for our drinks and extra plate multiple times, other than that, the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Pros:
Good food esp. \"Kabab torsh\"  (Chunks of char-broiled sirloin veal with pomegranate paste and walnut and spices), 
Reasonably priced
Nice decor

Cons:
Not a friendly  service!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at \"Shomal\" and would drive all the way up from downtown for some good old Persian Kebobs. Unfortunately, the quality of their food and service has gotten  consistently worse."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! I just left the restuarant because i had to wait for 20 minutes for someone to come ask for orders. He was rude and unprofessional.  Wont be coming back"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before Tuesday night, but apparently its quite popular.

Tuesday evening I was taken to this small stucco sort of place in a U shaped Plaza. Right away I noticed a big Persian crowd, mostly families.
Now, I am pretty familiar with Persian dishes so my surefire way of trying out how good the restaurant quality is, is by ordering the simplest dish (kobideh). Its a kabab style dish with rice and 2 grilled tomatoes (usually for decoration/slight flavor).

me and my girlfriend both tried the Dogh ($2.50 each) (yogurt beverage). If you haven't tried it, its absolutely , positively refreshing. Its got grounded pepper along with dried mint and the consistency is similar to medium bodied milk. Its almost always served chilled, or over ice and is paired with kabab.
I liked the consistency here but different areas of Iran and Afghanistan add cucumber bits. \"North\" does not. Yet, it was still pretty refreshing and yummy.

for appetizers we ordered : Borani spinach & Zeitoon Parvardeh.
The Borani ( $4.99 )is again a yogurt dish (DO NOT ORDER 2, they give a good portion of it so it can be shared by 2). 
Its similar to a dip dish, brought alongside with pita. Its thick with a mixture of sautéed spinach, garlic and herbs in yogurt. Ive had better so I wasn't fully satisfied, I felt it had TOO MUCH yogurt and not enough of the garlic/spinach. 

The Zeitoon Parvardeh is a bowl of marinated green olives with walnut, pomegranate paste, Mountain's herbs and spices ( $5.99 ).
Now, I'm a HUGE green olive lover...so this is DEFINITELY worth a try if you love green olives. The quantity is big enough for 2 to share but be warned, its crazyyy salty!!...so I had the pita from the yogurt borani, mixed some yogurt and added the olives...YUMMMM...

For entree : Koobideh Kabab ($10.99) & Sultani Kabab ($17.99)
the Koobideh was AMAZING..so tender and juicy. The rice was O-K. 
The sultani dish is a combination of tenderloin veal & ground beef. This dish is great for meat lovers that want both the kabab as well as try something different. I tried some of the veal and it was REALLY good. The meat is definitely something to try here.

I was too stuffed to try the tea 
or dessert. :(

Bill came up to $53.00.

The plus is definitely the food. 
The downside is the service, the server is a tad stuck up and refused to speak to us in English, only Farsi. (which is so wrong... why would you assume we knew how to speak it?). I got the feeling, service isn't huge here. Water alone took almost half the meal to get to us , and when it did, the portion was ridiculously small.
Then when we asked for more water, they huffed ( WHAT THE?? ...SERIOUSLY?) and got us a jug of water , slamming it down on the table. As if to tell us how annoyed he is.

So all in all, don't go here expecting minimal service, just go in , eat and get out. Don't forget to pay ;) 

xoxo.

{"text":"Shomal is my all time favourite persian restaurant! Their food is top notch! My family and I have never been disappointed by their food. 

Their service is alright. Sometimes its great and sometimes its not that good but because the food is amazing, you get over the quality of the service pretty fast. 

Their kabob torsh is the best! I have not been able to find kabob torsh anywhere else that is as delicious as Shomal's. All their dishes are fantastic from appetizers to entrees."}
{"text":"\"Kabab Torsh\" was one of the best kababs I had ever had! I wish I could go to that place everyday and try it everyday! \"Kaske Bademjan\" and \"Mirza Ghasemi\" were also really good. 
- The reviews mentioned that the service is not good, but my experience showed otherwise. The waitress was very polite and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Amazing food -- the  Chicken barg kebob is the best kebob in the city and we have tried many places looking for good kebobs... the Fesenjan is SPECTACULAR, the flavours are just scrumptious :)  The portions are extremely generous and the tea is lovely.  The service is a hit and miss but the quality of the food in my opinion makes up for it, especially as we've never had service which could be considered horrid -- and I'm only talking about this here because many people have commented on the service."}
{"text":"Dinner with some Persian Friends: 

Food, service, value, ambience: 3.5/5 

Food was tasty, no complaints.

{"text":"My family really enjoys coming here. Especially when my step siblings come to visit. We go for special occasions too and also enjoy the food. Now... Bare with me... I don't know the names of the dishes but I will try my best.

To start, we sometimes get the eggplant grilled and mixed with pomegranate paste. It was so good with pita bread! A bit sour and sweet and with the mild and creamy eggplant... Just hands down delicious.

The kabobs are a must with our table. We've done the mixed meat ones and they are always moist and tastey. I've never had an issue of too much salt or overcooked. It comes with lots of rice and grilled tomato. 
I also enjoy the red bean and beef stew. I enjoy persian cuisine for the use of dried limes in their dishes. The sour taste it gives is mild enough to not over power a dish but strong enough for its distinct flavour to be recognized. 
We've tried the grilled north chicken which is also good and the meatballs. Nothing disappoints.
Note that service is a bit slow. The venue is huge and the decor is like in persian homes eating within the courtyards. It quite nice but unfortunately has become dated and dark. Also note that the food is priced higher than other places in the area. So for a evening out its good but for takeaway or a quick bite maybe try one of those spots on yonge south of steeles."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant upon recommendation from friends and it did not disappoint!  We ordered the  Koobideh kabob and North special kabob (beef and chicken skewers).  Really moist chicken, only needed a squeeze of Lemon to taste.  Came with lots of fluffy basmati and a little grilled whole tomato. Complimentary bread basket arrived shortly after placing our order. 

Great customer arrive too. Very friendly lady. 

I will go here again!"}
{"text":"This place should be closed down the food is great but the kitchen is dirty and not sanitized I saw a waiter playing with his nose then went to serve the food right after the customer is horrible and the prices are over priced there are other restaurant  I would rather go to than go to this one again"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant; friendly staff and great food. Meat is well cooked and appetizers are tasty and in good portions. It is the go to for authentic food"}
{"text":"A few weekends ago, the weather was beginning to change, and on this sunny Sunday my friends and I decided we wanted to go \"North\" and visit Persian Cottage Country. Now, while a flight to Iran for brunch on a Sunday would have been ideal, financially/logistically it just didn't make sense (at all).

So traveling \"Shomal\" on Yonge we ended up on the GTA side of Steeles (yes that would be the Shomal/North side), we did the next best thing to traveling abroad for Iranian food - we visited the motherland in our own backyard. 

Yelpers have highlighted the beautiful interior of this restaurant before, but I felt it necessary to point out that after speaking to our server (and my close friend whom I was dining with) I learned that the murals on the walls, the replica villa set up, and the patio-esque seating areas are all set up in a way to give you the feeling that you are dining in the Northern area of Iran (similar to our Cottage Country). 

Ohhhhh Yesssssssss...... Now the name makes sense, Yes? North Iran? North? Shomal? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBztjzDr0fM

Once seated I left my DC's and went a walk about, chatting with staff, asking questions and taking pics (it's what I do). The coolest experience was talking to the guy whose sole job is making the naan style bread in a giant tandoor-style oven (the Iranian names for both escape me at the moment - apologies). He showed me the process on how they roll the dough, place it on a moist soft bag and slap it to the wall of the oven. I got to send one that I \"helped make\" back to my table with pride!

The brunch/lunch we shared was epic, my first experience with \"good\" persian style cuisine and I was thrilled (and stuffed)!

To begin we shared an appetizer of:

Kashke Bademian - Mashed Fried Eggplant topped with Fried Garlic, Onion, Mint & Whey.
Served with the bread to scoop it, there a distinctive Blue cheese flavour that I loved! This was heavy but an amazing dish!

To follow we shared in entrees of:

Sultani (which was similar to a skewered BBQ meat) very moist and full of flavour AND an order of Kabob koobideh, which is essentially a seasoned ground beef affixed to a long metal skewer for cooking. I've had Koobideh several times before in Windsor, London, and a few spots in Richmond Hill but I must say this was the best flavour and most moist I've ever had.

Lunch came to $58 + tip for three people, which I found to be very reasonable! Although service seems to be the one thing that people gripe about, I didn't notice it to be too far off other places, so I won't deduct major points for that (perhaps we got a good one). 

As the Irani population in my hometown of Richmond Hill grows, so to does my love of their culture, their people and most importantly their food! I'm excited to coerce my friends who brought me here to organize another meal here in the very near future (if you're reading this let's make plans to visit ASAP). 

Irani Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! The koobideh kebab hits the spot! The service is good, very friendly waiters. Highly recommended! They also have a really cute patio to sit at when the weather is warm. Perfect spot for a date night!"}
{"text":"This a must go every time I'm in Toronto. As an Iranian I can attest for the food and its quality. The waitresses are great and very helpful."}
{"text":"I like the environment, the food is ok, but very expensive compare to other Persian restaurants.
I ordered kabab torsh. It used to be better. It was different this time.
The service was also ok. Friendly server."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the food here and the wide range of options they have on their menu but didn't have such a great experience last time I came here.

First, my friend and I waited close to ten minutes before being seated and watched as several waiters and waitresses danced by, glancing over but not bothering to seat us. There were LOTS of empty tables, the restaurant was not busy yet. We had to ask one of them if we could be seated and she told us that someone was coming. Waited another couple of minutes. Finally someone took us to a table.

We started off with\"Mast Chekideh\", a thick, drained yogurt as an appetizer. I absolutely love this: it's so creamy, heavy, delicious with a dash of salt on it, scooped with Iranian bread.

They didn't have a lot of items advertised on their menu available and I'm not sure why. It was a Saturday. I asked for two different things and was told they don't have it until I finally ended up ordering Chicken Barg. It was tasty as usual but I was disappointed that they were missing so many menu items that are commonly ordered.

Another strange thing that happened: when we first got seated one of the plates on our table was dirty so the waitress switched it out for another clean one from a neighbouring table but instead of taking the dirty plate back with her, she left it on the other table...kinda gross. 

I will probably be back because I do really enjoy the food but service could be way better."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, the best things to get in my opinion are the kebabs (Kebab Tursh),  they really know how to make them right there. The service however is a downside it is often very very slow. Would be 5 stars if not for service."}
{"text":"First time I ate here was many years ago and every couple of years i decide to give it another shot.  And every couple of years i get disappointed..  Food is good but my god the service is atrocious..  And this goes back at least 6 years..  Too bad"}
{"text":"Delicious food, their Torsh kebab is a must. Order different plates and share together. Not a romantic destination, more suited for groups of friends, can be a bit noisy. All in all, a highly recommended place!"}
{"text":"Don't Dine Here if you Have Food Allergies!

I came here the other night for dinner and started to feel sick about an hour after we ate. The waiter assured me my lentil stew was gluten and dairy free but I believe it either contained milk or gluten within some of the ingredients used.

If you don't have any food allergies, I would recommend the lentil stew as it did taste really delicious. The only problem is, I began to experience severe cramping after consumption and the other digestive issues one would encounter if they eat something they are intolerant to. 

Going back a couple of years ago, I visited this restaurant with another friend and also experienced pain after eating my dish. I always feel bad writing a negative review but I do believe this is important for other people to read if they suffer from dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Persian food and this place does it right.  It's a bit more pricey than other places but that's also reflected in the quality of the food they serve.  They give you free flat bread which is a nice touch.  I got the vaziri which is a skewer of chicken and a skewer of koobideh.  They were both very tasty.  I also got the ghaymeh which is a lentil stew on tadiq.  Delicious!!!  Service was pretty good but our waiter tried to upsell us on a few things which I didn't like.  The inside of the restaurant is very nice with lots of trees.  There is a big parking lot but if you come at peak hours you may have some trouble getting a spot.  All in all, a nice place to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I have frequented shomal for more then 10 years..  And my experience here has always been a hit or miss... Either they deliver a superior experience or a lack luster one.   Some times the portions are way too big or just right. Today I ordered the white fried fish with zereshk rice...  Portion was just right...  I give them 4 stars because of the past misses."}
{"text":"Don't understand how they become famous... Small portions and overpriced... Quality is not good at all..."}
{"text":"The food didn't taste like it was freshly prepared or cooked. In fact, our meals were ready and served too quickly, about 5-10 min after we placed our order, and I'm sure it takes longer to cook kabab. The chicken in the stew and the kabab were dry and not appetizing at all. The yogurt and spinach appetizer tasted like it came out of a can! 
I do not recommend this restaurant as the food was overall pretty terrible!"}
{"text":"The best kabob Torsh I've ever had! Great quality meat. Lots of flavour! 
They bring out hot bread. 
Large portions!

The wait staff is not always so attentive. But is pleasant.

Appetizers are a must try also delicious! 

Overall a great experience and a nice place to bring visitors that want Iranian food."}
{"text":"Amazing dishes. Great ambiance 
. Meat is top quality.  Northern dishes are flavorful. Drinks were awesome( doogh) only negative is that they frequently run out of their popular dishes."}
{"text":"The meat was ok but nothing special - that's what my 2 stars for, the rest doesn't deserve a star at all: I didn't like the appetizers at all. Drink selection is very poor, I ordered Caesars but it tasted more like vinegar, I had to replace it with Corona. The service vas very poor. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good service and amazing food. Kabab tursh is my favorite at this place. Meat is very tender and yummy. I also had the lamb shank and it was great and tender too. They have amazing appetizers and my favorite is the grilled eggplant. We had great experience and it is highly recommended!

I also loved it that their music was low and soft so we could converse in our group and had amazing time! Some other Iranian restaurants tend to be too loud."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding.
Shomal means north in Persian and it is fitting because the restaurant features northern Iranian dishes and decor.
Borani Badejman was really delicate and gives a clear idea on the quality of their kitchen.  The Sultani Kebob was absolutely delicious with the meat very tender, marinated in pomegranate and yogurt, the dough had spices and mint and was really great.
I don't know if this is the best Iranian in town, but it is certainly a restaurant that stands out."}
{"text":"Food is okay, bread is tasty but service is below average. It's not that the staff is rude but they are not pros, from the moment you walk in, it's not clear who to talk to to get a table, wrong orders, slow service. It's a pricey place, I would expect to get a good service."}
{"text":"This is the worst Persian restaurant you could ever attend. We took friends there for lunch and it was absolutely embarrassing. We were served old re-heated burnt food. The kabobs were not cooked well and were raw in the middle, the rice was dried and old and continuously reheated. The fesenjoon was watery and way too sweet, the piece of chicken inside was cold in the centre and not enough stew was even given. The baghali polo (fava bean and rice with the piece of meat) was absolutely disgusting. The rice had been burnt and scraped onto a place, the rice was so old you could barely swallow it and was so obvious that it was continuously re heated. The meat that came with it was cold and tasteless, they had added just water to make it more watery and \"fresh\" but that also was very old. The manager gave us so much attitude because we weren't happy that our table was facing the washroom. I'm Persian and very used to Persian food and the foods we were served are foods that we would normally throw out at home. If I could give this place a zero I would. You can get WAY better food at a fast food restaurant for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"excellent place to have food . I go there more then often and all my friends from non persian origin were introduced to food here and love it .  i would like to see their sweets menu grow. and when it does the remaining start will be there"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation but was quite disappointed. Expensive and tasteless dry food. The only good thing was the fluffy rice and free pita bread. I ordered the North Special ($35) which is a combination of one skewer char-broiled tenderloin veal & one skewer chicken filet. Both the beef and chicken were very dry and flavourless, sentiments echoed by my friend who ordered the same thing. My other friend ordered the ground beef kebab and said it was nothing special. The service was OK but on the slow side. Won't be giving this place another try since for that price there are a ton of other places I rather go."}
{"text":"Good appetizers, kababs were ok. We drove a long way to come here. I had the kabab torsh (what I came for) and it was good. The koobideh was also ok. The Barg however was nasty. Small thick cuts of meat (looked more like chenjeh and tasted more like liver). And had a weird unpleasant scent. The waitress completely disregarded that we ate everything but literally didn't touch the barg. I wasn't looking for a discount or anything. But it would have been nice for her to make that obvious observation and pretend to care why someone hasn't touched their food for the sake of improving their restaurant. Great service! NOT. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a GO simply because I like my prior Persian food experiences.  Secondly, we were nearby this area doing a food crawl of sorts.  Third, the reviews here have been fantastic.  Good enough to give this place my time it seems...

The ATMOSPHERE here is great, my compliments to the Designer as we met with the ALL Male staff dressed to impress and directed us to the corner to seat with one side cushioned bench while the other is wooden chairs.

We came here to get a LUNCH experience as we looked at the Menu where half of it was White/Red Wine and other Alcohol Beverages.  Not feeling for Kebabs as we already had some at a restaurant beforehand, we went for Baghali Polo & Mahicheh: A traditional Lamb Shank Stew would be served with Fava Bean and Dell Rice($13.99) and Fesenjan: Stew of Chicken Breast, Pomegranate Paste, Walnut & Spices ($12.99)

We were served a plate of Raw Onions, Italian Parsley and Radishes which we didn't know what to do so I asked a waiter and this waiter looked at me like I was an Alien.  I LOVED the look on his face, AWESOME!  I should have taken a photo.  

BTW, the guy that seems to look like the Manager didn't have any smiling intentions at all but amazingly had a smile as patrons left and even greeted us goodbye.  Don't get me wrong, I like these guys but I guess I'm not used to those SERIOUS faces Al Capone style.

Served with a MOUNTAIN of rice which was pretty tasty while the Lamb dish was tender and good but the disappointment was the Stewed Chicken Breast.  Wow, was it ever stewed to the point where it was beyond mushy and bland while the Pomegranate/Walnut concoction did nothing to recover it.  The sauce wasn't PRETTY to say the least but I'm the least likely have an appetite disorder from nasty looking food.

Maybe it's my fault for ordering this dish or maybe it's their fault for putting it on the menu.  Whatever!  My comparison is mostly from Pomegranate Restaurant downtown which has more aspects on the plate for the same price structure.  2.5 *Stars* until next time we meet Shomal North!"}
{"text":"Exceedingly overpriced and increasingly low quality. Very, and I insist very poor customer management. We have been a regular to this place few years back. But since, it has been on continuous decline in all aspects. We went there few weeks ago, for the last time that would be, and ordered chicken plate (very normal and otherwise basic order). The food was horrible, to the level we couldn't eat it. Chicken was smelly and far from fresh, it was poorly made, and taste like a tasteless soup (I am jot kidding).
We told this to servant and he called the supervisor, from which point on, it went downhill. The supervisor came to us with a pre-fixed attitude, that somehow we are trying not to pay, and basically said it is what it is. We told her we will write reviews about it and never show up here again. She acted as she didn't care. A complete non-professional (it was a yonge lady with seemigly zero experience with the situation)

All and all, don't waste your money and time on this place anymore."}
{"text":"Food quality is low and it's overpriced. The owner is focusing on collecting profit only and needs to improve many things . If you want good Persian food and kebab go to Shater Abbas or even Taftan is better."}
{"text":"Loves the ambience. The fresh bread was the highlight for me. Solid food. Okay service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"North Restaurant, known as Shomal amongst the Iranians of Toronto, used to be the trendsetter when it opened about 20 years ago. It was the one spot you could be sure to get a great meal in a nice atmosphere and great hospitality.

Unfortunately, that isn't the case anymore and inconsistency has replaced that reputation as each of your visits can be anything from horrible to great. This goes mainly for food and service, as the decor and ambiance has changed little aside from one move to add additional space many years back. 

Perhaps the owner's attention is now more scattered attending their other ventures, namely North Express right next door, as well as Gilaneh Restaurant, a tad more upscale place with a nightclub on Yorkmills. 

Having said that, there are a lot worse places to try in the area, and North is still one of a few that can accommodate a larger group."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I've wanted to come to North Restaurant for a very, very long time and today was the day I finally gave it a visit! The inside matched the \"old world\" look of the outside - lots of wooden panels, wooden windows, upper levels (to give the restaurant a larger appearance) and a few trees. There was even live music! The overall ambiance was very intimate, almost romantic (especially if you ordered wine and were seated near the windows!). We were seated right next to the fish tank where it was really nice and secluded.

Food was very, very filling. I had the gheimeh bademjan. The lamb had a nice texture but had a \"lamb\" smell to it (the lamb almost smells like the smells from the barn it was from was carried all the way to the dish itself). The citrus from the dried lime helped to balance out the strong flavours of the lamb and sauces. The baba ghanoush was really good! We ended up taking some home. 

Service was good but could be better. We waited for ages just to get the bill. Also, the cloth napkins had tiny pieces of fibre that ended up getting everywhere (all over my hair and dress). Other than being a bit inattentive towards the latter part of our visit, the staff checked up on us (which we appreciated) and made us feel very welcome here."}
{"text":"Been here 2week ago gat food poisoning was trowing up for 2 days.service rood and unpleasant.Dirty washrooms no soap in dispensers its shoot be first signal. I can recommend this place if you want be seek miss you work and be in terabale  pain."}
{"text":"I had the chicken barg keba, charbroiled seasoned tender chicken fillet.  I had the option to get half salad half rice or all rice. The dish also came with a broiled tomato and a lemon slice. The salad came first. I got a garden salad and added the provided balsamic vinegar and olive oil myself. It was standard tasting. 
We then waited for a bit for the main course and drinks. It took some time but it was not too bad. When the main dish came to the table, i was surprised at the amount of rice. Indeed i found it very difficult to finish it. The long grain rice was soft and fluffy. The chicken at first taste seemed really salty but as i ate more, it seemed okay. The chicken indeed was tender and had a char flavour. 
I find when i eat persian food, i tend to eat really fast to the point i have to wait for food to go down my throat with sone difficulty before continuing to eat. I wonder if that is normal?? In the end i was completeley stuffed with leftover rice.
The waiter was friendly but a little absent minded. He forgot to bring us drinks and we got them long after finishing the salad. Similarly, we didn't get any bread until the mains were already delivered. When we arrived, the restaurant was pretty empty so there really was no excuse. Getting the bill also took an unusually long time."}
{"text":"One of my fav places to eat! Appetizers, main courses - love all of it. I've never had a problem with food or service in the 10+ years i've been eating there. Sometimes service can be a bit slow, but not to the point of complaining about it. Some of my fav's kebob torsh, chicken kebob & koobideh (ground beef). I have recommended this restaurant to over a dozen friends etc. and they are all regulars now too. There are so many places opening & closing that serve Persian food, but Shomal has stayed and continues to offer great food & service. It is also excellent for private functions."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends from work while I was in Markham for a business trip.  I love kebabs of all kinds, and was extremely tempted to get either lamb or veal, but I decided to be a good girl and got the chicken barg kabab.  Despite being the \"healthy\" option, it was still very tasty, I like how they don't overcook the chicken like some places do, it was still very tender and juicy.

The place is huge and the ambiance is very nice.  I would probably put this on my list of go-to restaurants whenever I travel in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. People have promoted this place excessively. It's alright at best. The food is good and filling, but the service is hurting. There's an air of pride in the wait staff that's hard to describe. The meals take too long to prepare. The venue is a little cheesy. Prices are high. I walked out with a feeling of 'meh'. I'll go back to this place if my friends are going, but otherwise, I don't expect a third visit."}
{"text":"Horrible service. By far the most rude people I have ever encountered. Food is way too expensive for what they serve. Shit overall"}
{"text":"If I could give a 3.5 that would probably be most accurate.

The food was good & made with care, the location had an interesting decor inspired by a famous town in Iran where the buildings are stacked a long the hillsides. The server we had was very nice and accommodated our party of 10 with separate cheques and brought us samples of their dessert when we jokingly asked for samples. And I think as we were leaving there was live music.

I think this place tries to be true to Persian food, and was recommended by a friend from Iran as being very authentic. He tells me the head chef is the 70 yr old mother of the restaurant owner.

I ordered the kalkabab as a starter; eggplant, walnut, pomegranate paste, garlic, herbs & spices. It was a delicious dip to go with the flat bread they provided. The flat bread was amazing, really well made in a charcoal oven I imagine from the smoky flavour on the bread.

My main was the chicken breast (I believe that was what it was actually called on the menu). Seasoned chicken, grilled, with a side of rice and roasted tomato.

The chicken was tasty and tender but definitely better with the kalkabab then on it's own. The rice was perfectly cooked and there was a lot of it but not much to it, and the roasted tomato was a whole roasted tomato, uncut, uncored.

They also brought out a plate of sliced radishes, quartered onions, parsley and mint which I wasn't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. Maybe if the onions were sliced it'd be more appealing but a quarter of a raw onion in the company of 10 didn't seem like a good idea.

Overall impression of this place is that it's a family owned restaurant. The food is good but a bit unrefined and would probably be a step up from a well-prepared home dinner in Iran which in itself is a nice experience. Not many home-cooked meals these days."}
{"text":"We've been coming to North for years. The food is consistently great and the portions are huge - so much so that my husband and I often share a main dish.

As Persian is my absolute favourite cuisine, my husband and I came here Tuesday night to celebrate our anniversary. We ordered Mast-o Khiar and shared a Sultani Kabob. The kitchen was nice enough to split it between two dishes for us.

As always, the food was great and of all the Persian restaurants in this area, I have to say, they're one of the best. The meat is cooked perfectly, the ambiance is nice (especially the little private room) and the service is spot on.

Where I live, we have restaurants offering authentic cuisines from Mexico to Afghanistan to Malaysia and everywhere in between... except Iran! This leaves me with no option but to travel 30 minutes west to come to North or 30 minutes east to go to Cyrus (in Oshawa). Cyrus, by far, serves the best Persian food I've ever had but we were close to my office so we opted for North.

I have sampled many items from their menu and have never been disappointed. Compared to the on-slot of smaller, less expensive Persian restaurants in the area, North is definitely worth the extra dosh."}
{"text":"Food is great, but the service is quite slow.......
Monday's dinner appointment was necessary to review this place again!
I've been coming to this place for a while, its among the more popular places for Persian/ North Iranian dishes!  interior is beauitfully constructed, almost feels like you're at one of those cultural pavillons at Epcot Center in Orlando lol....the patio and ambience is gorgeous! you definitely feel like you're in a different place!

for starters: 4/5
we had their Mirzaghasemi: a medley of bbq'd eggplants,egg, garlic and local spices! this is served with pita, and its definitely perfect balance of flavors! im a big fan of eggplant..lol...

Entree:
Koobideh: 4.5/5
Served with long grained flavorful basmati rice! it was so delish! oh and of course their 2 ground beef skewers was a joy of flavors to experience! Their portions were generous, so generous i had to take ONE skewer home...too much meat for a meatarian like myself.********also sidenote, you should try their Sultani: skewer of ground beef, and beef tenderloin...its their popular item as well. 

Dessert..........................sorry I couldn't fit anymore food in me! lol...next time!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible, food is amazing. 
I honestly recommend this place if you looking for a unique place to dine out. Try their eggplant kebab its sour and super delicious."}
{"text":"I felt like the staff were giving my party very poor service. They gave us a bad seat in an almost empty restaurant. I asked to move, and they did it again after taking a lot of time to \"search\" for a new spot. The food wasn't hot. The kebab kobideh was bad. The dish came with one grilled tomato, when every other plate in the restaurant had two. I did not feel like I was being treated well or fairly there. It's expensive and does not compete with other Persian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I speak Persian and have a lot of Iranian friends in the GTA.  All of them recommend this place!  It's well known for it's good service, authentic food, and helpful staff.  While most of the patrons are Iranian, the waiters all speak excellent English and are willing to educate you on the menu if you are new to Iranian food.  The yogurts are excellent, the kebabs are tender, and the stews are very flavorful. I would highly recommend going!"}
{"text":"Shomal (meaning North in Farsi) is a great Iranian restaurant specializing in North Iranian cuisine. 

It is a little pricey but the food you get is amazing and you will savour every last bit of it. With large portions and distinctive tastes, I take all of my friends to Shomal when I want them to try out Iranian food. 

Definitely try the Mirzaghasemi (a garlic eggplant type appetizer) as well as one of the Kebabs. The Koobideh and Joojeh kebabs are absolutely amazing and I`m sure you will love it.

Also don`t forget to try out the authentic in house made doogh (which is pretty much a minty yogurt based drink - can be carbonated or not).

The atmosphere and music is very authentic and beautiful made to represent the northern regions of Iran."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really nice and its similar to north of Iran...
\"Kabab Torsh\" is really good.. kabab torsh is sour marinated kebab ( pomegranate sauce)
Most of the times servers are friendly..
DON'T ever try kebab Kobideh.. its like bad hamburger...
Today I found something un-chewable in my Kobideh and I showed the server but they didn't even apologize"}
{"text":"food is among the best Persian food in Toronto but oh man the service is terrible. Every time we come here our server is incredibly rude yet we come back for the food time after time. You have to try the \"kabob torsh\" it's soooooo good!!! \"mast mousir\" is also a great side yogurt with your food. idk if the management takes time to read the reviews cuz aghaye mohtaram take some time to teach your servers some attitude. Funny thing is once this guy was training a girl while we were there and him himself was incredibly rude."}
{"text":"Wow! My first experience with Persian food and I think I found a new \"to go to\" spot. Went with an Iranian friend who was looking to have an authentic experience and even she was impressed with the quality of the food. Service was great as well! Staff were very attentive and allowed us to take our time without rushing us out. We started with a few appetizers Zeitoon Parvardeh and kashke bademjan. I highly recommend the first. All the mains were fantastic as well. We had lamb chops and Kebab Torsh both of which were simply delicious not to mention the tasty rice. We can on a Friday evening. There was live music. We couldn't have asked for a better dinning experience."}
{"text":"Authentic Persian food from northern Iran. Amazing appetizers and kebabs! I was also impressed with their service. Will come back!"}
{"text":"North Shomal is a great place to come dine for some yummy Iranian food. Yes, the prices are a little high, but the amount of food we got makes up for it. The bread is crispy and thick, and the meat was incredible. The juices were running from the meat and the flavor was delicious. The place has a nice atmosphere too, with pretty decor. Overall, you should experience this place at least once."}
{"text":"The poorest and the rudest customer service ever. Last Friday a group of us went there.The waitress mistakenly charged us for a few more meals and instead of checking again she insists that \"she didn't eat the food we did!\" Well we knew we never ordered them and everybody had already paid for their food. Then she wouldn't let us leave as if we are hostages! Finally she checks the bills again and guess what?!!! Her mistake! She comes back and tells us \"Oh your account is clear!\" Well of course! It was clear from the beginning. She didnt even apologize for giving us a hard time for nothing but her mistake! The manager also refused to intervene regardless of the fact that we asked her we wanted to see the manager! If this is how they treat their customers then fine! Good luck with it! Don't ever go there if you are not asking for some sort of intimidation and mental torture as your dessert !!!"}
{"text":"The ambience at Shamal is nice.  It was quite busy and rather loud, which was expected on Saturday evening.  
We enjoyed the Kashkeh Bademjan with Noon, Kabob, and Fesenjan.  Tasty and Filling!"}
{"text":"This place is really a hit or miss. I usually order the Mirza Ghasemi, which is perfectly done every time. My go to main dish is the Koobideh Kebab. Sometimes it's over cooked, which leaves the meat dry. 

Customer service also isn't a strong suit of this restaurant. I've had to ask for things 3 times, despite it not being busy. 

With that said, the food has been better more times than not which warrants my 4* review and also because I love Persian food."}
{"text":"Get a reservation if you plan to come on a weekend or you run the chance of waiting for a table or eating under the time constraint of an hour and a half. That being said, everything is an experience the first time you come here. The interior is decorated to feel like you are eating on the open patio between a couple small houses. There is a waterfall coming out of a mountainside mural, the roofs overhang an elevated deck area and the unfinished ceiling makes a passable night sky. The service was hurried and quick, but willing to answer any questions and apologetic about the inattentiveness. 

The food itself is good even though a bit overpriced. The meat is grilled to perfection, no matter if it is chicken, beef or veal. There are good char marks on each piece while the inside is moist and juicy. We really enjoyed the zeitoon parvardeh with the flat bread that was both crispy and chewy at the same time. The marinated olive paste was delicious and a must try for anyone who likes the taste of olives."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of this place.

I remember being taken there as a kid by my family friend.

The food is great. The restaurant décor is also very nice. I think I do not enjoy is the service. Don't get me wrong, the servers are nice but it takes forever for the food to come. There are also times when the wait to get a seat in the restaurant is insane.

Overall, a great place. I hidden gem tucked away at Steeles."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the best Persian restaurants in Los Angeles, DC, and everywhere in between. Shomal offers the most unique, varied, delicious Persian cuisine outside of the Iran's borders, and it most definitely worth the 6 hour drive for us to enjoy the specialties of Iran's northern region. Everything from the Baghale Ghatogh to the white fish and the soltani is prepared with the best ingredients and delicious. There is something for everyone here, including a range of kababs, vegetarian dishes, and regional specialties. Be sure to check out at least one of there appetizers - they are all delicious! Eating here brings back memories of being \"back home\", and guests from all ethic backgrounds should check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night. It was busy but the place is huge and we were seated quickly. The place had really nice decor that was fashioned like a little quaint village with clay houses and cute second storey balconies, and extrusions right out of the mountain valley.  The dishes were a bit expensive but the quality of the grill was amazing. My friend ordered the North Chicken, and I ordered the North Special, and the portions were huge. The chicken was grilled to perfection, the chicken breast was also juicy, and the beef steak pieces was on the well done side. The bed of rice was very generous. I'm not a fan of the grilled tomatoes but they were served with the plate. The only thing I wished was that the meat was a bit spicier. It tasted a little bland to me."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely a place where you would take a foreigner friend whose never tried Persian food just for the experience and atmosphere. The environment reminds me of little Italy for those who haven't been to the north of Iran. 

I've been here a few times and recently I've been back to try their kebab torsh again and was looking forward to some fresh hot bread, only to find out their bread kiln was broken. Instead they served store-bought pita bread, which definitely dampened the evening slightly.

I like the diversity in the restaurant too, its not just Persians dining here, which can be the case for the majority of Iranian restaurants. Our waiter was not that attentive either, my glass was empty majority of the time and we waited 20 min for the bill.

The food here is also average. If you're expecting to be wowed by amazing Persian food, this place isn't it. Come for the experience, not the food.

Peace out."}
{"text":"Don't go here for an intimate or romantic dinner - the crowds are boisterous and the place is very noisy.

Decor is a sort of mock village look.  Seems more Italian than Persian, to the point where I wonder if it used to be an Italian restaurant.  Wagon wheel chandeliers add a somewhat outre touch.

The menu is pretty typical Iranian fare - lots of kebobs, some stewed dishes and various hot and cold appetizers.  We ordered two of the eggplant ones (one cold and one hot) and both were delicious.  The pita to spread them on was fresh and moist and as in many Persian restaurants, came with complimentary radishes, parsley and onions.

My partner had the ground beef kebob and I had a chicken and ground been combo.  Portions were large, the chicken was exceptionally tender and well-flavoured (great marinade) and both were delicious.

I would have liked to see the kebobs come with dill rice and lemons, but that is a fairly minor quibble.  Prices are fair for the portion size but not cheap.

Friendly but somewhat rushed service.  Expect a short wait at peak hours."}
{"text":"Swore I would never return and this time service was a 2/5 same crazy manager . I had guests from Cali and none enjoyed their food either and found the place kind of a joke . This time I mean it ... Never again !"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and the food is average. I couldn't believe they advertise their food as Halal- How can you serve Halal food and serve alcohol which is haram. The service is terrible. The Kebabs and the rest of the food has no spice at all. Please do not waste your time and money at this place"}
{"text":"it use to be very very nice in everything but now its a waste of money on 
everything. the chef is not even familiar with making persian food 
and on of their staff was my friend he told me how suck is the kitechn
no good food anymore too bad"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying the food here very good! We have had the chicken breast kebob, bread, kubideh, salads, and dips. I can honestly say the food is not disappointing. However beware of making take out orders!! The lady that takes the order during the day and the lady in the evening (who you will most probably see) is different. There is always a communication error between these two. The day time lady is atleast very nice. The lady in the evening is consistently very rude and snobby. Every time she is there we are given terrible service and treatment. Last time I was there I was told 2 breads are inc and so I ordered 2 more (I will pay for) when I was given the food there was only 2. I asked where the other two breads were she just answered \"we're busy so now the two breads are not inc. so we can't.\" That's it. I don't know if she is related to the owners but they should know that she is a terrible person to have in the front and dealing with customers."}
{"text":"Bademjan kebab - eggplant stuffed with walnut, pomegranate and spices. * MUST TRY. This is coming from someone who doesn't really like eggplant. It is so delicious 
Kebab Torsh was also delicious, meat, rice and grilled tomato. 
Served with a naan bread.
Highly recommend this gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent service in Dec2012 despite what other reviews might have said. Food was great too. My only slight complaint is the prices are a little high. I think it's the atmosphere you pay for here. Overall it's a very good place, no complaints."}
{"text":"If I were writing this review after my first time here, this would be a 4.  Came here over the weekend and it was simply not the same as my first visit.

Pros:
Decor is very nice
Free bread 

Cons:
Orders came in wrong
Long wait time for food
Booth near the entrance is horrible

We came on a Saturday night.  Although it was busy, the restaurant is very big and we got our seats pretty quickly.  They gave us the seat near the door opposite the table where they keep the menus.  The problem is the table bangs into the seat whenever the servers drop the menus on the table.  It's like being on a place and the person behind you kicks the seat.  It gives you a bit of a jolt.  We told one of the servers but it's a force of habit for all the servers to just plop the menus down real quickly.  They're not doing it on purpose, but I can't keep telling every single one of them all the time. I just gave up and endured it for the most part.

We ordered the koobideh kabob dinner and the lamb shank dinner.  I also ordered a side of roasted potatoes.  We actually tried to choose vegetable side dishes first but the waiter told us there were none.  We settle on the roasted potatoes and were brought mashed potatoes.  The wait time for the food was pretty bad.  Something like 20 minutes.  They came out and told us there would be a delay.  However, everyone else coming in later than us got their food before us.    

The koobideh was pretty good.  I had that the first time here as well. They consistently do that very well. The lamb shank though could of been a lot better.  First, it was way overdone.  Any part without fat was hard as rubber.  It was also very salty.  I've had way better lamb shank at Persian supermarkets for half the price.  At the very least you get some bread that resembles naan bread for free.  

I love Persian food, but my experience here left me a little disappointed.  I might come back again. but not anytime soon.  Just don't sit at the booth right by the entrance."}
{"text":"In Persian Shomal means North. Its a nice place, busy, specially on weekends. 

We liked the appetizers and salads. A must try appetizer is called Bademjan , eggplant stuffed with pomegranate sauce with crushed walnuts, its really tasty, served with fresh pita. Very popular dish is Gormeh Sabzi, it looked like few greens grinded, with pieces of meat, dried lemon and red kidney beans .Then we ordered a dish called Aash , its like Persian veggie noodle soup. We also order Koofteh Tabrizi, its a huge meat ball with nuts stuffing. Persian food is incomplete without Kebab and rice, you can order beef or chicken or lamb.  

The decor is nice, I mean not flashy, they give you feeling or North of Iran. Thanks to my husband for introducing us to Iranian cuisine."}
{"text":"I came here with two other Yelpers on a cold winter's night and the food was great. Service was also good - no complaints. The decor is a bit eclectic and they were playing nightclub-type music, but we enjoyed our visit. My favourite is the pistachio and rosewater ice cream -  there's nothing like it!

In retrospect the food arrived very quickly after we ordered and I wonder if it was re-heated. Perhaps that's the only way to provide quick service?! Bathrooms could use a good scrub!"}
{"text":"My third (or fourth) Iranian restaurant.
I did not experience the inattentive (dis)service others have mentioned, but there was no quality check either. The waitress was polite and because it was a warm day served us on the patio well. By the way, they have a patio for the main restaurant, while there is an express take-out outlet next door. The waitress was polite and explained the dishes to us.
Complimentary, bread, butter and onions also are welcome...
The food was delicious, the chicken was moist, tender, melt-in-your-mouth. The yogurt was tasty and felt very natural. The prices are not cheap and are $25+ each!!! but the quantity and quality did not leave us wanting.
The completely empty restaurant worked for us. We had the patio to ourselves and we were thankful for it."}
{"text":"I am very surprised with poor quality of the kabob, in this place. The service is great and very friendly. I have tried several other Persian places they are much superior."}
{"text":"The best restaurant for Authentic Persian food.

The Kabob Torsh is to die for.

Service isn't all that great but trust me, the food makes up for it!

It sucks I'm a vegetarian now but I may just give that up for one more bite..."}
{"text":"authentic food from the northern part of iran (gilan) near caspian sea. great kabab torsh and bademjan kabab. also try the dessert (reshteh khoshkar)"}
{"text":"Seems like after 2 years, the portions have become smaller, but prices have gone up for some of the other entrees. When i was last here in 2014, the chicken breast plate had 10 pieces of chicken kebab, and 2 grilled tomatoes, wheras today i received 8 pieces of chicken kebab and 1 tomato. Service was friendly but took a while for our server to get the bill. Food arrived quickly though, which is much better than my first experience. Food is still tasty, but expensive for what you get, especially as the portions have reduced. I would say there is too much rice for the amount of meat plated."}
{"text":"An Iranian restaurant that seems to be a gem in this neighbourhood.  The apps were the best, some similarities to Lebanese.  Different types of dips made with eggplant, yogurt, olives, chickpeas, nuts, etc. to eat with hot nan bread.  Glad we ordered four apps amongst four people to start off, very filling.  Next were the grilled meats for our main course, chicken boneless, kebabs, steak tips, all slightly different in flavour,  all well cooked and went well with rice (we ordered a couple different flavours of rice).  The decor was upscale with lots of wood, lots of seating and some nice plants inside, also has a patio, located in a strip mall, just off Yonge street, plenty of parking.  I would definitely visit again when in this area."}
{"text":"Having constantly being recommended by my Iranian friends to get my a$$ to North, i finally did. I regret not having made the time to come here sooner.

The food is phenomenal. Authentic, excellent quality. All the dishes are done very well. The barg tenderloin was the best i've had in toronto thus far (with Banu coming a close second). The cornish hen was prepared with so much perfection - it burst with citrus and coal grill flavours. The kashk had so much depth to it - creamy, garlicy, crispy, heavenly . The salad shirazi boast the fine uniform chopping skills of the chefs. The fresh noon smoked with that intoxicating smell having just come out of the stone oven. I'm hungry once again. Even the baklava, which is traditionally an arabic dish, had the signature of an Iranian style preparation with a walnut base and pastry held together with sweet delicious syrupy nectar of the gods. 

The decor transports you, the service warms you and the food inspires you. I'm adding Shomal to my repertoire of fine higher end persian food that specializes in grilling high quality meats cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new! Service was surprisingly very pleasant, as our server was very helpful with the menu. 

Food portions are huge, especially for lunch. I also felt that my meal was somewhat cold compared to my boyfriend's meal. The chicken was made well, the salad ($2 extra) was nothing too spectacular but the bread was really good and sadly got us full from the start. Overall, it is a bit pricey for our liking and I've tried better Persian food."}
{"text":"Low quality food!
Very bad management!
It used to be a good restaurant but recently there has been some significant drop in their food quality and management! 
So disappointing! 
Although we tried to provide the feedback but she gave us very negative attitude and took it the wrong way!"}
{"text":"Rating is of the food only. Service needs a lot of work. Food was fantastic, I was surprised to find French fries on thier menu lol....soooo not Persian! 
     The BBQ chicken was very Smokey, and it seemed they marinate thier meats for a long time because the you could see the coloration from the marinade deep into the chicken. So that made it very flavorful. Thier yogurt thing with the cucumbers is incredibly fresh and oh so refreshing. The rice is probably the best quality rice I have had at a Persian restaurant in years, even better than Bijan in Houston. 
     Now the service. I'm not gonna say BAD but my water glass remained empty till I asked for it, we kept running out of bread, and to top it off our server asked us to make his night by paying cash....THAT WAS THE TACKIEST THING I ENCOUNTERED IN TORONTO!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked into this restaurant was the stylish atmosphere - they had this outdoor feel going on.  I wish I could have stayed, but I came here with my friend's dad to pick up some take out food.  

We got 4 different kinds of kebab all of which ROCKED - super tasty and not at all dry.  There were also a ton of hot people walking around (both servers and patrons).  I don't know what they put in the water, but Persians are just a good looking bunch.  I only gave it four stars because I didn't get to dine-in, but this is the only time I've given four stars at a restaurant I only spent 15min in!"}
{"text":"The place is in the back corner of a plaza and has three different signs that say \"North\" - I guess each sign shows their growth.  The service is great and the server explained each dish and answered all our questions.   The food was great but we were full from just the appetizer!  Will definitely come back.  BTW, the yogurt drink is awesome."}
{"text":"Went with three friends last night. We tried the eggplant with egg appetizer, olives with walnuts,  chicken, kamb& beef kebabs & the chicken stew.

They serve you parsley, raw radishes & raw onions on the table. 

I would rate the food a 3 out of 5. 5 being the highest & 1 being the lowest. It was good for what it was but nothing special. They serve a naan like bread to start. The mains came with a ton of rice unless you wanted salad. If you want berberrries with your rice, it was about $2 extra. They taste like cranberries. My friend had the baklava & although the portion was small, 4 tiny pieces, she said it was rich & not too sweet. 

If I was in the area & wanted Persian food, I would go back. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"Kashke Bademian is my favoooooorite thing here. Its delicious. All the food is 
really fresh. I've never had a complaint about this place."}
{"text":"Coming here makes me imagine I'm in a local restaurant in Iran. Relaxed servers and patrons, families and couples on dates. Food here is very delicious and recommend coming hungry as portions are very generous."}
{"text":"The food was good. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. I ordered the kabob torsh. This was the first time I tried it and it wasn't bad. If you are not into trying new dishes then I would say just order chicken. You can't go wrong. 
Only area of improvement would be that the service wasn't great. 
Overall a great place."}
{"text":"If you want stew dont go here , we had ghorme sabzi it was really bad , just opened the can of red been and water , a little sabzi. Really disappointing and expensive."}
{"text":"We come to Shomal for lunch when we're in Toronto. Their food is usually decent with good portions and reasonable prices. On our most recent visit, the restaurant was more like a sauna. The service from our waiter though was great and he was very attentive. When asked about the temperature, he too was bothered by it as he was sweating. Seems like management keeps the place around 80 degrees if not higher. Although their food is usually good I do not think we will be back for a while, especially not during the summer. I recommend going elsewhere if the weather is hot."}
{"text":"This place has the best kebob torsh among iranian restaurants in Toronto. The kebobs are tasty and juicy. The portion of food for each dish is more than enough for one person."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer ever since they opened. There has not been a single time that I was slightly unhappy about the food or service here. My favourite dish is Kabab Torsh, which is sour, mouthwatering and very juicy. I always get the Yogurt drink and sit on the patio, which is decorated gorgeously. There's great Persian music playing in the patio and you can easily carry out a conversation at normal voice level. The waitresses are polite and cater to the customers in a way any good restaurant should."}
{"text":"Whenever my friend and I visit Toronto, we make it a point to eat at this lovely Persian restaurant. I like the cozy, woodsy decor. We wish we had a Persian restaurant of this quality in Western New York. Thank goodness a drive to Toronto is easy from our hometown. So much good food and variety \"North\" of the border. :) 

Ground beef kabab with zafran rice, perfectly cooked and seasoned. Always a good choice. My friend sticks to this option and it's consistently tasty and cooked just right. 

I usually order one of the chicken kabab dishes, which are excellent. This time I wanted to try something different. The white fish with herb rice caught my eye. It turned out to be a good choice. Crispy on the outside, fried but not at all heavy or greasy. Tender fish filet on the inside. A good squeeze of lemon made the fish stand out. The herb rice went well with the fish, very tasty. 

We always leave satisfied. Service is polite and efficient too. And the US exchange rate is a bonus. All around a winner."}
{"text":"Food was not bad but a bit bland and overpriced. Atmosphere is great. I have to complain about the poor service in this restaurant. As another commenter has mentioned in her review of the restaurant, the servers were curt and cold. I also experienced a cut in the number of grilled tomatoes I received compared to every other plate in the restaurant. I ordered a fairly expensive plate of beef & chicken kebabs with two tomatoes as depicted in the menu. The issue isn't even about the number of tomatoes received, it's more about the unfair attitudes these servers have towards people of non-Iranian descent. We all pay the same of money to be dining there and I do not see any reason why we should not be treated equally. I did not feel appreciated during my visit here and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Shomal is my number one favourite when it comes to Persian food. Their dine in area is very nice and roomy with many private-ish areas.
The best part as well is that they do delivery!
I do it either by calling them or by using JustEat, and the km range is pretty good..

My favourite and highly recommended plates would be Sultani Kabab, and Vaziri kabab, it's always tender and juicy even with delivery.
Their rice with fava beans is great as well, and Zeytoon Parvader is A++"}
{"text":"Great Persian food! we go there every few weeks! I love the Sultani Dish!"}
{"text":"It was difficult to find at first, I was looking for the full name but it's just North. The decor inside is really nice - used to cheap and good Persian place just down the street on yonge, it's definitely not what I'm used to. From the raving reviews from fellow yelpers and some Persian friends , I finally decided to give the place a try.

Maybe I'm spoiled by tadeg down the street on yonge and finch, I found north quite over-priced. 32$ for a chicken and veal combo with rice... The option for half rice and half salad is nice. Girl needs her vegetables other than the dinky tomato they give.

I was expecting mind blowing food based on the price they charge but I wasn't tooo knocked off my feet. For 32$ I could've went to all you can eat sushi or feed myself 3 times from tadeg. I'm wouldn't mind spending the dough if I see value in what I'm getting - but not here."}
{"text":"Stepping inside Shomal North on a Sunny afternoon feels like bring me to another world... World which is dark..cool... and full of men (waiters)

I have to agreed with John F., the interior decorate does remind me of an Italian Village I been too.. now think about it.. I know exactly where it is!! The interior of Frankie Tomatoes!! The little storefronts, the fake painting of the cliffside on the far wall, the little X'mas lights decorating the trees....

I don't have a lot of experience with Persian food, ok make that once!... I can only compare to Pomegranate Restaurant (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pomegranate-restaurant-toronto-2) which I just love!! 

Raw onion, parsley and radish were brought to the table even before ordering. We were told that we suppose to eat them with our food. But what food are we going to eat?? BTW, their wine list are 3 pages long... more than their food choices!!

I found the stews are really not as delicious and taste not as good Pomegranate. The chicken here was so over stewed that it does not taste like chicken anymore. The lamb is ok... I have better... But I like how they match the different rice with the chicken and lamb.

I found the services here is cold, and the waitstaffs are quite disinterested. Maybe it is how an authentic experience suppose to be :P.

I am not in a rush to come back here for another meal.......

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been here at this location 3-4 times. I visit them for one reason and one dish only, Kabob Torsh (Sour Kabob) that is a pomegranate sauce marinated beef kabob. While you are at it definitely try Kabob Bademjoon as an appetizer (that's stuffed mini eggplants also cooked with pomegranate sauce). Honestly all other dishes that I had a taste of was great: Baghalighatogh, Mirzaghassemi, chicken kabob, Koobideh and the fried white fish!"}
{"text":"Its always a delight for us to dine here especially with a group.  Craving or feeling adventurous for Persian food, we've brought family, friends and off-shore co-workers to this place and every time it's a big hit.  How so?  The great food, the warm and earthly ambiance, and interior architecture that allow us to virtually leap from arctic Toronto to sultry Iran (visually).  Quite a fieldtrip.  If only we could be Jumpers.  Remember that movie back in 2008?  There is a wow factor to this place.  I don't use this word on a loosey-goosey manner but its impressive. Its perfect for a romantic date, family dinner or lunch, corporate dining, etc. The interior architecture provides nice nooks if you want some amount of hush-hush or privacy.  It's folksy with a nice balance of exotic (perhaps for us Non-Iranians) elegance.

So what about the food?  Nothing too fancy to tickle your senses.  But something so authentic perhaps that the simplicity is enough to fill your soul.  Feel free to fill me up with the right single word for this.  Anyway, you will see and taste a lot of yogurt, pomegranate, dried berries, walnuts, spices - not the hot chilies but something garlic and onion based with some hints of this and that herbs (Ahh, ignorance is bliss!  Haha!), and some olives too.  

The eggplants, it's the motherload of all their Appetizer and it does a great job to keep us seated and enjoy the relatively long wait for the main dishes.  The refillable Nan bread always come fresh and warm from the oven.  Butter would be unnecessary - as hearty as it can get.  I enjoy watching the bakers hand tossing the dough at the side near the kitchen, they're always gorgeous!  Like Italians are tall, dark and handsome and hairy.  Are they?  :D

Let me give you our faves and try it out for taste, if it doesn't get you sucked in.  

APPETIZER (our usuals):  Kalkabab - mashed eggplant with walnuts, pomegranate paste, some garlic, herbs & spices;  Badenjan Kabab - fried eggplant stuffed with walnuts, pomegranate paste, onions;  or this one, Borani spinach - sautéed spinach and yogurt, and flavored with garlic and some herb.  I really dunno what that herb is but its beginning to grow in me. 

MAIN DISH:  I hafta warn you, the appetizer may seem a petite dish for a minute there.  Wait until you see the platter of a main dish that is coming up your way.  Yeah, one platter one person.  And I mean, the oval and almost like your Gramma's serving plate kinda thing, and its filled and heaped!  

I always go for Chicken, how can I go wrong.  So its Chicken Zereshk Polo which is a flavorful char-broiled breast with Basmati rice (its always white and yellow; its buttered right?) and red berries - dried cranberries I would suppose, with a slice of lemon and a whole grilled tomato on the side.  This could be my last meal before an execution.  

My husband usually forgets me over the Beef dishes like Sultani Kabab, char-broiled tender veal and ground beef;  Kabab Torsh, char-broiled veal with pomegranate paste and walnuts, and again those spices;  or Koobideh Kabab, ground beef on skewers all with Basmati, berries, lemon, and tomato - the wholesome foursome, I would call 'em.

Another interesting and sometimes wonderful dish is the Ghaimeh stew.  Its actually delicious but a little too rich for me.  Our off-shore friends loved it, though.  Its beef with tomato, onion, and beans - stewed.  I did say that, did I?

OTHER FOODS:  A good-to-know - they also serve seafood and vegetarian dishes, but we haven't tried any of those.  Except for Rainbow Trout.  The fillet was better tasting pan-fried than bbq'd, but that's our taste buds.  But, heck, go for the meat stuff!  

One unique and probably their very own is the Yogurt Soda.  After one time, I never ordered it again.  Its too weird for me.  Its acquired taste, definitely.   Perhaps in time.  Desserts?  We simply don't have enough room for one though you can ask for the menu for it.  

SERVICE:  Its nice and friendly, and the server frequently checks on us on how things are going or how's the food, and refills our water or Nan with quick initiative.  The food may come a tad slower than you're used to but that's because its made fresh.  You can taste it right off the plate.  But as I said earlier, the Appetizers - its there for a good reason, and its diverting like a hostess on stilettos.

PRICE:  Appetizers can get you from $5 to about less than $10.  Beef dishes, if you don't go for North Special which is about $25, its $10 to 18.  Chicken would be $12 to 15.  The stews and vegans around $14. 

I hope my review satisfies you and make you hungry enough to go get some for yourself.  Its our go-to Persian or Iranian (you know Iran was called Persia in ancient times, right?  Ok. That's settled) and who knows you just might enjoy it like we do... as much as always.  When is the best time to go?  Lunch / dinner time on the dot. It gets crowded on later hours."}
{"text":"Sub par service. The food came quickly, but was so bland. The amount of meat in each plate was lacking in comparison to the mountain of rice on the plate.
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is quite nice and warm on the inside. The food here is mediocre in my opinion and the staff is a hit or miss. If you're going to charge $25 for kebab sultani... You should definitely be making sure it's above the other restaurants in the neighborhood that charge$10 less and tasting a million times better. 
The price and quality of food do match...So essentially you're paying for  location and ambiance.

Will not return."}
{"text":"Not even look like what u eat in iran
Bad quality of food, the chef of this restaurant does not know how to make kebabs well"}
{"text":"I am surprised with the mixed reviews of this place..
Was brought here by a friend of mine from Iran who highly recommended this place. Its my second time having Persian and once again not disappointed. 
We had a mixer of all types. everything was excellent and only complaint was lamb was a little salty and service was a little slow bringing us water as we were 5 and they gave us a small bottle and we had to continuously ask for water."}
{"text":"Good food and prices are OK.  Very interesting ambiance. Friendly service, will go back!"}
