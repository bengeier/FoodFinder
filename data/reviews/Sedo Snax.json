{"text":"This little store specializes in all kinds of South African products, primarily foods and some other items like magazines and housewares. They have a great selection of SA Cadbury's, and lots of interesting goods.  I love their frozen meat pies and samoosas. THey also have boerwors and biltong.  The proprietor, Neil is very welcoming and friendly and makes a point to get to know all his customers."}
{"text":"Best. Place. Ever.  Every south African goodie you can think of. Even if you're not south African, you're in for a treat. Go inside, try something new, I'm sure you'll Like it!  Recommendations:  Droewors- dried sausage snack Peppermint crisp - amazing chocolate bar Milky bar - the perfect white chocolate Royal creams - shortbread cookies filled with icing Sparletta cream soda - no relation to the pink cream soda you get in Canada Guava fruit leather - exactly what it sounds like Dainty fruit squares - moist little bites of fruity heaven Fizzers- like laffy taffy but fizzy (!!) Nougat - deliciously soft and bursting with honey flavour"}
{"text":"I was born in South Africa decades ago and still like the products from there, especially the spices (curries, marinades, chutneys and sausage).  They have good \"pap\" which is a similar texture to grits in the U.S. (no ugali or fufu available).  They have samosas (frozen) and the usual dry meat (biltong) which I loathed as a child and equally loathe as an adult!  But is is popular (kind of like \"jerky\" here in North America).  Good food to take when you are on a horse trek and in need of sustenance ...  This place is full of stuff from the Old Country for me even Ouma (Grandmother's) Rusks - which are highly carb. but great especially in the winter with a hot drink.  Lots of sweets/biscuits and that sort of thing.  You get fussed over a lot here and clearly they value one's business which is always a nice touch."}
{"text":"The customer service at this place is amazing. And the baltong is amazing with all the unique south African snacks. Love it"}
{"text":"A great selection of South African nostalgia foods, and always a friendly greeting and chat from Neil and co.  My kids have never been to South Africa, but through Sedo Snax they too have come too appreciate biltong, droewors, Mrs. Balls Chutney, Appletiser, Tex bars, Ouma rusks etc.My go-to store in Toronto for SA foods."}
