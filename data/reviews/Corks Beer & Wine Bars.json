{"text":"When my friend suggested meeting at Longo's for dinner, I rolled my eyes. However, I am now a fan.   Corks has a lot of specials throughout the week, including very reasonable oysters on Thursday nights. I had pizza and wine during my visit because I wasn't in the mood for oysters though. The drink menu was extensive; there were many red wines to choose from (and friendly to my wallet!).   The food was good. Their menu includes appetizers, charcuterie boards, pizzas, salads and soups. There's pretty much something for every pallet.   Service was excellent. There were two servers working at they both came to our table often. Waters were filled before we even noticed that our glasses were empty. And they came to our table as soon as we called for them.   I can't wait to return!  Good for: dinner, groups"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place so a bunch of us went.  At first I thought, what are we doing inside of a Longos?  I soon changed my cynical thinking when we settled and the friendly staff served us.  We could sample beers before selecting one.  The menu had a great selection and was not too pricy.  We tried a number of dishes to share and sample.  I LOVED the charcuterie board.  My absolute favorite was the potato rosemary pizza!  Who knew how good it could be?  We have gone back a number of times and I have brought friends to try it out.  I have gone back to order the pizza and take it home too.  The lovely woman who made the pizza let me watch and she described the technique.  This made it taste even better.  I tried to make it at home and it was good but nothing beats the potato pizza here.  I do not like beer than much but the selection they have here is quite good and being able to sample it, really helps you find just want you want!  I LOVE it!  You even get a little entertainment as the dining area is above the grocery store so you can watch shopper antics and the produce guys as they stack the fruits and vegetables in a fun and light hearted way.  All in all a great experience without a big spend."}
{"text":"The bartender/server smiled and said to me \"What do you feel like drinking? You can sample a few before you decide?\"  And with a selection of crafted beers from local breweries.. I am in LOVE.  Old Credit Pale Pilsner Spearhead Hawaiian Pale Ale Denisons Dunkel Granite Keefe's Irish Stout Beau's Lagered Ale Muskoka Lake Mad Tom IPA  If you don't like any of the above, there are also bottles and cans of different varieties available.  Price wise are definitely reasonable with a pint around $6 or 12oz for $4  If you are not a beer drinker, there are 16 different selections of wines from local wineries and you can even do a flight.  With Amsterdam Brewery just down the road, hopefully there will be some of their products on tap soon?  Life is good when I can drink a Denisons Dunkel as my afternoon tea...  Located inside Longos, you won't miss Corks. And you should not miss it!   I wish every Longos has one.. I need to start a petition: Grocery Shopping and Beer/Wine Drinking for all the shoppers!!  PS I forgot to mention Corks serves food too.... in case you are not a drinker"}
