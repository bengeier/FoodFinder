{"text":"This was my first time here. I'm embarrassed to say I've drove by here countless times and never gave it a second look. The decor is warm and inviting and makes you want to stay to read the daily paper. Perk Ave. Cafe boasts a large but simple menu. A hidden treasure in Amherst, and a must try!"}

{"text":"If you  love small-town coffee shops this place is the place for you! Not only does Perk Avenue have awesome coffees, teas, lattes and awesome drinks they have an amazing food menu and fabulous desserts. 

I love the atmosphere of Perk Avenue. The high ceilings are great for claustrophobics like myself. They have a variety of regular  and high-top bar tables.  Because Perk shares the building with Lifecare Ambulance they have one of those HUGE garage doors in the front of their restaurant. When it's warm enough outside they open up the entire front of the restaurant to the street. 

Perk Avenue has free Wi-Fi and they don't seem to mind if you want to hang out all afternoon and do your work, relax with friends or read a good book. 

Owned and operated by a local family, Lucy and her employees will make you feel like part of their family every time you come in. I have always been treated well here and they are very accommodating. 

Perk Avenue tends to get busy during the lunch rush so you may want to call and order your food ahead of time if you have a short lunch break. I often order food to go and they usually quote me 10-15 minutes to get it ready during lunchtime. '

My favorite food items are the Birds of Paradise Wrap and their hummus and pita wedges. They have a ton of other offerings available as well!

If you are looking for a great place to eat lunch or hang out with friends and chit-chat over a great cup of coffee give Perk Avenue a try. They will not let you down!!!"}
