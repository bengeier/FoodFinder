{"text":"John DeJoy is every bit as good a chef as some of my favorites in Cleveland including Zachary Bruell, Michael Simon and Michael Longo. We recently visited John Palmer's chef counter after a long absence and we once again very pleased. We discovered this gem when it opened in Chardon and are glad every time we return. Service is efficient and Chef DeJoy is pleasant and entertaining while cooking up great food. His sauces are second to none. We started with a cheese plate and the sharp white cheddar was excellent accompanied by a Gouda and something I could not recall. I had the glazed salmon which was off the charts. The sauces were excellent. My wife had the filet which was excellently prepared. The reduction sauce ( the reason she ordered it) was as good as our previous visit. Nice wine list. Prices are reasonable especially given the quality. Wish more people were familiar with this place they would be very surprised."}
{"text":"Phenomal. Had the banana peppers/sausage for appetizer, the house salad, and the gnocchi. Everything was so good."}
{"text":"First of all sit at the bar.  Secondly, go on a Monday! Yes a Monday! The reason I say go on a Monday is because it is their half priced bottle of wine night! Yes, you heard right! And the wines offered aren't your average run-of-the-mill mass produced wines. There are world-class selections offering whites and reds from Europe as well domestics.  One of my favorites is the Pouilly-Fuisse from Burgundy! Not only is the wine selection amazing; the fact that they're half off is unbeatable.  If wine isn't your thing they also have delicious $5 martinis during happy hour which is from 5-6:30.  That is why sitting at the bar is worth it.  They also have delicious small plates and special priced appetizers during their happy hour.  I've tried almost everything but my favorites are the cheese plate and the lamb lollipops! The cheese plate is an excellent accompaniment to the wine.  The selections vary but they are always wonderful artisanal cheeses.  That paired with fresh fruit and a reduced balsamic make a memorable combination.  The lamb lollipops are also terrific. Juicy and succulent with a cool mint sauce.  I only wish they had the meatballs on the happy hour menu !  But the veal meatballs are worth getting anyways.  I've never been disappointed while dining here.  The bar prices are unbeatable and the food is comparable or better than some famous named restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Very nice place! Went for an anniversary dinner and really enjoyed ourselves. The atmosphere is inviting, food is really good and the wine was good too. Be prepared to spend some money but it's worth it. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"John would be appalled that you're still using his name and serving the garbage you're serving.  The waitresses belong at Denny's, not at a place with a $50 steak on the menu.  Ours was slow and incompetent. The food,  and I mean all of it,  was over salted,  from the salad  to the chicken. Learn to prepare fine food.  Then there was the $40 lamb. It was prepared by someone who has never been near a kitchen before,  I guess. Every tendon and piece of inedible offal was left on the rack.  I tried to eat it because I was hungry.  I couldn't.  1.75 hours after we arrived,  we finally got a bill and left vowed to never, ever return. We won't.    This is not John Palmer's, and a name change won't help."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food. Sit at the kitchen counter for the full effect."}
{"text":"We recently went to Nou.veau with friends for dinner. Our friends had been there a few times, but this was our first visit. We had a great time, which means, of course, that we had a great great dinner. We have just moved back home here to the east side of CLE after over a decade of living in the South. We have been searching for a nice, comfortable fine dining experience, and am happy to say we have found it in Nou.veau. The food and service were both top notch. Would recommend it to anyone seeking a quality night out."}
{"text":"Totally off our radar, as whenever we are in this area, dining seems to be aimed at nearby chain establishments.  Upscale atmosphere, but located in a small strip mall, and not too apparent.  Somewhat creative menu appears to feature a couple of Kobe beef dishes.  I had a Kobe strip steak, and it was very tender, perfectly prepared (medium rare), and about 10 oz in size (maybe a little bigger).  Gouda encrusted tater tots were a big surprise.  Very good.  Small bar in the front is cozy.  The waitress on our visit was not very competent.  She didn't know the prices of a couple of the specials, didn't think the bar could fill a particular drink order (Harvey's Bristol Creme), and didn't check. Second-choice bourbon and ginger ale came as bourbon on the rocks.  Adequate wine choices, including those by the glass.    Also, she kept placing delivered items on the far side of our round booth table.  Far enough that I nearly had to stand up to reach.  Not sure what that was all about.  Could have been her first day.  :-)  This place is pricey compared to what else is in the area, but not that expensive.  My Kobe strip entree was $25, which was in the upper mid-range of the menu.    Ambiance is nice, but tablecloths would make it nicer."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar. Babs the bartender took excellent care. Lobster nachos, bone in rib eye & cheese plate all combined into a 5 star experience. If I find myself back in town, it is at the top of the list to visit again."}
{"text":"Great lobster nachos, Kobe beef egg rolls, and martinis. Salmon and ribeyes cooked poorly, tasted like they were cooked slowly. We enjoy the atmosphere and appetizers however!"}
{"text":"We were staying at Quail Hollow on a golf trip, and 8 of us headed to the restaurant in search of a quality meal. We were not disappointed. From the steak special to the scallops and the tuna, everything was perfectly prepared. The service was top notch as well. A great place that I wish we had in our hometown."}
{"text":"My fiancee brought me here for my birthday dinner. I started with a flirtini and it was good. Fiancée got an iced tea an it was good too. For starters we ordered the pork belly and the bacon wrapped scallops. The pork belly was melt in your mouth good. If you order the scallops, get ready for sticker shock at $18 for two of them, but wow, they are delicious.  We both got the 7 oz filets with onions, mushrooms and tater tots that we shared.  It was all spectacular.  I think we will be back here when we have something special to celebrate."}
{"text":"There are only a few places on our county, a suburb of Cleveland OH where you can get truly fine dining. John Palmers Bistro 44 was the best we have experienced. It was our 35th anniversary. JP's  Bistro is in an slightly upscale strip mall. Probably less than 5 minutes away from our home but we had never eaten there. I had read good reviews on YELP so we went there in s slow time.. 4th of July weekend.  We were not disappointed. I had oysters Rockefeller on a spinach cream sauce, lamb 2 ways and mushroom risotto. My wife had the special cauliflower soup, and flank steak. Both meals would have passed the Gordon Ramsey test. Out of this world!! There is an outside patio/bar restaurant and inside restaurant section with private booths. Also you can sit at a food  bar and watch the kitchen cook. Dress is semi casual to smart casual. We will definitely be back soon. I highly recommend this if you like fine dining. 2 meals with appetizer , vegetable sides, and entrees, 2 wines and a mixed drinks came to $110 plus tip. Service was outstanding.  I really am blown away!"}
{"text":"The lobster nachos here are superb!  It's a great spot that brings fine dining to the suburbs and the staff is wonderful, they remember your name when you walk in - that's awesome. The wine list is great, food is fantastic and ambiance is super. It's Concord's little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Have been back a couple of times the last few weeks and really liked their food! Amazing fish selection ($25-$40) and their Lobster Nachos ($15) are delicious! The uber sweetness was probably a one time off thing... rest o fmy experiences have been really good!"}
{"text":"Well, let's put it this way: If you want perfectly cooked food, eat here. What more can be said? The new owners have classed the joint up a bit and the newest menu items they've added are some of the best options. Sure, it's a touch on the expensive side, but to call it over-priced would be wrong. Everyone at my table of 6 ate every bite of all of the food we ordered.  Live music? Killer patio? Tasty drinks? I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Classy place. Older crowd. A bit overpriced in my opinion. Good service. Stiff drinks. That said, we stopped in as our third choice. We got the pork cracklin which was delicious. We also got the lobster nachos. Stay away. Not worth it. Huge pile of nachos with very little toppings and almost no lobster."}
{"text":"First time at Nouveau last night, hostess was very friendly, we made reservations online and we were seated immediately. The server was very pleasant, while still giving us space to enjoy each others company. We had the fried deviled egg appetizers, which were very greasy and bland, we also had shrimp cocktail, the shrimp were over cooked and the sauce was too sweet. The entrees were good, my wife had the lamb and it was cooked medium rare and the sides complimented the dish well. I had the filet done medium, again the entree was very good. I gave a three star rating due to the appetizers and price of meal. It isn't super expensive but pricey enough that we left feeling we over paid a bit for the experience."}
{"text":"John palmers bistro is perfect and romantic for a date night in the winter and great for drinks with friends on the patio in the summer. I have never had a bad meal here. We usually order the lobster nachos to start ! They are so good !!! I usually get the scallops or the salmon !!!!!"}
{"text":"We were surprised at how much we enjoyed ourselves on this our first visit to nou-vous.  Excellent cocktail, outstanding entrees and sides, and a server who made us comfortable.  Portions were appropriate and neither of us left a morsel on our plates.  My wife had the halibut and was disappointed when it was gone.  Not because she was still hungry but because such a great meal had ended.  I enjoyed a pork chop cooked medium but with a good char on it.  It was wonderful and very nicely presented.  The sides were as much fun as the pork.  My wife had the flourless chocolate cake which I shared with her.  It was like eating fudge.  We finished with coffee and plan to return in the near future."}
{"text":"John Palmer's food has never failed to impress me.  Even though I am not a fan of seafood, my wife prefers to get the lobster nachos.   We've only been there three times so giving 5 stars wouldn't be prudent at this juncture.    * reservations are a good idea, is normally very busy thursday thru saturday. * The hostess normally can accomdate your favorite seating area. * Drinks are expensive, but they specialize in wine.  You can get some good deals on bottles on the right nights * I normally get the filet, perfect every time.  They are not adverse to special ordering sides.   * my wife normally gets the salmon.  she has never sent anything back.   * Don't bring your kids.  They have a kids menu but it's a classy place and panini's is right around the corner.  Save the place for adults.   Just a tad pricey, you are looking at $200 for four adults to hang, drink, eat and have a good time."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and a good find for Lake County. Love a family owned, great food, and great drinks."}
{"text":"Ehhhh. The food was delicious. But the pricing didn't match with the ambiance of the restaurant. We sat in a booth. Initial thoughts would be private dining, instead your greeted by every patron that walks in because the booth opening is right at the front door.  Like I said, the food was amazing. Cooked perfectly. The pricing just doesn't match the drop ceilings and store front atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service served in a strip center restaurant in a blue collar area.  Don't be deceived, as you will enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The food is awesome and the wait staff is friendly and very attentive. The bar is small but good people and very good to eat if you are alone.  Someone bought me a beer after knowing them for 5 min.  Must be Cleveland hospitality. Definately go back.  Not cheap though so bring your credit card."}
{"text":"We had a horrific dinning experience too. The food isn't worth the aggravation. If you want to spend 3 1/2 hours wondering where your server is than pull up a chair at John Palmer's Bogus Bistro."}
{"text":"Had another excellent meal! Started with the Lobester nachos which are more of a fluffy wonton style and very good. Tom ordered the banana peppers which he loved! And he is very picky! I then ordered off the New Year's Eve menu and had the Fried Lobster which was fabulous!! We got there early and were lucky enough to grab 2 seats at the bar. Seating at the bar is fine for us since our favorite bartender was working Jillian!! She is one of the best and always takes good care of us!! I highly recommend trying out this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Too my in-laws and I can honestly say that this is one of the better places to go in lake county for fine dining. The food is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"This is an absolutely fabulous restaurant.  I'm reluctant to say that because I have only been there once, but after meeting the owner and sampling quite a few things from the menu, I'm optimistic that our next visit (which will be soon) will be just as good.    I was reluctant to try this place at first.  As someone who is fluent in French, the name really threw me off.  Nouveau means new, but Nou Veau means Us Veal, with the Nou being misspelled.  I wasn't sure if the owners were trying to be ironic or just had some bad intel, but frankly, after eating there, they could call it anything they want and I'd still come back.    It was dinner for two.  We tried two appetizers off of the regular menu, one appetizer special, and two special entrees with some a la carte sides.  The foie gras was cooked perfectly.  The shrimp and grits were a cut above anything I've had in this area.  That said, what a treat to have some Florida stone crab claws as well.    Our steak entrees were cooked precisely to temperature.  The sear was perfect.  As I told the waitress, I thought it was a shame that the chef put a salad on top of the steak, not because it wasn't delicious, but because it was such a beautifully cooked steak that he shouldn't have hid it.    The bread was great.  The seasoned whipped butter was to die for.  The service was excellent.  The drinks were well crafted.  The wine selection was good for a restaurant of this size.  Terrific atmosphere.  All in all, a wonderful experience that I'm sure to enjoy again and again.  This place deserves a solid four stars."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places on the east side. I'm a huge fan of their lamb lollipops . Great patio in the summer time!"}
{"text":"What a classy dining room. Good service, good food, great music tonight with Kristine Jackson playing guitar and singing her heart out. The place is packed!"}
{"text":"Came here twice for happy hour after the new name change and were impressed. Recently bought a Groupon and tried them for dinner. We were very impressed. Filet and Ribeye cooked perfectly, lobster nachos as always were delicious and bread/oil were fresh. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My favorite local East Side restaurant when I want a nice meal, but don't feel like driving 35minutes to the downtown Cleveland/Ohio City/Lakewood area. I've dined here 4 times and each time has always been enjoyable.  The first time I went they made me the best gnocchi dish I've ever had. I am hoping they put the gnocchi back on the menu...so delicious. My last few visits they have made me some pretty nice vegetarian dishes, but none of them compare :/  Great wine and drink list! The decor is very sophisticated and modern. The patio is nice as well; sizable with a bar."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant  I took my wife there Fat Tuesday as Frato Pub had a half hour wait  We were seated quickly  I had NY strip steak and Brussels sprouts and a bottle of German Reisling all very good  My wife had filet mignonette and au gratin potatoes, delicious  Not cheap but very good"}
{"text":"If you are a foodie and haven't been to Nou-veau,  you have to get there.  This is THE best restaurant in Concord and ranks up they're with Michael Symon's \"Lola\" and Johnathan Sawyers \"Greenhouse Tavern\". The service is incredible as is the food. My husband and I had salmon, the skin had a crunchy sear and the fish itself melts in your mouth.  The lamb chops are the best I have every had.  The waitress brought steak knives but they weren't needed.  Done to a perfect medium rare, the knife slid right through.  If you are fortunate enough to go there when they have potato Perogi or blue cheese on cracker appetizers,  go for it,  you won't be sorry.  The blue cheese had that incredible barn yard taste that only the best and most expensive blue cheeses have.  I can't wait to take my mom and adult kids who also appreciate an unbelievable meal!"}
{"text":"There is no way this restaurant can be rated anything other than 5 stars! We eat here relatively often and the food, service and drinks are top-notch every time. We recently celebrated my birthday and ownership & staff went out of their way to make me and my guests feel special.   I'd recommend Nouveau to anyone & everyone who wants a 5 star lunch dinner or happy hour! You have to check it out!!"}
{"text":"What can I tell you, I love this place... That's right we were back here again for drinks and dinner.   We sat at the bar and met the new bartender Rob, interesting gentleman. Food as always was amazing, drinks spectacular as always.  Rob suggested a new twist on my wife's favorite Cosmo, added some raspberry and she loved it! Nice work Rob. I live for my wife's happiness as well.  The best thing about this place is it less than 2 miles from my house, so after a couple of Rob's great drinks I can walk if I have to."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 11 on a Monday night for Cleveland restaurant week (3 course Prix fixe menus, $33 per person). Very classy, nice ambience. Started with bread, white and multigrain with a herb butter. We got a few fried calamari appetizers to share, they were very tasty, with capers and a creamy sauce on top. My friends and I ordered different  things and shared. I'm just going to say that everything I ate was delicious and flavorful. The spinach and artichoke dip was baked, so the top was crusty and the rest was creamy, and it came with crunchy pita chips. They were quite more crunchy than normal. The mussels came in a creamy white broth, with crispy/crunchy garlic bread. Their soup du hour was a carrot ginger soup, topped with goat cheese, it was super creamy and flavorful, the ginger was light, not overpowering. I enjoyed it, and I'm not crazy about carrots or ginger. The winter salad had dark greens, beets, candied walnuts, and goat cheese, very fresh and tasty. I got the bistro filet (medium rare, because that's the only way to eat steak), with polenta cake and brussel sprouts. By the time we got to the entree, i was already very full. The steak was well seasoned and cooked perfectly, but the polenta cake was amazing. I totally thought I hated polenta, but in the past I've only had bland, dry, poorly done polenta. This polenta cake had a crisp outside, and the inside was amazingly creamy and soft, a little cheesy and flavorful. It reminded me of jade tofu, because it was so soft on the inside. All my friends loved the place. The servers were very attentive and friendly as well/ It's a little far from where I live, but definitely worth the trip, hope to come again in the future!"}
{"text":"I brought my fiancée here for her birthday. I made reservations through open table and got it with no problem.  We order the pork belly and the bacon wrapped scallops for appetizers. Both of these were delicious. The scallops were large and both items were enough for us to share.  We both ordered how 7 ounce steaks medium rare and they were cooked to perfection and were delicious. As side we ordered sautéed onions, mushrooms and a side of tater tots. Everything was great and I suspect we will be back here. If you want a nice place to eat, this is the place."}
{"text":"Easily one the best restaurants in lake county a true gem in Concord , worth the money your gonna pay its a great place for really anyone but couples for a night out. Wine prices aren't out of control by any means. The steaks and pork chops are fantastic and certain Staples on the menu that have been there for years continued to please."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I was thoroughly disappointed with this place. I brought my boyfriend here for a birthday dinner. The service was HORRIBLE and the food was not worth the money. When I arrived, the hostess was so rude and barely acknowledged us. Just because we were the youngest couple at the restaurant, doesn't mean we can't \"afford\" to eat here. Our server Mitchell was not doing his job. Took 15 minutes to get us our drinks (glass of wine and a rum punch). He forgot to put in our appetizers, he had to come back and ask us \"Oh did you guys order appetizers?\" REALLY?! The least he could have done was comped our apps if he legitimately forgot and made us wait longer for it! He failed to bring us bread while we waited. I think I saw him a total of 3 times that night. We kept looking for him and he was nowhere to be seen. Oh by the way, there were only 2 tables that night. It was dead! The food was par, I gave this place 1 star because the only good thing about that night was the ribeye. The apps and dessert was gross. NEVER coming here again to waste my hard earned money."}
