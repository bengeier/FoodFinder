{"text":"When we entered the restaurant, we were helped immediately. The waitress was excellent.  Sadly this is all we can say good about our visit today. The food looked and tasted as if it was microwaved, not fresh!  The main thing we wanted to let anyone thinking of eating at this restaurant is BEWARE of any foreign item that may be in the food. My husband found something very hard in his food.  It was a large thorn. This shocked us all.  The possibilies of  injuries it could have caused is so scary.  We are so glad it wasn't one of our grandchildren that could have gotten this in their meal. PLEASE just be aware."}
{"text":"This review is for the new location on Indian Trail Road. The restaurant was very clean, the service was good and everyone was quite friendly, but the food could use some work. The salsa and bean dip were both very bland. I ordered pollo con queso, and it wasn't terrible, but it had way too much pepper in it. I don't think we would come back unless they made some changes, especially with La Unica being so close."}
{"text":"Great food and service here. The quality of the chicken is better than competitors and the price is a great value. You should really try this place out, and try the flautus."}
{"text":"This was the most God awful dinner I've ever had. The server was loudly yelling to the hostess about where to seat us. We all ordered off the numbered meal options, I asked for the #2 with chicken enchiladas and no one at the table got the meat they ordered. We all got cheese enchiladas. The rice had ZERO seasoning & the refried beans were like glue. Then we waited - no exaggeration- for about 20 minutes for our bill. At one point the waitress came over with a load of plastic chip trays (empty ones from another table). She - I guess- decided she couldn't carry them all because without saying anything she put one down on our table & walked off. Gross. It stayed there until we got our bill. Pass on this one. NOT real Mexican food & SO not worth it."}
{"text":"While multiple Mexican themed Restaurants have been in this location, finally Cactus Rose has staying power! Food is good, portions are above average! I believe it's worth a visit, if you haven't visited!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I ordered a simple taco salad. Not only was it not good I got food poisoning from the bad meat! We ordered our food to go but when I picked it up the restaurant reeked of mildew. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"My review is based solely on my visit, eating fajitas.  The mild salsa was too hot but the big problem was that the steak for the fajitas was like eating bland beef jerky -  very tough."}
{"text":"Real Mexican Food and the best you are going to find!! Family owned business with over 40 years experience in Mexican food. Not your typical microwave mush like you find all over the US. This is old school Mexican like you find in south Texas. If you like Tex-Mex  and find yourself around east Charlotte stop by and see Gabby & Deb and enjoy a real meal of Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Never ate here before tonite. Had chicken & spinach quesadilla, it was very good. Will be back. Prices good too."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night. It was Saturday at 8:00 and there were 2 tables filled. One outside and one inside. We should have known then something was wrong. We sat down and ordered 2 top shelf margaritas. The server brought us chips and salsa with our drinks. My drink was good, very strong. My husband's was weak and sweet. Two more tables were now occupied, making a total of four. There were 4 servers. Our server never came back to take our order, but I could see her sitting at the cash register eating. We finished our drinks and asked for our tab. It was $17 for the 2 drinks, chips were free. We left and went to Moochies a few doors down and had decent service and food. Bummer... I was craving Mexican food. BIG disappointment."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at Cactus Rose when it was in the downtown train station in Matthews years ago.  We'd lost track after it moved to various other locations, then discovered it again opening just down Monroe Road in Indian Trail.  So, remembering the great meals we had there before, we ventured down to try the new location.
I'm sorry to say it was a big disappointment.  The service was fine, our waitress was attentive and food arrived quickly.  This was on a Saturday evening, so there were other families in there too.  But the food itself was surprisingly bland.  It's as if they don't add any spices when preparing the meats.  The beef for my fajitas appeared totally without any seasoning.  My wife said the same for her ground beef chimi.  I don't recall ever having to add salt to a Mexican dish before!  Oh, and tho the portion was good sized in the fajita dinner, they only bring you 3 very small flour tortillas .. absolutely not adequate to hold all of the dinner.  But the clincher was, after asking for a couple more soft tortillas so I could finish my meal, finding the additional ones as an extra charge on my bill!  So, under-serve the number needed, then charge when the customer asks for more?  amazing.  And my wife found it odd compared to other Mexican restaurants we frequent that no sides came with the Chimichanga ; no rice, no refried beans,  unless you wanted to pay an additional charge.
All in all we both agreed there was no reason to drive all the way here to return, and relegated the memories of the old Cactus Rose to the past, not to be repeated."}
{"text":"Upon checking Yelp's mixed reviews - I decided to give it a try anyway. The lady at the cash register didn't offer a greeting or anything, but that's ok - no real harm done.  I chose a table and a lady came by to take my drink order.  After a bit, the \"bartender/waitress\" brought my very weak and terrible tasting margarita - they really should use a different mix.  The chips and \"spicy\" salsa were good, and their menu offered a specific combo that I don't see too often:  chili relleno, taco, rice, and refried beans.  I requested extra refried beans in place of the rice, yet when my dinner arrived, it contained rice and refried beans.  I pointed this out to the very apologetic waitress who offered to get me the extra refried beans but I declined. The very crunchy taco shell that was packed full was fantastic, but the chili relleno was pretty much inedible. Also, no need to worry about refried beans - they weren't good either and I dare say I can't remember ever having had \"bad\" refried beans anywhere. I ended up leaving most of my meal, having only finished the taco.  The winners here: the hard shell ground beef taco, the \"spicy\" salsa, and the nice bartender/waitress."}
{"text":"Good little restaurant tucked in a strip mall. We were on our way to try La Unica on a Friday night.  It looked really busy and we had some small kids with us so did't want to wait long. We checked out Cactus Rose around the building and were not disappointed. Quick inexpensive Mexican Food. Full bar, friendly service.  The food was good, and there was even a fellow playing live music. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Service was very good on a busy Friday evening. Service was great on two other visits on quiet late afternoons. Food was very good each visit. Price is very right. My husband likes that he can get a beer with his meal. Haven't had dessert yet. So far have been very full from the portions. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the area.  Food is real TexMex.  Sides were just as good as the main course.  People were great.  Lots of different drinks and beer.  Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff. My wife and I enjoy going there mid afternoon Fridays. You will have a hardtime finding fault with this fine restaurant."}
{"text":"We decided to try this Mexican restaurant after living near by for almost two years and we are so glad we did!!  What a gem!   The guacamole was fantastic,  and all the food we ordered was delicious!  I had the chicken chimichanga which was very good,  we also ordered a cheese dip.   The salsa and chips were delicious as well and we had fried ice cream for dessert!! One of our new favorite spots!!  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"From California and have been on the east coast for 19 years. This is the first legit California-style Mexican restaurant I have been to. Rice and beans were perfect, tacos were amazing (no, they're not food truck style, they're old school crispy), and the service was good. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I thought it was a questionable move for a New Mexican joint to move in right beside la unica, but after trying it I have to say I like cactus rose better. The bean/cheese dip is great and their chips are delicious and perfectly salted. The chili relleno is really great, they fry the whole pepper and stuff it with cheese and top it with queso (not exactly diet friendly but really good ). I took a star off because of the service. It seems like they need a few more people working here. The food was slow coming out and some people who ordered before us got their food after us. Maybe they'll work the kinks out but I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Waaaayyyy better than La Unica!  Real legit Mexican tacos, beans and rice just like my favorite place in San Diego. Has even pulled me away from all other Mexican food in Charlotte, even Azteca!"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal,  owners are wonderful if you take time to get to know them, nice big glass of wine, can't go wrong! Best Tex-mex. I am there every month and they can customize a dish (#2 is vegan) for you."}
{"text":"no not eat here....food is nasty.  my dog would not even eat this food.  also the service sucks.  waitress was all over her boyfriend and didn't even notice me half the time.  do not support places that use cheap food and expect you to overpay!!!!"}
{"text":"I had tried the Unica around the corner and it was OK but have driven past the Cactus Rose many times without stopping. Decided to give it a try this past weekend and was not disappointed. I ordered the enchilada/tamale plate. Anybody that calls themselves a Mexican restaurant should be able to do a good enchilada. They did a good enchilada. My standards are probably a little too high for tamales so I was not impressed with theirs.

Good service. Good food. Reasonably priced. 

Live entertainment is nice but the place is a little too small to have the 'Music Man' parked over in the corner.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, good food. Candy and Albert provided excelent service. Jerry herbert the music man is awesome, he put a smile on my daughters face. Will def come back"}
{"text":"A good, decent Mexican food joint. Real cheese, tasty salsas, jovial atmosphere, you can't ask for more. The tostada is perfect, I couldn't have made a better cheese enchilada myself. This isn't scary authentic Mexican food (no brains or entrails on this menu!) but it isn't a whitewashed liquid queso nightmare either. Good food, good atmosphere all at a decent price."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to taste the food of Cactus Rose at a New Year's Eve party that had some food provided by the restaurant.

Let me say this, I am not normally a fan of beans and rice from mexican places because they normally do not have any flavor but this place has the best beans and rice I've ever tasted.  Both were flavorful and kept me going back for more.

The enchiladas where good as well and like most mexican places, they had great salsa...good fresh flavor on the medium one.  The hot one was not very hot, in my opinion.  I did not try the flautas that were provided.

So if they have great beans and rice, they makes me want to check out the restaurant.  My friend says that this is her favorite Mexican place so that's another reason to try this place."}
{"text":"I've been by this place  a thousand times and finally decided to stop by last Friday.  I wasn't impressed at all when I walked in, I had to seat my self so I was thinking hmm will I have to get my food my self as well.  There was a lady standing behind the counter yelling across the room to me, asking what I wanted to drink.  So I let her know, and again thought will she throw me my drink since she yelled?  Any who, finally a waitress came and I oredered mine and my little girl food.  The basket of chips and salsa was good and warm.  When I got my food, I was shocked at how much I got.  I know that just about any authentic Mexican place you go to you get an astounding amount of food.  But I ordered a side of rice and beans and bascially got a full plate size of both.  Not complaining it was really good, the guacamole was amazing better than any guacamole I've ever had, it was a little spicy but really good.  I had fajita quesadillas and they were super good, it was like eating a chicken grilled cheese on tortillas.  And the sweet tea, oh my it was the best sweet tea I've ever had at any Mexican restaurant I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  I will be going back, I met a lady there that enjoyed the place so much she was on her thrid visit for the week.  So I will be back, don't let the look fool you."}
{"text":"The Cactus Rose is a relatively new offering - though there was a Mexican outpost in this shopping center (in this same exact space, if memory serves), it was not the same as what is here now.

When they first opened, decorations were on the slim side - even the name of the restaurant was only a banner on the front of the building.  Either the delivery was delayed or they are doing well enough to afford an actual sign now, because there is an actual sign out front.

That is a good thing, because it should attract more people to the food, which is worth trying.  The beans are among the freshest I have ever had - rather than an unrecognizable mush, you actually see beans on your plate.  This is not to say that the beans are the only good thing - just that it is an impressive feat, for something as lowly as the bean.

On the downside, they can get busy - say after church services let out on Sunday - and the service is not quite as good as the food.  Hopefully they can catch up, at which point they will be well worth a stop.  Right now, it is a bit of a stretch."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to the new location but boy was I disappointed. 

The service was awful.  It was so bad that it literally took over 30 minutes from the time the first meal was brought out until the fourth.  The excuse was that another waitress had mistaken the missing meal and delivered it to the wrong table.  Maybe, but then why did our 2 other meals arrive 20 minutes late.  I have to wonder who is running the place.  The manager offered a weak apology.  

Three of us ordered meals calling for tortilla shells.  We had to hunt down the waitress to get them.  Even then it was about 15 minutes before they arrived. By which time our food was turning cold.  When they came they were wrapped tightly in aluminum foil so were very soggy and falling apart.

I felt sorry for our server.  She was working hard and running from table to table but the manager and the kitchen were making her look bad and adding to her work load.

The food was just OK.  Typical storefront Tex-Mex.  No thought went into the presentation.  The flavors were very flat.

Finally they had a very poor entertainer performing.  He added nothing but noise to the atmosphere.

Maybe the owner should get rid of the musician and use the money to hire an expeditor to oversee the kitchen."}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss. Services has been better the past couple of times. I do find it tacky that they now sell jewelry inside the restaurant. It makes it feel cluttered and more like a flea market."}
{"text":"The food was decent, some of which was as good as that which I have had in Az, NM and other parts of the SW US.  For example, the beef taco was excellent!  The picante sauce, however, was a little bland and the relleno was inedible as it was covered with what tasted like an insipid, gooey cheese product. The worst part, though, was trying not to watch Fox News on the big screen a few feet away. There was another TV on the other side of the dining room, on Fox News too. We live in very polarized political times. Some people love Fox, some like other networks, some like none. But we all love choices, among them the choice to be free from disagreeable partisan commentary while trying to enjoy a meal out. Seems like any businessperson would know that."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times with my wife.

One good thing is that lunch menu is good until 4 p.m. The lunch combos are a good price and the food is usually good. I would advise to make sure you specify beef, chicken or cheese if you are getting something that could go many ways. The default seems to be cheese.

My wife does like the chile relleno. They do offer chips while you wait.

The service is hit or miss. I've been there during some slow times, and the service can disappear.

However, this overall is a solid choice if you are in the area. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff conveniently right off 485.  Taco Salads are great and chips and queso perfect.  Very friendly staff and outdoor seating when it's warm."}
{"text":"Terrible food that probably came out of a can. Poor service- took forever and watched our waitress chow down on some food while we sat waiting. Also messed up my order."}
{"text":"Pretty good. They have beer & tv. But food is ok I guess. Not sure I will be back....maybe I got the wrong thang"}
{"text":"Went there (in Indian Trail, NC) today for lunch.  Had a chicken enchilada.  It was pure awful.  Canned chicken, soupy soupy cheese sauce and an inedible flour tortilla.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"Not authentic food. Atmosphere was not great the day we went. Won't be stopping by again. A lot of better choices out there."}
