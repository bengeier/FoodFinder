{"text":"It was our first time going to this restaurant it's a brand new restaurant it's a mediocre sushi restaurant it's nearby in the neighborhood. It was very quiet and small inside. I'm sure it do well in the future."}
{"text":"I was really not happy with the service at this place. My friend and me went last Friday for lunch we sat down and ordered our food and water.  We were sitting for 20 minutes never got our water after 28 minutes we had to leave. We were on our lunch break and we just thought it would take more than 1 hr to get service since there were 4 other tables waiting for there food."}
{"text":"We had the AYCE traditional rolls.  All was good and service was very good!  Mario made our rolls and we had no complaints."}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost.  Sushi chef is the waiter, busser, and chef. Extremely small selection for the all you can eat. Low quality. I thought the chef was cleaning the refrigerator but when he turned around he had a California roll on his plate.  It tasted just okay.  Kind of on the plain side but what the hell was he doing in the fridge?"}
{"text":"This is now my go-to sushi place in Las Vegas! Keith, my sushi chef was excited and knowledgeable. The BOMB.COM roll was incredible! A Japanese Lasagna with jalapeño, salmon, mushrooms, Jack and cheddar cheeses, sriracha, and an added drizzle of jalapeño sauce! The Japanese Lasagna was also exquisite with the added jalapeño sauce. I knew I had a good feeling coming here instead of the other sushi place I was contemplating!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have never been big sashimi  Fan, but my friend talked me into trying it here. The albacore was amazing and so was the wonderful staff including Andrew. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Just thought I try this new AYCE place.  I don't expect the service will be good since they just opened recently.  When we got there, the service was not that bad.   This review is mainly on the food. We ordered rock shrimp aioli.  It's not the best and bit oily.  The same as their tempura.  It's oily.  I thought of trying the AYCE but I wanted to make sure that they have all the special sushi I like.  Well, they didn't have uni that time, so I checked sweet shrimp (amaebi), the waiter told me that they're removing that from the menu. What??  They don't have toro either, so i scratched the idea of AYCE.  Kaizen Fusion is a better option if you are a sushi lover for AYCE because they have those special sushi even if it's 1 time order only."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre!  My wife & I have been wanting to try this out and we left disappointed.   Service was fine.  We were nicely greeted and our server explained the all u can eat menu well.  I chose the chicken teriyaki bento box and my wife had the all u can eat sushi.  Hers arrived promptly and my bento took about 20 minutes?!   The chicken teriyaki bento was served with miso soup, California rolls and the bento itself.  California rolls were ok.  The rice was full and sticky and had a good flavor.  The wasabi was a bit mild to my taste. Miso soup was fine too.  When the bento finally arrived I was disappointed with it.  My first concern was iceberg lettuce.  I've never had iceberg lettuce in Japanese style cooking. The sesame dressing on it was spot on though. The tempura was oily. Major turn off. The chicken teriyaki was also lacking flavor and was oily.   My wife's sushi order was big!   Very large sushi and was ok but too big to get much variety.   I won't be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I had a great time here and the chef came out to talk to us, the food was good, and he let us try some of the popular rolls. The rest of the cousins nice's and nephews will be going back on Sunday. My experience was excellent."}
{"text":"The good:    We had the 10$ AYCE special. For 10$ we already knew not to expect to much.  well the quality was ok  some better then others but it WAs a steal of a deal and it did the job so we were happy in that sense.                 the bad:  it was very warm inside  the ugly:   miscommunication among staff , they are very disorganized.   the first waitress we had was very rushed to get off shift , left walked out passed us and didnt say a word. She  didnt even let the oncoming  waitress know anything about previous  orders / service we had placed.   Good thing The new waitress Vanessa is very charming and sweet because we forgot all about the other girl.         Although the deal was sweet I probably wont come back , at least until the staff becomes more organized."}
{"text":"I was there on a Saturday with my wife and daughter, we had to wait several minutes after 11:30 AM (hour of operation). When you put that time on the door, you need to be on time. The sushi chef was the waiter, busser, cook, and cashier. He did his best but all he could do was make sushi and nothing else. We were good with that since we wanted all-you-can eat sushi (rolls only and 1 drink) for $15 a person. Sushi was okay, but slow because he was all by himself. Everyone else called in. Not his fault but not good for a business which just recently opened. I wouldn't go back because there's no way I can recommend a place like this when you have more sushi restaurants in Vegas. I tried it, not going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I just got done eating lunch here after seeing a promotion on Facebook for $10 AYCE lunch. We were definitely skeptical after reading a few questionable reviews, but we had an amazing experience!! We were sat at the bar because there were no servers. Just one chef and one busser. My table was a bit dirty and the menu was sticky. I ordered quite a few orders of salmon and yellowtail nigiri and a few tradional salmon and yellowtail rolls. Everything was great quality, taste, and texture. Not the best I've ever eaten, but $10 for AYCE?! Can't complain! My husband got a few traditional and special rolls and wasn't a huge fan, adding to the 4 star rating. I tried a couple of his, and thought they were great, but I'm not the roll connoisseur that he is, I lean toward nigiri. We were the only people in there on a Wednesday at 2pm and the chef was very attentive and fast. Overall, great experience!! I would even consider paying the full price, but they have promotions going on all the time. Definitely would recommend based on my experience!!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Wonderful menu. Friendly staff. I went in for the $10AYCE, and it was a lot better than expected, as far as selection. With 40 items, I could hardly complain. Very short wait time (I came around 3). Going again soon."}
{"text":"LMAO WHAT THE FUCK. Lol this place. Funny af experience. Who runs out of rice at a sushi place lmao. We ate 4 rolls.. then they apologized for running out of rice.. and since it was closing in half an hour.. they couldn't make more. Hahaha funny af fam I can't stop laughing about it. It's like.. running out of buns at a burger joint.. running out of pizza dough at a pizza place. Never have I ever had this happen lmao. Besides that tho.  the assistant manager was cool and gave us free shit. Free appetizers...  1 beer.. if I knew they were gonna give us the drinks for free I would got turnt af and ordered 6 or 7. But they ended up only making it 10 bucks for everything so I can't complain.. they were sympathetic about it. But for reals tho like hahahahalmfaolmfaolmfaolmfao who runs out of rice. Ahhh fuck. Funny shit. 5 stars for the unique experience and hospitality. Maybe your experience will be better despite my review fam. Peace out#squadgoals #dank #fam #lit #af #runsoutofrice"}
{"text":"This is a true disaster! Trifecta of failure!  1. Food is bad. Bad quality. Bad selection. Bad execution.   2. The service and management are laughable!  The back is the front! Lazy/incompetent/unprofessional.   3. Literally, you'll get better service and quality at Smiths sushi counter."}
{"text":"Drove over 30 minutes due to the special they are running for all you can eat.. the place was essentially empty with 3 tables occupied with 2 people at each. They immediately tell my girlfriend and I that it's a 30 minute wait because of the to-go orders still waiting. We decided to stay only because we drove so long. We sat at the bar area and after 5 minutes the ONLY sushi chef that was on staff said \"it's going to be awile, look at all these in front of you\" and proceeds to point at the list of checks behind him. It wasn't very tactful but I somewhat understand. They needed to be staffed better if you're going to serve all you can eat, especially when running a discounted AYCE rate. We left without eating.  P.S. We went to Sushi Mon on Silverado Ranch and Maryland, fantastic food and service. They never keep you waiting."}
{"text":"So sad.. This place is suckkkkk so bad & for every Japanese dish that we order, fish is so disgusting and not fresh at all even for AYCE quality, the tempura suck and all the roll suck, rolls look like amateur chef skills, A Tiny TV to watch, Oh the only good thing about this place is a Sapporo beer..I won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is so bad that after my wife and I walked in and waited for 10 minutes for service in which no one came to our table we decided to walk out because there was a \"B\" Rating by the health department on the back wall. I don't think I want to eat sushi at a place that has that type of rating and the sushi chef was doing all the work while there was no help whatsoever. I have never seen a restaurant run so poorly and so we decided to leave. So glad we didn't eat here!"}
{"text":"I've been to their other location and found it just okay- a one and done kind of place for me. Facebook has been advertising the hell out of this new location's grand opening special ($10 AYCE lunch and $15 dinner), even extending it to the end of the year, so I brought my BF to try this one out despite the glaring reviews. Space is extremely clean.  The actual product is okay- certain fish were fresher than others, and the menu itself (even for dinner) is much more limited than other AYCE spots. The majority of rolls have cream cheese, which is a no-go for me, and the nigiri often came with a golf-ball sized chunk of rice. But some random items here and there were decent, like the Train Wreck and Salmon Lover rolls, and the super white tuna and garlic salmon nigiri.  However. The service and professionalism are seriously lacking. Our server was a nice guy, but clearly inexperienced and forgot some obvious things like individual plates and water refills. We asked for suggestions while ordering, only to hear that he doesn't like sushi- awkward! Also, they either have a resident crackhead or an off-duty employee hanging out at the bar in sweats and hitting up the bathroom every ten minutes while chatting with the staff. We laughed it off, but it factors into why I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Rolls with crab tasted very fishy. Place opened late. They were out of tuna and salmon. $10 ayce should have read $10 all you can stomach."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar and Keith made all our rolls. He was super nice and very attentive. Sushi was really good! Place looks clean. I'm giving them 4 stars because of the waitress (they need to step up their game). I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"There is a nice ambiance and the place is clean. They also have a great idea with $10 all you can eat standard rolls; however, they don't tell you the sticky rice is an 1/8 of an inch thick.   When funds are low I might be back."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Very fresh and the $10 AYCE lunch special going on now can't be beat. We arrived at noon and it was busyish. We were told to grab a seat and the waitress came over promptly took our order and brought our drinks. We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Average food, average service. Took them a while to make everyone's sushi. Only one server, one person in the kitchen and one sushi chef. They were out of salmon and didn't tell me until after I tried to order it again. This was my first time here since it changed to Tokyo, I really don't think I'll be back, there are better places."}
{"text":"Will NOT be back.  Decided to try Tokyo Sushi House II on Craig road in North Las Vegas today at 5 pm with my daughter.  We walked in and were greeted nicely by the guy behind the counter wearing a white chef coat and glasses and he told us to sit wherever we wanted. We sat down and there was one other family of three when we walked in.  The white coat chef then looked at the other guy behind the counter with dark hair and a black chef coat and asked him to get the girl from the back (I'm assuming the waitress).  He told him to get her himself.  So the guy in the white said he would if the guy in the black would put some gloves on to help.  So the guy in the black decided to walk around to the other side of the sushi bar and just SIT down. At this point I'm feeling bad for the guy in the white.  So he comes around and comes to our table and informs us that they are out of tuna!  I don't really mind because I don't eat tuna anyway.  We decide on ala cart (not all you can eat). We order edamame, miso soup, shrimp tempura and two sushi rolls.  The guy in the white chef coat seems to be doing everything. He makes and then brings me my rolls and I ate one of each and they tasted the same and looked the same and didn't have the right ingredients in them.  My daughter gets her soup and shrimp tempera. It was ok but she didn't even finish the shrimp tempura.  Finally the edamame comes out (big portion) after all our other food. The guy in the white coat comes to check on us and I told him my rolls weren't right. He offered to make me more but I didn't want anything at that point. He brought the leftover sushi behind the bar and the guy in the black coat started laughing. Couldn't make out what he was saying but he made it very uncomfortable.  I've NEVER sent food back in my life.  This place is a joke.  The guy in the white coat brought my bill and only charged me $15 for the appetizers that we had.  I tipped $5 because I felt bad how hard the guy in the white was working. Seems like he was the only one doing anything besides the cook in the back that actually made our appetizers and soup. All this time... No waitress.  Also seen a few people come and leave because there was no tuna. Do NOT come here. Left Disappointed & HUNGRY."}
{"text":"Came out to Las Vegas to visit friends and family for Christmas and was really jonesing for some good sushi.  My friend and I decided to try out this place since it is so close to his house.  The presentation for this restaurant is kind of a hole in the wall. But sometimes the best food can be found in such places. In this case we were definitely not disappointed with the quality of the food. The sushi chef was on point and created some excellent fresh pieces.  Some of the very best included garlic salmon nigiri and super white tuna with lemon nigiri both were excellent.  The presentation for the restaurant itself is Pretty Dirty and the attention to detail with the staff is just not there. Service was extremely slow especially for checkout.   It seems like this place has a lot of potential with the quality and style of the chef but staff would need training and there does not appear to be any routine as to how the restaurant is being run. Even the restroom trash was overflowing even though there was not a lot of business at the time. They appear to be low on some supplies and just we're lacking things that are often taken for granted in other restaurants. They really did not greet their customers very well when they came in the door as is traditional in most sushi restaurants and I even witnessed one potential customer come in and ask to sit at the sushi bar but was told the bar was closed so he just turned around and left.  If a routine could be established and a little more Pride taken I think this place could knock it out of the park."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Sushi house we come just about every payday. Good service, great sushi and the process when you like their Facebook page are unbelievable! Love this place"}
{"text":"sushi was delicious very weary. There for my birthday the sushi chef and staff sitting around at tables talking . No greeting towards us. They were out of ICE!!!! SCARY how's the fish up to temp. No ice for drinks either.  It took 10 min for one roll to come out and we were the only ones there. Won't be back management needs to evaluate help!!!!!"}
{"text":"REALLY HORRIBLE!  On October 14 we decided to have this $10.00 lunch special. When we arrived at the Craig property, the guy behind the sushi counter looked at us several times but never acknowledged us at all. We stood there waiting behind three other people and no one was acknowledged at all. There were two other people sitting at the sushi bar and I thought they had already been served but after about 5 minutes, they got up and left at which time I noticed that they had no food on their plate - their plate was clean and untouched!  As they walked past me, I asked them why they were leaving and they said they would have to wait 2 hours before being served because there was no one to prepare the food. The three people standing in line just in front of us also turned around and left seconds before the couple at the counter decided to leave.  Needless to say we left the restaurant also. It was very disgusting that no one acknowledged us and told us that there was a two-hour wait, even though they were only about 7 people sitting in the restaurant. The service was so terrible that we will never come back to this place again and it is shameful that Tokyo Sushi House would advertise a $10.00 lunch special when clearly they had no intentions of serving people."}
{"text":"Definitely... Not what we were hoping for. We liked the family that ran this location before so we naturally gravitated to this new place. When we walked in for lunch it was warmer than expected but not unbearable. Later on this becomes important as our raw fish wasn't cold. The texture? Unpleasant in the tuna roll especially. We0 did the $10 deal to try their basics to see if we'd be coming back again for dinner. Spoiler : nope.   All of the employees were bored. & talking to each other. Or lounging around. Our booth was dirty so I'm sure there were things they could be doing... Instead of yelling at landlords on the phone while eating the fish you're chopping up & literally making slurping sounds. Or walking around in your gym pants at work because you're off work... But not leaving... & telling everyone on the phone about it.   It felt like we were interrupting them. Our waitress was nice but we really could never get her attention because (you've probably guessed by now) she was too busy talking to the slurping guy.   Also - teriyaki chicken roll? Gross. Dark meat mangled pieces with super thick teriyaki syrup. & don't get water - it tasted like it came out of a bad water pipe or something which I didn't notice till later I was so thirsty.   All in all - we know more about these people while trying to each lunch than we do about our co-workers which is just weird.   Hard pass. A shame because the location was convenient. I'm glad we only wasted 10 each."}
{"text":"We came in for the 10$ AYCE (TRADITIONAL rolls only) well worth it for the price. The service was good and the chef was cool, all over a good place for cheap sushi."}
{"text":"So we showed at 1135am to try the $10 AYCE and the front doors were locked. Website, Yelp, all say open at 1130. We decided to wait thinking maybe there are just a little slow in ooening.  Well, 1145 rolls around, an employee opens the door and very rudely states we dont open till 1230 then closed the door on us. I used to come here when it was Sushi Zen. I figured new ownership, new Sushi, new everything. Very disappointed. If you are gonna open late.  Please update your times and teach your staff customer service. I really wanted to try this place, but after the treatment.. don't know if I will return. Such a shame. Hope the new owners see this review and correct the issue."}
{"text":"Good 10 dollar all you can eat if you can convince them to give it to you when they offer it. They didn't  have the air conditioning on. Good rolls."}
{"text":"This place was horrible the sushi had a very odd taste and there was only one waitress that took forever to get are drinks and food. We went there to check the $15 all you can eat and it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:15 on a Sunday and were told they are closed. All signage, including website and Facebook, states close at 9pm. Seriously disappointed in the responce of staff present."}
{"text":"I've tried to like you guys.  I'm sorry, but you can't run out of fish for sushi half way through an all you can eat dinner.  You really need to get your act together.  The sushi I did get was not really that great.  Service was really slow and the fish was not very fresh.  The kitchen food was the highlight of the meal.  The sushi chef barely said one word to us.  The $15 AYCE special was not quite as advertised and discussed on Facebook.    I'll probably never go back.  I've moved on.  Goodbye and good luck in your next job because I'm not sure how long you're going to be around based on what I've seen.  Not everyone should run a restaurant."}
{"text":"I thought this location would be better than the Cheyenne location, but it was just as bad, if not worse. When we walked in, there was one other couple seated in the restaurant. It was very warm and quiet. Most sushi places I've been to, including the Cheyenne location, had music playing. I was concerned about how warm it was in the restaurant since they're serving raw fish. The waitress was nice; however, I believe she was the only one working, besides the chef. We were going to do the AYCE dinner for $15.00 which was just for traditional rolls, excluding the spider roll. We ordered some water and put our order in for a few rolls. The chef came out and didn't seem to be in a hurry to prepare our food. He walked up and down the sushi bar, ran the sink, went to the back, walked around some more. Meanwhile, the waitress and chef are talking as we sit there waiting. We cancelled our order and left. Too many bad things in a short amount of time. I wasn't going to take my chances with the food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed all kinds of different sushi rolls tonight at this 2nd location of Tokyo Sushi House. Love me some AYCE scallops, eel, crab, salmon, tuna & yellowtail...all topped off with eel sauce, ponzu sauce, panko crunch, or avocado. Total foodcoma, and it was a great price, $15/pp (special thru end of October, lunch is $10/pp)! Loved the laid back atmosphere and service was outstanding! The sushi chef talked to us, answered questions and made suggestions and made the meal just that more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Yikes!!!! I am a sushi lover and I know when fish is good and bad and my oh my this place smelt like rotting fish, and there were only 2 people sitting at the bar 2 people and the 2 sushi chefs looked lost or something... I was already skeptical because $10 all you can eat is rather cheap and now I know why, I will always and forever have to drive all the way across town for sushi from now on I'll pay $25-$40 for all you can eat sushi I rather be happy than sick... we went back to our best spot Daisho sushi $25 all you can eat and the menu is endless of good sushi they have never failed us for the past year oh and 808 sushi during happy hour BOMB.com...enter this $10 special at your own risk"}
{"text":"After a long day.  A few beer and lots of sushi why not.  Mario made the whole day so much better.  Thank you Mario it was amazing.  The food was really good and fresh."}
{"text":"Last time we went there for lunch one of the waiters said I had to wait 30 minutes just to put in an order. We got there and waited about 45 minutes to get an item of food we finally got to order and they table that got there 20 minutes after us already had all of there rolls. We asked the waiter why we were still waiting for food and she told us the chef couldn't read the writing so he moved on to the next order. She was quick to defend herself and said it was not her fault. It was horrible. I had to remind them twice to bring my water. They ran our of rice and it was just all bad. Everything would have been better if it weren't for the attitude of the staff in particular the waitresses.   One waiter was just standing at the register doing absolutely nothing and the other one was just running around.  Never going back. Definitely debating even going to the Cheyenne location."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check these guys out after seeing their 15$ all you can eat special on Facebook. We arrived around 5:30. Not too busy. I ended up doing the 20.00$ all you can eat because it included the appetizers. We ordered a total of five rolls. The spider, Lisa Lisa, Jenny, volcano and bomb.com. Three were baked rolls bc we love a good baked roll but these seriously missed their mark. They ALL tasted the exact same, we were very disappointed. The two \"regular\" rolls, however, were quite good and we enjoyed them. For the appetizers I ordered the rock shrimp, it was more dough than cut up pieces of shrimp but the sauce was good. I would suggest putting more than just four tiny pieces per order and because of this I ordered another and it took a long time to get it."}
{"text":"Great food except AC was broken and they only had one server. I would recommend the Deluxe all you can eat since it includes all you can drink beer (hubby was happy about that). I would've rated higher if service was a little better and AC working. Boy- it sure was hot in there."}
{"text":"Small little sushi joint in N Las Vegas. I feel like the prices are very reasonable and they even have a $15 special of all you can eat sushi. This special includes all the Traditional Rolls, Legacy Rolls, and even Specialty Rolls! That's a total of 47 sushi rolls all ranging between $6 to $13! So if you eat 2+ rolls is totally worth it. I average about 4 rolls when I do this special and I always order the $10+ rolls which are the most expensive and tasty rolls they have. Definitely recommend if you are near by!  Mario is the main Sushi Chef and he is super charismatic and humble!"}
{"text":"This place is the same as the other place. I ended up waiting half an hour for a somewhat lousy rainbow roll (some of the fish fell off the top) and a dry spicy tuna roll (I believe it was sitting for about 10 mins before it came). This place may have an authentic appearance with an \"artistic\" appearance (if you call sprinkling too much seasoning on top of a spicy tuna roll, not like it needs seasoning on top in the first place). The sushi \"chefs\" were just messing around the whole time, meanwhile my date and I went in at 7:30, and left at 9:30, what'd we get that took that long? 3 rolls and 10 orders of nigiri (other places would take about 30 mins to make all this, I get the same thing at every AYCE restaurant, and 2 hours is just ridiculous).   I felt like I was the test subject, as I saw one of the kitchen workers from the back making my sushi WITHOUT gloves (according to SNHD gloves must be worn when preparing ready to eat food). After having the roll sent back, the chef came to my table and said that the best Japanese restaurants in the world don't use gloves, that may pertain to the BEST Japanese restaurant, but certainly not a mediocre restaurant like this (he came to the table to argue).   The rice was either undercooked, or crunchy. Either way, that's not how any of the rolls should be (considering they never went in the oven). Their dinner price is $26.95 (or something around that $.95 mark), which is the same price as other sushi restaurants. The difference? Other sushi restaurants offer Sweet shrimp, sea urchin, and salmon eggs for dinner. This place has none of those. You're basically paying the $7 difference (compared to $20 lunch) just because it's past a certain time, they do not offer the same dinner time perks as other restaurants.   In the beginning (past 2012) this \"chain\" restaurant was very good. But over the years it's gotten worse and worse. Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else, Sushi Loca, Krazy Sushi, Sushi Ko are all relatively close to this restaurant. Choose those places before choosing this place.   The positives of my meal here, the lemonade was amazing. It really helped with the dry, undercooked/crunchy rice they serve. The issue is that they  understaffed, the issue is that the \"chefs\" messed around the whole time and let the kitchen workers learn how to make sushi (allowing me, the customer, to be the guinea pig). I have no idea how they have two establishments. It's beyond me. But both are equally a disgrace to AYCE restaurants everywhere. The only reason why we ended up coming here is cause all the other sushi restaurants had a wait time of 30+ mins while this place was half empty (in retrospect I should've ran out the door, but I'm a sushi addict sooo....)"}
{"text":"my 2 star review is based on just the service. never got a chance to eat there! walk in on a sat. night. a few min befor 9pm. there are four people at the bar. the place is about half empty. first thing the sushi chef says to us is...\"Last call is in half hour. Just keeping it 100 with you guys!\". needless to say we left and went to sushi tachi"}
{"text":"It's honestly the worst sushi spot I've been to here in Vegas. The special they run isn't worth it. The quality of fish is inedible. They make excuses about being out of almost half of the items on their menu. The service is even worse. There isn't enough wait staff to cover the restaurant. Even for the small size of restaurant. No one should go here unless they have no other choice."}
{"text":"Supposed to open at 11:30 and with the heavy advertisement on Facebook in regards to the AYCE $10 special I had to check it out.  Well I got here at 11:29 and the doors were locked. At 11:34 some worker came out and told us (there are other people waiting) that they are still setting up and then shut and locked the door again. It is now 11:43 and I'm still here, outside waiting. Thank God it is not a hot Vegas afternoon.   11:45 the guy finally opened the door and just walked away. We walked in and I had to ask if we just sit anywhere. He told me yes, I asked if he was the only one here and he said yes and since it's just him that's why he opens up late. He told me he opens when he is ready. Then he proceeds to tell me just to let you know we have no salmon or tuna right now and that the delivery didn't come.  I told him never mind and he goes well for $10 it's still good. This guy never apologized for making my son and I wait outside for 15 minutes.  Very rude and horrible service that didn't get.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Thank god we have a good sushi place in North vegas they have a few kinks to work out but I see them being here for along time will definitely be coming back very friendly atmosphere Keith our chef war great."}
{"text":"Had to be the worst experience EVER!   FIRST.  we get here and they tell us that they are a bit behind.  We wait patiently.  SECOND.  30 minutes later they take our order  THIRD. 1 hour later the table that came in after us gets ALL OF THEIR ROLLS as well as the other tables around us.   I ask what's going on and express my frustration. They say ... oh we're sorry. We made their order first because the chef could not read the handwriting from the girl who took the order order.  It's been over an hour and I've had enough time to write this review and order a pizza from next door without a single roll being delivered.   I USED TO LOVE THIS PLACE.   NOT HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE OR THIS PLACE... BETWEEN THEN RUNNING OUT OF FISH, RICE AND THE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE... I'M RUNNING OUT OF STARS TO DEDUCT!"}
{"text":"We visited this place on on Thursday.  I have been waiting for it to get on yelp. First of all the service is horrible  we got to order a few rolls once every hour so we waited  a total of 2 hours to get the rest of our rolls. There was only 1 waiter and 2 sushi chefs. Our waiter only came by twice had to get his attention to order refills and rolls. It was also super hot in the restaurant it seemed like they did not have the ac on at all.  We are big time sushi lovers we always go to ayce sushi restaurants. So we decided to try their $10 special because who can really mess up on regular rolls right lol. Well the sushi was OK but you could tell the rice in the sushi was not fresh at all. I rather go spend $32 on an ayce restaurant that has good service and fresh sushi. Won't be returning at all."}
{"text":"Ratings are all in the value and $15 all-you-can-eat sushi for the ALL traditional rolls (only $10 for lunch) until the end of the year is a good price. Super filling and sauces are ultra flavorful. Not sure about maybe $25 for the same deal but add an all you can drink option and it's totally worth it!! Staff was very friendly and wish their business success for during the holiday season and beyond!!! My favorite was the chicken teriyaki roll, train wreck, dabomb.com and salmon lovers!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday 12/21/16 around 3ish for the lunch special. One employee was literally smoking right in front of the door as we walked in & the other employee was sitting down on his phone then got up when we entered without greeting us. Sushi took a lot longer than we expected. We were the only ones in the restaurant (four adults, a four year old & a one year old.) Sushi was subpar. Service was lacking. Had to hassle the employee for a fork & to order more sushi. Really wanted to enjoy this location since there were so many awesome reviews also you cant beat the $10 price. I will never eat here or recommend eating here since the service was so horrible. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Since this restaurant is pretty close to my house, I came a couple more times after my earlier disappointment (see my attached picture: sushi for ants). Apparently they have TWO facebook pages, Tokyo Sushi House 2 and Tokyo Sushi House II. Tokyo Sushi House II advertised a $15 AYCE special for the Craig location, but once I got there, a worker told me that that was wrong because two different people manage the two different FB pages. How confusing! Even after I showed him the picture from my phone, he still insisted that I was wrong with an attitude. Honestly, I was just a bit confused and trying to understand why they have two different FB pages lol. Not wanting to argue any further, I dropped the issue and ordered a la carte instead. After sitting for about 20 mins the manager came by and said he would honor the $15 AYCE special that was advertised on the \"wrong\" FB. Mind you, the \"wrong\" FB page has over 300+ likes, is constantly Sponsored on my FB feed, while the \"right\" FB page hardly gets any traffic. Who wouldn't be confused?   Other than that strange situation, the rolls are OK. They ran out of unagi one day I was there. Another day, the rice they used in the rolls was not even sushi rice--it was bland, like they got it straight from a rice cooker, unseasoned. Also, don't get the water, it tastes metallic. After giving this restaurant multiple chances, I think I'm burnt out. The cheap AYCE is cheap for a reason, but even then it is not worth it. Hard pass."}
{"text":"We finally found our sushi spot! The rolls were more than amazing. Andrew, the manager, definitely made this a great experience and Mario made delicious rolls. We will totally be back and spread the word! It's a small space but better than anything my hubby and I have had."}
{"text":"Sushi was great and service was fast. Tried almost 15 different rolls and can't complain whatsoever. Everything was delicious and the server was great."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly plus they have a $15 all you can eat traditional rolls. Mario the chef was really nice."}
{"text":"First I would like to say how amazing Phillip was. He has exceptional customer service. Now the people that he works with are terrible. We waited a long time to have our rolls we only got 4 and we ordered a total of 11. The chefs were unprofessional no sense of urgency at all when Phillip asked about our rolls. We were able to get 2 boxes because they were done and the others were cancelled. The chefs were talking to one another the whole time we were there. No apology for the wait that says a lot about the service they did not provide. Phillip didn't charge us which we greatly appreciate. There was another individual in the back who was wearing adidas slippers and listening to hip hop on top of the music that was already playing in the restaurant. Ultimately there has to be a better system in the way they treat customers. I gave 2 stars because of Phillip. If the chefs were more time efficient then this place could of had 5."}
{"text":"Service sucks!  There were only 2 people in the restaurant when we came in. Whoever was working had told us we could sit anywhere. We sat and it took a few minutes for our \"waiter\" to ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered water but that alone took 10 mins to come out. The only chef had to keep telling the waiter what to do & to bring us utensils & plates. After about a 15 min wait, the waiter finally came back to take our order. Our appetizers (miso soup/rice) came 20 mins later and the whole hour we waited, we only got 2 rolls out of the 6 we ordered. We finally ended up canceling and the chef said we didn't have to pay.   I try to give people who work at restaurants my time & patience because it's not easy working serving people but we weren't even acknowledged to see if we needed anything else. The waiter kept going to the back doing who knows what.  If they were understaffed, someone could have said something about it, apologized for the wait, etc.    Never coming back here again."}
