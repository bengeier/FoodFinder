{"text":"Gave it another go.....worse than before. Need a list  from BlogTO for worst service....this place would win hands down...  You want an English Pub? walk across the street to The Dog and Bear....way better service, better food and way less attitude....not busy at all on a Friday so my bet is it will be gone by spring, just like Samuel J Moore... Strike 2....."}
{"text":"I really like the d√©cor here and our server was friendly, it was nice to hear a Glaswegian accent. We enjoyed the beer and cider on tap.   We ordered the fish and chips and the vegetarian Shepard's pie. The food came out a little too fast. The fish and fries looked very dark which didn't look too appealing but taste wise were fine. The pie was well seasoned even if I wished veggie options everywhere would stop just throwing beans into things!   We had heard good reviews on food so perhaps will give that another shot since it didn't bowl us over, but definitely worth a tipple here."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times, namely for the Sunday night roast beef dinner. I'm sad to say that this prix fix has gone downhill a lot in the past few years. I first went when they had their location on Christie and it was a thing - a huge proper British style dinner and always packed. I went again this month and there were no mashed potatoes, no mushy peas and the roast, while flavourful, was very gristly - extremely rare with a lot of fat. Still love the yorkshire pudding and sticky toffee dessert though. Sorry...really nice neighborhood place - just disappointed, hope you'll bring back the old style again."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and it was great- good menu, good mimosas and good service so myself and a couple friends decided to try it out for food and drinks on Saturday night. Never again! We were walk ins so didn't have a reservation, but there were plenty tables available when we got there. We sat down at one, took our coats off, chatted for 5 minutes then were asked to move as we didn't have a reservation for a table (which is fair enough). We asked for the next available table for 3 and ordered drinks- half an hour later- empty tables are still there, so we asked again and were told they weren't aware we were waiting for a table! About 15 minutes later, more walk ins appeared and were seated before us so we asked again and again were told they weren't aware we were waiting for a table and the wait would be 45 mins-an hour! We eventually were seated at a makeshift broken table in the middle of the floor, in the middle of a bachelor party. The food when we eventually got it was good and we all enjoyed it. I asked for mine to be wrapped up to go as I didn't finish it all, paid the bill then asked if my food was ready- only to be told it had been thrown out as they didn't realize I wanted it wrapped up to go!  The menu is great at The Bristol, its a nice spot and the food is delicious, I'll be back for a quiet brunch but the service and organization was pretty disappointing for dinner."}
{"text":"Pint of stout, bangers and mash w/ mushy peas. Food was good.  Servers were friendly but service was a bit on the slower side but nothing to really complain about."}
{"text":"Meh is right.  Service was great, food really was sub par.  The Eggs St. George (their regular eggs benny with a small dollop of hot sauce on top) were served with poached eggs that were hard, the fresh baked scone it was served on was so hard, I couldn't cut through it.  The potatoes were fine, and the salad mediocre.  My partners \"Glasgow\" was so-so.  It, too, was served on scones (in his case - potato), and they were vastly undercooked.  Drinks were fine.  Ambiance was nice.  I wouldn't ever eat there again, but for a drink it was fine. Note: their air conditioning doesn't work well, so don't go on a warm day."}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast today.  Food served pretty quickly despite being busy by our friendly server.  The menu gives many hearty options.  The Bristol was tasty and the Glasgow had a tasty sausage patty and potato scone.  Yum.  We'll be back for Scotch Eggs and Vindaloo."}
{"text":"The Bristol was advertising itself as a destination to watch a football (match).  Perhaps at the older location, I would've considered it but not at it's current location.  The food was ok, the service was fine...yet the experience still left a lot to be desired.  I had initially been given the brunch menu and was looking forward to ordering The Maradona.  Unfortunately when I went to order, I was told that it was after brunch and was subsequently given the lunch menu.  After some deliberation I chose the Skooby Snack and started to settle down to watch the match.  Another 5-10mins later the server returned to let me know that they were out of the Skooby snack and I would have to select something else.  Eventually I got some fish and chips, which I can only describe as overcooked but adequate.  In regards to watching a match...the TVs are too small and there is too much inane chatter from people not there for the match.  I should've expected as much from a queen st west brunch place.  I would go back to try The Maradona, the Skooby snack or their Sunday roast dinner...not for a match."}
{"text":"The Bristol is the revamp of The Bristol Yard. Cosmetically, it's an upgrade, but now it's a try-hard and empty imitation of a British pub. After a somewhat less than medicore Friday night experience, I would not go again.  Pros: nice selection of cocktails and beers at reasonable prices and nice decor. Tardis near the washrooms concealing a ATM is a bonus. Cons: small tables, slightly below average service, poor to mediocre food, and a \"hip\", but empty ambiance.  Drinks: I liked the cocktail list, since they had lots of gin-based drinks on the menu. The Pimm's punch was fine and the gin sour was OK. Prices for cocktails ranged between $10-$12, which is very reasonable.  Food: Except for the chips, the food is poor to mediocre.  I had the Scooby Snack ($15), a gargantuan sandwich, which is a \"everything but the kitchen sink\" sandwich with a fried egg, fried black pudding, sausage patty, potato scone, bacon, tomato, and lettuce on a Scottish bap. It sounded a like a heart attack on a plate and I had my cardiologist on stand-by. It's a shock-jock dish, i.e., something put on the menu that's outrageous so you can say you ordered it, but it's not very good. The sandwich was too big to fit into my mouth in one bite. The bacon was tough, the sausage patty could've been used in construction (as could the potato scone), and the sandwich managed to be dry despite the sunny side up egg. My jaw hurt after  four bites and I had to disassemble it and eat it piece-meal until my jaw got too tired trying to chew the bacon. I love bacon, but this was bad bacon, which seems like an oxymoron. The sandwich only furthered the stereotype that British food is bland and awful (which I know isn't true having eaten some great British food elsewhere). I didn't finish the dish and left most of it on my plate.  Friends who ordered differently had similar opinions about the bangers and mash (meh) and the tandoori chicken wrap ($12). The prices are reasonable, but the food is comparatively poor to decent pub fare in Toronto.  Service: I didn't think it was great, but we were a table of ten. It was sometimes difficult to grab our server's attention and when we didn't want her attention, she kept on popping up. I felt the stress of serving us and her other tables radiating off of her and there was no warmth which would be par for the course in a pub. However, the server seemed well-intentioned and was nice enough to bring us pitchers of water instead of just glasses. As always, refills of water were very slow in coming. Ultimately, it was a slightly lower than average standard of service for Toronto, i.e., it's bad service, but because Toronto's service standards are so poor, diners' rubrics have to be re-calibrated.  Ambiance: some people would love the atmosphere because it's cool and trendy. To me, just seemed somewhat try-hard. Not my cuppa, but young twentysomethings who want a decent beer list at decent prices (average $7/pint) will like it.  Conclusion: I really wanted to like The Bristol, but all I can muster after a visit last night is regret that The Bristol Yard is no more. The Bristol Yard was a small, humble place with heart and decent food at affordable prices. The Bristol is polished with a far more upscale and trendy feel with lots of TVs, deep brown leather loveseats, and cool decor. It's shiny, new, and pretty, but ultimately, the pretensions towards being a more upscale pub are just that -- pretentious -- because it has little heart and warmth and the overall experience was disappointing in light of what The Bristol Yard was."}
{"text":"Great meal! British food was done perfectly. Pie crust was flakey and fresh. Excellent fish and chips. Loved the mushy peas! Indian curries were spicy and better then some Indian restaurants. Will definitely return when in Toronto again."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot on Queen West with a lot of potential. I've been there for drinks a number of times and have also enjoyed their British-style brunch.  The brunch was delicious - filling, served hot and reasonably priced.  My main suggestion with this place is to hire a full time host for nights - each time I've been there in the evening the bartender tells you to seat yourself and eventually a server comes over and finds you.  During brunch the waitress did not refill coffee or water unless asked so I would get the brunch hostess to go on regular tours of the restaurant filling up water and coffee.  The Bristol is a cute and warm place you should check out if you're on Queen West and would like a spot where you can actually carry a conversation."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning - we got there when the restaurant just opened so there was no wait - but even as we were eating there really wasn't much of a line or wait either.  I ordered the eggs Bristol - it was an average eggs benny but the homefries were very dry and some of them were even burnt.  Would probably not come back to this place for brunch."}
{"text":"This place is definitely my go to. They just revamped the menu. If you get a chance to go for the Sunday Roast, do it!! The taps they have are really good, the stout's my favouritr. The staff is always friendly and attentive. They also have tvs, which makes it a perfect spot to catch a game."}
{"text":"Went here last night after seeing reviews and everyone raving about how great it was.   So it was a reasonably quiet night from a patron perspective, quiet it was not though. The music was so loud the person taking our order couldn't hear us and even admitted it needed turning down. We ordered battered bangers and mash and the fish and chips with Welsh Rarebit to start. The toast on the rarebit was burnt and it was okay but nothing to write home about. Entrees arrived. Bangers and mash were less than average, the mushy peas were excellent but mashed potatoes were pretty tasteless. The bangers were dry and the flavour over powered by either thyme or sage.   Fish and chips were dismal. I'm not sure what happened with the fish but the two pieces I had were the size of sardines! The thick cut chips were fine, cooked too much But passable. Batter on the fish was light and tasted okay. Overall we felt like we were not getting value for money. Small portions for the price, compared to other places locally of similar style. Service was ok but these places really need to decide whether loud music isn't more suited to a dance club rather than what they are trying to sell as the local pub.   Won't be going back."}
{"text":"When I went for brunch a couple months back I enjoyed my meal, not only were the portions huge but they were delicious. I had the french toast coated in rice krispies and my friend had the regular eggs, hash browns and bacon. I loved their version of Mimoas with beer instead of champagne. I was excited to come back.   We went for dinner last night and the food was terrible. The hostess that greeted us wasn't too friendly but we made the best of it and had a drink and played some cards while waiting for a table. We ordered apps which were beyond bland, we were all starving so we eat them regardless  and waited for our mains. I had a burger which was dry and boring, my friend had the chicken and waffles which were horrible, other friend had the banger butty he didn't enjoy either. Only person who enjoyed their meal was my boyfriend who had the steak pie with stilton, it was pretty delicious. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing...but how can you mess up a burger? Might only be back for a beer, I like their selection."}
{"text":"came here because I've been craving a good proper English breakfast for so long but I got here a bit late and arrived in time for their 5:30 dinner time. The atmosphere is really relaxing and welcoming, cute english decor. The menu makes my mouth water; from Indian English fusions to traditional big brunch plates... I had the cauliflower and cheese pie, one of the only few vegetarian choices. Nonetheless, it was delicious. Served with tasty, traditional mushy peas, gravy and chunky, thick chips. I will definitely be back for a good hangover breakfast cure!"}
{"text":"Backstory - One night my SO had a pleasant drunken conversation with the friendly bartender here. Since then, he almost always ends his drunken nights here. He said he's always wanted to visit this place sober.  Place is clean and spacious and I love the British decor. At night the music is usually old school hip hop and during the day its the Beatles.  If you're not a bud light on tap kind of person, youll probably enjoy their selection of British drinks.   As for brunch, well it was great. Really, I wasn't expecting much since I only ever come here to drink, but I really enjoyed my food, even more than some other highly rate brunches on here.  SO got the herbivore with poached eggs on a portobello mushroom and biscuit, I got the house special. Loved every part, from the salad to fries. Potatoes were perfect - flavourful but not salty, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Overall every part was cooked well and appetizing.  Will definitely make this place a usual."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to The Bristol. As an expatriate I am always looking for a taste of home.   We went for a mid afternoon Sunday Brunch and were seated immediately.  I ordered the Full Monty and my wife went for the Bristol Toast (a seemingly egg-less variant on French Toast).   Lots of little things contributed to the low score: - No decaf beverages  - OJ came with far too many ice cubes  - Although authentically British the bacon looses points for being slightly undercooked  - Garlic Loaf used for the fried bread and Bristol Toast,  not a pleasing discovery - Home made beans were listless and flavourless  - Home made brown sauce was abysmal  - Scrabble game was missing 6 tiles - Fried Toast was a) cut too thick, b) not fried (seemed like it was grilled on a flat top), and c) not cooked with the fat from the bacon and/or sausage - potatoes were dry  Would I go back? Maybe. Certainly not for brunch,  and now that my expectations are a lot lower they may be met."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and the service was horrid and my food was way worse. I did not eat my eggs benedict as the eggs had not been drained, the scones were soaking wet and cold and the meat had a strange taste. When I spoke to the waiter he never apologized and even tho I only ate one bite when he took it away he still charged me!!!!!! I would never ever come back and will tell all my friends how poor every part was. The bathrooms were clean at least."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks one night and had a couple beers. They have a decent selection and for the price you get a good amount of beer. It's a lively, fun atmosphere, but beware service is slow on the weekends due to it getting pretty busy. There brunch is four stars! It's delicious, big portions  and fair pricing. Line for breakfast on weekend can get crazy long, so be prepared for a wait! But it's definitely one of the best brunch spot in neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had dinner here (I've only ever been here for brunch which I would highly recommend!).   We started off with the cleverly named Porkoras, which are pakoras with smoked bacon. They were a really big portion but a little underwhelming - all you could taste was batter and chunks of bacon fat. After that I wasn't sure what to expect of our main. Our server recommended the Steak & Ale pie and I'm really glad she did because that dish is the only reason I'm giving this review a four star. I can see why that dish is a customer favourite. The pastry is light and delicate, the filling is hearty - they don't skimp on the steak, and the mashed potatoes (made with real potatoes) are soft and fluffy.  Writing this review makes me want to order one right now!  The service time was average and our server was attentive and friendly. I would definitely go back for that Steak & Ale pie again."}
{"text":"Not so flavourful - the curry poutine was soggy and sweet. Not to my liking. Nice decor if you like a sports bar. My friend found a hair in his curry, but, you know, shit happens."}
{"text":"The meals my boyfriend and I ate yesterday were very good. The fish and chips portion is massive and the best tasting fish I've had. The batter wasn't too greasy and it went well with their house made tarter sauce. Bangers and mash tasted just like the pub near my flat in England. I'm not a fan of mushy peas, but the taste was fairly good, and the mash was seasoned really well.   What brings the place down is their service and lack of knowledge. My boyfriend enjoys trying their different beers, but yesterday he mentioned that the waitress never seems to know anything more than the names of the beers they offer, except for one particular type that she knows the flavouring of it but not the name.   Overall, this is a nice casual hangout spot. The food is not outstanding but still good, and hits the spot if you want some English comfort dishes. They always have room to sit, though it gets difficult when a football game is on. They sell Crabbie's ginger beer too, which was exciting for a non-beer drinker."}
{"text":"I have been here for brunch and for dinner, and didn't leave disappointed either time! Went with my boyfriend who is Irish but grew up in England and even he raved about the food here. For dinner we each had a curry dish and they were both delicious and the presentation was really nice as well. One time we went there at they were playing Dr. Who and it seemed like people just went there to watch it and have some pints. Which is fine, although we weren't aware of this at the time and it (the TV) was super loud but whatever.  Overall, friendly service and good food. The atmosphere is nice, and I love snagging a table by the cozy (electric) fireplace. I would go back."}
{"text":"Came here for weekday brunch with a friend.  I'd heard it was good and it did not disappoint.  We were literally the only customers at 1pm - I wasn't even sure it was open.  We had a friendly, patient server who popped by every once and awhile to make sure we were OK.  Didn't seem to mind that we hung out to chat long after finishing eating.  Food was incredibly reasonably priced.  All day breakfast was $10 with a generous portion of eggs, two big slices of bacon, toast, fries (not my favorite) and a small salad.  I felt the portion was quite generous.  Took a look at the dinner menu and would love to come back."}
{"text":"We headed out for dinner as UK folks living in Chicago, it seemed to check our cravings boxes   Spent $30 return cab fares from downtown and was excited to get some expat food having read the menu  Did not realize there were no \"all day\" breakfast  or brunch items which ruled out cheesy beans and full Monty variants etc as these are weekend mornings only   We were told that every type of pie and the the balti curry also not available   On ordering another cider, then told that all Burgers off the menu now too  Pretty much left with a choice of bangers and mash, fish and chips both with mushy peas and a couple of curries, the third was going to be too hot   Curry was ok to good if you like sweeter tika but as a pub curry no issues  Fish and chips and bangers and mash were sent in with arugula salad in absence of mushy peas !!!  Bangers, mash and arugula nothing to write home about   Just not cricket   Fish was OK and chips OK but not like UK   All in all the lack of menu was more than a little disappointing.  They took off  $2 to $3 off each dinner but after a $30 transit fare the discount was irrelevant we could afford to eat at places close to hotel with high ticket items, we chose to make the trip for the experience which unfortunately was not good"}
{"text":"Wings are.... curry, very british, not my fave. The Cauliflower bites are AMAZING!  Service is always good! Friendly and helpful. This is a fun place, that's clean, pretty and cozy. Really like it. They have a TARDIS! and nice bathrooms. And good drinks menu, the pies are lovely but the Sunday night dinner is to die for! NOM NOM! Great seating for the games!   I love it here!"}
{"text":"Was at the Bristol on Saturday april 4th. We were a party of 8 was great the to go downtown for a treat.  We all eat differnet food I had their Rover hamburger with the blue cheese was so big great flavour.  Also others ordered the fish and chips, the roti and beef pie.  We also ordered appetizer with cheese and pork pie was so delicious.  The service was really good and the she did bring our water and drinks they way we requested.  It was not to busy it was early in the day and will go back soon like the food and service. The price for what we paid was great just loved the food."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal here on opening night. This pub is a great addition to the neighbourhood.   The fish and chips was the best I've had in the city - generous portion with delicious house made tartar sauce.  My partner had the phall curry with shrimp. We were warned it was hot, but it ended up being too hot for us both (and we order gandhi Rotis extra hot!). Our mistake though, and would definitely go back and order a milder version as the flavour was great and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. Who would expect a British pub is beating most Toronto Indian restaurants for spiciest curry?  The service was great. Our server walked us through the list of Innis & Gunn beers on tap in a Glaswegian accent. While we didn't eat it on this visit, the vegetarian shepherds pie is vegan.  Looking forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Luck would have it that I was close enough to Queen West yesterday to make coming down worthwhile, especially because I needed a ticket to the summer BLOWUP which will take place at the Bristol.  Ticket in hand, I decided to stick around for some brunch.  Why did I think, and fear, that the menu had drastically changed since things were located on Christie?  The huge breakfast and many of the other favourites were still around.  And everything on that that huge breakfast plate remains as tasty as ever: mushrooms, tomato, toast, bacon, sausage, etc., etc.  No doubt about it--this is my favourite breakfast in the city.    My order took a little while so the waitress brought out a bonus black pudding meat pie.  So good!  I liked the old digs but this new location is very spacious and has a full, well stocked bar.  Service was great.  Given what you are getting, $20 for this amazing breakfast plate plus a pint is totally worth it.  They are not opening up a can of Heinz beans or using Sysco back in the kitchen.  Toronto is spoiled for good breakfast and brunch places but the Bristol is worth a trip out of your neighbourhood.  I'm eager to try dinner here soon."}
{"text":"We were enticed into brunch by the beautiful pictures of the food. I had the Full Monty and my DC had Egg St. George. It didn't look like the pics; arugula salad was replaced with overdressed mixed greens; and things seemed a bit overpriced. The food was so-so; nothing special; and my baked beans were cold. The sausage was very good and the toast was doughy and undertoasted?  Maybe it's new kitchen staff? Our server caught an error that they had made."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review on the last 3 times I've been here. The first time my boyfriend took me here, it was not what I was expected. I didn't like it much. I had the Glasgow which is a plate of potato scones topped with sausage meat and then a poached egg served with gravy. But funnily enough, I took home 1/2 of my brunch with no intention of eating it, but after reheating it was so good!!!!!! I wanted more.   Came back a second time, the menus were different and the potato scones were different, chewier and dry and I left extremely disappointed.   The last time I was here with my boyfriend we service was slow and the food took about an hour long wait. Ridiculous. Every time I seem to come back it gets a little more disappointing.  If people ask me if they should go, my answer is yes. Go! Try it. The brunch is delicious. Will I myself be back, however? With my luck, probably not. I don't think my poor little heart can withstand being disappointed again."}
{"text":"I really like this place... well probably more than like.... I've been to this place 4 times in the last few months. .. twice for brunch. . Twice for dinner. . No disappointments. Anyone who knows me knows that I don't like going to the same restaurant too often but this place has kept me happy.  Their menu has so many interesting items. . And while the menu is not huge,  I want to come back to try something else. I've has their fish and chips and their veggie burger. .. both were delicious. The British style keeps things traditional yets add a little bit off Indian flair.   The drinks list has a bit of the old with some new brews to keep things interesting.  The staff is also super friendly.  It's a good place to watch the Hockey game and they are willing to accommodate if it's not on TV.  So whether it's day or night... whether you want something comforting and hearty.. can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Customer service and food - spot on.  Folks were friendly and the atmosphere very comfortable. It was quiet when I came by but later it was filled with people watching soccer I believe.  Haven't a single complaint other than I really wanted to try the fried bread which is only available on the weekend. I'll have to come back.  It's a pub menu you'll find with classic fish and chips and shepard's pie, of course. Went with breakfast and was absolutely happy with my choice.  Crispy, slighted salted potatoes, fluffy scrambled eggs, two generous slices of bacon, grilled tomato, beans and toast. Served with a really good in house made HP sauce.  Washed down with some water and a cup of coffee.   Highly recommend. No pretentiousness here. Just good vibes and fine tasting pub food.  Cheerio!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday with my partner.   Let me start by saying our server was excellent. Attentive but not intrusive.  The food, however, was mediocre at best.   The Bristol's website brunch menu and actual menu were different. I had planned to order one of the salads that was on the online menu (which happened to be on the online and \"actual\" dinner menu as well), but unfortunately for whatever reason they could not accommodate.   We ordered the steak dish and eggs benny. Neither were particularly good...  The steak was tough and overdone. I could not cut, nor chew, it. The eggs that came with the dish were over cooked as well. The salad dressing (which came with the side salad) tasted like raw garlic. Both the steak and Benny dishes needed salt.  I wanted to live this place. The online menu looked promising, and the service was great... But I just can't get past the food, which was terrible... Sorry, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place but it was, as the stars indicate, a fail.  My husband is British and we are always looking for a good English breakfast.  The Bristol doesn't deliver.   The good: The hot sauce The sausage The potato scones  The bad: Grease upon grease just for the sake of serving grease.   Bad homemade brown sauce- don't mess with HP Bad homemade ketchup  Unauthentic homage beans- sorry, where is the tomato sauce?  Why are 80% of the beans kidney beans?  What are the beans so clumpy and dry? Way too thick cut bacon, undercooked and fatty.  The service - there is no indication whether this is a seat yourself or wait to be seated establishment.  After waiting at the front, then waking to the empty bar to ask, we sat ourselves.    And then, proceeded to wait for 10 minutes before one of the three people on the floor checked on us.   We received no quality check, no offer to fill our coffee, which not came half full to begin with.  If the service was better I would be rating this 3 stars"}
{"text":"Wow, what happened to this place? The food and service were once so fantastic I couldn't wait to come back! I brought friends from out of town as I had been raving about it for a while. Boy, was I embarrassed. Our waitress (who needed to sit down or 'squat' beside you to get your order) seemed, umm, stoned? Had a hard time remembering our orders, and we waited ages for everything. It was over 2 hours for dinner and we didn't even have a dessert. We asked 3 times (different staff) for the bill and it finally came 40 minutes later. I've never had such slow, uninterested services, and it wasn't only us that were affected. The heat was so hot in the place they had to crack the doors open as we were literally sweating (it's February). And then there's the food.... the appetizers were decent. The sunday roast took nearly an hour to arrive at our table and it was, well, average to good I guess. The once fabulous steak and ale pie was now about as good as a frozen one from your grocery store, dry and quite salty. And where is that beautiful gravy they used to serve? They now have overly-saged, bland gravy. SOOOOO disappointing, we wont' bother returning ever. I'm guessing either the owners changed, or the chef left with his recipes and cooking skills. It shows."}
{"text":"Food was okay/medium. Unfortunately, the delay in getting our food and service turned this review lower"}
{"text":"The worst service around. First time there, was told the kitchen equipment was down - an hour after sitting there Second time - wasn't even looked at, the waiter was walking around all squirrelly and completely ignored the other side of the restaurant. As told from another couple who had been sitting there for 20 min with zero acknowledgement. Food doesn't look that good to put up with that service"}
{"text":"This review is a bit late but I wanted to write one anyways. The service from our male server was very poor. He didn't even acknowledge us when we came in. Food took an extremely long time, almost an hour, to arrive. The food was decent but nothing special.  I wouldn't recommend a special trip here."}
{"text":"This review is for their curry - we ordered two types - the chicken raj (madras style) and the lamb vindaloo. Both curries were $15, and included rice, roti and pappadum. The sauces for both curries were OK, but the portion size was pretty small.   The lamb was incredibly tough - it wasn't cooked long enough to break down the connective tissue in the muscle. The vindaloo had an odd bitterness to it as well.  The chicken raj was OK - a little salty for my taste. The roti tasted like it was from a package, and not made in house. The rice was hard and undercooked.  Would we order it again? No. It wasn't well-prepared, and the portion size was incredibly small for the price. Would we return to The Bristol? Yes, but probably for brunch."}
{"text":"We went for some Christmas cheer this evening at The Bristol, which is in our 'hood (most restaurants/pubs in our 'hood were closed).  Others had the same idea.  John was our server and he took good care of us."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6 for Easter weekend. The restaurant was not full but they took a while to bring our food. I had the eggs St. George and they were delicious. It was very reasonably priced with our bill coming to less than 40$ for 2 meals and a beer.   Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"When we sat we were informed the place was closing for rebranding in three days and their selections would be limited. Probably a bad sign from the start. I ordered the steak and ale pie with mashed potato and mushy peas. I got lukewarm mash, peas (no mush to speak of) and a dry, broken pie with flavorless gravy on the side. And the presentation was nothing to write home about. The pie looked like it was dropped from a height onto the mash and peas. Nothing like some of the nicer pictures you see in other reviews. My girlfriend ordered a salad with no cheese and chicken added. They brought her a salad with cheese and no chicken. The server apologized and brought her a salad with no cheese and no chicken. She was halfway done her salad by the time the chicken arrived. The waiter took it off the bill, at least. Not a great experience for people visiting from out of town. As it's doors are closing, it's a moot point, I suppose."}
{"text":"This quarter Irishman of Republican leaning origins seldom appreciates anything British. British cars, unreliable. British food, generally garbage, British Accents, silly.

The breakfast here is amazing, and the porters and stouts they have to accompany a breakfast/brunch are fantastic. The french toast with rice crispy batter is to die for. The server's were mad chill as well and I tipped them well.  The Bristol is tight."}
{"text":"Would love to review the food but unfortunately I can't, having walked in twice to a partially empty venue and having to leave after waiting 20 minutes for the indifferent wait staff to acknowledge me let alone offer to take a food order. The place looks pretty cool which is why I gave it another chance, I think they were happy to see us walk out. I guess queen west staff are above the clientele.  Update: this place closed down, surprise surprise"}
{"text":"Decided to try out Bristol for Sunday brunch as they got a great 2014 review for brunch. We headed on over with 8 of us including the toddler. Shortly after the doors open this place was rammed, with barely any room to move around. This place is happening. The atmosphere is what I would call a modern british pub. It's a nice looking place for what it is. The food was where the big hit was. Everyone was raving about their dishes and the portion sizes were excellent. We had ordered a simple french toast which was the standard fare but very well done. The little one ate all the food which is definitely a good sign on the food front. Only downfall was the service which was pretty wretched, negative, slow, not caring. I'd go back even knowing how bad the service is as the food and vibe are quite good there."}
{"text":"Used to be The Bristol Yard over on Christie Street.  Now they've got a tonne more space.  Really cool atmosphere.  Food is glorious, just like my British mum used to make for us as kids.  I love their fish and chips.  You pretty much get an entire fish, and it is so perfectly cooked.  Don't even get me started on the chips.  Dear god."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch with my friend last Sunday. One of the waitress was kind of rude and made me very uncomfortable for the brunch. And she made the mistake for my friends order. we are waiting for 30mins for the wrong food. I wont go back again."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch one weekend. Great pub atmosphere if you're looking for some good old English breakfast for brunch . Located at the corner of Queen/Dovercourt, this restaurant may get busy at times but the service was fast. There was also an upstairs bar if you wanted to watch sports.  In terms of what we ordered: - Full English Breakfast - The downside was that they ran out of black pudding that day which was a disappointment.  - Eggs St. George - Not your typical eggs benny but spicy eggs benny with a kick.   In terms of food portion, there was a lot of food including a small salad and homefries. We both left satisfied. If we're ever in the mood for English food we would know where to go!"}
