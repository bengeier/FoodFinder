{"text":"Food 5/5 staff&service 5/5 decor 5/5 We had their lunch menu which consisted of the soup of the day or the appetizer of the day along with a main. I had the chef's starter which was 2 pieces of  rolled zuchinis with creamed mozarella cheese stuffed with egglant pur√©e...incredible. I decided to go for the fish of the day : a delicious piece of cod on a bed of buttered mashed potatoes with greek olives and roasted red peppers.  Our server was knowledgeable of the menu items and was quick to serve us despite the busy large table next to us. My total bill was 42$ tax and tip included."}
{"text":"I love going there after work!  Free delicious popcorn with your drinks and food is great too! Staff is super friendly"}
{"text":"A delicious meal! We were a bit hesitant walking as the other restaurants in the area were packed and we were easily able to get a reservation here. We needn't have worried. Good and service was excellent and the bread pudding and poutine were fantastic. Recommend!!"}
{"text":"My friend invited me for drinks & lunch and he chose this location both of us have never been and wanted a nice terasse for Friday afternoon and since it's Grand Prix weekend every place downtown was gonna be packed.  This place was and is fantastic. They have a Paris vibe with the outside seating they have benches along the wall and round tables with chairs facing the bench. Very comfy. The owner is french the waiter told me so that's where the design comes from.  Inside when you walk in there's a glass floor square  that shows you the top view of the kitchen so you can see the chefs prepping and cooking. The place is gorgeous very rich looking wood that makes you feel warm and cozy. They have a pub on the other side of the restaurant with a popcorn machine!  Now for the best part.. THE FOOD    Sliders- cooked to perfection and char grilled they were so juicy. Came with cheese lettuce tomato onion. No condiments needed and that says a lot.  Spinach dip- very creamy and cheesy, they served it with thick crunchy Tostitos styled chips as long with salsa and sour cream. Hit the spot.  Poutine- dark sauce and fresh fresh fries! Super crispy not sure what potato they used but it was a bit sweet. Huge curd cheese. Big portion   Lobster roll- fresh tasty lobster with garlic butter sauce served on a submarine like bun filled with lettuce. They didn't chop it all up like other restos do and try to mix other seafood in it. Very good.  Drinks- beers were very cold, drinks were made with love, wasn't a huge fan of my Long Island iced tea as I found it was lacking. The shots are 5 for 20 and u can mix and match them which is cool if not everyone is a tequila fan.  We had a great waiter named Johnathan aka the skinny Seth rogen ( that's what he told me he was called because we said he sounded like him lol ) extremely knowledgable of the menu and ingredients which was a real treat. He was super friendly and great at his job.   I will be back 100 percent."}
{"text":"What a great way to watch the Capitals go to the Stanley Cup  is in an English Pub! Couple of Tv screens added to the decor which made the atmosphere pretty laid back. Free popcorn is served. I ordered the burger sliders and sweet potato fries. Great little hang out after a long day, service was good. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Out of town visit and we thought this would be a nicer bistro with good food and ambiance from the yelp reviews. Instead, felt like a neighborhood bar with overpriced food. The drinks were so-so and my steak frites was mainly a plate of frites with a few, small slices of steaks. My husband's salmon lobster burger was definitely not house made. Overall the cost was incommensurate with the quality. Friendly staff but somewhat disorganized."}
{"text":"We went to the Gladstone Pub next door and it will definitely be our new hang out! Service was great, good little pub   My husband had the burger (wish they had a single patty option)  and I had the salmon tartar and fries. Yummmmmy  Good bar selection, fun place to hang out"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden Gem!!! Particularly lovely in the spring/summer when you can sit outside.. It's located just between westmount and atwater.. Great seasonal menus, serving great delicious French food.. I've been there twice with different groups of people and everyone had a great time.. The lobster risotto was fantastic.. Such a great spot for supper in the lazy summer days, where you can actually sit and have a conversation and catch up with friends!!"}
