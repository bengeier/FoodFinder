{"text":"Excellent staff, very friendly.  Great food, had the dinner for 2 which came with soup, salad, rice, 2 spring rolls, steak, chicken, and shrimp. Everything only cost $20 and it ended up feeding 3 of us. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went a few weeks ago and we both had nothing but praises. We did the $19.99 all you can eat sushi, and everything we got was incredible!!! And what an awesome deal?! Everyone was so kind and we got great service. It may not be in the greatest location, but as a Matthews resident, I love having a great sushi place so close without going all the way into town. So it didn't both me that it isn't in a super fancy building. We plan on going again the next time we get a babysitter :) The price was amazing for all you can eat sushi, and they had some really delicious and creative rolls."}
{"text":"Great, fresh tasting lunch for a fair price. The little spring roll they throw in with the lunch combos are a nice touch.  Only flaw is that their spicy chicken could be spicier, but they throw in extra hot sauce"}
{"text":"We keep giving this place a chance....after our fourth or fifth time there I can't go back.  This place lacks in every catagory one desires for a restaurant...of any kind.  First every single individual that works there is rude, from the disinterested \"hostess\", to the waitresses who shout at you asking what you want to drink...and if asked what they have they answer \"Coke products\"...to the kitchen help that will mow you down with their carts of food.  This place is very, very dirty.  There are food scraps everywhere....all over the carpet, the dishes are crusty and the food choices, while expansive are just not that good.  The real kicker as to why we will never, ever return is as we were waiting for our check...we were seated in the aforementioned back room...my son happened to tap his foot.  All we heard were sloshing sounds...his chair was on top of a soaked carpet.  Immediately a major mold issue came to mind, so we commented to the waitress, she smirked and said \"oh thats from when they clean\"....ya right.  I had to get out of there....fast, and will never step foot in there again.  This PLACE IS DISGUSTING!!!!!"}
{"text":"this is gonna be my favorite spot for lunch and dinner!!! im loving it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing service had the shrimp streak and chicken was $13 amazing portions. Waiting staff and chefs all very friendly and interacted with us during our meal to ensure we had a great experience. Amazing bang for buck if you're hungry and need a lot of protein and carbs!"}
{"text":"5 stars for exceptional value! This buffet has over 250 items. In general the food is average but the price and huge selection make it the best buffet in Charlotte! The Hibachi grill is a great place to start. Fill a plate with fresh vegetables, steak, chicken, shrimp, or crab and they will grill it with your choice of sauces: Hibachi, Teriyaki, garlic, etc...

Includes: Sushi bar, to-order Hibachi Grill, Chinese/American Dishes, salad bar, and an ice cream & desert bar.

$6.59 Lunch
$8.99 Dinner & Sundays"}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars. There was a lot of people, so food was fresh and hot. A little better than what I expected, based on the other reviews."}
{"text":"The only reason they're getting 3 stars is for the food ...which is GREAT. Unfortunately, Nothing beats quality service.  I visited this establishment at least 3 times a week during my lunch for the convenience and good food, but was always met with such disrespectful tones and demeanor from the wait staff. I have been going here for a while so I will say not all of the employees are bad, but too bad the only pleasant worker is on the grill !! If you're looking for some great hibachi, definitely give this place a try ...just make sure you drop your money, grab your food, and run! I, however, have given them enough my money and will not be returning. I like to get the entire quality experience- food AND service !"}
{"text":"Hibachi Grill and Buffet just opened up in Matthews about a few months ago. This is now our \"go-to\" buffet place.

It has a huge variety of Chinese food and some american dishes. It also has a hibachi grill area where you can pick out fresh veggies and meats and have them cook it for you right there. 

Since I love Japanese food this is such a cheap way to have both Japanese and chinese food together.

They also have your typical sushi rolls from buffets if you enjoy Chinese buffet sushi. They also have a good variety of fruits and desserts options and and you won't be disappointed by their ice cream. Its not the typical three flavor yogurt ice cream. 

I love their Teriyaki steak and my daughter loves their sesame chicken. She says its the best in town. :) 

The prices are very reasonable too. Its under $8 per person and thats very reasonable when considering their buffet selection. They also have one in the Kannapolis area."}
{"text":"Food is decent... Service is lousy.  and the hostesses are dont have a clue... they tell a party of 1 that they have to wait while people coming in after them get seated if there is at least 2 in the party.... and they told me that a party of 1 is not important to them"}
{"text":"Pretty good place, I went around lunch time so it wasn't too busy. There could have been more to choose from food wise..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots in the city.  

I've heard other say \"stay away from the sushi,\" so, I have, however, their hibachi is delicious and incredibly inexpensive for the quantity & quality of food you receive.  ~$8 for a small basic salad (nothing special), cup of soup (ok), and a GIANT platter of hibachi meat, veggies and rice.  Really really good.  Never too crowded in my experiences during normal lunch hours.  Staff are pleasant but not overly talkative.

Another reviewer gave parking 2 stars.  Not sure why - I've never had any problem with parking a few spots away from the front door.

2 things bother me, but neither enough to get me to not come back once a month:  1)  It's an old gutted Pizza Hut that is long overdue for a re-haul of the interior.  2) It's on Independence.  Making a U-Turn on Independence, at least in certain stretches, is nearly impossible for miles on end.  Just not very easy for me to get to regularly."}
{"text":"Looking for good  Chinese buffets with good food and multiple selections is hard to find in matthews, NC but this place is great awesome selection on sushi and the hibachi is awesome . Service is moderate very good on refilling your drinks and picking up your empty plates. I recommend this to all my friends."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food it came fast and fresh! We ordered a family combo D2 in the menu. The shrimp was probably the best part it was a mouth watering experience They even make their own hot sauces which us pretty unique and then they have the typical Sriracha if you prefer that. Would highly recommend, great staff as well very informative on how they make their food as well. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and lots of it.  I got the chicken teriyaki and miso soup.   I ate in.  Small place and quiet.  Lady working there was playing guitar between orders and I loved it"}
{"text":"84.5.  That's their health sanitation score!  Eater beware.  I used to love this place but they constantly have poor sanitation scores. I can't eat here anymore, for my own GI health."}
{"text":"Solid food, and really nice service at this place as well. Ordered Hibachi chicken and sushi rolls for take out. Sushi wasn't the most well put together but tasted fantastic. The Hibachi chicken was super good too. 

IMPORTANT: If you order online, be sure to pay online as well. Otherwise they will not cook your food. Can't say I blame them for this policy either."}
{"text":"The owners of the restaurant are both very nice. The quality of the food is really good, the short ribs and the squid are both really good. 4 dishes were able to serve up to 6 people. And it only took them 15 mins to have the food ready. I strongly recommend you guys to go to this place."}
{"text":"This is more of a take-out place for Chinese/Japanese food.  Food tasted good, not great. But then, it is healthier and no MSG unlike most Chinese restaurants. They even make their own sauces which were delish.  They have a small sit-in area for those who want to dine in, which we did.  Just wished they would use real plates for their dine-in customers instead of small Styrofoam plates with the rice and dish all mixed together.  Servings were fairly generous so it is hard to eat on those small plates...lots of good stuffs will end up on the table.  They have a decent variety of grilled dishes but they are all served with rice.  Would have loved to be able to order just the dish, no rice.  Not really a fan of everything mixed up in a container for take home.  I want my rice ang main dishes separate. But that's me.  This place is owned by a young couple - the guy cooks while the wife looks afer the customers.  Really very nice couple and would do anything to make their customers happy and satisfied.  We ordered the dinner for 3 - salmon grill on fried rice, shrimp, chicken and steak on fried rice and shrimp on noodles (which we asked if we could replace with chicken instead) . They also gave us extra steamed rice when they found out my son prefers it over the fried rice. My son was also lucky to have free ice cream as the owners bought some for their beautiful daughter and shared some with my son.  Where will you get service like that!!!  I really want this young couple to suceed in their venture.  If they continue to give exceptional service and thrive to improve their products at a reasonable price ,I see no reason why they will not grow."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem in Pickering. This was my second visit here and I ordered: Hibachi short ribs (a must have), hibachi angus steak, spicy chicken and yakisoba shrimp. I had asked for take out and the owner ensured that my food remained warm until it was ready for pick up. The food was cooked to perfection and the taste was absolutely divine! Don't forgot to add the yum yum sauce to the rice! Also for all you spicy lovers out there, ask for the homemade hot sauce. 

Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Huge selection and pretty cheap. I just don't like to pay to get sick five minutes after eating. If you're brave give it a try. Not everyone will feel the same. But I won't be going here by choice again."}
{"text":"First time visiting. Very clean and friendly. Don't be fooled by the appearance and location, the food is good and affordable."}
{"text":"this place has the largest and best buffet selection around...first thing I do when I go there is ask for a better seat/table if its available then go for the usual...round 1, beef and broccoli, fried rice, egg roll, piece of crab, fish, fried chicken, fried shrimp and hot and sour soup...round 2, lots of crayfish (2-3 plates) and sushi...end it off with orange slices, melon and jello...then I'm stuffed and say I don't want to see this food or place again for a month...next day I'm thinking about it again and am drawn like a moth to a fire...delicious food is delicious food and its damn healthy too...

once I tried the grill, where the chef cooks up your ingredients, but I'm just not crazy about the sauces used...something is missing, its bland to my taste...

a few tips if you go...go around lunch or dinner time...don't go off time early lunch/dinner...the food can be warm and not pipping hot...in other words semi-fresh...

also, dinner is pricier so the dishes are a bit different...e.g. crabs, crayfish...

the only reason I don't give this place a 5 rating is cause they need to do some serious daily carpet cleaning or a monthly shampooing...why, cause some of the waitresses/waiters wipe the tables clean and where do you think the food debris ends up...bingo, on the carpet...most of the times its swept up but whatever the food flavor was is absorbed by the carpet...

all in all the place is great...the food is clean...never been sick yet...unlike some places where you know its the food that made you feel the way you do...

hungry yet, pick up your date and head on over...not many are disappointed afterwards..."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! The cleanest part of this place was their bathrooms. Flies on the food, which was cold by the way, sticky floors, ripped seats, hideous walls, rude servers and even the food was bad. I understand they can muck up american food because their not used to cooking it, but even their food was god awful. $10 is way over priced for what you can get. Half the buffet was dessert and salad. I would say $5.99 would be more accurate to the service you get. This is the golden corral of foreign food. Will never go back and I wish I could stand outside the building and stop people from going in."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night.  The place was packed and people were everywhere.  Server was courteous and attentive.  Lots of food choices, all delicious and would definitely recommend.  There were little kids everywhere and some running that got me really annoyed.  There's a reason they post signs on the walls telling parents to watch their kids.  If you can't keep your eyes on children, please don't take them iut to eat.  This is why and how accidents happen as I almost walked into a kid running with his plate of food.  

Anyways, sushi was good and only thing I was sad about was not getting to try everything I wanted as I had already gotten full.  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Owners are super friendly. Food is amazing and ingredients are fresh. Very good size serving too."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here!! They have amazing short ribs, great potions, very reasonable price, and super friendly owners! Highly recommend this place for someone who like Japanese or Korean style food. Don't forget to pick up your rewards card when you're here!"}
{"text":"Ate at this mega buffet place for the first time this past weekend.  I'm not going to be one of those snooty critics, especially for the type of establishment it is.....a cheap all you can eat buffet!  Wasn't expecting to go into the place an be wowed.  That being said, the food was actually pretty good.  The coconut chicken was about my favorite thing on the buffet.

If you are in the mood for a cheap, all-u-can-eat buffet, this place is pretty good.  (Especially if you're coming off a bender from the night before)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic!  My guy always has a chicken dish but I have had both meat and seafood and everything always tastes great.  To top it off, the service is always great.  I highly recommend Hibachi Grill if you haven't tried it yet.  You won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and fantastic customer service. We visited this place because of the rave reviews and it did not disappoint. In fact we've been back several times since. If you're in the Pickering area, give them a try!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since it open. There is so much to choose from as far as as a food selection so no one should feel left out. This place has a big buffet selection for a pretty good price. This place is usually always crowded on Fridays or Saturdays, so there may be a wait. The place is really noisy and sometimes I wish I could hear the restaurant music and not other guest conversations.
One thing I would say that I do not like about this place would be the bathrooms. The bathrooms are nasty. You have to have enough staff on the clock for a busy business such as this to tidy up the bathrooms. I will continue eating here. Haven't been disappointment   food wise just will never use there bathrooms."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and both times constancy is amazing, not to mention their service. It's a husband And wife team who are both genuine and honest. The portions are awesome leaving you wanting more but stuffed. they don't use No MsG on many of their dishes. Freshly made and different ways of sprucing up your combo  while you wait! 4 tables to sit. And bar to have quick meal! Awesome for quick stop by very close pickering town centre! Try their Beef short ribs! So far have tried scallops and shrimp, side noodles side steak and side beef Short Rib ribs. Excellent customer service for a take out and eat in joint. It's possible quickest freshest you can get. And they literally will keep you entertained while they cook. Kitchen cooking is visible so you can see your food being prepared!"}
{"text":"This place was really good and the pictures on yelp don't lie.   The protein portions are very generous, the service was very attentive and friendly and the prices were fair.   I had the shrimp stirfry which was generous on shrimp (tails removed - thank you) and onions and zucchini were delicious! There are a number of sauces on the table to drizzle on your stir fry."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  I saw so many positive reviews on yelp so I decided to give it a try and I wasn't disappointed.  The owner was very friendly and helpful. The food is very flavourful and not salty which was refreshing!  They also give you a generous portion.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"After checking out this local Pickering restaurant grill, the high ratings on this local eatery is very deserving. The Yum Yum sauce on top of everything we ordered, added to the well rounded taste sensation. We tried the steak, shrimps, and scallops. The food was great and very hearty servings - your taste buds will be satisfied along with your belly. The owners were very helpful and made recommendations on what we should try on our first visit here. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Waited over an hour for food. Not the start, between the salad and meal. And when when my order arrived, it was wrong. I ordered salmon and shrimp. I received salmon and chicken. Not a good look at all. And my veggies were skimpy. My friend that was visiting from out of town's meal was incorrect (asked for no zucchini) but plentiful. Took so long, had to take food to go. Our server was too busy flirting to care about refilling our drinks. I barely got an apology. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Great little place serves amazing food! He made my steak to my preference and it was perfect!! I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, friendly atmosphere. One of the best food places in Pickering."}
{"text":"Friendly and great food.  Had the short ribs.  This place will likely be a regular lunch stop."}
{"text":"Definitely an overwhelming variety of dishes here. From Chinese to everything else. Food was ok, nothing great. I can't imagine eating here when it gets crowded. It was annoying to get around the buffet when I was there and it was just moderately busy. Everything tasted like it had way too much MSG. I felt a little dizzy after my meal and I didn't even overstuff myself like I normally would. I think I would rather go to a decent sit-down Chinese restaurant (like Wan-Fu) then mess with this place again. If you are a glutton for the All-You-Can-Eat Chinese Buffet than you may really enjoy this place. For me, it's a no go."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, freshly made to order food, excellent customer service! My new favourite spot in Pickering..."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places I've ever eaten before.

My wife and I love asian food, and we wanted to try something out of our ordinary restaurants. Big mistake.

The food was cold, underseasoned, bland, and poorly prepared. The chicken was tough, the \"egg rolls\" were burnt and had very old ingredients for filling. The shrimp smelled old and so we didn't risk eating it.

The staff was extremely rude (lots of younger girls), and spent most of the time behind our table fighting, gossiping, and being very loud while rolling napkins. They also said many things (in English) about the customers in the restaurant that were very inappropriate for any environment.

Would NOT visit again, EVER!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Pickering! Super good, affordable and great service! Steak, scallops, shrimps just to name some of the stuff on their menu! All tasty and healthy"}
{"text":"Lots to choose from but just almost no taste to anything. Way too many screaming kids whose parents do nothing to try and quiet them at all. The steaks are chewy."}
{"text":"Friendly family run restaurant catering mainly to takeout although currently a few tables inside and out if you wish to eat there. We had squid, chicken, steak and short ribs all of which were delicious. They were accompanied with rice and hibachi prepared veggies in ample proportions. Will certainly go back again to enjoy their fare!"}
{"text":"When I saw the restaurant I had to try it as it was Japanese food and the sign was interesting too. I like the logo. I tried the steak and chicken and it was really great tasting food!! The best part about it was the yum-yum sauce. I loved the service as well as the owner and his wife were very welcoming. Great food, great service, great value ! Must try"}
{"text":"Really fresh and quality tasting food in a fast food looking environment and fast food prices. I had the beef short rib and fried rice and I have to suggest you add their home made yum yum sauce and their home made hot sauce. Just fantastic. Actually amazing that such a simple looking dish could have such subtlely delicious flavour. But it did. Really, you should try this place."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to getting takeout for dinner, would be ready for pickup in 15-20 minutes.  When I arrived to pickup my order (20 minutes later) I waited in line about 5 minutes and asked if my order was ready and was told they didn't know.  I asked when it would be ready, they could not tell me.....so since it was 8pm on a Sunday night I ended up at Wendy's."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to go with a solid 3 star on this one. We hit this place up last week for dinner and as far as size goes it was pretty impressive. They have about 8 buffet islands with assorted foods and deserts to choose from. You have all of your standard stuff like rices, chickens, dumplings, shrimp and some beef which I wouldn't recommend because it was way overcooked and tough. They also had a bit of a DIY hibachi grill in the back which was pretty nice. It's similar to the mongolian BBQ where you build your own plate and hand it off to the guy at the grill and he'll cook it up while you wait. It only takes about 5 minutes but you kinda feel like a schmuck standing there milling around waiting for the food to cook. The hibachi offers 3 different types of sauce the cook will mix in with your dish. Garlic, Teriyaki and a standard \"hibachi\" style. The later of the three I went with and it was delicious. The only downside to the hibachi is that they do not offer up the white sauce that I usually eat by the cupful at more upscale hibachi restaurants but it's probably for the best since that stuff isn't exactly the healthiest food on the planet. One thing we found the buffet lacking was crab. I'm pretty sure I saw a pile of Krab with a K but no crab legs or anything that tasty. That was a bit of a letdown but the ticket price for a meal reflected the missing premium item(s). All in all it was around 9$ per person and for what you got it really is a good value if you are in a super hungry mood but this isn't the type of place I would call fine dinning. The service was pretty decent. Like a lot of buffets they just kinda usher you in, get your drink orders and bus the plates off your table as you finish up. They were also good about keeping our waters filled up."}
{"text":"Forewarning: If you do not like hole in the wall places don't come here expecting something nice and then give it a low rating based on the appearance! This rating is based on the food and service. I don't think it deserves a low rating just because it's in an old Pizza Hut or that it is difficult to get to because it's in a difficult location. 

I came here for lunch and the lunch prices are slightly cheaper than dinner. They had a chicken and shrimp special along with some sushi specials. California roll and shrimp tempura roll for $2.99! The grill that the man cooks on is right in the open so you can watch him cook the food. I watched him chop the chicken and veggies right there. I've never seen anyone cut a fresh head of broccoli so fast!! Amazing. 

The meals come with soup and salad. I got the shrimp and chicken. The rice could be a tad more flavorful but who eats plain rice at a hibachi grill! The shrimp sauce here is in a big squirt bottle and is really good! It's lighter in color and a little on the sweeter side. The shrimp was a big size and the chicken was chopped in smaller pieces so more flavor! The veggies were juicy and fresh although I wish there was more included. It was a decent amount of food but if I was super hungry I'd want more. 

I got a tempura shrimp roll. It was ok. I didn't try the more \"fancy\" rolls but if you want good sushi go somewhere else. It was good for $2.99 though!! 

The waiter was something else, but a good something else. If you go, you'll understand. Overall if you are a hibachi lover this is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food and very good customer service, family owned and operated.  My wife ordered Hibachi Chicken and Shrimp combo and I opted for the Hibachi Scallops and Shrimp.  They have a very tasty sauce \"Yum Yum\" that tastes great on the fried rice along with making a tasty dip for the scallops and the shrimps.  We were also able to purchase some of the Yum Yum Sauce for take away.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't like buffets. But as far as they go, I think this one is a winner, as evidenced by the crowd that is always there no matter what time of day you go. 

I think it's kind of funny they put a gym in right next door, so you can feel guilty about yourself before you go in. Who knows, maybe it's how the gym recruits new members. 

This restaurant has very friendly employees, but not all of them speak English. Most of the time you can grab someone who might understand, but it's not the case all of the time. 

They have an area that has a kind of cafeteria type space where you can fill up your plate with raw veggies and some sort of meat, then they fry it up hibachi style. 

This is really the only reason I go, because for $6.97 for a lunch buffet, I can get all of the hibachi I can eat. You can't really get to-go japanese for that cheap, so it's a win in my book. Set me up with a gallon of shrimp sauce and I am one happy girl. 

Oh and for you sushi takers, they have sushi. Take a glance at that lunch price again. That includes sushi..."}
{"text":"Ok went hear about 2 weeks ago. First of all it's an old Pizza Hut restaurant which is weird but when I walked in it was dark, and looked dirty. I was a little skeptical about ordering anything. I was HUNGRYso I ordered hibachi chicken with veggies. Can I say YUK!! It tasted like Racoon meat...ok I don't know what Racoon meat tastes like. Chicken had no flavor and looked like it was a week old. Needless to say I will never return there..I don't even want to drive by there..I'm just saying!!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to go to when you're looking for a Japanese fix. The portion sizes are decent and the meat is cooked quite well. When we went here we decided to get a chicken and shrimp combo and it came with rice and a miso soup. The owners of this place are extremely friendly and very welcoming. They make me want to come back again and again just because they're so nice!

In terms of the food it's quite good but not mind blasting or anything like that. It's not a place where I will crave their food but if you're looking for something that is good and won't make you feel like crap after then this is a good spot to go to."}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing.  The server acted like that was the last place on earth he wanted to be, took over an hour for our food we were the only ones there besides a couple that came after we ordered, they ate and left before we got our food.     3 star for the sushi !"}
{"text":"Good food at a great price. Beef short rib was on point. Chicken and steak was really good too. Highly recommend to try this place. Ill be coming back here. Service is really good. Very nice people."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow, so it sees the best thing to do would be to call in and pick up.  But The servings were large and the food was tasty.  I have only tried the Hibachi, but it was quality and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Came here based on other yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. The owners are very friendly and I really liked how it's a family run place. I ordered the squid combo and the chicken and steak combo to go. It was made fresh to order and ready in 10 minutes. The food was very tasty and for what you get the portions were great! I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"love this place go for lunch  and what a deal-- very receptive staff found my favorites--hibachi chicken-"}
{"text":"The food and service was great. They offered so many choices, I couldn't eat it all."}
{"text":"I thought 5 stars?!?! I need to try it for myself... and it did not disappoint! The 5 star rating is well deserved. As we hesitantly approached the front entrance looking at the menu in the window, we were greeted with a big smile from the owner inviting us in. 

Both hubs and I had the lunch special. I had the grilled steak and he had the beef and chicken skewers. As other yelpers mentioned, the food was flavorful, not salty, and plentiful! Lunch specials are under $10 and it comes with a drink, soup and salad. 

This is a take out joint but there are a few seats inside and outside to enjoy your meal. We opted to eat outside. The server, I assume the owners daughter was super sweet. 

Good food, great value and excellent service! Will definitely be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been going there for years and the quality and price cannot be beat in Charlotte. The staff is very friendly :)"}
{"text":"Great family run small business restaurant with fresh ingredients and food made to order. I recommend the yakisoba with steak and shrimp or steak and spicy chicken!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! I love the teriyaki chicken with rice, and I sometimes even get an extra order of the chicken. I have tried the shrimp as well and it was also great. The restaurant atmosphere is not the greatest. The waiter I had was really slow and was clearly smoking something in the back. But the food is great."}
{"text":"I don't know WHY any bad/low reviews--the food selection is EXCELLENT! All FRESH!! Freshly GRILLED ANYTHING you want Hibatchi (Benihana) Style in the back. They also have SUSHI!! When we went, DINNER for Adults was JUST-ONLY $9.99 ...REALLY?!?? Move over Golden Coral--this place is giving you a major run for OUR $$$.  I will DEFINITELY be back! YOU...You.., the one reading this...GO! Go and try it out! Good Food and Super Cheap!
PS. I love the \"no waiting\" to eat. Go straight to get your food!! ENJOY?"}
{"text":"Last time I was here was in 2015, the food was decent then. Today's visit, the food was horrible. The lo neon had an awful taste. Fried rice was dry....
Even the sweet tea was bad."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly staff, big portions, very fair prices. Will be coming back regularly. and"}
{"text":"So I was just looking for a nice little restaurant to go to for my bday and I ended up stumbling on this little place.  
First and foremost I love Japanese and Korean cuisine.  So this nice takeaway spot, with limited seating, was worth giving a try.  

The hospitality is amazing.  Right from the get go it is a family operated restaurant and you could tell as soon as you walk in.  Super friendly, super accommodating, and their suggestions are on point!

The food is really good.  It comes out fresh, and their sauces are really good.  Yum yum sauce is def my favourite, and I'm not much into mayo based sauces. The teriyaki sauce is good and their home made hot sauce is reallly good.  The food portions are really good.  Honestly, if you Are someone who has 'Le Munchies' this is the spot to go lmao.  My family and I ordered: chicken and beef dinner, and shrimp and chicken dinner with chicken and beef skewers, oh, and also the scallop appetizer.  Total bill came up to 50$ after tax and tip. Honestly, well worth every penny.

The seating is limited but honestly this place is a must visit. All the best to the owners and trust me, I'll be back for more!"}

Came here before hiking in the Rouge Park.
The owner and his wife are both super friendly. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food great service! What more can one ask for? Had the steak and shrimp noodle special. They pile on the shrimp and cook the steak to your liking. I hope they stay around for a long, long time."}
{"text":"They have the friendliest staff you'll ever meet. Oh, not to mention that they give a TON of meat - all of which are full of flavor. That YumYum sauce though."}
{"text":"First time eating here. It was okay but could have given a little bit more food! Didn't serve our drinks until meal came out. The staff was nice and food came out in timely manner! Not somewhere I would be quick to come back too!"}
{"text":"Very solid. External appearance (5/10) seems less appealing, but very affordable (8/10) and efficient (9/10) even while quite busy. Generous portions, particularly for lunch, and quite appetizing (7.5/10) hibachi/teriyaki."}
{"text":"Okay service, mediocre at best food, and low quality atmosphere. The food is extremely low grade. Stale rice and noodles, chicken are all similar (just drenched in a slightly different sauce), and the 'steak' is like rubber. 9 times out of 10, I advise to avoid a buffet, and this is no exception. If you insist on eating here, go to lifetime next door to get rid of the shame."}
{"text":"I wanted to check out Hibachi Grill since yesterday. The second I walked in, the owners were so warm, friendly and welcoming. We asked them to recommend which dish is good, they recommended short ribs and squid. So I ordered the squid and shrimp combo.

Food:
Extremely good portion. They made there own yum yum sauce and it was just as yum yum as it sounds!
The squid, they gave us like a full squid to go with my shrimp. The flavour were good and ingredients was  fresh. It is definitely comparable to teppanyaki at restaurants. 

Seating
3-4 tables, it is more for take out. But you can sit there.

Overall, a very good first experience. You can tell that the owner put his hearts to it. Definitely worth a try if you are out in the area."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying the reviews I read about this place are very true. The location is HORRIBLE but to be honest anything on Independence has a poor location due to the large median. You are able to reach the restaurant even from outbound Independence but it's inconvenient for sure.

The restaurant itself isn't nice. It's actually kind of crappy! The interior and exterior haven't been updated EVER! I honestly should have check the sanitation grade before eating but I had placed a take out order.

When I called to place my order I received fantastic service. Due to the lack of online menu I had many questions and the gentleman was patient and kind to me. When I arrived to pick up my meal I once again received notably good service. They didn't charge me for requesting extra sauce. 

When I got home I realized they have me Hibachi Chicken, not Teriyaki Chicken (unless they use barely any sauce or the sauce is super thin). My meal was still good. I smiled when I saw that they cut their vegetables in zig zags :) thought it was a fun touch. I will note that not just this restaurant but all Japanese style restaurants say your meal comes with a salad but that's a joke!! Just lettuce isn't a salad but at least this place offer more than just Ginger or Ranch dressing. 

I did note upon arrival that they had a special with Chicken and Shrimp that was only a dollar more and Au wish I had known about it. They really need to post a menu online!!! 

Overall there is definitely room for improve but they have great service and I would do take out from here again!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good and delicious.. before came here, thought the five star was fake, but it turns out that the food here definitely deserves the five star."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this restaurant, and it was definitely a great choice. They have a large selection of food, including several types of sushi, create your own hibachi and even some American food. The prices are very reasonable. I would recommend this restaurant, and I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Overwhelming variety. My wife is a very picky eater but she has no problem whatsoever finding a nice selection of food here. Her favorite is picking & choosing her selections from the hibachi bar and letting the chef work his magic.

They also have their buffet bar that is painfully huge... you have a nice seperate dessert bar along with a salad bar to accompany the main attraction food bars. Too many choices... you can try one of each item and NOT have had everything they have to offer.

Next to their Hibachi bar, they have a nice little sushi bar as well. I'm not a sushi aficionado but it's made fresh and my wife seems to enjoy it. 

From crab legs, to pizza, to hand dip ice cream, to sushi and pretty much any and everything else you can imagine. Simply put, they have more bars than a jail cell. 

The bottomline - good food, fresh, generally clean, and reasonably priced and if your a fan of buffets, then this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place twice. I had teriyaki salmon it was delicious. This time I had teriyaki salmon and scallops. Very good. The soup and salad was ok but my entree was a winner. I love that you don't leave smelling like the grill. They do not cook at the table like other hibachi restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered short ribs and grilled squid.. So tasty... Squid is the right consistency... This is my second time here. I also like their rice.  Customer service is also great."}
{"text":"First time trying this place after coming across it on Yelp. Hubby and I got two meals to go, food was delicious. The portions were very generous. The owners were super friendly and made us feel welcome. 
The scallops were tasty and my hubby loved the BBQ short ribs! I will try the lobster next time :):)
Very happy to find this place in Pickering! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I probably won't go back and I don't recommend it. The food was missing some flavor and as a vegetarian they didn't have many options for me. But I guess they did for anyone else. Also it kinda upset me that they mixed the egg rolls with the spring rolls. 
The seating was bad too they say us in the back room and it's just awful for anyone who's claustrophobic. There's way too many tables in there and they're too close together. They pretty much stuffed everyone back there even though there was plenty of room up front. 
The service was pretty good though and as full as the place was I never saw them run out of food as soon as it was getting a bit low a new tray would come out."}
{"text":"In the three months since my last review, the Hibachi Grill continuies to maintain its' high standard of great food, fresh and fast. They are so incredibly friendly, and I am glad that this hasn't changed. (Also, we had some broccoli in our Hibachi meals this time, and it was a really inspired addition! I hope that they keep it up.)

We tried a few new things today. My son said that his order of Spicy chicken was excellent. My husband really enjoyed his scallops, which were nicely browned and seared but still moist and juicy on the inside. The Lobster and Shrimp combo (my order) did not disappoint either. The lobster was sweet and nicely seared (not the usual treatment that Canadians use for lobster, so be prepared - I loved it). The shrimp was as great as ever.  To my taste, Hibachi's signature yum yum sauce is best suited to meats, and their homemade spicy sauce pairs well with seafood.  

How do they achieve that beautifully seared, flavourful exterior without turning the seafood to rubber? I sure can't do it at home, which makes Hibachi Grill the perfect take-out for a busy night. 

Next time, I want to try the unagi."}
{"text":"Horrific cheap buffet food, cheap in price, awful in quality and taste. Stay far, far away from this crap place."}
{"text":"2nd time I come here the food is not fresh -_- my coworker loves the food. The rice was ok but everything else it was hard like they refried their lunch and I'm here for dinner, ugh."}
{"text":"The owners are very friendly ..the food is made fresh and tasted fantastic .. Will Recommend the Hibachi Grill to friends and family"}
{"text":"Outside is run down and old. I like the classic look.
Inside in 1 big room. There is 1 Hibachi grill behind the counter where you can watch the chef.
The service is fast.
Food is okay, not the highest quality but still good."}
{"text":"Great Food... don't judge a book by the cover. Their food was was great. I ordered the hibachi chicken and rice, with soup and salad. My meal was 8.95 with no drink. The waiter was very sharp. We only waited 6 mins for our food. The decor is not updated but the food and service was A1. I plans to go here from again and take my husband... oh wait forgot to tell you I had a small sake for $4.85 & got 4 1/2 drinks out of it. This place gives you enough food to share. My Friday night was done after eating here. Next time I go, I'll make sure I have no where to go afterwards"}
{"text":"Ordered and just finished the short rib hibachi ! Very pleasantly surprised for take out food and in Pickering !! I've been waiting for something decent like this for years .. 

So the break down 
1) service - friendly and I like that with the takeout all the sauces were included
2) rice - I haven't had such quality rice in take out for a looonngggg time. It makes such a big difference to the meal
3) meat - seasoned well without being too oily or salty 
4) veg - thankful that it wasn't just a leaf or two but a proper portion

All in all, we will be back as long as the quality and price remains !! Thanks for a great meal :)"}
{"text":"We went here soon after they opened and were shockingly surprised with how great the food is. When we saw the menu and pricing we didn't expect much but gave it a try as we felt like something new and there isn't a whole lot of take out options in Pickering that isn't burgers!  We ordered the $20 combo and wow! So much food, shrimp was cooked to perfection! I was very impressed!  My only suggestion would be to give a little less rice and a little more veggies. The veggies are so yummy but 80% of them are onions...I can't eat that much onion, give us a little more zucchini and carrot etc. We have been here several times now and it has yet to disappoint!  Try the short ribs, seasoned and cooked perfectly you will love them. As long as this place keeps up their quality they will be getting a lot of our business for sure! A healthier fast food takeout option when you need dinner in a pinch!"}
{"text":"We took an afternoon walk by the lake and I yelped around and found this place. Convinced my husband to order some take-out and save \"the keg\" dinner for later.(maybe for my birthday in July? ;)

The first batch we ordered are beef skewers (a little rough but okay if you eat when it's hot.) Angus steak hibachi, steak and scallop combo, chicken wings. And we headed to M just across the street to buy my son some fries. I didn't have lunch so I ate the 4 scallops and some beef skewers in the car while waiting for fries take-out. Scallops are big and juicy, the steak is tender and a little bland--used the teriyaki dressing or other dressing.

We headed back and ordered scallop dinner combo and 2 more beef skewers (4*2) to go. (My mom like scallops) And I had some chicken wings and they are juicy and the seasoning is just right.

I like their teriyaki dressing for scallops and extra dressing for steak. Try different dressings on everything and see which one is your favorite.

Owner was happy to see us back in 10 mins for more , hahaha.

The rice is a bit rough and hard for us. Be prepared to take out cuz it's a rather small restaurant/diner. 

We'll come back again when we are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Always amazing fast service. Owners are so kind and the food never disappoints. When my wife and I are not sure what to have for lunch or dinner this is our go too spot!"}
{"text":"I used to dine in but now mostly run in during lunch time and grab a to-go box.  The selection is always fresh.  On several occasions, the food handlers have cooked me a special batch of whatever I asked for that was either low or almost finished.  (Just last week the food handler had the cook make me 6 fresh sesame balls since it was close to dinner time, there were only 2 left in the serving dish, and they don't typically offer them to the dinner crowd.) One of my favorite lunch stops during the week."}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese take out food.
I ordered grilled steak,shrimp,veggies with noodles. It was a great alternative to Chinese food. Good size portions & friendly service. Hope restaurant does well. Definitely worth a visit. Menu appears to have some variety, if you enjoy steak, shrimp, scallops, etc..."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, filling, and delicious!!! They let me swap more vegetables for no rice at no charge, which is always nice. Difficult to turn into the parking lot off of Independence but worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Everything was great had the family special .. large portions..fresh food! And literally the nicest people ever! They go out of there way to make you happy :) definitely going back"}
{"text":"Good food except that maybe the dining experience would even be greater if plate and cutleries are not the plastic and styro."}
{"text":"It's your typical Chinese buffet. A little bigger then some but all the same food. So much so all the buffets could be getting their food from a central kitchen. 
   For those who know, wouldn't it be great if Buffet Dynasty or Tin Tin could still what they were. Or someone takes their place."}
{"text":"Worst buffet in town. Poor service. Cold food. Do you selves a favor and try someplace else"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food. There were so many different sauces to try! The food was simple and fresh something that is really rare these days."}
{"text":"Some of the best ribs I have had. I recomment getting those. I liked it. If you're looking for atmosphere though, this isn't the place. Wasn't busy when I was there."}
{"text":"Awful. Terrible example of hibachi. The food by no means is fresh. Wouldn't suggest this to my worst enemy. If you want to get sick this is your place. I wish I could give them 0 stars."}
{"text":"Their service is always A++. Very friendly people. Lunch special is a great deal. You get everything you want. The yum yum sauce is a nice addition as well."}
{"text":"Most of the food was average for a buffet. However I really like the coconut Chicken. Green beans where a little hard. But for the price it's nice place to sit back with a book and a plate of food."}
{"text":"How can you beat the price.  $9.99 at dinner and $9 if you are a senior.  Yes, the food is average quality but there is a ton of selection.  They even have a lot of seafood at dinner (oysters, crawfish, salmon, cod, octopus, etc). 

Didn't have too much of an issue with getting hibachi or any food the weeknight I went - not as crowded.

The service I had was actually excellent.  Nice, attentive server.  Once again, maybe it's because it was not as busy.

Definitely will give the Golden Corral just up the street a run for the money!!!!"}
{"text":"My son and I checked this place out. I had the steak and shrimp combo. Perfectly cooked and the \"Yum Yum\" sauce on the rice (as recommended) was delicious. Been back twice and it's our go-to place for the days when I'm too tired to cook. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went with in the in-laws Sat. afternoon for lunch for my first time. This place was packed!!!! But huge so there was plenty of seating. We got shoved all the way in a back corner room, where we were the only ones speaking English (Mexican Spanish was king here). And it almost seemed like we interrupted a birthday party, I later found out that wasn't the fact. It was just a very loud, obnoxious room with little kids running around everywhere unsupervised. Start the meal off like that was and its bound to end up getting worse.
The food was pretty gross, everything was over seasoned and salty. The \"Chinese\" food was a disgrace, I was surprised at the American food options. (Spiral ham, pizza, etc..) The buffet tables were so crowded with everyone going everywhere with no rhyme or reason....shoulder bumps were common. I don't know, just not my idea of a good meal."}
{"text":"Great food, perfect price, wonderful service. Glad to have  found my new inexpensive hibachi place."}
{"text":"Went to try it for first time mainly for hibachi.. And it just wasnt good!! It had a wierd flavor. No hibachi flavor at all!!! So i had to eat some of the regular buffett food which wasnt that great either. Sushi didnt have labels so i had no clue what they were... Will not return."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Had both The teriyaki and hibachi chicken the teriyaki was the best race was very good so was the duck sauce.  Scary parking lot but clean inside."}
{"text":"This is seriously as close to heaven as you can get in Matthews, NC.  $7 lunch buffett with all you can eat sushi, shrimp, ice cream, and egg rolls?  Are you serious?  This restaurant is a metaphor for everything that is great about America.  My only complaint would be the hundreds of screaming kids running around and getting in my way.  Getting to and from the buffett lines is kind of like an obstacle course, but it's totally worth the headache."}
{"text":"Say there for 30mins and no food, all the waiter could say was its coming!!! Got some \"soup\" more like chicken broth and a salad drowning in ranch! Never going back! Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Yes!! If you are in the area, this is the place to go for some amazing food! It looks small and the plaza looks really non engaging but I always say, never judge a gem by where it's buried! ;)

The staff here are the friendliest people ever. Happy people making happy food! The price is amazing and the portions are fantastic! They make it all to order so your food is always fresh off the flat grill and they have a variety of sauces too like the yum yum sauce! 

My top recommending is the short ribs. You should see how much comes with an order!! Delicious to the last bite :) the rice is a Japanese style rice that tastes and feels very unique. Simple yet very flavorful. I really appreciate that everything is not full of sodium so you can actually taste the food for how it should taste.

Give it a try! Sit in or grab some take out! Absolutely worth it. This is our go to spot for the weekends"}
{"text":"3 words can sum up this place.. AWESOME, FRESH, CONSISTENT. This grill \"Handsdown\" is the best place to dine in or out (it all tastes the same). I live in Ballantyne area and will drive across town for this food. Although the Customer Service is quite Blahhh the food is worth it!! The lunch special Chicken and Shrimp is my fav and NO other place has better rice than them!!! Try It!!!"}
{"text":"It is a buffet people. It gives you the opportunity to stuff your fat ass and not spend a fortune doing it. The noodles were dry? The rice sucked? Well guess what... no one pays for buffet to eat rice. This is America, eat some meat you pansy."}
{"text":"Quantity over quality is how I view this buffet. They offer a HUGE selection of food. Certainly not all items that I prefer, but that's what makes it great for the masses; there's something for everyone. The cost was $10.95 for the adult dinner buffet. My intention for visiting an Asian buffet is for American Chinese selections and all you can eat sushi  And if You can save any room they have pretty decent dessert selection including ice cream. 

I would've given them a three star review, but there's one item in particular they offer that I have not been able to find anywhere else. Since relocating from PA I've looked at many places for Coconut Chicken and this is the first place that has it. If you've never had this, it's a must. Deep fried (like general tso's) and covered in a sweet creamy white sauce 

When I heard this, I drove home, got the family and we went in to load up to go containers. Mine consisted of fried rice, mostly coconut chicken, broccoli and I always love the teriyaki chicken skewers. Turned out to be a great deal so make sure to remember this place the next time your interested in take out!!!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is super but it's the service that really makes this place special. Super nice family!"}
{"text":"My mom likes this restaurant and had a takeout plate one day while I was away.  We ate here the next day while I was off.  I enjoyed it.  It's not the best looking spot compared to the China buffet but everything was good.  The sushi bar is tasty and I love the sushi with lettuce. So fresh and pretty.  If you get takeout, they order it and will charge you for sushi to go from buffet.  It ended up being more affordable than I thought.  Join the loyalty program for points at the register."}
{"text":"Hibachi Grill is a relatively new Japanese-ish restaurant in Pickering and they've been getting some really good reviews. It's a small place catering mostly to a takeout clientele. They have seating for 10 people inside and a table for 2 outside on the curb. I'm sure that will change in winter.

I had the pleasure of meeting the young couple who own and operate the place. They're very enthusiastic and passionate about what they're doing and very much interested in finding out what their customers want. Top marks for customer service and appreciation!

Although geared mostly for takeout, their menu goes well beyond the typical offerings of chicken, beef, shrimp, noodles, and veggies. They offer lobster and scallops!

I had the Lunch Special A, consisting of the Hibachi steak, rice, spring roll, soup or salad, and pop. It was a very good value at $8.25 and tasted very good. They also have a variety of house-made sauces available, with varying degrees of sweetness, savoury, and heat.I can't remember which one was their signature Yum-Yum sauce but they were all good. Yes, I kinda tried them all.

Their food presentation could use a little work. Even though I dined in, everything was served in takeout boxes. The salad, in its own box, was colourful, but the box with the steak, rice, mushrooms, and onions, was just monotone brown. See photos.

I will definitely be back, and not just for the food. I wish these young owners lots of success! Please visit them."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to get Japanese/hibachi food. The shrimp in particular is amazing! The owners are really friendly and always have a smile on their face! I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"great buffet for cheep prices! the only thing that isn't great is the sushi.. but besides that the coconut chicken is my favorite thing there!"}
{"text":"Disgusting is the first word that comes to mind.  I watched a young boy drop a plate of Lo Mein and a orange on the floor.  Six employees walked right pass the mess and one young man at front desk kicked the orange.  

The food trays were mostly empty and this was 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon.  Labels for the food were missing and I was not quite sure what I would eat.  I witnessed employees changing out trays of food with no gloves or hair covering.  Had I been a health inspector, I would have shut it down immediately.  Plus I was charged $9.99.... Seriously???  Stay clear!!!  dirty, very dirty..."}
{"text":"The decor - 0 stars
The price - 4 stars
The service - 3 stars
The parking - 2 stars
The location - 0 stars
The quality 2.5 stars

All in all, this place is OK if you're desperate for a quick hibachi. To-go is definitely the best way to enjoy this meal and for $6, who can argue. But keep in mind that there are 2093728372 other places around to get a great affordable lunch. If only another hibachi option was close to this one!"}
{"text":"My preference is to go in and get take out which is quick and easy. You get a box that they weigh when you leave and is what the price is based on. If you're in the mood for fast food Chinese, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I understand everyone's experiences can't be the same and for Hibachi Grill, my own experience seem very different from many other reviewers who rave about this place.  

Yes, the owners are nice.  Yes, it's interesting that they have their own sauces (like yum yum which in my opinion, didn't add much to my food experience here.)  

We dined in for lunch and ordered grilled steak and grilled squid both of which came with a side of veggies, rice and soup.  Good value for the money but the steak was very tough, the squid came with sprinkling of spice when I had specifically asked them to serve it plain (as it was for my toddler).  They were very apologetic for the mistake and offered to cook us a new one which was a nice gesture.  But even the new squid came covered in butter and we barely touched it.  What I really disliked about the meal was their rice which had a weird oily sheen to it.  When I asked them about it, I was told that what was served was plain rice.  Umm...I'm Asian.  I think I know the difference between a bowl of plain rice and rice that had something done to it.  When we put the rice into the miso soup, you could see a film of oil immediately forming on the surface.  Eew...  

Overall, the food experience was so subpar, I never bothered going back."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food.They have large portions and the Yum Yum sauce is delicious. Will be coming often."}
{"text":"Pros: Decent Japanese food for a dive restaurant. Prices are pretty normal. 
Cons: Their customer service was weak at best. The owner was more concerned about watching tv than taking my order. Never said hello, thank you, etc. The salad didn't taste very fresh either. The decor is nothing to write home about. Calling-in for pick up is the best way to go."}
{"text":"Met Jonny and Sunny in the Winter 2017 and they were so nice! Jonny grills up fine dining quality food at the takeout price. I started working in Pickering so it is a weekly stop for me!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, they give you a broth like soup and a side salad before your meal. Since it was our first time there, my dad ordered teriyaki chicken & I had hibachi chicken. The service was great and the fruit punch is  super sweet. The lemonade & fruit punch made me feel like I wouldn't sleep for days. Good amount of food at a great price. Overall, I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Nope, sorry, this place needs a lesson in customer service.  The hostess was texting on her phone constantly, she dropped our reciept on the floor as she walked away and the place wasn't even busy.  Way too many people sucking on chicken wings and crab legs in one place.  The seats are ripped, the walls are stained, there are signs posted everywhere telling you to keep your kids near you, very unprofessional and really takes away the vibe if you're not there with kids.  

The food was decent, we'd probably come back when we feel like raising our cholesterol, but they could have done a better job here..."}
{"text":"We always see tons of people coming and going at this place so we decided to try it. The place is big, lots of space and tables. We came for lunch and arrived right at 11 when it opened so there was no crowd. A lot of selections on the buffet, including desserts and a kids bar (pizza, rolls) as well. We stuck mostly with chicken and thought it was pretty good considering the price of $7.29  it's not the highest quality of chicken which I really didn't expect. We were satisfied and would go back. Place seemed pretty clean to us, restrooms were clean. I would have trouble going during peak dining, as I'm not a fan of swarms of people on a buffet but coming when it first opened worked well"}
{"text":"As others have said, decor and location are horrible.  The salad wasn't really fresh but the ginger dressing was passable.  The soup wasn't horrible but I bet it was just a beef bullion cube. 

The chicken teriyaki isn't bad. Good portion size, small veggie portion though. 

Good alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"The hibachi part is great.  Need more hibachi cooks (grillers)at that station especially during weekend and evening.   Food on buffet is ok.  But 5 star on the hibachi part.  I would say invest more there than on buffet stations."}
{"text":"Fast good food at a reasonable price. We tried a variety - rice, shrimp, beef, chicken, noodles, scallops- everything was really good. The owners are beyond nice- they smiled, made us feel welcome and provided suggestions on food. I would definitely recommend.  
Seating is limited to about 13. There are only three tables of four."}
{"text":"It saddens me to have to write this poor review as I've eaten here for over 5 years. I warn you guys not to use your credit/debit card as my card waa double charged and I was made to feel as if I were in the wrong. I showed proof from my bank account he argued and said no it didn't and to wait 24 hours and I'd see it was settled at the end of the night. I waited and I sure enough  paid $15 twice for one meal. BEWARE PAY WITH CASH ONLY.. THEY will blame the machine having issues rather than righting a wrong. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place thinking i could get some sushi-lite along with my fella getting hibachi steak.  They do offer a huge selection, and if we'd never eaten at Nakato or Kubuto, this place would have been amazing...  but since we have eaten at those higher end chains, we were not impressed with what Hibachi Grill had to offer.  The seating was tight and there were children running all over the place.  There were also what appeared to be some escort type ladies with their handlers not far behind filling up for their night on the town.  The food tasted ok, but nothing memorable or worth returning for unfortunately."}
{"text":"My grandmother took me to lunch here on Sunday saying that she liked the food because it was \"fresh\" and that not everything tasted the same.

I have to disagree- unfortunately and say that it was just the opposite. 1.5 stars...

When you walk in the place looks pretty fancy smanshy for a typical Chinese buffet style restaurant and I was psyched to see a sushi chef and hibachi chef. I'll admit the buffet was huge and at first glance looked good.

I enjoyed the wontop soup, coconut macaroons and ...that's about it. I didn't realize the green onions were a part of the salad bar so I unfortunately didn't put those in my soup : (

Most of the food was overly salted and not cooked crispy enough for my tasting. I did brave the sushi and actually didn't think the california rolls were too bad. I didnt end up trying the spicy tuna since I just couldn't get past it's appearance. I didn't get the hibachi since the line was a little too crazy for me- perhaps that's the way to go?

Health-wise this place is not ideal. Probably not a good place for a dieter or someone who needs to watch salt/fat intake.

On the bright side it was cheap. 

Wont be back..."}
{"text":"Housed in an old Pizza Hut in front of (you guessed it) a strip mall along Independence Boulevard, this unassuming restaurant is probably one that you pass with some regularity.  Independence is, after all, one of the primary routes through the East Side of Charlotte.

But if all you do is race by on your way into the city, you're doing yourself a great disservice by not stopping in, because the Hibachi Grill really has done a great job with what they have to work with (which is to say, not much).

This should be apparent by the fact that they are still there, some years after they first opened.  This particular strip mall has gone through numerous changes, and business in this particular area of Independence haven't done well overall with all of the road work, yet they have managed to stay open throughout.

Once you step inside, you will definitely be struck by the dinginess of the place - it is certainly true that they haven't wasted much on the inside, but that's okay.  You can hold that against them.

What they have done is taken that effort and put it into the food.  It's nothing monumental, mind you, but simple hibachi-style food, cooked on an open grill.  You can get a number of varieties - steak, chicken, shrimp, and combinations mixing and matching them.

Unlike other similar restaurants that give you tiny bowls of sauce, they will also give you a massive container of sauce to boot.  And their lemonade and sweet tea is among the best in town.  Really.  You can also find sushi here, but I'm not sure if I'd suggest going just for that.

One note - this isn't one of those places where they cook in front of you.  The kitchen is mostly open, but you aren't sitting around the open cooktop.  They cook it in back and bring it out to you.  The food is just as good, but you don't get the show.  You'll need to go elsewhere - such as Kabuto or Nakato - for that."}
{"text":"This place is just shy of unbelievable.  I am almost certain it is the largest buffet (as in number of lines/tables) in the CLT.

The venerable China King on Tyvola has held that distinction for a long time, but as most know, that is not in the best of areas.  The old Crazy Buffet - later C&E Buffet - on Albemarle Road was pretty good sized, but it has since closed.  The Hibachi will probably assume the crown, at least for a while.  Even the China Buffet in Salisbury probably can't beat this one.

Each time we have been here, the place has been packed.  Early dinner, later dinner, even on a weeknight.  It's insane.  They sent out coupons, but most of those have expired (you can find some online if you search).  It's like the East Side has been craving a massive buffet and that pent-up desire is still exploding.

There are several (4?  5?) full-length buffet lines, split in two, down the center of the building.  At the back of the room is a hibachi grill and a sushi station.  Tables are around the room, and there are two rooms to the back on each side, which may be able to be cordoned off for private events (I don't know this, just guessing).

The line for the hibachi grill is always long, so I've only braved it once.  If you do, drop your food off and go get some other food, then come back and pick up your food - but make sure you know what you ordered or you may get in a fight with someone else.  Or just skip it and get other food.

Quality of the buffet food is actually pretty good, but that could be because there are so many people here that the food gets refreshed frequently, rather than getting stale on the bars.  It will be interesting to see if traffic slows down and the quality suffers on the bar as a result.  For now, it's not bad, especially when you consider that it is a buffet - generally a bad thing."}
{"text":"No idea why all the bad reviews! This place is always packed and the food is always delicious. Great selection and well worth the $."}
{"text":"Delicious food with great prices! I got the family dinner for takeout. Service was great too. Will def eat here again"}
{"text":"The best take out hibachi I have found in Charlotte. I get the vegetable hibachi and it has been amazing every time. The California roll is great too."}
{"text":"I decided to try Hibachi Grill after reading all the great reviews and salivating at the pictures on both Yelp and Google. I was not disappointed. 

Service was fast and the staff so friendly. Talk about service with a smile!  My order was grilled quickly. The restaurant itself was clean. They had four small tables in the restaurant and one outside, by the front door on this summer day. 

I ordered the Hibachi short-rib dinner ($10.99) which comes with veggies (onions, zucchini and shredded carrot--a little too heavy on onions for me tho), fried or white rice, and a choice of soup or salad.  I also got the lunch special of 2 grilled chicken & 2 grilled beef skewers with two spring rolls ($6.99). This comes with choice of miso soup or salad, fried or white rice, veggies, and a pop.  They carry PC brand pop so I got a diet mango, which was a nice treat! 

They also gave yum yum sauce, teriyaki sauce, and a red sauce to eat with the meats. 

They certainly do not skimp on portion size that's for sure---Leftovers for several meals!  The meats were seasoned well, and grilled perfectly.  I enjoyed their yum yum sauce (tastes like a mayo based salad dressing) on the skewers and their thick, sweet teriyaki sauce on the short ribs. I wasn't sure what the red sauce was but I used it to dip the spring rolls. 

In my opinion, the \"winners \" at this establishment are really the meats they grilled and their sauces.  The fried rice, salad & soup, spring rolls and veggies were okay. 

I would still like to try some of their seafood specialties---the unagi, squid and mackerel. But I think next time I will request less onions in the veggies, and yakisoba noodles rather than the rice. 

If you are in the area, I totally recommend this place.  Give it a try. Great value!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been inside a Pizza Hut and thought \"man, I wish I could get something covered in shrimp sauce instead?\" Okay, me neither. But, I totally dig it.

So yeah, Hibachi Grill is set inside an old Pizza Hut building. It's nothing fancy. It's not the nicest place. Kind of dingy. What they lack in decor... they make up for with the food.

There are different specials each day. I never get sushi here. Not sure how I feel about that at the HG. I always go the hibachi route. For the price, it's good. It comes with salad and soup. Both of those are just kind of meh.

The biggest thing working against this place is the location. If you're on outbound Independence, it's a complete pain to u-turn. You have no choice but to drive several miles to find a place to do it.

Despite the awful location, there are always people here. And, it's one of the few to survive in this horrendous corridor. Hibachi Grill is doing something right."}
{"text":"My go to place in Pickering for take out. It's healthy, cheap, and made fresh to order. Good selection on menu and very tasty. Staff is very friendly as well. I wish they had more salad options and a brown rice option."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to go for a buffet.  The selection is quite large for the islands, sushi, and Hibachi.  There always seems to be the same 2 guys on the grill every time we go so they know what they are doing.  The location is large, but they pack the tables in.  There always seems to be a line even with the two rooms in the back for seating.  I recommend getting a booth if there is only 2 of you.  The tables are very close to accommodate 8 people and just pulled a little for 4 or less.  

My recommendation for eating is make a trip to the Hibachi station first.  Drop your food off (pay attention to where it is at on the grill) and go get your sushi or other food, drop off at your table and go back to station to wait on the cooks.  He will point at your food and you order your sauce (I am a fan of Hibachi and Garlic) and he will plate it up for you.  Repeat as necessary."}
{"text":"Great first time experience. I went there tonight for the first time with my kids for take out. It's a pretty small place with a few tables if you want to stay and eat. 

We ordered yakisoba with steak and shrimp - very tasty and the beef was tender and flavourful. We also got hibachi rice with chicken teriyaki and again that was great. The rice is a bit fried not plain but that didn't bother us. 

We also got some edamame - that was bland but the portions were decent. The miso soup was ok as well - heavy on the garlic but it had more flavour that way than cheap sushi places. 

I was really impressed with how friendly the service was both over the phone and during the pickup. I asked for non spicy because I have little kids and they prepared the food very mild and gave us sauces in little containers if we wanted spice. 

My kids kept saying 'best food ever' so I think we will be going back soon. :-)"}
{"text":"I don't see why this place gets a bad rap.  Don't get me wrong...I won't touch the sushi.  The hibachi is pretty good though.  The buffet selection is large and constantly replenished.   There is of course your traditional Chinamerican cuisine, lots of salads and cold options, and once in awhile there are crab legs and an expanded seafood selection.  Even my pickiest little one loves the pizza and yeast rolls.   There is space for large groups, so it's great for last minute get togethers.  The servers are great at keeping glasses full, and the food is good, hot, and cheap.   As long as you are not expecting a 4 star meal  (and don't eat the sushi) you will enjoy!"}
{"text":"I saw Walters horrible review and had to write a differing opinion. I think he MUST be thinking of that scary place down near Eastway Dr, not this one in Matthews. I've been coming here over a year and it's NEVER been dirty, the food is overall quite good though some things were not to my taste, but that's any place you go. There's a huge selection all the time, the buffet is constantly being restocked, the sushi is beautifully fresh though not a huge selection, but at their prices I wouldn't expect a big selection. The staff has always been very polite to us but there is a language barrier with most of them. The hostess will sometimes have a cup at the entrance and the grill and sushi chefs do as well and I don't begrudge them that at all. You work in a hot, busy environment like that all the time with few breaks and see if you aren't thirsty. If you're expecting 5 star service and Michelin star rated food for $10 a plate all you can eat then you're quite honestly an idiot. For the price this is an excellent value and I'll be coming here often just like I have for the past year."}
{"text":"Variety of food that is good tasting and kept freshly stocked on the buffet. Friendly hospitable hosts. Drinks are kept filled in the cups. No frowning faces when the kids drop or spill their drinks. Everyone continued to enjoy themselves. Great for parties as well. Will be back and continue to bring more people."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Staff is very friendly! Everything is fresh and cooked in front of you. Ordered the spicy chicken and beef combo. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Got catering done for a birthday party and gave them free reign on what to make. Everything was amazing and so much food. I am super impressed by the quality and quantity and the friendly service. They were so nice and on time. Every one of my friends was impressed and asked for the place name. Great success! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"RARE, SOLID 5/5 across the board. Pickering is unbelievably lucky to have Hibachi Grill. I would drive way out of the way to eat here. Sat in on a weekday evening with a friend. Ordered 1 app and 2 mains: the deep fried scallops, the hibachi grilled short ribs, and the hibachi steak, spicy chicken, and shrimp.

First of all the owner/server is the kindest, sweetest woman I have come across in my entire foodie career. Treats all customers with highest level of respect and service. Ask her for her recommendation if you are in between choices, she will happily help you out.

Secondly, the food was awesome. You are served a your protein of choice, grilled to perfection and seasoned just right. The short ribs had the signature Korean taste to them. The grilled steak was medium well done, in a savory sauce with grilled mushrooms. The spicy chicken... wow. No words. And the shrimp was my favorite! Had an amazing flavor, grilled to perfection. I could especially tell that the rice was fresh, and flavored with a delicious sauce.

But that's not all. They have amazeballs sauces and they are ALL good. The hot sauce is delicious and definitely has a kick! Not sure what the Yumyum sauce is made up of but it lives up to its name. All taste good on its own... but I dare you to try it mixed.

This place is such a gem! Within its restaurant category and considering the location, there is no other place like Hibachi Grill."}
{"text":"This place is great for what it is. It's a hole in the wall hibachi grill. Great food. Quick service. Great for takeout or you can eat there as well. Your soda comes from a can. Your wine comes from a box. But, really great hibachi. I recommend you get it for takeout."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place for Chinese buffet! I visited today for an early lunch. Surely everything will be super fresh, hot, and delicious. It was not... most of my food was cold and tasted \"off\". Even my tea was bad. Of all the buffets in town, this one has always been consistently good. I don't know what happened but i don't like it."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time today after reading some excellent reviews about this restaurant.  I can say that I loved it. The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes is excellent also. Customer service is top notch. Very polite and friendly and caring about the customer. Food tasted great. I had the shrimp and chicken combo and the chicken and steak combo as well. Excellent quality. The only thing my family and I didn't like is that we felt the food and sauces were a bit on the sweet side. A bit too sweet to our taste. But other than that everything else is great! I will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Moved to neighbourhood and drove past this place for 6 months before I decided to look it up one day. I just finished my first visit and it was awesome. Friendly service, reasonable prices and huge portions. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent visitor ever since I have discovered this restaurant.

As an ex-cook for a small restaurant, I have noticed on the first visit that they have used some high quality beef in their steak dinner. I asked the young owner and he told me they have only used Angus steak, mostly from Costco. $12 something for this full-sized dinner, I feel the only reason why his door is not crashed is because the restaurant is still very new in the area."}
{"text":"First off, the service is amazing. The owners are so nice and genuine and go the extra bit with their service, I would definitely return for that reason alone. 

The food is great. It tastes fresh and very good flavor. The portions are very generous and the prices low. I tried the squid and shrimp combo; the squid perfectly grilled and tastes great and the same with the shrimp. My boyfriend got the beef short rib and chicken combo, the chicken was delicious, very good flavor. And the beef was very tasty and tender, would definitely order again. 

It's hard to find good places in this area, with good service and tasty fresh food, so I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Such a great and convenient place to eat and it's well worth your money! I got the steak and shrimp combo which comes with rice and vegetables all for 10.95! And the food is good! It is not food that has been sitting under a heater for hours which makes a difference. Also, the people there are so friendly :)"}
{"text":"Its a buffet. Everything is mediocre. Nothing spectacular. Good for large groups. Very big and lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Here on 5/10/12

Have been here a couple of times before today. Has improved. The hibachi grill good value for the cost.  Not huge selection of chinese food. Good sushi rolls. Would come here again."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The couple who runs it were very welcoming and passionate about making good tasting food for their customers. The food was really good. We had hibachi squid, beef short ribs, spicy chicken, steak, and shrimp. All incredibly tasty.  Much better than what you get at all you can eat japanese places. The prices are also suprisingly reasonable. A typical meal was $7.99. If your in the pickering area or in the pickering mall, walk across the street and try this place out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food , great value for price. We tried the steak and shrimp combo and teriyaki chicken. Food is very flavourful."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here because he loves their hibachi. I am more on the picky side and could not eat here. Things were barely labeled so I had no idea what some things were. I tried their pizza which was bad and their doughnuts which were stale and bad. Even the soda was very watered down. Honestly it was so cheap $6 for lunch, I can't really expect better. I myself will not be back but my husband likes their hibachi, he is not picky about where he eats. The place could stand to be cleaner. Our waitress was nice but the hostesses were mediocre. I guess if you are looking for a cheap lunch place and are not picky about what you eat definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"First of all I want to say the food was awesome second The staff was very nice and friendly third the place looks great after all the years it's been opened fourth they have a very large party room that seated my friends and family  of 45 with more room to spare and fifth the manager was very nice he greeted us and made sure all the waitress did there jobs of refilling drinks and cleaning all the plates of our table. So I give Hibachi buffet five stars."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem on yelp, of course.
A small family owned business (such sweet people!)
A little out of the area but can't complain cause the food is just absolutely amazing!
We always order the hibachi chicken and steak combo but always get the spicy over the teriyaki! (You'll thank me)"}
{"text":"Come here weekly. I love it, great food, great staff. The steak and chicken with rice is bomb. Also, the yumyum sauce is to die for. I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"This is a solid Chinese buffet - with some sushi and hibachi. I can see why people go here - and you will get plenty to eat. I found nothing to complain about. 

However, the Ichiban on Albemarle Road in Charlotte is similar - and just a little better. Go there."}
{"text":"Just came here since it just opened so me and my niece had to check it out.

Had the steak yakisoba and my niece had chicken and steak.  The steak is pretty good.  It was pink in the middle and soft.

The staff was really nice too. Gave us some extras too.  I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"So my wife and I Yelped this place and decided to try it out since the reviews were very good and the pictures of the items looked delicious. Needless to say we were not disappointed! This place is amazing!!! 

We both had the spicy chicken, shrimp and beef combo. I swear to God it was orgasm of flavors exploding in my mouth lol. Fresh ingredients, open kitchen, friendly staff and not to mention very generous portions. Makes this spot a great lil gem... I live by Kennedy station and I would actually make the drive out here again and again because the food was so damn F'n GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!!!Definitely worth the drive. Food was freshly prepared and catered to my kids' liking. Happy to support small business"}
{"text":"This place had been around forever and I freaking love it. Yes it's always busy when I walk in there. Some would say that's weird. But not me. They do a lot of to go food. I always get the steak and shrimp hibachi w rice and salad. Hey for a quick meal that you can eat off of for about 2-3 days the price isn't bad either. Call it in and it's ready when you get there. Located in the same shopping center as Chris's deli this place is an east Charlotte staple."}
{"text":"Good family run restaurant for take out or for upto 3 people. Seating area is no frills. I only come here if I'm stuck in Pickering for work. Owners daughter takes the order, she is a pleasant junior high student. She confirmed that there was no msg. After the meals my throat felt ok. I'm typically allergic to large amounts of msg"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. I got the lunch special of beef and chicken skewers, it included a drink and a choice of soup or salad, all for $6.99.

The skewers came on a bed of rice with a side of veggies- onion and zucchini, and spring rolls. Over all I was very happy with the portion and the skewers themselves were very good.  

The food itself as I said was good but not out of this world good. I would say this is a solid lunch spot and well worth the bang for your buck where you can't really go wrong for the amount of food you get at the price point.

I would definitely return for lunch. I also hope to try something off their main menu rather than a lunch special."}
{"text":"It is a bit intimidating walking into this place.  I think this is the largest buffet I have been to in Charlotte (I guess the next comparable size in buffets reside in Vegas).

I forgot what used to be in this shopping center - I think a Media Play... but the space that the Hibachi Grill and Buffet now resides at used to be a Goody's clothing store so it had a lot of space to work with.

There are rows and rows of food... anything you can think of.  It's not all Asian inspired cuisine, there is pizza and chicken fingers for the kids.  There's even a sushi bar in the back - (quantity sushi rather than quality), but it's still sushi and pretty good for a buffet.  In the back there is a Mongolian grill setup where you can pick all your ingredients and the chef in the back stir fries it for you.

Decent price for such a large buffet.  I'll definitely go again, just that I always feel like I never get my $$s worth since I don't like eating until I'm about to pop."}
{"text":"Amazing & consistently delicious food. The staff here are always so welcoming & nice. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Been ordering from here about once a week.  Hibachi chicken and veggies.  They're generous with the shrimp sauce.  Food is consistent!  I always order out, so can't say what the dining atmosphere is like- but it is located inside an old Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I was unsure what to get to eat for lunch today so that's when I whipped out my trusty yelp app to help me decide. I stumbled upon this restaurant with perfect ratings so I knew I had to check it out. Honestly I was skeptical how could a restaurant with such simple offerings have such great reviews...

What really makes this restaurant more than it's food is actually its customer service. Situated in a small strip mall off of Kingston road it could easily be passed by without notice. Upon entering I was greeted by the beaming owner smiling ear to ear. He took my order and was soo gracious and pleasant the whole entire time. I could hear a child off in the distance and he told me no school today so his kids are here with him. A young girl actually cashed me out which I presume was his daughter. He then went off to cook my meal which I could see him doing just off behind the cashier. While he was cooking he told me to go pick out my drinks from the fridge. He then came back out and offered me a bag to put my ice cold pops in because he didn't want me to hold the cold drinks in my hands.

I got everything to go and he kindly bundled everything up for me. When I asked about the famous yum yum sauce he said all the sauces were already in the bag in separate containers which I appreciated. 

Driving home the delicious smells coming from my bundle of food were making me extra ravenous to dive in.

I had made it in time for the lunch special which they generously offer until 4pm so I ordered the spicy grilled chicken which comes with fried rice, zucchini, onion, carrots, a pop, miso soup and a spring roll.  A great size portion all for just $7.25 is a steal in my books! So onto the taste...
To be very honest the flavours of everything is simple in taste nothing outstanding but still simply seasoned and not overwhelming in any sense. The fried rice is as basic as they come with just the right amount of salt and savouriness without any other accompaniments mixed in. It's the perfect bed to highlight the tender grilled meat which is also lightly seasoned with that familiar Korean flavour. I didn't find it spicy but it had good flavour. In addition to listed sautéed veg I see they have added broccoli to the mix which I would prefer more of. As for the famous yum yum sauce I was not a fan but I never really favour mayo based sauces anyhow. The teriyaki style sauce was far too sweet for me but the hot sauce was more my style. It seemed to be mixed ketchup to tone down the spiciness however I felt the meal itself was great on it's own and did not require the addition of sauces.

I have to say what really keeps the customers coming back and gives it it's high ratings is the hospitality of a family run business. They are humble and gracious and then simplicity of fresh ingredients simply prepared right before your eyes without being weighed down by sticky sauces or coated in heavy spices. They let the real ingredients shine, it's simple, tasty, and filling and that's about it plus that low price point and large portion does sweeten the deal."}
{"text":"We always go to this place when we are planning on a Chinese buffet.
It has the biggest selection...  and sushi.
Although they have the typical Chinese buffet desserts, you can scoop your own ice cream here, my kids love that.
My husband always gets something cooked on the hibachi grill.
I love their coconut chicken!!!
The people are very nice. Don't forget to check out the fish and turtles up front."}
