{"text":"The new Stevenson's has not lost its touch with serving up a great burger. It's good to see more seating and a real nice selection of draft beers. Add to that an attentive staff and plenty of parking this place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Cleveland, new place is nice but not the same nostalgia as old joint. Bruce is the best and a great guy."}
{"text":"Good burgers and an assortment of deep-fried favorites. If you're looking for simple fare, pleasant service and not worried about the latest ingredients or decor, this is your place. I had the Cheeseburger with onion rings, and it was tasty and comforting like a friend you've known for thirty years. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots! Great food, amazing prices. Best part: Poppers and a Big Guy. Old bowling machine that brings back memories and a touch tunes juke box. Great for get togethers."}
{"text":"A simple, plain bar with terrific burgers and fries...no frills!  Make sure to bring cash as they do not accept plastic.

Other than that small issue, you will not go wrong with any style / flavor of burger you choose...and for the price, why not add a patty or maybe have two!  These burgers are just about perfect with a great bun, veggie fixings, and you can add bacon for a buck.  Done.

We got two types of burgers and split them (a bacon cheeseburger and their version of a big mac).  Both were extremely tasty but not really greasy at all. Fries were a bit on the limp side, but were fresh cut so I didn't hold it against them.

They even have an old-fashioned bowling machine (and leagues for it, i think).  Well worth seeking this place out."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars. This is a no frills restaurant/bar. The place itself is actually pretty small. When we got there the only seats were in front of the door. The service was ok, not great, but one girl was manning the whole bar and restaurant all by herself. So I'd say she was doing pretty well.
  The food. We all got burgers that were delicious and epically huge. Especially in regards to the price. Even my picky 9 year old demolished his burger! We shared a couple baskets of fries and Mozz. Sticks. 
The food disappeared almost as fast as it came out from the kitchen. I will definitely be coming back. Shout out to my YELP brother Chaz, you were dead on with this one."}
{"text":"If you like \"big boy\" style burgers & breaded crispy wings, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great hamburgers and fried bologna sandwiches at a very reasonable price. Alicia is a standout server. Definitely a bar atmosphere but a good place for a good and cheap meal."}
{"text":"Stopped by to test the best burger in town theory out and I must say I wasn't disappointed. From the outside looking in you wouldn't think this would be the first place to come in mind to get a burger but it was hot and fresh which is the foundation of any good burger I would argue.  The burger wasn't overwhelmed by too many toppings and complicated buns, it's straight and simple to the point, sometimes less is more."}
{"text":"Hands down the best in Cleveland, no frills, just great burgers.  Go there tonight and thank me tomorrow.  Bruce has been doing this for a long time and he does it right.  Ate many times at the old location and have not been to the new location as many times as I would have liked."}
{"text":"My son and I finally went here for Thursday night dinner. I've heard a lot of people rave about their burgers- we were not disappointed! We both got the Big Guy, 2 beef patties with cheese and special sauce. The burgers are probably the best I've ever had. We shared sides or fries and onion rings. The fries are the hand cut style, very good. The onion rings were great, nice thick slices with a really good batter, a little greasy but hey, it's fried food. They have drink specials every night and this night was Long Island Ice Tea. Our server was friendly and helpful. This is a bar restaurant. Prices are very reasonable. We will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Love this place it has been a landmark in Euclid forever... food is amazing, service is great. The only thing is I wish they would have kept the original building as a landmark.. yes it could not hold the people in it cause it was so busy. I feel they could have done something to preserve it... other then that, you need to try once and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice. The first time my burgers were leathery and tasteless. One burger was requested well done and the other to be medium well.
 Years later I made a second attempt and tried the new location.  Both burgers were received as medium instead of the above requested. I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Great burger!  The big guy was delicious and they have fresh cut fries.   Very small inside but they have a good beer selection and specials every night.  Staff is friendly and bar is clean. Would highly recommend if you like a good burger."}
{"text":"Nice little bar. Burgers are extremely good along with the two appetizers we tried. (Fried pickles & fries). Could probably use a new bartender though... I found it rather gross she served someone else's food with a her half eaten burger in hand....."}
{"text":"The burger is really great, and probably the highest taste/cost ratio around, but definitely not the best burger in Cleveland, as many hype it up to be. The bar is very low-key; in the 1/2 dozen or so times I've been there, I don't think I've ever seen more than 20 people in there at a time. Very laid back, very friendly bartenders (talk to Anna, she's awesome!). Pretty small draft selection, but plenty of bottles. There are several big TVs behind the bar for watching a sports game. Overall, a good experience and a cheap night out. Make sure you check your mail for a Valu Pak coupon before you go, Stevenson's has a pamphlet in there all the time."}
{"text":"Great burger! Seasoned well and I really liked the special sauce! Service was pretty fast and very polite! Definitely would come back for a second time. I got the \"lil fella\" and added bacon to it. Could've done without the bacon (it was a thicker cut than I'm used to on my burgers) but the special sauce was on point! Fries are hand cut and amazing so don't skip out on em. Overall a solid bar for a burger and a beer."}
{"text":"Throw back burger joint that hits the mark. If you're looking for gourmet burgers cooked to temp this is not your spot. They are big greasy burgers with grilled onions, and a decent bun that almost withstands the burden. The fries are hand cut. Service is friendly and efficient. Decent beer selection and very reasonable prices"}
{"text":"1st time stopping in for a meal. Nice clean atmosphere. Bartender greeted us as soon as we stepped inside. Dad and I sat at a table and soon got menus and asked what we wanted to drink. 
Upon her return we placed our order. Dad got the daily special Fish Sandwich (fried cod). It was crispy outside and tender and flavorful inside. Tomato, onion, lettuce and cheese. Plus a bowl of some very delicious chili. Was said everybody loves it. We tasted why!!!! 
I got the famous House Cheese Burger. Made to perfection, outstanding bite after bite. Now on my list of place to eat."}
{"text":"Came here motivated by a Thrillist article naming Stevenson's as the best burger in Cleveland. Needless to say, I had high expectations walking in here one rainy afternoon.

The place is a classic dive bar. Cheap beer, a fireball shot dispenser apparatus behind the bar...I like. They even had one craft beer on tap (Columbus brewing) which was a surprising positive. I wasted little time and ordered the Lil Fella burger ($5) that was named best burger. My loins trembled at the thought of juicy beef patty juice running down my face and body.

The burger arrives. Patty, onions, pickles - simple. I take a bite. Solid, but unspectacular. I take another bite. Oooo i discovered some of the special sauce. Overall good burger but did not meet my high expectations. My loins restored to their normal disposition."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. The service was great. I had never been here before and thought I would check it out since I was in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger I must say at a very nice neighborhood joint. The burgers are hot and melting with delicious cheese and a special sauce that is out of this world. Have a Burger and a side of fries and maybe a beer and you've got yourself a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Glad to see the Stevensons name and great burgers didnt die when the old building up on Lakeshore was crumbling to bits.  Came in here on a Friday afternoon before the after work worriors and the power lunch, polo shirt statues frequent and Im glad I did.  The ladies behind the bar were both cool and the patrons gave a smile if ya made eye contact.  There were drink specials and they actually told you before ordering what they were and didnt try to keep it a well guarded secret!  Ordered shots, beers and a Stevenson burger.  Tastes just as good as years passed.  Once I found out this place used to be a seedy strip club I was automatically smitten by the neon blue lights and imaginary, yet faint smell of stripper lotion and regret still lingering in the air.  Only thing I can say is the beer lines in this place need cleaned something aweful.  Tastes like buttery cat ass in a glass...yumm..."}
{"text":"One word description - YUM! I've been craving a delicious burger..... WOW! I am stuffed and still thinking about how good the burger was! I can't wait to come back for another!"}
{"text":"I have found my favorite burger place in town, excellent service, best prices can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Exactly what we were looking for local friendly down home bar with great burgers. No frills great service, prices, drinks and burgers. I got the cheeseburger and my hubby got the big guy. This place did not disappoint. We will be back."}
