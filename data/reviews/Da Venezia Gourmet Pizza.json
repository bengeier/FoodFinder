{"text":"My new go-to pizza place! Didn't know what to expect but after trying the pizza I loved it! Much better then the classic places like pizza pizza and the dough is really tasty. The prices are great and definitely worth it. Will be suggesting this to my friends!"}
{"text":"The BEST. We live in the area and tried it a few months ago and haven't ordered from anywhere else since. Prices are very reasonable for gourmet pizza delivery. Try tomatoes on your pizza, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"WOW!! I'm not a foodie but the first thing I did after arriving home after devouring my pizza slice was to write this review. It was mere chance that I passed by this pizza joint at lunchtime on my way home. I had a veggie slice (spinach, tomato and some white cheese (not sure what type of cheese it was). This slice was AMAZING! This is now my new \"go to\" place for pizza. Please note that this place has a few tables - it's not a sit-down dinner place."}
{"text":"We enjoyed many pizzas from Da Venezia but tonight's was over cooked and laden with garlic.  So we'll be going back to Camarra's.  Too bad.  They were producing a nice product."}
{"text":"awesome pizza and good pricing; nice people; but close early esp. for friday and saturday night"}
{"text":"Went in for their walk in special. Service was friendly. I was Told it would be a half hour wait for a large pizza. While I waited, I noticed the place was empty but nobody bothered to wipe down the tables which were oily and full of crumbs.  The pizza was slightly overcooked and dry. I really wanted this to be a good place since it's in my neighborhood and family owned but it failed to impress. I may return for a second chance."}
{"text":"The man that runs this gourmet pizza spot is truly a master of his craft.  This place is my go-to for a quick bite, and the food quality is truly unparalleled.    Easily the best pizza I've ever had.   My grandmother visits yearly from out of the country and refuses to eat out with us, except when we get Da Venezia pizza."}
{"text":"It was time...Time for me to give the newbie pizza joint a try. It's arrival was very inconspicuous, one day it just appeared to pop up out of nowhere.  Open concept with a very large kitchen with a few tables lining the windows for sit down diners. At first glance, menu includes all your Italian staples with dough and sauce for pizza made in house.  The restaurant appeared to be run by one person who was doing the cooking and customer service stuff. They had 5 options for slices. I ordered a slice of the bianca which had zucchini, mushroom and artichoke. The homemade dough was mouth-watering brought the flavours of the pizza to life. All toppings were fresh and the slice was a moment to savour.  Price point was very reasonable except that the debit machine prompted you to leave a tip for a take-out order. However, for a business just starting out I can understand why they might want to.  Good for: homemade-style pizza, quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for the vegan potato pizza.  But they didn't have any potatoes.   Also, it was really hot inside and no outdoor seating, so we would have had to take it to go."}
{"text":"This place makes the best pizza. If I dare say, best I've ever had. Their dough is amazing. It's addictive! We tried it for the first time about a month ago and have ordered twice since. It really is great. Do yourself a favour and give it a try. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good. But their prices online and their actual prices are wildly different. That, or they purposely ripped us off.   I would not return, just based on the lack of interest in it. They had no interest in fixing the prices, or giving us the prices from the website."}
{"text":"When I called to order I asked for the total for a Canadiana which on the website says 13.99. The price came out to 19 and change. Now I'm not cheap but when I asked he said the website is not correct. Really ...like really . Forget that"}
{"text":"We order pizza from here often. The pizza is always good. Fast delivery and friendly staff. Reasonable prices too. Their \"pizza style\" garlic bread is amazing! You must try it! Definitely my favorite pizza joint in the Upper Avenue Rd neighbourhood."}
