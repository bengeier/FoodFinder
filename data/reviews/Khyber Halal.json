{"text":"I've been coming here for the past two years and the service and food has been consistently amazing. Family run, friendly staff. Try the Mantoo, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved here from NYC and were excited to try this place out. It lived up to the great reviews!!  We ordered a vegetable samosa, which came with some cilantro dipping sauce. It was perfectly cooked and I wanted to put that sauce on everything.  I ordered the Mantoo and my husband the lamb kebab. They both were very good portions and more importantly delicious. Last, but not least we had the chili naan bread. It was spicy, but worth every bite.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Second time in and just as good as the first time. Fantastic service, incredible food this is really a terrific place!!"}
{"text":"Couple guys I work with found this place on Yelp so we went to check it out.  We may have come on a bad day being a Friday and they close from 12:30 to 1:30 to pray but we did make it in early enough.  At first was concerned because they were missing some spices so a few of the items we were thinking about were off the menu.  But we asked what type of chicken was his favorite and he said the Boti Chicken so we gave that a try.  we ended up getting the rice served along with the dish and ordered the Nan? (bread) as a side everything was really good the Boti has a little bite to it but not too much very good but do want to sample a few more dishes before deciding on a favorite.  I will keep you informed on my explorations in the future because we all decided this place needs to be on our regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant after spending the day at the hospital and wanting to have something exciting to eat. It's not much to look at from the outside situated in a small strip \"mall\" across from a circle k. Definitely a diamond in the rough! The food is DELICIOUS and the portions are quite generous. Service was also very good! Will definitely be back it was great"}
{"text":"Sweet mother of God, why haven't I tried this place sooner??? I've wasted 24 years I could have been savoring their dishes. (I technically don't know how long they've been in business, but I'm guessing it's been a while... and even if it's a month... I can't believe I've missed that month).  It might be my new favorite restaurant in this city.  The food was amazing.  The service was wonderful.  The value was outstanding. The prices are beyond reasonable for what you get (taking into account both flavor and portion size).  Don't let the location scare you.  Consider it a blessing.  It's probably how they keep prices down.   I ordered the Chicken Karahi (large portion, so that I'd have leftovers for lunch the next day).  It's a miraculous mixture of chicken perfectly cooked, in a ginger/jalapeno/tomato based sauce that's so delicious and fragrant, served with naan bread.  I ordered it medium hot, and the spices were perfect.  Definitely warm, but not so hot you can't enjoy your food. It's only 10am next day, and I've already broken into the take-home carton and had it for breakfast.  YUM.  Even better second day, if that's possible.   My hubby ordered the Mantoo.  HEAVEN.  He cleaned his entire plate off (and then helped himself to my Karahi...which at the time I was cool with... but today.. I wish I'd have told him to keep his grubby hands to himself... I would have had enough left for breakfast AND lunch.)  We were stuffed, but had to try the Gulub Jaman for dessert.  We weren't disappointed.  Two balls of doughy goodness, resting in a sweet syrup of heaven.  They aren't large.  Small actually.  The perfect amount to cap off an amazing meal with, without pushing you over gluttony's precarious edge.    Don't hesitate to give this place a shot. You will be so glad you did.   BRAVO Khyber Halal!!  You will definitely be seeing us again!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had afghani food, but if this is what its like...i love it! It's like a combo of indian and persian. The naan s not like the naan you'll get as an indian restaurant, but its still good, more crispy. We ordered the afghani kofta and mixed grill platter. I was a little worried about ordering the kofta because the grill platter is HUGE!. But after trying the kofta, I was glad I ordered it...juicy meatballs surrounded by well cooked and seasoned lentil curry. The meat from the grill is cooked well, not too dry. Sadly did not have room for baklava or any other dessert, but we did leave with a lot of leftovers. It's also at a good price point so they definitely have gained a repeat customer."}
{"text":"One of the best resturants ever. I went there last night and it was great overall. Halal food, excellent service, friendly staff, delicous food and reasonable price. I only wish that they have more non-spicy food because I am spicy-allergic."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat in Phoenix! My boyfriend and I make it a point to visit whenever we are in town! My favorite dish is the chicken handi, but I have loved everything I have tried. I highly recommend the lamb shank, beef kabob, and the goat biriyani as well!!! So much flavor in every bite here. The staff when we've gone has been two younger guys and they are so helpful and adorable. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't think that I would like Afghani food and I was a little nervous to try, but everything I had was WONDERFUL! The waitress was such a sweetheart and she was patient in explaining the types of dishes to me.  I had a chicken samosa, garlic naan and the mantoo.  Would highly recommend, everything I tried was amazing!"}
{"text":"I got a wild hair and thought I'd give this place a try since it happened to be on my way home from work. I randomly picked items off the menu to try something new. Everything I chose was fabulous. The spinach, the cauliflower, lamb kebab with rice, hummus and bread. The restaurant was quaint and clean and the service was great. I ordered my food as take out and ate it at home and had a nice family dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Small place but very clean. Started off with the veggie samosa and the hummus with pita for appetizer, forgot to snap a photo!!  Both very good, the hummus was especially delicious. If you ever had the hummus from Switch on central ave. this one gives it a run for its money. next had the chicken boti with rice and the beef kabob with the afghani rice with carrot and raisins  Both were wonderful and tasty.   Service was great. The kid with the black framed glasses and the other kid with the curly hair both nice kids and very friendly. Food is great can't wait to go back.  Check them out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is family owned and operated. They have great consistent food quality every time. The Chicken Mali Boti is the best!! My boyfriend and I love this place and could eat here every day."}
{"text":"I love Khyber Halal. It is the best place to get Mantoo in all of Arizona.  I spoke with the owner she is a delightful Afghani lady. I have been going to this place for years and is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on Sunday and the restaurant was closed. Not the ones to lose hope, we drove 35 miles again for dinner today. We were the only two at 6 for dinner. They are closed on Sunday's though the website seems to show open.  My husband ordered chicken malai boti and chicken tikka masala with naan. He really enjoyed his dishes. I ordered kabuli pulav and vegetable kabab. The rice was flavorful and the kabab well grilled.   The food is freshly made, so it took them around 20 min to serve our dinner.  We plan to go back again and try some curries.  One negative thing is the location, the restaurant surroundings seemed to be shady."}
{"text":"1) Really good food 2) Menu items that you will not find anywhere else 3) Massive portions (took home more than we ate!) 4) Atmosphere is awful - turn off the TV in the seating area!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent especially Naans are fresh and wholesome. It does lack professionalism though. Closing time is 9 PM, drove 17 miles to be there but staff refused to seat us at 835 pm saying that they will only provide take out.  Never went back and chose another restaurant for our spicy food needs."}
{"text":"Amazing.  I am afghan too and can cook all these so it's hard to impress our family with traditional good. this place is the only authentic food I go for. And not to mention very reasonable prices. As long as you make it there before 8. We just moved to AZ and so glad to find this place."}
{"text":"Not sure if I I just ate chicken...  Or a cat...  Weird texture meat.  Sauce was odd in the tikka masala and the naan...  Well...  It was more like a pita - too thick and spongy...  2 of 5 even with rice.  Will not recommend."}
{"text":"After reading all the great review on yelp was utterly disappointed. Definately not an Indian or Pakistani restaurant. Food is bland. Biryani is just plain bland masala rice made with afghan spice combo. Nan not good either. For people looking for authentic indian or pakistani place this is not the place."}
{"text":"Just bought the hummus. Whatever the bread is, is disgusting. I can't exactly place the flavor but it keeps reminding me of cigarettes and burnt coffee. I threw it away. I hope I don't get sick from it. The hummus was average but considering the bread, I recommend getting something else."}
{"text":"Was on a business trip in Phoneix and decided I wanted some Paki food. After reading some reviews I decided on Khyber Halal. Since I was from out of town I decided to give them a call and confirm there hours, I was told last order is an hour before the restaurant closes. Me and three of my coworkers grabbed a cab and headed over there. We arrived an hour and ten minutes before closing, as we headed to a table the cashier, Abudallah told us take out only. We mentioned to him that we called and they said as long as we come an hour before closing we would be served. He repeated take out only, we told him we were from out of town and didn't have a place to take them. He told us that was what the manager had told him, we asked to see the manager, he told us that the manager wasn't available. At this point he said we are out of food, and pretty much told us to get the F out. Couldn't believe it, ended up spending $40 in cabs without getting anything to eat. We ended at Curry Corner(Tempe), with better service."}
{"text":"What an unexpected delight. Great food. Charming family of owners. It looks like nothing from the outside but what wonderful smells tastes and flavors await you."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a little piece of Afghanistan heaven, KH Chicken Boti with rice is where it's at.  I get it to-go on the reg, at least once a week; 3 times if I'm lucky. My life is more complete with this rice...I'm actually eating it at this very second.  The staff is all very kind, too. Don't mind the so-so parking and bus stop outside...curb appeal doesn't matter when Chicken Boti is concerned."}
{"text":"My dad and I are new to Arizona and decided to eat at Khyber. The food was amazing! the portions were beyond perfect, and the service was amazing. The servers were very helpful and kind. We ordered the Beef shish kabob with rice and Chicken boti with naan was delicious. I highly recommend eating here! The place was really clean and organized (even the bathrooms!)."}
{"text":"Checked this restaurant out tonight and I'm pleased with their timely and yummy service. Mixed Grill with Rice dish tasted like it was made at home with minimal spices and not greasy at all. I can't wait to try other items from their menu."}
{"text":"This place is just the best.  I've had lunch and dinner here several times and it NEVER disappoints!!!  If you want to have a nice meal that's out of the ordinary, come to these guys!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday night. Fantastic food with a strip mall ambiance. Not sure who was in the back cooking but they know exactly what they are doing. So delicious and flavorful. On top of that, our party of 4 had our fill of entrées w/ desserts and out total after tip was only $50."}
{"text":"This place is Rad!  Once in a blue moon I will get a bug up my ass that can only be satiated by the food I find at Khyber. Years in the middle east have lent to me having some strange cravings that can only be scratched by the food served at Khyber Halal.   Go in, keep an open mind, get some eats. Its pretty simple."}
{"text":"Drove here al the way from Tempe. I was at the door at 8:01pm on a Sat night. I was told there was only take out service after 8 and they didn't seat us. I guess they just can let business walk away. I will never come back."}
{"text":"One of phoenix best kept secret. I didnt realize this hidden jem was 2 miles away from work until i drove it by one day and decided to check it out.   I'm impressed! Great food friendly staff clean humble restaurant.  I always try something diffrent everytime i come in and the food never disapoints.   Khyber Halal is a must try for all you foodies out there"}
{"text":"came here seeing all the raving reviews. HUGELY disappointed. we had the lamb shank, goat biriyani(spicy), and chicken biriyani. Had the worst biriyani ever. And believe me I had tasted lots and lots of biriyanis."}
{"text":"Want good food for your buck? Come to Khyber Halal. A family-owned restaurant serving Afghan/Pakistani/Indian combo platters, and boy is the food great! The only unfortunate issue I could think of this place is some items on the menu may not be available. Other than this, bring your appetite cause the portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"We started with the Samosas and the sauce that accompanied them was fantastic.  Like, eating spoonfuls of this stuff after the samosas were gone, good.  The goat curry was spicy as requested and went down great with the fresh, warm bread that came along with the food.  Everything else was great but I got the impression you can't really go wrong on this menu.  Awesome, totally awesome."}
{"text":"Just as an FYI, they are closed Fridays from 12:30 pm to 1:30 pm and a sign inside states that they only do takeout after 8 pm Monday to Thursday and 9 pm Friday and Saturday.  Only reason I mention this is that I happened to place an order at 12:28 pm one Friday.  They mentioned their closing and gave me the option of still placing the order with my food being ready at 1:30 pm.  it was no big deal so I went with it.  A few months back my car was in the shop for about a week and I took the bus to work.  Passed by this place and meant to stop by but never did.  It was featured in a recent issue of Phoenix Magazine Cheap Eats.  I decided it was time to take the plunge.  Tried the mantoo and garlic naan for lunch take out.  This is the first time I've tried Afghani/Pakistani food but love Indian and Greek food and imagine I'll become a further fan of Afghani/Pakistani food as well.    The mantoo had so much flavor I absolutely loved it and would recommend it.  Going to go back and work my way through more of the menu."}
{"text":"I'm seriously beginning to question, whether Yelp reviewers are actually former incarcerated felons, who had such lousy food in jail, that almost anything decent will merit 4 or 5 stars.  Seriously:  what about this place rates 4 or 5 stars?!?  Yeah, the kids, who help run the place are adorable and well-mannered, but that's not a reason to rave about the restaurant ... or is it?    Let's talk about what's NOT cute:  One of our companions ordered the kabli pulao from the menu.  He did state, that the meat was fairly decently spiced, but the rest of the dish was pretty bland.  His plate, for some reason, came with plain pilaf, which did even less to relieve the blandness.  My plate had the Afghan rice with raisins, so it was a little better.  However, the presentation of the kabli leaves something to be desired.  I would seriously consider altering its shape, since it arrives at your table shaped like a long .... Well, let's just say, I wondered whether one of my dogs from home got into the restaurant and had an accident on his plate  (my companion assures me, that would not have been possible as the food would then have had more flavor than it did).  I had the lamb shank.  It, too, came with enough rice to feed an Afghan family of 7.  And, as much as I love carbs, most of it sat on my plate at meal's end.  The lamb was very fatty, but, hey, that's what gives it taste.  Unfortunately, it was the ONLY dish with lamb available at the restaurant (which, for an Afghani restaurant is as bizarre as going to an Italian restaurant and them not having pasta!).  As an appetizer, I had the hummus, which was -- surprise -- bland.  The bread they serve with it -- allegedly naan -- bore an amazing resemblance to Little Caesar's cheesy bread.  Good, but not naan in any sense of the word I know.  My partner had the chicken tikki masala, which, to me, looked almost like pho (soup) when it came out.  However, he said it was not only very good, but creamy.  They did not, however, bother to ask him how spicy he wanted it, so it came out in a neutral, middle spiciness, which, according to him, added just enough spice to avoid it being --- you got it --- bland.  Service was attentive and extraordinarily polite, especially when considering our server probably doesn't yet know how to shave.  Overall, we won't be coming back here.  The food was bland and nothing particularly exciting.  If, as one of the reviewers stated, the cooking reminds her of how mom made dinner at home, she should immediately close Yelp, drive to mom's, and blow up her pots and pans.  Many of the reviewers here have written, that the dishes come with plenty of food.  But this isn't exactly true:  when it comes down to it, the main dish portions aren't big at all and you're served truckloads of cheap rice to fill out the dishes.  As my partner stated:  \"you really have to read these reviews with a grain of salt\".    Perhaps.  But if you intend to take reviews of this place with a grain of salt, make sure to bring your own with you:  as bland as the food is here, you won't find any salt laying around to use"}
{"text":"many delicious options, very flavorful. They were sweet about helping me concoct a vegan option. You can taste the blessing. They also have good vegetarian options, no concocting necessary."}
{"text":"Affordable 'Mediterranean diet' if you want it that way = carbs/ protein/ healthy oil- OLIVE.   I could care less about the location - because, I sure am not a snob or someone who depends on synthetic smiles and alpha males roaming about.  Trust me, there have never been jerks or plastic people here, mostly medical professionals and surrounding business folks. NO fake giddy people being nosy, loud, or obnoxious. Very well.   That said; I love eating inside, it's one of a few locations I feel back down to earth at. This establishment is clean and just to prove it they have a sink outside the restrooms as well as inside the restroom, for the person that would usually use a napkin or dispensed paper for opening  up the door after hittin' the restroom. That makes me smile.  The food is healthy as all get out, tasty chunks of flavorful chicken that are juicy. NEVER  EVER  HAVE I HAD A GRISLY CHUNK OF MEAT HERE - NEVER. Nice!  The rice is rich n' hearty as well as being flavorful, it's not exaggerated with any seasonings, somehow it's always just right.  They do have baklava and a bunch of other nice deserts. The beverage selection is great for my situation (alkalinic causing foods = cancer prevention) that'd be organic lemonade.   The price fits my budget any time of year and is a bargain for what you're getting. A healthy flavorful meal.   Staff are down to earth, there is never any body breathing down your neck with bloated superficialities or temporary personalities. What you see and hear are what you get. Very nice hosts who serve your dish and promptly refill drinks when you need it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great prices. Had some dumplings off of their authentic menu that were delicious. I also now know I love naan and chicken marsala. If you're new to this cuisine I need help with the menu the staff is great at helping you figure out what it is you're looking at."}
{"text":"Go for the mantoo and some kebabs. Now about the spice level. My wife is Mexican and we eat very spicy food. Their spicy, is indeed very spicy! Very tasty."}
{"text":"Undiscovered gem! This place is fantastic. The restaurant sits in a nondescript strip center on southwest corner of Indian School & 24th St. Since it was the first time we had been there I decided to try a bunch of different items and see what we liked.   Chicken Tikka Masala was rich and spicy. Very good.  Chicken Malai Boti was green (yea, green), grilled, and really flavorful. Vegetable Briyani was standard rice with veggies. Still good. Mantoo was the highlight! Little dumplings stuffed with meat. They are topped with a combination of curry and yogurt. So, so good...  You should definitely check this place out. The ambiance will not overwhelm you, but the food certainly will..."}
{"text":"A little birdie told me this is the place to go for authentic Afghani/Pakistani dishes. I must admit this was my first time trying such a cuisine. Like Indian food it is rich in flavor and quite aromatic. The portion sizes are huge and prices are more than reasonable. We had ordered Tiki Masala (I always thought that was Indian, but the Pakistani version was impressive), chicken Biryani (my fav), kabli pulao, and of course naan.  We ordered 'to-go' to feed a big group (10-15 ppl) and it was a hit with my family, they were very impressed."}
{"text":"Really interesting family own restaurant.  Be ready for new flavors. Some of them spicy.   The dumplings and deserts were my favorite. Also the meat dishes were tasteful.  Not a big fan of the rice dishes, plus the servings were family style.  The deserts worth the try, try as many as your stomach allows you!  I was invited so I don't know about pricing, but seems to be pretty fair.  Cheers"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We tried many items. Favorites were the lamb kabobs, eggplant, lamb shank on rice and chicken khori.  What a find!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the good reviews. Their naan bread is frozen pizza dough. I love indian food but this place just isn't good."}
{"text":"Disgusting food fake imitation of Afgan and Paki food. Waitress/owner thinks she is the thing so disrespectful Food was disgusting as I said so I paid for the first dish and not ate it being so disgusting! And tipped the old woman acting 18 $1.00 thanks"}
{"text":"Good food, sometimes a bit greasy but overall very delicious. Would say the eggplant is one of my favorites. Avoid the chicken tikka masala. It was bland and had too much food color. The other chicken dishes were excellent."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! I'm always excited to discover authentic gems in the Valley. It reminds me of LA, where you can get food from any country that's presumably as good as what you'd get there.   My roommate and I stumbled upon this place after getting gas at Circle K, and were delighted by the airy garlic naan--best I've ever had--and the well-balanced, perfectly seasoned mantoo. (That Afghan term for dumplings sounds just like the Korean one!) The dumpling skins were incredibly chewy and the sauce-to-filling and filling-to-skin ratio were ideal. The lamb kabob was tasty too (just reordered), though I've had more tender. The green (cilantro?) yogurt sauce was the perfect complement to the lamb, rice, and fresh veggie mix.  To top things off, our server Kamila was super friendly and fun, giving us helpful recommendations and, when we returned, remembering our exact order!   We will be back again and again when in the area."}
{"text":"I like to try Gyros anywhere I go, and the Gyro here was quite possibly the best I've ever had. The meat was juicy but not too salty (too many places go crazy on the salt with Gyro meat) and the pita was fresh yet firm. Their Tzatziki is amazing. My father had a beef kebab and my sister had the vegetarian rice; they both seemed to enjoy it.  For an affordable delicious lunch, you can't pass this up. I know I'll be back for plenty Gyros in the future."}
{"text":"I adore Khyber Halal, it's my new favorite. It's a new experience in a cuisine you may think you already know well. While not Indian, many of the dishes are novel takes on Indian & Middle Eastern dishes you may already know, like curries, kabobs, biryanis & naan. All of the dishes are marked by a fresh & vibrant taste. It really seems like homemade food, not churned out by the pot load. And the owners are very friendly and make for a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was our first time trying afghani food so we tried all the recommended and traditional dishes.  The service was great, didn't know quite what to expect.  We less flavorful than Pakistani or Indian cuisine, and did not like their traditional dumplings.  Felt the rice with raisins and carrots was a bit strange.  Perhaps afghani food is not our thing if this is a representative of great afghani food based on the reviews.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Cliff notes: Pros: -food is served fresh and piping hot.  -restaurant is clean.  -Naans are very tasty. Perfectly toasted.  -portions are large but small on the wallet.  -friendly staff.   Cons: -bit slow on the drink refills.   -place is small so gets crowded quickly.  -can run out of popular desserts quickly."}
{"text":"I do love me some Pakistani/Indian food! Khyber Halal is a spot that i frequent and does not disappoint and its a family run joint, which i enjoy! My favorite dish here is the chicken biryani.  It's a nice blend of spices and they give you plenty of meat. They do seem to use a lot of white meat chicken; however, sometimes i do like the dark meat. If you are craving some decent indian food, i'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome, authentic, and worthwhile your time to appreciate the cuisine of Afghanistan."}
{"text":"This place is so empty to dine-in but one can see many people walking in for to-go orders. I wonder why??  However ,we went here on a Monday evening and found a couple of staff at the counter and all the place is empty. So we ordered some goat biryani ,chicken malai boti , with some chicken karahi for a to-go (initially our plan is to dine-in ,but changed up our mind as it is empty).  Staff are prompt and placed the order and asked us to wait for 15-20 mins. The food is packed very clean and leak safe. Also it is fresh. When it comes to taste, I did not find the boti and karahi that good. They tasted like under seasoned. However the biryani is better in taste.  Over all my experience is for a one time go."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good restaurant. Professional staff, clean restaurant, and inexpensive for the portion size.  I ordered chicken boti and it was good. I prefer less spicy so I did not opt to use the green sauce that comes with it, but still very flavorful! Portion size was more than I need and inexpensive for just $9.95.   The other order was lamb pawloh, and not quite as good. The meat was on the dry side and while the rice was VERY ample in quantity, it was not my husband's favorite and it was $13.00. The humus was great quality, though.  We arrived before the dinner rush hour so seating was not a problem.   I would return and give it another try."}
{"text":"This is seriously a hidden gem.  I mean it's not hidden, its like, right on the front of 24th  st and Indian School by a bus stop, but, I probably would have never given this place a second thought had a coworker not suggested it a while ago.   I find myself obessed with their Chicken Kahari.  It is just so freaking good.  It's like crack. So many complex flavors that I just can't comprehend.  It's under the curry section of their menu, but don't expect the typical creamy coconut based curry that we all know.  It's actually like a puree of tomatoes and a bunch of other awesome shit.  I know I'm not doing this dish justice at all so I'm gonna stop here, but please believe me when I say that you MUST try this dish. ( Get it SPICY)  I also like their Chicken Tika Masala.  It's similar to the Indian version, cubes of chicken breast immersed in delicious sauce, but again, this version is NOT creamy.  It's very dense in spices.  Oh and each entree comes with a huge naan (bread) the size of your face x 2.  And their portions are HUGE.   Service is very friendly and efficient.  What an awesome find in Phoenix, the city of not so awesomeness."}
{"text":"Came here for the mantoo on a recommendation from a co-worker and I left feeling super satisfied and happy to have a new restaurant to add to the rotation near work.  The mantoo dish consists of 12 fairly large dumplings filled with meat, topped with a meat sauce (similar to a Bolognese). At first glance it doesn't look like enough to be a meal, but I was pretty full after finishing the plate and scooping up every last bit. The dumplings have a nice homecooked feel to them, which went well with the politeness of the staff. Food came out fast, and they gave my coworker his order of garlic naan for free because they forgot it until we had finished our food.  Another coworker got the beef shish kabob and said the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly, so I'll definitely be back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. The food was very good. I went for lunch and had the lamb kabob. It's not rivaling the Persian Room on ambience but as far as the food goes, it was good. I'd recommend it to a friend and I'll be back again. In a time where restaurants are overcomplicating menu items with clever flavor profiles I find myself clinging to tried and true classic dishes that leave you satisfied."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience of my life! I ordered the over priced kabob platter to share with a friend. We were both sick to our stomachs for over 24 hours!  The chicken was dry and had a nasty sweet taste. When I called the manager to complain, she had the nerve to tell me I am not American and I have an accent!!!! The nerve!!! The ambience was also poor and small. Very over priced for nasty food. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Every time i come i have the same consistent  service.  Just FANTASTIC!  I ordered a lamb kabob and the Califlower dish.. with of course, garlic Naan.   Just divine!   If you go- please try the Mantoo.  It is one of my favorites and it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on Check Please, Arizona I had to try it!   I never had Afghani food before but love exploring different foods and learning about different cultures.  My husband spent time in Afghanistan and wanted to visit as well.  We went with my son, brother and sis-in-law.  I think we ordered the entire menu and it was all delicious!  I can't even think of one particular dish I would recommend.  We will definitely be back.  I think there may be one or two items on the menu we didn't try."}
{"text":"So, we've been back to Khyber Halal no less than 5 or 6 times since my last review. The food is still fantastic and I have noticed a change in service... for the better! We are quickly seated and the staff recognizes us when we come in, often making suggestions about new dishes or provide a detailed explanation when we inquire. We tried to go a couple of weeks ago but the restaurant was closed due to a funeral :(. If you haven't tried this place already, what are you waiting for??!"}
{"text":"I really, really enjoyed the experience of meeting up with the Phoenix ISC at this place.  It is truly a hole-in-the-wall but they handled our crowd pretty well.  I would have to guess that they have a hard time when faced with large parties but everything came out at roughly the same time and my food was hot when it arrived.  My favorite bite of the night actually came from the Yelper seated across the table from me.  She ordered the mantoo and graciously traded bites with me for some of my kabli pulao.  The mantoo consists of bite and a half sized ground beef and onion dumplings with a meat sauce and a yogurt sauce on top.  I really, really liked the combination of flavors and the presentation was simple yet beautiful.  I would have gladly eaten an entire order!  My entree was a ground beef kebab that was over a foot long and beautifully seared with a really pronounced charcoal flavor.  It came on a bed of Afghani rice which included raisins and carrots.  Savory and well seasoned, it completed the dish.  That said, the beef was a little dry and benefited from the occasional dunking in the yogurt sauce.  I also had a beef samosa that was a steal for a buck.  It came with a sauce that included jalapenos so I had to leave that part of the dish alone.  The others at the table who sampled it had great things to say, including the description of it tasting green.  Plenty of green ingredients and it looked like something I would have enjoyed if it didn't include the one green ingredient I cannot eat.  The samosa itself was just about perfect.  I really liked the addition of several different peppers in the meat mixture both for the flavors they added and the color.  They were fried perfectly and were the right balance between tender and crunchy.  Baklava for dessert, iced tea to drink plus a generous tip and I was still out the door for less than $20.  Thanks again Phoenix for having me at your ISC.  It was a pleasure to meet everyone and I enjoyed the restaurant!"}

{"text":"This was pretty horrible. I ordered chicken tikka masala for take out. I was so excited due to the high marks in prior reviews. It tasted like just hot tomatoes. No flavor at all. Just heat. I would have rather ate a frozen Indian meal. I wouldn't recommend this place....at least their chicken tikka masala."}
{"text":"Simply great food and great people. You do not go to this restaurant for 5 star service and ambiance, but for great food and hospitality with prices you cannot beat. I have found everything is professionally cooked to perfection. I am used to fine dining but am willing to sacrifice all expectations for great food and welcoming hosts."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a Saturday lunch. Had chicken tikka medium. Pretty flavorful. Not as good as Indian buffet but decent. The naan is thick but pretty good. Kids had gyro sandwich split because it's a good long. They do give you a sh*t ton of food. We took a lot of left overs."}
{"text":"Dropped by a week ago to find updated decor, new menus, but the same wonderful attentiveness by the staff.  Did I tell you this is a family operation??  Anyway, the menu items have gone up by a few cents but that should not deter anyone.  This place just can't get anything wrong!  We had the delicious lamb and chicken kabobs, spicy rice and salad.  Just Fabulous.  It's one of those restaurants that just gets better and better.  I don't know how they do it, but they do.   Thanks for the wonderful meals, guys."}
{"text":"Great place to eat on a budget.  Super clean, friendly and delicious!  Try the gyro sandwich, but be sure that you are really hungry!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good. I have never eaten Middle Eastern food before and after this meal I am a fan. The prices are great. Had a party of 4 and ordered the meat platter. It was a ton of food for $20.00. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because their service is really bad. They did not even think to ask to refill our drinks. Once you ask for a refill they do refill your drink. They are not rude or anything, they just are not that concerned about serving you. My favorite meat was Chicken Boti, the workers even said that this is one of their best dishes they make.   If you want to try Middle Eastern food for the first time, this is the place I would recommend. It can be a little intimidating, but focus on the Chicken Boti, order a naan, or Tandoori Paratha and enjoy."}
{"text":"Long delayed review for a lovely family owned establishment. Every single item was delicious and the serving portions were huge. The servers were so attentive and pleasant to our group that it only made the trip worth it. My ever so picky kids are all of their dinner and that's saying something :)"}
{"text":"very friendly staff it feels like we are at a friends house! Unless you are insane stick to medium spicy"}
{"text":"The kabobs were amazing and the goat rice was yummy. The staff is very friendly and the food is delish =)"}
{"text":"2.4 Stars. I love Afghan Food and was really looking forward to eating here. Maybe I got the wrong thing. Got the lamb kabab with rice and salad. Really disappointed in the lack of flavor. The portion was large enough but ended up being 6 pieces of meat and about 2 lbs of rice. I'll give it another chance at some point, hard to find Afghan food in AZ."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Boti, Garlic Nan, Riati sauce, Tzatziki sauce, and baklawa to go.  Chicken Boti consisted of perfectly spiced and marinated chunks of chicken breast served over a non-greasy flavorful basmati rice mixture.    Riati sauce was a cilantro-based lemony garlicky sauce that reminds me of chimichurri sauce.  Tzatziki sauce wa sthinner than expected but necessary to balance the spice and still very good.  Baklawa was juicy and crispy and with a certain strange pice that made it better than usual.  Service was awesome, the owners were very patient, helpful and descriptive since I have never had this type of cuisine before.   Got a question, just ask them, they wer every nice.  A quick 10 minutes after ordering, my food was ready to go.  Since everything was so tasty, I can't wait to go back and keep trying the different things on their long menu!  I am a sucker for meat grilled to perfection which is what they served to me here."}
{"text":"Went with the family. Great place if you want a very casual night out for good food. We all enjoyed our meal and had plenty of leftovers to go. We started with samosas. Then had mixed grill, chicken tikka, Uzbek pulaw, spinach, hummus and naan. There were 4 of us . The staff was lovely and took the time to answer any questions. I am planning my next visit already."}
{"text":"We had the tikki masala and plain naan. The naan was very dry but good when we dipped it into the masala sauce. The masala itself was good but the chicken chunks were a little dry so i mostly ate the sauce with the naan. Decent food and willing to try the Afghan and Pakistani side of the food."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  The food it's delicious!!  The lamb its my favorite dish. The portions are great and its really affordable!"}
{"text":"First time guest. Companion and I both had the chicken boti. Seven large chunks of white meat chicken, with a wonderful spice. Literally, served on top of a mountain of basmati rice, and diced tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers. Absolutely delicious. Service was exemplary. If you want ambiance, and expensive art décor, then go to Scottsdale. If you want delicious food at an incredibly reasonable price, then dine here."}
{"text":"Recommended by my Afghan friends, consistently delicious, friendly staff, quiet enough to have a conversation, and good prices. I love everything about this place. My only wish is that they'd be open on Sundays!  My recommendations: Chicken Karahi (THE BEST comfort food), Mantoo, and Kabli Pulau (order two skewers of meat per the one plate of rice--that gives you a better meat:rice ratio). Also, the green chatni is good on everything. My dad actually drank it straight from the little plastic cup...."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place by friends from Pakistan. This is the real deal.  Didn't think anyone could beat my \"old\" fav place in Vegas but, Khyber Halal has. If I could go there everyday and order something different I would. Have not had an unlikable meal there yet. Very traditional menu, lucky my friend Hesham could help me choose. Friendly staff and luck enough to meet the women in charge of all the cooking. YUM, YUM"}
{"text":"I have been to Khyber Halal a few times and have always enjoyed the food. The mantoo (sort of like spicy beef raviolis with yogurt sauce) is awesome. However, they say they close at 8:30, so we got there at 7:55 and they said all they're doing is takeout now. If you're not seating past 8, say you close at 8 and then we wouldn't have wasted our time going way out of the way to go there or we'd have planned to arrive earlier. Ended up going to Tahoora grill nearby which serves Afghani/Pakistani food and was pretty good."}
{"text":"I'm trying to remember how we heard about this cool Afghan restaurant. Do remember seeing good friend and party queen Irene V in the reviews and had to check them out.  Inside is very clean and the decor is casual and fun. This is a nice family owned restaurant and you can feel that vibe right away. The kids work the front part of the restaurant and Mom does her magic in the kitchen.  Started off with some Chicken and Beef Samosas and went with the famous Chicken Tikka Masala extra spicy. It was delicious and had plenty of tasty flavors bursting in my mouth. The heat level was very high and perfect for my taste buds. Nice!  Came back again and ordered the Kabli Pulao (Kofta) plate. Again the portion size and the flavors were exceptional and even had some left to bring home. Really love the way she makes the rice with the raisins and carrots in the dish. Going to have to try and reproduce this bad boy at home.  They have a rather large menu that can accommodate almost any diet or request. Appetizers, Snacks, Kababs, Currys, Wraps, Burgers, and Vegetarian choices if you are in the mood for a meat free meal. They also have a good variety of sweet Desserts to cap off your visit.  Service is friendly and the food is delicious. Can't wait to bring the family back and maybe get me some Goat on my next visit. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. OH YEAH!  5 STARS"}
{"text":"I was greatly disappointed ordering the grilled lamb.  It was dry and tasteless.  The rice was plentiful but also tasteless.  The diced cucumber salad was refreshing.  The atmosphere is depressing, like a cheap diner.  My lunch without a drink was $12."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with a crowd of Yelpers which is guaranteed to be a good time, but one never knows how the food will be. A tiny hole in the wall usually turns out to be the best place to go and this one did not disappoint! We practically took up the whole place but that didn't hinder the service. I tried the Gulpi a Cauliflower dish cooked with a unique blend of spice and seasonings, I'm no vegan but it was the perfect meal for me. But just to get some variety I ordered a chicken samosa, like an empanada but different texture to the dough, another winner! Along with some tips about farmersonly.com fellow yelpers Jennifer and Eirich shared a few tasty bites of their Mantoo dish. It reminded me of beef ravioli, swimming in tomato and drizzled with yogurt sauce. Everything was good, the portions were large and the prices are low!  Another successful adventure with the Supper Club!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is awesome. I always do takeout because I'm not crazy about the atmosphere, but I've never tried anything I don't like. Definitely try it out!!"}
{"text":"Went back on Friday and was disappointed to find they are  closed from 12:30-1:30 on Friday...lunch time  on Friday seems like a super strange time to be closed and I was unable to eat there due to the closure (and I drove out of my way to go there never thinking to call and make sure they would be open at a time that should be the busiest of the day).  I will go again, but I will call before heading out of my way to make sure they are open and I don't waste my time on the drive."}
{"text":"After being stuck in the rural Midwest for two years where food options were extremely limited, this place was a nice find for lunch.    Glad to have my Pakistani/Indian Yelpie friend present to order as I had no idea what to do.  We got chicken karahi, goat biryani, chicken tikka masala, and chickpeas with some naan to share.  Food came out looking looking very homey and overall tasted very good.   The karahi was by far the best - very tender and moist chicken that I mopped up with naan.  Tikka Masala was also tasty and had a nice kick (you can adjust spice levels).  The rice:goat ratio on the biryani was high and while I usually like goat, this was a bit gamey and dry.   Service was slow given there weren't many other diners at the restaurant.  However, portions were huge and very reasonably priced.  Total bill was $44 for 4  and we left stuffed with 4 full boxes of leftovers.   I would come back for more karahi and to try some other dishes. Probably for dinner though as the food is pretty heavy for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm never thinking wow that was amazing food. But I have never had a problem with their service and their food is tasty and satisfying. The workers are nice, the waitress is really pretty, and they always get my order right granted it is always simple. Portion sizes are perfect for my appetite and I really find nothing big to complain about in this restaurant. I often come back whenever I want some ethnic food. I guess one small issue would be that the restaurant does have a lingering smell but it's never too noticeable like at an Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a foody guy and love all kinds of food. I originally come from the background where my mom and wife cooks delicious food at home. After looking at the reviews i decided to try khyber halal restaurant. I ordered nehari and chicken karrhai. Serving was good. Chicken Karrhai was good however Nehari needs to be more thicker. Naan was little over crispy harder to chew. I will try other things next time."}
{"text":"Came in today with my daughter. We both enjoyed our experience. Chicken tikka masala and chicken handi was delicious. Nice and spicy. Hummus was perfect. Coming back soon. Great family run place. Two brothers work up front and are good kids!"}
{"text":"love this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you haven't been here before then you need to go now!!! if you drive passed it you would second guess it like i did but one day my mother brought me some & it was love at first bite haha =) try it"}
{"text":"My family and I came here because my sister-in-law wanted to try it. I'm glad we did.  I think we bought about seven dishes and nine of us were able to share them all.  I definitely would visit again."}
{"text":"Great fresh full of flavor chicken karahi--full order was huge.  Easily a whole chicken in it.  loved the sauce. Great eggplant dish too.  Kids loved the tikka massala. Cheap and tasty. Would come back anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Idk how the hell this place has 4 stars.  **RANT** So, I am from the south. Atlanta, Georgia to be exact. My family is also African and I'm used to food that has seasoning, flavor, taste etc. I have traveled all over the world and tasted a variety of different foods from different countries that were quite exquisite and flavorful. So I decided to try this place on a trip to Arizona and I was extremely disappointed. The bread was dry as hell and tasted a bit sour it was also hard and thick (no resemblance to naan) , the rice had absolutely no flavor, the paneer tikka masala was also bland no seasoning just red sauce and cheese. I don't know if it is because people in Arizona are trapped in a desert and have never tasted real food, but there was nothing delightful or tasty about this restaurant and I do not know who gave these good ratings. Not to come at you Arizona people, but really? This is what y'all think is good food???? Also, The mango lassi tasted like water.  DISGUSTING.   service was questionable as well. Please try to tantalize your taste buds at least once in your life if you actually eat this food and think it's good.  Peace & blessings y'all."}
{"text":"Lots of dishes to choose from. I ordered the chicken kabob and chicken tikka masala spicy. Caution do not order spicy unless you can handle some serious heat. Decent price and good portions. I will visit again, the food was delicious.Next time I'm going to try the Afghani specialty menu."}
{"text":"My friends took me to Khyber Halal around the 1st of March and I've eaten there once a week since my first visit. the food is fantastic. they have a ton of vegetarian dishes which I love and they have plenty of Meat dishes for the meat eaters. Treat yourself to something other than burgers and fries and go eat here!"}
{"text":"Solid. I will definitely be back ... especially for take-out.   And when I order that take-out, let's be honest, I will probably have to order that delicious Mantoo concoction as an \"appetizer\" even though I will be dining alone. I'm really glad that someone made a parody of Taylor Swift's 22 for 30-somethings, because now I don't have to feel bad about choosing take-out over a night on the town. You know, some of us have jobs and responsibilities and just don't want to put on spanx at the end of the day. We want to put on yoga pants and eat Chinese food ... or in this case Afghani.   So, in conclusion, if you are looking for some tasty meat, why not try Khyber Halal? It's available whenever a craving strikes and you don't have to get dressed up for it."}
{"text":"The food menu for Khaybar requires updating. The service is cordial but is being handled by the business owners high school sons. We applaud any business that teaches business acumen to the next generation. The selection was limited for fish dishes, out of shrimp, dishes discontinued, etc.  We opted for the fried tilapia. The fried tilapia was seasoned and cooked very well. We don't process professional palates so it doesn't require a five star zagats resort critique. We were the only customers in the restaurant and the sons allowed us to enjoy our meal and checked on our needs. (We have to confess we did ask the high school tech savvy youngster to review the Yelp reviews before ordering)  Our food companion ordered the lamb dish and from my observation it had to be great. I was the only one talking. A rare first. If you decide to partake in some authentic Afghani cuisine this is the spot. The son's speak Farsi (Persian, Iran's state language). Read a review where someone said Pakistani/Indian cuisine. Doesn't really matter the meals were good."}
{"text":"We r from chicago and came to khyber halal after reading positive reviews on yelp. The restaurant is charming, quaint, and well - decorated with authentic afghani decor and pieces, also very clean. The owner/head chef Fahima greeted us and was our server. She was incredibly pleasant and gave us great recommendations. She discussed that she tries to use organic ingredients and tries to make dishes healthy for her customers. All of her meat entrees are halal.  Our first visit we had beef samosa and shami kabob for appetizers. Each came with fresh green chutney and tasted as if she had just freshly hand made the dough, meat, and chutney. We ate afghani dishes including kabli pulao and uzbek pulao, both spectacular. The helpings of rice are heaping, and you'll definitely have leftovers. Thr prices are very reasonable.  Since our visit, my family reminisced about the delicious taste of her food every meal in phoenix, nothing compared. We came back and tried her pakistani dishes, equally delicious! Her naan is so plump and tastes made in a tandoor.  This place is always crowded and filled with a diverse crowd.  Mango lassi is perfect after a morning hike. Dessert including phirni and baklawa taste homemade.  We will probably b back again during our vacation, but wanted to post this since I am truly in love with this place. The owner Fahima is incredibly talented and will probably b known as a great chef in the near future.    If you are in phoenix, definitely visit this place, your taste buds will not forget it!"}
{"text":"I was brought here by some friends and have repeated gone back since. I normally get the chicken boti which is a spicy chicken cooked on a kebab. It's pretty fantastic. It's also super reasonably priced. You get an EXTREME amount of food for a decent price. My husband once ordered a chicken curry dish and they asked him full or half. Since he loves leftovers from this place he said full, it looked like it was literally a whole chicken! For like $13! It's amazing food too, that is completely unique to Phoenix. I know that Afghani food sounds like it might be extreme, but it's really good and not that crazy. I recommend starting with something simple like the Chicken Boti (if you like spicy) or the Chicken Mali Boti (if you don't) and getting crazier from there.  My only disappointment, they almost always sell out of baklava before I can get my hands on it!"}
{"text":"Loved the lamb shank. The wife got the okra which she also liked. I'm not an okra fan so I'll reserve my option on that."}
{"text":"I arrived at Khyber Halal on a Friday for an early dinner and my first experience with Afghani food.  But to my incredible astonishment, the owner (and coincidentally the first employee I met here) is a former high school classmate of mine.  Bilal Safi and I were not only classmates but also played on our high school basketball and football teams together.  Bilal and his sister Fahima actually co-own this mashup of Afghani, Pakistani, Indian, and even American cuisines (emphasis on the Afghani portion) on the southwest corner of 24th Street & Indian School.  I'd been eyeing this place for a visit for awhile, but now that I knew Bilal's family were running the show, I was pretty excited to give it a go.  The restaurant itself is pretty unassuming but comfortable with seating for maybe 40 inside.  Here you can order food to go up front or grab a seat and a server takes care of you.  Although I've become more knowledgable about food from the Middle East and African regions in recent years, I really had no clue what to expect when it came to Afghani cuisine.  I took a passing glance through Wikipedia to read up a little on Afghani food in advance so I at least had some idea of what to look for.  To start things off I ordered a glass of Dooge.  It's a cold yogurt based drink mixed with chopped up mint leaves.  It's not as thick as yogurt but has a somewhat similar texture.  The mint adds an extra cooling sensation to the tongue.  Flavor-wise its a little unusual, but then again that's why I'm here.  Bilal warned me in advance that the portions here are on the large side so I skipped the appetizer and went straight for Afghani food 101.  The Qabuli Pulaw is apparently widely considered to be the national dish of Afghanistan, so what better place to start?  At the base of the dish is Pulaw rice, which is white rice cooked with meat stock, carrots, raisins, and herbs and I think I even picked up a hint of pistachio.  Next to the rice is a healthy portion of chopped salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, and a little cilantro as well.  Atop the rice, a footlong meat kabob of seasoned ground beef.  The dish bears a resemblance to similar kabob dishes I've had various Middle Eastern restaurants, but the rice here stands out on its own.  I think its the raisins that really make this dish stand out, adding a subtle and pleasant fruity component.  Coupled with the salad and meat, the Qabuli Pulaw is a solid dish and a great gateway dish for those unsure as to whether they'd really enjoy Afghani food.  If you need a starting point, start with this dish.  Having enough room for dessert, I decided to try the Rusmalai.  I'd read up a little on this dish and ordered it mainly because of how unusual it sounded.  Basically its flatted balls of cheese curd soaked in cow's milk cream, and flavored with cardamom.  From there the flattened balls are cooked in milk, sugar, and rice pudding.  Here they come two flattened balls to an order, still doused with cream.  How to describe this.  Its a sort of sweet spongey, chunky, chewy, dairy bomb.  I actually really liked the cream in this dish, though the texture was certainly a new one on me.  Total cost for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to about $23.  I will say I'm still processing some of the experience as both the Dooge and the Rusmalai were completely new to me.  But the Qubuli Pulaw was an absolutely excellent main course.  Along with Afghani specials here, you'll find several other rice dishes along with curries, kabobs as well as some wraps and fried fish options.  There really are a lot of ways to branch out here while still eating something inherently comfortable and familiar.  Or you can go way outside the box on certain items as I did.  Bilal and Fahima delivered an interesting and tasty meal for me to try this go around, and I suspect they will next time too.  Great to see a fellow Central Bobcat giving the community a great go to spot.  Even if its origins are halfway around the globe."}
{"text":"This palce is awesome. Enjoyed it more then i have in the past. You need to try this spot for some quick casual eats, They now have a blog soit where you can read all the descriptions of the food. I foregt what I order bu it comes on a huge mound of brown jasmine rice and the most fkavorful shisk kebab like chicken. I am a huge fan and it' right in my hood,"}
{"text":"The food is very good!  I suggest you take it to go. I had to ask for tea and boxes for the food. The server hung out behind the register texting. Really? Do you expect to be tipped?!?  Definitely take out!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been wanting to try this for a while now since I live close by and glad that I did. We got mantoo which which was beef dumplings with sauce, chicken biryani, and a mix platter that had both chicken and beef kabob and top of rice. The chicken biryani we got it spicy and it did not disappoint. It had a very nice kick to it. We also got garlic bread naan which we could've done without. Nothing really special about it and wouldn't really get it again. Everything was yummy and the staff was nice. I would come again and try more of their specialty food."}
{"text":"I love this place! I crave their naan bread like no other! The taziki and samosas are amazing too. Take out is quick and servings are generous."}
{"text":"Oh my, could there be Afghan grandma's in the back cooking up all that food? Home-cooking ain't got nothing on this place... unless the cook(s) here are in your home kitchen.  We had a table for 7 and everyone was beyond satisfied. Kabobs, fried fish, veggies and more were had by all. Recommend the Uzbeki Pulao *wink, wink*  Came here visiting family, and so sad that we're not in the state regularly enough to be their sole source of income lol"}
{"text":"Food taste great comes in big portions. The price is really reasonable too. I have been here over 5 times."}
{"text":"Mutton Karahi or Goat Curry was awesome and different. Not sure what it was exactly called. Their Kebabs and Tikkas were delicious. Nihari was good too. Chicken Tikka Masala was a little too salty.  A great joint offering a variety of food. Clean and family friendly. A must eat Halal option in Phoenix, AZ."}
{"text":"Another attempt to pick up food from this place and the hours on the sign outside are not accurate. Pulled up at 5:40pm and the door was locked despite it stating that it would be open for take out only. Of course they were in the restaurant and let someone else in that apparently called in their order. Why type up a sign with special hours m, post it on the door and then not be open during the hours?!I really don't understand why they can't post an factual sign with the correct hours!  Nonetheless, Happy Ramadan."}
{"text":"We went out last night to the movies, and with an hour and a half to spare, we thought we had time to stop at this newish restaurant on the corner of Indian School and 24th St. It was a family owned place, baby in bassinet by the cashier, and absolutely no explanations of what the food is. Just strange names. We ordered and sat down. 35-40 minutes later, we realized the food still hadn't come and we'd never make it out to Scottsdale for our movie. So, disappointed, we took the food when it finally came and brought it home and ordered something up on Amazon. When I dove into the \"to go\" boxes, I stopped complaining. Man, that food was delicious. I ordered the Chicken Tikka, only because I pretty much knew what it would be, and it far beat my expectations. Our Chicken Kabab (ordered again because we knew what it would be) was delicious as well. To the owners, thank you for being here. We'll be back. Please develop something that describes the food, and make a non-egg version of the Naan bread please! Lots of vegans and allergies out there who don't expect food from  your region to have heavy eggs included. Readers, as long as you set your expectations correctly about time for food preparation, you'll be very happy with Khyber Halal. Get in there and support this neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"So far this place is living up to it's other reviews! I tried the Mantoo based on another Yelp recommendation and it is comfort food in a foreign dish. So rich and delicious! The naan is really great too, crispier than what I'm used to getting at Indian food places...but this place isn't Indian. This is my first experience with Afghanistan cuisine. Thank you Yelp for letting us in on this gem!"}
{"text":"This place has some seriously delicious food, but the service isn't going to wow you (I suggest take-out if you're wary). And, now that you've been warned, on to the deliciousness!  I shared veggie kabob and rice, beef egg rolls, and chicken tikka masala. I'm happy to say that you get a ton of food with your order! The veggie kabobs were served on a huge bed of rice, and they were super fresh and flavorful. They're simple, but great! The egg rolls, which are only $0.99 a pop, were also very tasty, albeit a little greasy (they're deep-fried egg rolls though). I also can't forget to mention that the egg rolls come with a great spicy sauce!   And then there was chicken tikka masala... At $10.99 it's not the cheapest thing on the menu, but DAMN! It was sincerely some of the best chicken tikka masala that I've had in the valley (almost inching out one of my favorites at Z-Grill). They served it with an enormous piece of house-made naan. The masala was perfectly balanced in spiciness and thickness, and the chicken was cooked just right! Masala lovers from all over should try it!  I welcome Khyber Halal with open arms into the neighborhood! I'm always a fan of a new flavor in the area, and I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The food is plentiful and delicious at Khyber Halal.  The menu is dominated by lamb dishes.  The walls are  covered with hangings from Afghanistan and guests sit on pillows at short tables.  It is quite charming and I liked it a lot.  My only regret is that I live pretty far from Khyber Halal so cannot get here too often."}
{"text":"If you have been reading reviews about how spicy their food is, prepare to be underwhelmed. But, it could just be because I am used to eating a lot of hot spices.  Beyond that, their service is great! In my opinion Their Chicken tikka masala is about good and flavorful but nothing to write home about. Their biryani is okay. It seemed to lack consistency in flavor between the chicken and the rice. The owner asked me how spicy I wanted it. I told them as hot as they can make it. She asked if I was sure and I said aboseffilutely! I was extremely disappointed when I didn't even break a sweat :(  Their Nihari however is a completely different story. How different you say..? Well, it is downright top notch! Spicy, tons of flavor and all around consistency in thickness. If you are in the Phoenix area and grew up in the subcontinent eating nihair then let me tell you that the next place to get it would be your grandma's dusty old kitchen back home. I have not had it this good even in Houston, Dallas or the desi infused parts of California. I triple highly recommend it!  For dessert I saw that they had gulab jamun on the menu. People who know me and my bloating love handles know how I cannot ever pass these things up. I asked the waitress if she recommended it and she said no. Being the stubborn bastard I am I ordered it any way. Boy was she ever right. Their Firni is much better and I'd go for that in a heartbeat if I were you."}
{"text":"Great price - Excellent service.  The food is very delicious. Naan are very good with curry."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. The chicken boti, and mantoo were delicious!  The eggplant dish was really good as well. The place is simple, clean and the service was good. Our bill was $29!  Talk about an amazing deal. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gross food.  Tastes like they dig around in the dumpsters of other restaurants to create their menu.  I was so disappointed in all the choices we made."}
{"text":"Decent food. The naan was good but the chicken tikka masala lacked flavor. Portions are huge, tikka masala order can feed two. And kind of pricey for the taste. Overall it was just okay, not the best Indian food I've had."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I went here with my boyfriend a few years back and recalled it fondly. Recently visited again and it is still just as good.   The staff is very welcoming and friendly.  In addition to that service is very fast.   I personally recommend sharing a plate ( we usually get a curry) and each person getting their own naan unless you really want leftovers. The chicken handi is delicious and the naan is to die for."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from my friend whose a big fan of this place and boy was she spot on! My friend and I decided to share an order of the lamb shank, sabzi (spinach) and badanjan (eggplant). When it came out it was more than enough for 2 people (more like 3+ people). The lamb shank was a decent portion topped on a bed of fluffy basmati rice that had shredded carrots and raisins with a side of cucumber salad. The lamb was moist and flavorful. The sabzi was nice and creamy with just the right amount of spices and the badanjan  was cooked until it was soft with just a little kick to the taste. The entree came with a plentiful helping of  naan as well. We had to box most if it to go since there was so much food. I also ordered a mango lassi, it was good but I've had better. I think I'll get the Chai next time since my friend said it was really good."}
{"text":"This is one place that i have been visiting last 2.5 years and here is my feedback 1.taste remains consistent forever. 2.Respectful cook 3.Wonderful Baklava for 0.99 4.Facility is clean  5. Location and ambience is ok.... but the food taste compromises for good reasons.  Highly recommend.   Only recommendation to the management is to  1. Extend hours of business is required. You do not let customers to dine in after 8 PM....though you are open until 9 PM.... I have driven a couple of times so far thinking you close at 9 but you refused to dine in.... ended up little frustrated.... I am sure am not the only one who wod have experienced this....."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I ordered the chicken boti and lamb skewers for my husband. The food was good, and plenty of it, but not flavor city. Unfortunately for the us the food did not live up to the hype. The samosas were the BEST part of the meal."}
{"text":"This place is down the street from my work, so we stopped here for dinner one evening after work. There's an Afghan restaurant close to my house I really liked so I was trying to see if this place could top them.   We ordered the mixed grill platter ($24.99) with a mixture of several kabobs to try. It came with chicken, beef, and lamb. I really enjoyed the chicken. It was moist and flavorful. The beef and lamb were okay, nothing remarkable. The platter came with rice, salad (similar to pico de gallo) and yogurt sauce.   The platter was huge, enough food for 3-4 people, so we definitely had leftovers to take home. At $24.99, it was a great value for what you get. I would visit again but it is not something I would drive out of my way for."}
{"text":"We loved the food and a quick and polite service at the Khyber Halal, definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Unique, disticnt and literly colorful flavors can be found here at quite reasonable prices.  There are several veg options here including the Gulpi. Coliflour with a tumeric and other spices sauce which was just beyond wonderful. It left my foung dancing and my fingers yellow from all of the flavor. It is serverd with their \"naan\" bread which is much more like a thick tandoor bread.  This was just a quick take out order and I am excited to try everything they have to offer."}
{"text":"I just ate there for the first time and I must say it was amazing!  The food is fresh and I can't wait to go back and try something new on the menu.  I had a mango yogurt drink and started with one beef samosa and one veggie samosa, both were wonderful, then we each had an entre and both entres were amazing and big enough to share or take home.  I just finished my left overs from eating there last night.  The atmosphere was casual and comfortable.  I would feel comfortable eating there by myself or with a friend.  I will definitely be back and my boyfriend has been talking about the food since we left there last night."}
{"text":"This is our household's very favorite restaurant. It's a little out of the way for us, but we always have an incredible meal with leftovers for days and days.   Portions are fairly gigantic and quite reasonably priced - especially delicious baklava for $1, which I've /never/ seen cheaper. In particular, the lamb kebob, the mantoo, and the gyros are favorites.  The woman who always waits on us works really hard, and she's always so nice. We were just there for a birthday, and she noticed that I didn't order anything besides a soda. I explained to her that I was quite broke, and she surprised me by bringing me a gyro on the house, which she remembered me getting last time and loving. This was more than a month ago! I nearly cried.   That being said, don't go in and try and get a free meal! It was just a really cool thing that she didn't have to do.  Anyway, this is the best Afghani/Pakistani food around. The only thing that could make it better would be to pick it up and put it right next to our apartment - but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I've loved everything I've gotten here.  Just tried the lamb kabab and it was amazing!  Not gamey just delicious.  I normally order the chicken boti and upgrade the rice to Kablli rice which is a must!   Also try the mantoo!   Succulent little beef dumplings with yogurt sauce  sooo good!!  Oh and samosas are great too.  GO HERE!! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My co worker and I eat here at least two times per week! Love everything I've ever tried. My favorite is the Chicken Boti."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS FOOD! Quick, clean! Great portions! Kebabs are outstanding and so are the appetizers! Rice is fragrant and comes with all the kebabs...."}
{"text":"Amazing Pakistai/afghan food. Best I've had in the valley. Family run with very nice owners. Chicken tikka masala, goat karahi, and beef Bihari are my favs"}
{"text":"I just visited Khyber Halal. The food was great, the price is right and the portion sizes were a little larger than necessary. The service was pretty slow though. I think we waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order and we had to ask for our check. Plan your lunch or dinner date accordingly and I think you will be happy. I am going to be bold and say, this is the best Afgan food in Phx."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Hands-down! Which brings me much sadness to have to give them a one star review. I have tried to come here four times since my first experience and every single time they have closed at least 20 minutes prior to the closing time time posted in the door! I am currently sitting here right now staring at one of the employees standing inside the restaurant, it's 835 and they close at nine and the door is locked. Also they do not answer their phone so you can make that impossible to place a pick up order or to go. Great food but horrible at caring about their customers. Don't print hours if you don't intend to keep to them !!!!!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken kabob that came with rice and a tiny portion of their salad. I felt like it was a decent price for the serving, but it took a long time to make my carry out order. The chicken was tender but not super flavorful. I think I was expecting more."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!   Sketchy from the outside but perfectly fine and nicer than expected inside.  The staff was great, and my lunch was awesome (and soo much to eat!!).  I've been twice and will go back again."}
{"text":"This gem is tucked away amongst a few random shops. The food is amazing - don't let the outside fool you. I felt like I was in someone's home and the tradition of recipes had been handed down from one generation to another making each meal so flavorful. Their samosas were some of the best I've had anywhere! The eggplant amazing, the palaak paneer wonderful, I can't wait to being friends here!"}
{"text":"Hugh amount of very tasty food for the dollar. Boti chicken kabob is my favorite along with the samosas. The mango yogurt drink is great! The two side dishes of spinach and cauliflower have wonderful seasonings."}
{"text":"The Good: Decently priced and huge portions.  My boti chicken kabob had a nice flavor, with the cucumber salad.  The yogurt sauce was passable.  The Bad and the Ugly: The Saag Paneer was DISGUSTING.  It was bland as hell.  I had one spoonful and tossed it.  And their Goat Karahi, which is a dish that is close to my heart, was DISGUSTING and watery.  How does karahi get that watery?  It actually looked weird.  It did not taste like it was cooked in a wok, the spices and tomatoes were not cooked down at all, and there was an inch layer of fake ghee on top.   And when I asked for it to be spicy, someone just dumped pickled jalapeños in the dish---which made it look less like a karahi.  And I love goat meat but this tasted so gamey and it really looked unappealing, I also threw away 90% of this dish.  And the naan, as someone else said, was thick and spongy, with a yeasty after taste.  I hated it.  Everything was $34 and I threw away practically all of it --- it was nasty to me.  The kabob (and me being a huge softy) saved it from being a one star experience."}
{"text":"Amazing. Everything we had had its on distinct flavor.  All the meat dishes were great, not fatty, very lean. We will definitely  return many times!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with lots of variety! The location is sort of tucked in the corner off of major street but you can't miss the sign. They truly have excellent fast service and their items are absolutely made fresh."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with chicken curry and chicken Boti.  Ordered medium spicy on the curry and it had a pretty good kick. Portions are big. Nan is thicker than what I'm used to."}
{"text":"We live just down the road and having seen this place for over two years we decided to finally get some takeout there. The menu is very interesting it's not your average Afghani kebab place it's more traditional food we decided instead of ordering dinners to just order à la cart off the menu which you can do. We ordered chicken kebab, lamb, Cream spinach, cauliflower, A third vegetable dish which I can't recall and some pita. The food was all very well prepared and tasted good. The vegetable dishes come out very soft so if you're looking for al dente cooked veg this is not the restaurant for you however you can also get salads. It took a fair amount of time to put ours together as I walked in off the street so I would recommend calling ahead. All-around we really did enjoy the food and would likely get take out there again you can eat in but we prefer to take out on weekdays and if we go out to restaurants on weekends we probably go somewhere else with a little more ambience. But if you're into afghani food you should definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I usually go here when Biaz is not available. And I would usually go to fattoush also before I go here. But fattoush made me sick once and that was it. This place is family owned and operated. The meat and bread are good but the rice is not. It tastes weird. Also your meal does not come with pita bread or hummus. They have no middle eastern sodas or gourmet sodas, just Pepsi products. The Mother who is the cook is the only nice person there. The younger boys will treat you funny if you are not middle eastern. And don't expect a damn thing from the younger women working there. I don't feel to much racial tension here vs other places. But as an African women I do know they can be more respectful. The Baklava was soggy this time."}
{"text":"First of all, this is an Afghani/Pakistani restaurant. Its the only decent Pakistani food Ive had in the valley. Their beef shish kababs are great. Nihari is also very good. As for their Afghani items, the Bolani and Mantoo are amazing. Its a very spartan restaurant in a less than spectacular strip mall. The owner and his family are very welcoming.   This is as close as it gets to authentic Pakistani/Afghani food in the valley. So dont go there if you're seeking ambience!"}
{"text":"worst service! i ordered okra curry and the lady said they are out. she handed me the menu and never came back for 25 minute. I had to go to them to order. now the 2nd lady i went to was pretty rude and loud. whatever i asked , they were out. she seems pretty mad !   i ended up eating nothing. my husband had chicken karahi though. once you sit they dont give a crap. they are busy with all takeout orders."}
{"text":"The Curry's are very flavorful, but the homeless chicken is dry more often than not. The naan is absolutely delicious. The lamb kabobs are tender and flavorful. There Afghani rice is super. The raisins and carrots really make it pop."}
{"text":"Been in kabul know what good stuff is and hands down this best Afghanistan dishes in Phoenix. Lamb shank is to savor with carrots raisins, chicken boti and amazing garlic bread. No mud hut bread with goat smell but it's great to compliment dishes. Best Phoenix secret for Afghan food!"}
{"text":"The chicken Boti is my favorite!! Only time I have ever had afghani food and it's GREAT. It's close to my work so I come in multiple times a month . Love the staff as well"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, heaping portions and cheap.  Wanted to try something a bit different and this place hit the spot.  We had the chicken karahi (sadly, they were out of goat)...aka, the chicken curry... and mantoo.  The former came with big, thick naan bread that was a bit heartier than what I've seen in Indian restaurants.  The latter is like a ground beef ravioli with middle eastern spice and yogurt drizzled on top.  Both were great, and we've earmarked a couple additional menu items should we have the opportunity to return.  I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Kabobs were very good. Rice with raisins was sweet. The mantoo is excellent. We  will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. My go-to is the paneer tikka masala, which is more aromatic and tomato-y than the sweet stuff you get from frozen dinners or at Indian places. Also, I love eating vegetarian as much as possible. When I'm craving the good stuff and am willing to sacrifice innocent animals for the purpose, I go for the goat biryani. Guessing by how frequently the place is packed with people, these dishes are perfectly representative. I also recommend the hummus appetizer if you're looking for some tasty to go with your numnum.  The big warning to take in if you go to this place is that if you aren't a leftovers person or won't be able to pack leftovers, you should really plan on sharing a meal. I tend to go here and eat until it hurts and still have enough for lunch the next day. I like to go and split an appetizer and plate with a friend, and I always leave more than full.  Last note, the service here is wonderful. The owners run the shop themselves and are very friendly and appreciative of your business. They get busy, so it might take a moment or a friendly ask, but the staff is so responsive. If you love experiencing the world's cuisines and have some time in Phoenix, I would highly recommend Khyber Halal."}
{"text":"Here it is...my 100th review...and I don't have a speech prepared...oh well, here goes!  Go here (http://khyberhalal.blogspot.com/) to see pictures and descriptions of the food on their menu. It is very accurate. Although the Mantoo picture doesn't really emphasize that it is 12 pieces of deliciousness...  THIS PLACE IS FRICKING AMAZING, the service was excellent as well as friendly and it smells simply divine.  After several months of saying 'we need to stop at this place one day' we finally made it there last night for take-out. We ordered the following:  1) Chicken Karahi...MMMmmm MMMMmmm! We got an order of basmati rice and the flavors of this bone-in (but cut into manageable pieces) was fantastic. Never had anything like it, but it was awesome. I woke up this morning wanting more...but there was none.  2) Mantoo...this was possibly the star of an all-star show. We decided that they reminded us of dumplings or of non-fried crab rangoon, only filled with ground beef, seasonings and topped with one (technically two?) of the most delightful sauces ever.   3) Chicken Tikka Masala - I chose medium spicy this time...you know I HAD to have it. And it was delicious. (We also had the basmati rice with this one because it's a saucy dish and that's how I like it...if you ask nicely, they may let you substitute the naan that it comes with for rice instead)  4) Beef samosas AND Chicken samosas...both were fantastic, but I think I loved the beef one just a *little* bit more. The seasoning was superb. We also dipped it into the sauce that came with the mantoo...OMFG...wow.   5) Garlic naan...I've never met a garlic naan that I didn't like.  6) Baklawa (aka baklava)...one of the best I've ever had. Nutty and honey-ey...mmmm...  We're actually planning on going back again tomorrow night so I can try the okra bamya and the eggplant banjan and see what that bolanee/aloo paratha is all about."}
{"text":"My nephew brought me to this place and i will definitely be back.  The service is really good. The taste is fabulous and the servings are huge.  Had to take most of it Hine.  Thanks for bringing me here Eli"}
{"text":"Amazing sweet staff, waitress was friendly and helpful, amazing bread the taziki sauce is to die for the dish my fiancé and I had was delicious and they give you plenty of food. Cozy little spot, always nice to have culture in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Am a snowbird from MN, and this is really the only Phoenix place I crave while I'm back in Minnesota. I generally order take-out and can't get enough of the spicy chicken tikka masala. Otherwise,  I really enjoy the mantoo, boti, or the handi. It's great to order with a group and share dishes. Thanks for the wonderful food and great service!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch after a good hike! Good food and the chicken was amazing! Great customer service! Defiantly making my way back!"}
{"text":"The worst food and Serivce I don't know how they get great reviews maybe they pay yelp for it!! We ordered food for carry out chicken kabob flavorless and dry please avoid this place!!!!"}
{"text":"The Khyber Halal restaurant may be small, but it is mighty in flavorful dishes. My friend, a local physician, introduced me to Khyber Halal. She eats there often and now I know why. The meat and the vegetable dishes are very tasty. I especially like the Chicken Handi, the Sabzi (spinach) and the Bandanjan (eggplant). Kabli, the Afghani rice, is made with raisins and carrots (delicious) and the rice pudding is so creamy (oh my!!!). The portions are huge. I am an enthusiastic fan; so much so that I just had Khyber cater our party for 75 friends. Everyone (true foodies) loved the food. Their catering service is very professional and reasonable. This ethnic restaurant is a jewel in the desert."}
{"text":"Good food, great service in an unassuming ambiance.  Chicken tiki marsala was very tasty, as was the naan bread.     Prices are very affordable; restaurant is family friendly."}
{"text":"I agree with an earlier post the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the restaurant is clean. Not fancy, but very clean. The food was too dry for me."}
{"text":"I was in the area so I looked up the place on yelp. I was looking for afghan food. The place did not disappoint.   Low prices good quantity friendly staff clean place  Please try the Nihari, it's to die for. Remember it is spicy!!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I saw the reviews of this place and planed a day to drive to this place to pick up food! We are foodies and love finding new and local places to return over and over again. I am sad to report that this is not a place we will be returning to again. The food is just A-OK. As one of my co-workers stated, it was just plain spicy but the flavors or lack there of leave much to be desired. The portions where huge, I give them that, but we each paid about $17 bucks for an order of flavorless chicken tikka masala  and vegetable byriany. We just expected the food to be homey, aromatic, and flavorful and sadly we did not find any of that in the food we received."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this place. The beef dumplings are amazing! I wish I lived closer so I could go more often."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, authentic tastes, the chai transported me back to my time in Somaliland. I really enjoyed the  Usbek Pulaw( seasoned lamb cooked on skewers and served on a bed of Afghan rice(basmati rice mixed with grated carrot, raisins and little chunks of meat) accompanied by a cucumber salad. For desert I had the Gulab Jaman. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to eat genuine Afghan food and does not care about the setting"}
{"text":"My first YELP UYE activity. Nice selection of Mediterranean dishes on the menu including curries and kabobs. I had the chicken tikki masala which is a chicken curry dish. You can request mild, medium or spicy. I ordered spicy and it was served at about what I would rate as medium spicy and it was very tasty.  Very generous portions and inexpensive. Not a large selection of drinks. Only three dessert selections but they were all excellent. There were twelve or so people in our party and service was satisfactory. They also had no problem dealing with separate checks. This restaurant is located in a strip mall and there didn't appear to be any parking problems. I will return to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Kababs were good, biryani was fresh and the mango lassi was just right. Will be coming back again to try different food."}
{"text":"Really good food.  The best Gyro in the valley and it is huge!  They also have very good simosas.  Be sure to try some of the Afghani dishes too, like the Mantoo, which is kind of like a spicy ravioli with a twist of yogurt.  I have never had a bad tasting dish here and tried a lot of things, my only complaint and thing that would keep me from rating this 5 stars is the fact that I have received cold food on a couple of occasions and on a couple of occasions my simosas were partially frozen in the middle."}
{"text":"I will start with the positives: the staff is exceedingly friendly and attentive, the restrooms are clean, and the restaurant is clean.  Now with the negatives: the food. I have eaten Indian food all over the country (San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Baltimore, New York, Washington, the list goes on). I LOVE Indian food. If I had to choose a dying meal, it would be paneer masala with naan and basmati.  This restaurant served literally the least authentic Indian food I have ever eaten. They tried, but it is painfully Americanized, and I should have known based on the \"whitebread\" patrons here. They even serve hamburgers???  They did not serve basmati, instead it was just long grain white or brown rice, and very little seasoning. Their naan tasted like cheap, reheated, store bought pita bread, their sauces/curries were bland and lacking dimension, and the rest of their fare was the most average food I have ever had.  I tried this place because two other restaurants closer to me had a whole star less than this place (including the place recommended below), so I thought... It MUST be better. I was wrong.  If you want authentic Indian food I recommend New Indian Bazaar on 7th Street."}
{"text":"We are visiting Phoenix with my family.We were searching for Halal food in yelp and Zabihah and found Khyber .the food was delicious .we ordered Uzbek Pilouo it wasn't original Uzbek Pilouo but it was delicious. It's clean and nice for dinning."}
{"text":"We've been going to \"Khyber halal\" from long time and have had exceptional good meals every time. Although small, the restaurant is reasonably attractive with some wall decoration. If you like authentic afghan style food I would highly recommend this place. The prices are reasonable and every curry comes with 4 pieces of naan . I and my husband like panner tikka masala it is our fav dish here. Recently we visited this restaurant again and thought to try samosas as appetizer for the first time but unfortunately it was horrible. It dint really look like samosa and stuffing was very less and not at all tasty so 4 star is for panner tikka and naan."}
{"text":"I just moved to PHX and kept driving by this place and wondered if it would be good. It sure was! There are few places around the US where I've had this delicious food. The service was good too, and helped me navigate the menu when I had some amateur hour questions."}
{"text":"Khyber Halal is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix! You can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu here. The Chicken & Paneer Tikka Marsala is beyond delicious, some of the best in town in my opinion. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Samosas beef, chicken, & veggie all spectacular! Everything is homemade, and you can tell with every bite you take it's made with a lot of love. Service is always perfect. The family that owns/runs the business are always super kind and welcoming. You can't beat this restaurant."}
{"text":"Santi and I discovered this Afghan restaurant on Yelp and came to visit on several occasions. The horizontal interior was equip with a front counter, overhead menu, good number of tables, moderate lighting, and maps and images of Afghanistan. The atmosphere can be sparse, but still home-like based on previous visits.  The Uzbek Pulaw ($13.99) encompassed one skewer of lamb cubes, cucumber salad, and Afghan rice. The lamb was tasty and nicely seasoned, but was also too small when measured against the Chicken Boti. As a national dish, the Afghan rice came with bits of lamb, shredded carrots, and raisins buried into the rice mixture. We unexpectedly found lamb innards due to its metallic flavor, and the brothy sauce that was used for seasoning had an off-putting profile. Portions were generous, but comparatively, the Chicken Boti was the better choice.  The Chicken Karahi ($12.99) arrived with half of a chicken served in a ginger, jalapeno, tomato sauce, and our choice of Tandoori Chili Naan. The combination of dark and white meat was tender and sensational. The cooked-down flavors of ginger and jalapeno provided the spiciness, and the tomato sauce helped round out the sharp edges. Serving was plentiful. We wished the dish came with more heat and sauce for the rice, but this was our favorite dish at this restaurant.  The Lamb Shank ($12.99) came with one large bulky piece of lamb shank, cucumber salad, and Afghan rice. The lamb was easy to fork off the bones, but there was little seasoning to alter the gaminess. Unlike other Afghan restaurants, the profile of their rice carried a strange oily aftertaste. The cucumber salad was served in room temperature and tasted more like a filler than anything else.  The Chicken Boti ($9.99) came with one skewer of chicken breast marinated with spices. The chicken skewer was sizable, tender, delicious, and nicely seasoned. The sides of cilantro and yogurt sauces were delicious. Interested diners should note that the regular basmati rice was the better option when compared to the Afghan rice that tend to overwhelm the flavor of the skewers.   The Tandoori Chili Naan ($2.99) came with large pieces covered with cilantro and jalapeno. The spicy tandoori flavors were captivating to couple with the delightful thick and crispy textures. There was a resounding crunch in every bite.   The location in the strip mall provided ample parking. Interested diners should expect large portions, reasonable prices, home-like atmosphere, and down-to-earth customer service. Despite shortcomings, there are still plenty to look forward to on their menu. I would be  returning to try the Goat Karachi, Paneer Tikka Masala, Eggplant, Cauliflower, Okra, and Garlic Naan."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Our family really likes the Mantoo and mixed platter.  We have been missing good Afghani food since moving from the bay area and this is a tasty, friendly, and very reasonably priced restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Very pleasant, quick service and nice atmosphere.  The mantoo and samosas were AMAZING!  This is the first restaurant reviewed on Check Please Arizona that we would return to.  Khyber Halal is a definite keeper!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out because it's close to home and was disappointed.  The meat was dry and the service was slow.  The space can use some updating. The staff were friendly and I really wanted to like it because I like the cuisine, however I'm going to check out other places before going back."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped here for a quick lunch. This place serves amazing big portions at reasonable prices. I highly encourage you to try this place out, but come hungry."}
{"text":"AVOID if you do not like getting foul smelling, rotten food.  I really didn't want to leave a negative review but after how I was treated I want to help some people avoid this place. After all I decided to come here based on a quick yelp scan.   My mother ordered a goat stew dish. Before she even bite into it she smelled something funny. She decided to at least give it a try. She could not believe what she tasted. It was very old and rotten (the goat).   I was shocked. I didn't know how to tell the waitress. I decided to politely tell her what had happened to at least warn her that something was wrong with the meat. I went to also grab a plate for my mom to share my food. As I was talking to the waitress, another lady popped up (I'm assuming was the cook). She insisted that it's normal and goat always smelled like that and that my mother must have not had goat before. I told her that she actually has and cooks it at home all the time. I saw she was offended and got awkward so I went back to my table to eat.   When I was paying, I asked if I was going to be charged for the entree my mom didn't eat and that she picked up. She (the cook/manager) said yes you have to pay, then started to attack me. She stated that other people had eaten that same dish earlier and loved it. That we were offending her.  I told her calmly that I didn't mind paying for it. It wasn't a big deal. I was just shocked at her rudeness and lack of customer service.   *funny thing is I told her I found her on yelp and that I would leave my own review. She stated go ahead. I didn't want to, but after what had transpired, this is your WARNING everyone."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this restaurant, though I think I've had their catered food at various events over the years. A group wanted to have lunch here and invited me along and I was able to get to it easily with enough parking.   It's a medium sized spot with a good amount of seating and the decor is a mix of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and America. We were given menus as we arrived and chose our table. The food choices are plentiful and even have some vegetarian options (but only two fish). We mostly ordered waters but they have drinks like mango lassi and chai, black tea and green tea.   Our group of 8 seemed to each pick a different dish. I got the vegetable biryani and the portion size was enough to feed two, or in my case one with ample leftovers. It was the right amount of spice and flavors with a twist of corn added. I really liked it, and the veggie samosa was fine. The chatni (green chili sauce with mint and coriander) and yogurt sauce that come with the dish were tasty accompaniments to my meal. Affordable prices and good food, along with attentive service makes this a great choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My regular lunch time go to spot. Sooooo goood. The chicken tikka masala is on point."}
{"text":"Great food--everything coming out of the kitchen looked like a stock photo!  Beautiful and delicious!   Could probably make the atmosphere more attractive--it's very basic and not much soul.  But the food more than makes up for it, worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Good and quality food. We got some biriyani, chicken tikka masala, spinach, some naan and a mango lassie. Biriyani was pretty good! And the naan were fresh and huge. Very good bread.  However, the chicken tikka masala was not up to my standards. It was still good, but just different than any indian place has to offer. It was not the usual bright orange color, instead it was a darker red or maroon colored.  Overall the food was good. We got our food to go, wan't a long wait. The interior seems very nice. I have to try the kebabs and grilled meat there. This is what they are know for.  I will be going there again soon :)"}
{"text":"Although this restaurant is owned by my cousin and her husband, I have yet to make a visit. I give this place 5 stars because I have tried out numerous dishes cooked by her and have got to say that EVERYTHING i have tasted by her is absolutely exquisite. I do not doubt that the same goes for everything on the menu at this restaurant. I wish I lived in Phoenix so I could've tried some of the delicious dishes at her place, mainly because of my love for afghan food. Yummy Kabuli Pulao."}
{"text":"Best Afgan, Pakistani food and a great value for the price.  The folks that own the place are so very nice. I love the \"green\" cilantro chicken.  Check out the deserts too!  so good!"}
{"text":"I really liked my first time there.  I got the mantoo as an appetizer and the Uzbek pulaw and everything was very fresh and smelled great.  I loved what their style of cooking does with chilies! Green chili Naan! Some kind of delicious green chili sauce with the tsaziki. The staff were friendly. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The area seems a little sketch, but if you're looking for authentic dishes, this place doesn't disappoint.  I got the gyro plate, while my boyfriend got the spicy Goat Biyrani.  The plates were small sized platters, which could easily feed 2 people (we had leftovers for another full meal).  You defintely get your money's worth.   Oh, and as a warning, when they day spicy, guarantee that your nose will be running and you'll be sweating and slightly uncomfortable while eating. But it's a good kind of uncomfortable."}
{"text":"It's far from home, but I always make a point of going here at least once when I'm in town. Very good curries, kebabs and breads. I'm a lamb fan, and they do it well at Khyber Halal. I'd like a spot of good beer to wash it all down, but that's unavailable for obvious reasons. Friendly service."}
{"text":"For me this place was fabulous! I wasn't sure what to expect as far as the people or the food. A small unassuming place in a strip mall, I didn't expect much. Boy was I happily surprised! The waitstaff was pleasent and explained everything.  The food was all delicious. I have been several times since my first. I love the dumplings in yogurt sauce. The samosas are also very good. They have kabobs. Not to mention the prices are very good. As halal is the equivalent to kosher, you know the food is going to be fresh. If you're looking for good food at reasonable prices, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I love visiting independently owned restaurants that offer dishes you don't often find in AZ. Khyber Halal offers Afghan, Indian, and Pakistan cuisine, but I think more focus is on the Afghani items here.   The interior is cozy and homey, with various tables you can sit at. We had our choice of tables in the back for a party of 6. After you order and eat, you pay at the front which makes it easy if you were planning on doing split checks.   I had a mango lassi, and shared the qabuli pulaw (The national dish of Afghanistan) as well as the mantoo dumplings. The mango lassi came out first, and it had more of a sweet mango puree flavor than the tart yogurt flavor I'm used to with Indian style lassi. It was a very generous amount though for $2. It didn't take too long to make our entrees and when all our dishes came out we oohed and ahhhed. They looked so good and with very substantial portions too!   The qabuli pulaw was a footlong slab of ground meat, similar to kofta kebab, with cucumber salad and seasoned rice. All the elements together worked well in harmony. There were also two little sauce bowls with yogurt dip and a spicy green dip to go with it. The rice itself had a beautiful mix of spices, colors, and textures, and I loved the inclusion of soaked raisins in the mix. The cucumber salad was light and refreshing, a good complement to the earthy ground meat.  I also enjoyed the mantoo. It also was beautifully presented, with a thin wonton-like wrapper, ground spiced meat, drizzled with sauce.   I think overall the restaurant is very tidy and well kept. I was sitting against the wall and there was a slightly gross looking food stain on it though so they might want to pay attention to checking cleanliness there.  We had a good time feasting on our dinners and chatting. If I were in the area this would be a great choice for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Great service and the food was good any healthy.  Had the eggplant, which was a bit unfamiliar, but tasty with the naan.  This naan was not the best I've had (a bit more \"hearty\" than I'm used to). The chicken kebab was seasoned really nicely, if a bit overcooked.  Very generous portion of rice. Totally a fan.  I'd come back again next time I'm nearby and try something else and probably up this rating to 5-stars."}
{"text":"Great Afghan food, great service, family run restaurant. One of the reason why I feel sad about moving out of the PHX area. My personal favorites are the Chicken Karahi, the Goat Karahi, and the Lamb Shank. Also a big thanks to this place for introducing me to the Baklava!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean cuisine is one of my favorites, so I was really looking forward to a great meal from Khyber Halal. I really wanted to like this place, based on all my fellow Yelpers' reviews, but, in my opinion, it just wasn't up to snuff.   I checked them out on a Friday night after work, looking to grab a few items to go. After entering the hole-in-the-wall location (which I love, by the way), I was greeted from behind the counter by an older gentlemen and a few teenagers. You could tell this was truly a family run operation.  After perusing the menu for a bit, I asked for a few recommendations. I'm a pretty adventurous eater, so I told them to throw the best of the bunch at me. He suggested the Uzbak Pulao, which was grilled lamb on top of a rice mixture (carrots, currants, and bits of meat...I'm assuming it was lamb or goat). My husband ordered the Chicken Handi, which was grilled chicken with a spicy rub over rice (nothing fancy here).  We also ordered Naan and a side of hummus.  We got home and dove into our meals, which by the way, was enough to feed a family of four, if not six. My lamb was chewy (I ordered it medium rare) with very little flavor, and the rice mixture was bland and oily (probably from all the meat). The Naan had no flavor at all, either, and after a certain point, I felt like I was eating a chewy piece of cardboard. By far the worst of the bunch was the hummus. It was literally mashed up chickpeas with no additional ingredients (tahini, anyone? Maybe a little lemon juice?). It was bland as can be.  To be fair, my husband enjoyed his chicken, but it doesn't take a lot to please his palate. I also tried his rice, and it was nothing special.   While this place is a killer value and and a sweet family run establishment, we, sadly, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Anything I say is already reflected in the other reviews.  Love this place.  The service is good and the food is great.  The small restaurants are the best.  Never eat at a chain restaurant when there are so many great little gems in town. They even have goat if you're so inclined."}
{"text":"BEST BEST FOOD! I cannot say this enough. I recommend this place to everyone I know. home cooked, authentic and awesome."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to restaurants in Arizona. Not because they offer a certain type of cuisine but because their portion/price and taste is just very good to deny. it's guaranteed that you will be full at the end of the meal. The naan is just very delicious and I really enjoy their personal relationships. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"After 4 and a half days without desi food, stopping by here before our flight back was paradise on a plate. Started off with the mantoo appetizer. I highly recommend it. We got chicken boti, beef sheesh kabab, beef biryani, and some chola dish. All of it was fresh and delicious. Excellent place with excellent people."}
{"text":"I find good food almost every time. Once the chicken I ordered was burnt.. I told them about this, showed the burnt chicken and then they did not charge but made a bad face, became little rude."}
{"text":"Yum! Was brought here by a coworker and what you get for the price couldn't be better. Came back for a second try with my wife and was equally impressed. Try the mixed grill, ton of food and flavor. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great karhai and kabob. Love it!"}
{"text":"I don't know what you are all talking about.  This place has horrible service and mediocre food.  The rice doesn't come with the mean and the naan is hard and thick as a rock. No thanks. I need to find a better place asap.  Nothing beats my wa place"}
{"text":"Headed here during lunch with four friends with really good Taste. Two had been here before so we let them order everything. Ambiance..not much, but its clean and bright. Service...family-run. Friendly. What we ate... Mantoo....amazing little beef and onion filled dumplings covered in yogurt sauce, a spicy orange sauce and dried mint. Addictive. Fabulous. Dream of them now..... Chicken boti....bright orange., looks like a kebab, served with rice and cucumber salad. A nice safe dish. Chicken kahari....a curry type dish. Meat was moist and sauce was flavorful. Goat korma....the hit of the day, well, beside the mantoo. Rich, succulent. Like the bestpot roast yyou've ever had but better. We also had a bread type dish...looked li,e a pizza with no cheese or sauce. Had a bit of a vinegar taste.  Headed back next week to eat more...."}
{"text":"I came across this place recently (SW corner of 24th street/Indian School) and I have to say I find the food to be excellent.  The cuisine is mix of Indian, Pakistani and Afghan, designed to suit every taste, from spicy to not so spicy.   I have had several items but , such as the tender and juicy lamb kabob and most recently the Chicken Boti which was spicy and very good!  They serve goat, lamb, beef and chicken in a variety of dishes and many are able to be shared.  The service is somewhat slower because you generally have the owner being the watier and the menu explainer.  He will take the time to explain the food, how it is prepared and what may suit the taste you are looking for.   His wife loves to cook and that is how this place got started.  Interior decor is nothing special, very typical of an authentic place that just serves good authentic food!.  The Nan bread is fresh, warm and tender.  The hummus didn't really fit my taste, I have other places that I prefer hummus, it was more oily than most.  When I was in there last night, There are approximately 10 tables in the place and during my last visit I could overhear each table making comments about how good their food was.    There is a charge for bottled water (if you ask for \"water) and you will pay a .35 cent transaction fee for credit cards, testament again..to authenticity :)    I love this place and when I feel the itch for something different and adventurous for my taste buds,  I have not been disappointed yet.    I just wish they could pipe some low authentic music and it would top off the place!"}
{"text":"Signs says open until 830 on a Friday. At 820. They are closed. Servers give us the sign of \"cut throat\" indicating closed. Seriously, you can't stay open until the hours you have posted!  Pic of time. Still shows 4 minutes until closed.   Won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"From the outside it might well be a place to drive by, but the food is definitely worth stopping for. If you don't know what you want to order, ask the waitstaff for recommendations or bring friends who have visited before (which is what I did).  I had the eggplant from the Afghani Specialty menu with naan, and it was delicious but too much food, which was actually OK because I just boxed up the leftovers in a doggie bag (even if I had a dog, I wouldn't share). I also ordered a veggie samosa, which I had one yummy bite, exclaimed how good it was, and it was finished off in \"taste testing\" by my dinner mates.   The naan was really useful, especially at soaking up some of the hot spices in the other dishes that my group ordered.  I'd like to try other items on the menu too, as they have a diverse assortment including gyros! Looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We stopped by here on our way to Prescott. Server was very nice and helpful. Their servings are huge. Food is excellent. Fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation. Not very impressive but not disappointed either. Takes you back on the streets of Afghanistan or to a bazaar in Peshawar. Feels like u r experiencing the eastern culture. The food is better than most Indian/Pakistani restaurants. If you want some real authentic food go for a nihari and the combo platter. Don't choose typical Pakistani stuff like biryani, karahi, wraps etc bcoz this is not the place. Afghani food however is delicious. Went there quite a few times only for nihari. It's a family owned business and we support them for this. The young guy who's on reception is so nice to talk with. My only reservation is that if u r just couple of minutes late from 8.00 pm they won't seat you even they close at 9.00pm and leave right away at 9.00 if you are late for pick up. One day we arrived at 9.03 pm and they were literally out with our order which they handed us on road. They don't even care for their regular customers. They won't listen n understand your problem. They must have to raise their standard for good customer service otherwise there are many other better places."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, I tried the Chicken Tikka Masala. I got it spicy, but not over the top spicy. It was very good. The chicken was cooked perfect. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is my first review. I'm the type of person that likes to try something new almost every time I go out. I get bored easily, and I rarely want to go to the same restaurant. I have been to this place twice in 2 weeks!  The menu is huge, I don't know what half of the stuff on there is but that is what google is for. I've tried at least 3 things now that I have never had before and they were all delicious.  The chicken Handi is addictive, it's what I went back for. The servings are family style in my opinion, but it did not stop me from ordering 4 things! I had leftovers which tasted even better the next day.  I'm a sucker for family owned restaurants, these meals are home cooked recipes to order so the wait is a little longer, but well worth it. If you just get off work and don't want to wait, they do take out. Order before you leave and it's ready to pick up...this is me planning my next visit."}
{"text":"This was really good food at a very descent price. Infact it was a lot of food for a price I was totally willing to pay. I had the lamb biryani and it was very well spiced and had the right meat to rice ratio.The service was incredibly fast and very friendly. I would come back here again ad try their other menu options."}
{"text":"Even if Afghan food is not in your general comfort zone, you really should give Khyber Halal a chance.  Small ethnic restaurants are not always attractive, comfortable, or even clean, but Khyber excels in all of these areas.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  The menu is varied but not so large as to make you suspicious about how much frozen food is served - I believe everything here is freshly prepared.  The portions are large, the prices are low, and the food is nearly as good as it gets for this type of establishment.  So how could Khyber be better?: Well, I wish they were located in my neighborhood, and the food could be spiced a little more heavily, particularly as regards salt.  Other than that ... well I gave it five stars.  I can particularly recommend the Mantoo, a kind of ravioli dish with meat-stuffed dumplings in a surprisingly good beef-yogurt sauce.  The \"Salad\" (for under $2) is a large portion of a cucumber-tomato-onion chopped salad, and is a perfect relish for the Mantoo.  There are a number of vegitarian dishes served with Nan.  We had the Bamya (okra) which needed salt but was otherwise perfectly prepared.  The Nan here is thick, like a thick-crust pizza, and they give you enough to make a meal of on its own.  If you have room for dessert, I can recommend the Phirni - a pudding whose ingredients we were told are secret, but it tastes like a cross between rice pudding and custard and is superb.  I have to return to try the kebabs and some of the other specialties.  The pictures on the menu and the website are helpful and accurate, so you really know what you are getting.  Maybe I shouldn't raise your expectations too much only to have you disappointed.  See for yourself.  What are you risking? -- For two people, we had two delicious somasas for an appetiser, two main courses, a huge plate of Afghan rice, a side salad, and a dessert for $33 including tax and tip.  I've paid much more for much less."}
{"text":"When it comes to spicy, awesome food from India and Afghanistan this place cannot be beat.  Their samosas come with an amazing spicy mint sauce.  It is really the best samosa I have had in my life.    I also got my favorite Indian dish - the chicken tikka masala.  It was incredible.  I ordered it spicy because usually spicy is not a challenge for me.  I was wrong .  My tongue was on fire but I battled thru the heat to enjoy the excellent flavor explosion in my mouth.    I will most definitely be back to this restaurant.  It was also very reasonable priced for the amount of food we got."}
{"text":"I am giving it a 2 star only because a) the food is okay not so great b) service is average and c) very, very pricey for a kabob joint.  There's clearly a trick in the menus; there are no combos of two items. The closest thing is the mixed grill but that's way too much for one person and the proportion is for at least two people.  So, what do you do when, for example, you want to combine lamb and chicken (1 skewer each)? In my case, I added the chicken boti with my lamb but the extra charge was $7.99 so my single order, a custom combo, came out to be about $18.00!!! No rice! They give you an option between rice and bread with your Primary order (lamb kabob in my case) so I picked bread and paid an extra $7.99 for a single skewer of chicken.   I don't think I will return here again, it's a complete rip off."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant via Yelp.  It's a good restaurant with great food, if you like interesting, sometimes spicy, different food well made.  Here's the warning, though:  it's not the place for that special, romantic date.  The ambience is low rent, but that should not stop you from visiting.  The menu is varied, and the variety goes from Afghan food to Indian / Pakistani food, to good old American grub.  We tried some of the first 2 and were very pleased.  Some have said that the service is slow.  To protect ourselves (and we did not make it up) we told the waiter that we had to make a plane, and our service was prompt.  We're sure to return next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and super affordable. Was stoked to find it here in Phoenix.  Take out is quick, staff is super nice."}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to try the food yet, they always seem to be closed.  One time it was due to a big catering order (excusable) and another time I was met with a locked door with 2 1/2 hrs prior to posted closing time.  I'll update if I ever get to try the food."}
{"text":"Had the sampler order along with gobi. It was excellent food, particularly the dumplings. Great prices.  Nice chai, too."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food was super and the service was fantastic. We had a wonderful time exploring dishes new to us."}
{"text":"Yummy... the gyro was really good and fresh; it might be the best gyro in town but I'm gonna need to try it one more time. Plus the gyro was pretty good in size; I get pretty disappointed when I don't get enough food.  It also came with fries and extra gyro sauce at no extra cost."}
{"text":"I am giving this place five starts because while it is not the most excellent afghan food I have had many of their dishes are delicious, and we really need more of these types of places here and phoenix, and what more?  Its just down the street from me!  There menu is very diverse covering everything from afghani to Indian to Pakistani and even American cuisine (mainly burgers and fries/ wraps)  Most important of all the owner and employees are very kind.  I do advise to order ahead of time if you are taking out, they can take a while to get out the dishes but when they do it is worth the wait.    Thomas S."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  My husband and I came here for date night - we got the garlic naan and hummus, beef samosa, chicken Karahi and chicken buryani - it was all fantastic!!  I don't have much experience with Middle Eastern food - but everything we sampled was great!  It was all very flavorful, the dishes were very large portions, and it was all super delicious!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was traveling and decided on dinner with colleagues. Called ahead to confirm closing time was told I must arrive 1hr before closing to be seated. With 1hr and 10mins to closing and a $20 cab ride the 4of us entered with great anticipation. No greeting, no smile, no eye contact even. The first words spoken to us upon entering the door were, \"takeout only.\" I said, \"pardon me\"? And the response came back even more dry, \"takeout only.\" When I mentioned we have arrived with ample time to be seated, the guy made eye contact, raised his voice and said in a firm voice, \"TAKEOUT ONLY.\"  Informed him that we are from out of town staying at a hotel and cannot do takeout he said not his problem.  Asked why takeout only, he said they've run out of some items on the menu. That is understandable so I decided to reason with a compromise. I asked to let us order from what remains on the menu so we can be seated. Surely a win-win I thought. This guy just didn't care. He said no matter what we order he would tell us he was out. And in the next breath said, takeout only. Asked for a manager, one wasn't available.  Got his name, Abdullah.  Abdullah does not care for his customers, nor did he seem to be concerned about how rude and unprofessional he was being. He used words like that's not my problem and I don't care. He is ill prepared to serve in this role in the food service industry. Perhaps he is an inexperienced employee or a family member. Neither excuses the poor service and the awful attitude displayed. He is representing Khyber Halal in the worst way possible and to the detriment of the owners.  I was humiliated in front if my colleagues. I have never been spoken to in such an arrogant and condescending manner. Had to leave. Spent an extra $80 in cab fare to Tempe and back to dine at Curry Corner (highly recommended).  Will never return to Khyber Halal. Take your business elsewhere. Many other restaurants that will make you feel welcome and demonstrate care."}
{"text":"Food is always good here except one time where I ordered chicken kabobs to go, when I got home the chicken was not cooked all the way and it was pink still. I never had an issue here but this was the only time I did."}
{"text":"Khyber is a great find in Phoenix!  Although they are marked as Afghani/Pakistani/Indian, I would definitely think they're more Afghani than anything based on the large cloth rug map of Afghanistan at the cashier's stand and the menu calls out Afghani specialities more than the other ethnic dishes.   I made a reservation ahead of time for my friends and I the day before just to be safe. We arrived that night and it wasn't terribly necessary despite it being dinnertime on a weeknight. Young waiter greeted everyone as we arrived. Table was already set and once a majority of us were seated he took our drink orders- all canned pop and mango lassi, no alcohol whatsoever.   Forewarning parking is a little limited since it's in a very small strip mall off 24th and Indian School.  Everyone ordered garlic naan and for one person it's like 3-4 pieces per, so our table was swimming in it! For the cost you get A LOT... more than what I expected. Absolutely naan-tastic!  The popular dish most of us ordered was mantoo (dumplings with a meat sauce). Uber tasty and not too starchy/heavy as most dumplings can be. I was a little disappointed they weren't served piping hot but I'm assuming that's how it's supposed to be served and eaten. It looks like dumplings with taco meat and other sauces, but the look is deceiving. I left with a clean plate and plenty of naan for my friends to take to go.  In total I spent $17 for dinner and it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great food....Awesome flavors and you get a true portion of food!!! The make it fresh when order no preheat food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not a place you go on a romantic date. You go here when you want to enjoy some authentic ethnic food. This is a plain cafe in a mini strip mall in view of Walgreens. Once you have recovered from the shock that you are not going to experience a candle-lit dinner you can start focusing on why you are here; you are here for the wonderfully tasty food. The menu is chock full of interesting Afghani dishes. The dish I ordered contained a whole chicken. Needless to say, I took some home with me. My dish would have fed a family of four easily. The naan that accompanied the dish was unbelievable. It tasted like manna from heaven. The four of us polished off most of what we ordered and we left full and happy. This is definitely a place I would return to eat again."}
{"text":"Great Place...Good Food Chicken Biryani was Superb... The quantity of food was good as well. All in all an excellent Restaurant."}
{"text":"When it comes to Indo-Pak food , this place is really good. Friendly service and clean if simple ambiance make this a pleasant place for lunch or dinner. Often you will find Afghanis and others from the subcontinent enjoying the spicy halal food. The veggie dishes particularly stand out."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My family eats here every once in a while and even had Khyber cater a large event that we held. I even ate here when pregnant and it was the last food I ate before going into labor!    I love the parathas, potatoes and chick peas. Their food is reminiscent of true South Asian home cooking. The staff is very kind as well.  Note: I heard they may have changed their main cook since the last time I went so I'm not sure what's it's like anymore."}
{"text":"The lamb here is absolutely amazing! So tender and flavorful. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Really good food!! Staff were nice! The area wasn't too bad. The restaurant itself it's nothing fancy but does the job! I'd definetly go back!"}
{"text":"I really liked the place. The dumplings were outstanding. The goat curry was tasty. The use of ginger is interesting. I don't think I'd ever tried Afghan food before. The portions are huge and the prices are very low."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and made to order. We order the chicken tikki Marsala and chicken birhani with Rita yogurt to top the dishes. We've had the goat as well. Everything is great, you can't lose here!"}
{"text":"I've eaten Khyber Halal twice now, both times for take out. Everything I've had there is pretty delicious, definitely good Indian/Pakistani/Afghan food for the Valley. The chicken tikka masala was classically delish, I feel like it's hard to go wrong with heavily spiced and sauced chicken. The naan was fabulous, and if I weren't so full from the other things on my plate I would have eaten much more of it. Definitely worth eating with sauce alone. Lamb kabobs are also a solid choice, again another classic dish that it's hard to go wrong with. What really stood out for me, though, was the mantoo! I ordered the mantoo on a lonely night at home, by the recommendation of the guy behind the counter. It was SO garlic-y, but SOO meaty, creamy, and delicious. My roommates were flabbergasted by the smell of the house when they got home, and I definitely couldn't finish a full order of the garlicy goodness on my own. I'll definitely go back and try more options, but I'm excited to get more mantoo in my belly (hopefully chased with some naan next time to dull the spices)."}
{"text":"The food consistency and quality is still amazing after many visits - 5 stars upgrade  You must get the Gulpi (Cauliflower) as a side dish - It will change the way you think about the vegetable"}
{"text":"It took Yelpers to convince us to try Afghani food, and we're sure glad they did. I think their lamb kebabs are the best value in town, but the chicken is so good that we end up getting the combination plate and sharing. My wife is partial to the eggplant, and for good reason. The rice is marvelous. We always order extra to take some home. We have taken to calling Khyber the \"phirni\" place, because of that marvelous dessert. Both creamy and light, it is the perfect end to a spicy repast. We once took a dozen to a dinner party, and not surprisingly no one had ever heard of it, but everyone wanted to know where they could get it."}
{"text":"Charming joint in a sleazy strip mall where you underpay to be overfed. Authentic, welcoming, spicy. I love it.  As Alex S. said below, some of the items have too much rice. I don't really recommend the pulao dishes for that reason, though the lamb shank is delicious, and yes, I finished the rice. Get something spicy & soupy with naan. Anything karahi or nihari."}
{"text":"Plan accordingly folks. Leave room for the sweets! You may over order with your eyes. Temptation may give in as you eagerly dig into your meals. Pace yourself or you'll be stuffed as your fork hits the bottom of that plate.   Trust me, in your lifetime everyone should try a Gulab jamun. In laymen's terms that would be a little ball of dough. Two of these ping pong sized balls come in a container. You won't want to share. I mean, the civil thing would be to share. But really, once your spoon touches the sweet cardamom syrup that's involved. Mmm...I don't think so. A moment on the lips a memory forever.  Moving on. Just remember to leave room for dessert. There are other sweets available up front to choose from, I'll report back next time. (Gosh darn it. They've got me.)  Zipping into the nondescript shopping center we studied the menu upfront. We seated ourselves in the dining area, which is a no-frills kind of place. (There's a TV if anyone really, really needs that.) Our server was quick to take our order and our food was out lickity split.  Spicy means hot! (If you opt for spicy be prepared.) The Chicken Tikka Masala was divine with copious amounts of chicken. Served with four large artistically cut pieces of naan leftovers abound.  The Kabli Pulao really does come with a foot long serving of a beef shish kabob.  (The beef has been shredded and molded into this arc of a shape.) The rice was airy and well balanced with raisins and shredded carrots.The accompanying chatni sauce was a delightful surprise on top of all the goodness involved.   Note that there is no beer or alcohol on the menu.  Just remember, pace yourselves!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite lunch place. I usually order beef wrap or lamb kabab. Those are my favorite. I have been going there for about three to four years, never disappointed.   Sometimes I go there at dinner time with my friends as well. We order combo plate and Beef Nihari are great. I would suggest you to try it.   The other beautiful food in this place is NAN. I just can eat that NAN as alone. It's just bread but so tasty.   The place is pretty clean, dishes are clean. Prices are reasonable. You can eat fulfilling lunch under $10. The staff is all relatives of the owner and they are so kind. I like this family business and I will support them."}
{"text":"Ok, ok.... maybe my experience was not as good as it could have been as I went with the International Supper Club and our group was quite large. Everything on the menu looked good, and maybe I should have read more reviews, because I ordered way too much. The husband and I shared the chicken tikka masala (spicy), a beef samosa, the beef dumplings, and a side of rice with carrots and raisins. If you have been here you know this is an obscene amount of food... I did not know that and was shocked when the plates came out. Let's start with the good:  The samosa was delicious and the cilantro sauce that came with it was amazing... delicious with a touch of spiciness.   The service was fabulous... attentive and timely for such a large group.  The dumplings were really yummy and different than anything I have ever tasted. Plus there were like 10 of them on the plate.... they were tasty. I would get them again for sure.   The bread was fresh, warm, and delicious.... oh, and plentiful.   The prices- this place was inexpensive... I could have fed 6 people for 30$  Ok, now for the bad:  The chicken tikka masala came out completely not spicy.... maybe they didn't hear me, or something got lost in the large order, but it was not at all spicy and just tasted kind of boring.... The portion was large, but if the flavor is there, it really doesn't matter.    The side of rice was maybe the worst thing I got. It was huge and tasted.... off. It's hard to describe, but it tasted like oil that has been used one too many times.... just kind of weird. I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to taste, but if it is... yikes.... not awesome.     Anyway, I would like to come back here without the large group to taste this food as it's meant to be."}
{"text":"Great place, family owned and very reasonable prices. Have been here several times. Made a meal of Somosas and a  cucumber side salad. Used the extra sause to amp up the salad. Samosas  included meat, chicken and vegetable each with a tasty sauce. Great taste..some with good heat!  Have also had the Chicken Karahi several times. Very ample portions with more than enough for a take home meal. The chicken is bone-in and served in a calderon with plenty of Naan bread. Great flavor also with some heat. Service was very good. It is located in a strip mall with ample parking. Great custom and antique VW shop next door for car buffs. Check out the menu...two people can easily have a great meal for under $20....a gastro treat and easy on your wallet."}
{"text":"This place would earned a 4 star rating for their food and service but the server told me that they didn't honor the Entertainment discount of $5 off $15 or more since they didn't sign the contract with the publication.  Paid full price for the meal.  That said, this place offered decent food with good value for their unique cuisine in the city..The samosas were a little on the small size but it was cooked perfectly with mint sauce that is quite unique and signature..Their Mantoo live up to other expectation and it is a must dish if you are here..Their Gyro sandwich was in par with other Greek places in town.  Very generous portion."}
{"text":"Like almost every good restaurant in Phoenix, this place is hidden in, yes, a strip mall. But strip-mall facade be damned, this place is really as good as it gets. I've only been here once but already am eager to work my way through the entire menu. I went there earlier this month with three friends. We all sampled each other's food and nobody was in the least displeased with anything. First off, I will continue to sing the praises of the mantoo. These dumplings--which are the Afghani equivalent of Chinese wontons or ravioli--are filled with ground beef and onion and then topped with a yogurt sauce and a red sauce. Tender and flavor, little dough-bites of heaven. Another highlight was the goat curry. I had a taste of my friend's and it was perfectly tender. And the sauce is a great mix with their jasmine rice. I had the chicken boti in which the flavors were felt all the way through the meat. They have a few different kinds of naan bread. Loved the garlic naan but you'll need a breath mint later. I saw some reviews said the service is so-so. It did seem like we had to wait 5 or 10 minutes longer than one might be used to. But the restaurant--which isn't that big--was almost completely full. It's also important to note we were the only non-Middle-Eastern/Indian customers so that tells you the level of authenticity is pretty good. The service may have taken a bit longer but nobody was rude. Also, it looks like the kind of place where you go up to the register to take care of your bill. Anyway, I plan to make Khyber Halal a stop when I have visitors in town."}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here whenever I am in Phoenix.  I love the kabobs with the green sauce.  The naan bread is the best I have had.  It is chewy with a crunch.  Their baklava is excellent too.  It may look like a hole in the wall but, if you want authentic Afghan food, you have to try this place."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about this restaurant. We were immediately greeted and given our menus to seat ourselves. Once we had a chance to review the menus, our orders were taken and the food came out quickly. First, we ordered one chicken and one veggie (potato) samosa. Yum!! They were golden brown and the dipping sauce that comes with them is the perfect compliment to the flaky pastries. Next, came the chicken boti and the mantoo. The chicken boti is a classic seasoned chicken kabob and we upgraded to the Afghani rice, served with carrots and raisins. We were pleasantly surprised by how delicious the rice is and it really stood on its own! And now to the mantoo. These Afghani dumplings are filled with ground beef and topped with a beef sauce and garnished with mint. DO NOT miss your chance to try these! You will not regret it. The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable. This was our first visit and will not be our last. We can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"This relatively new restaurant immediately became one of my favorites in all of Phoenix Metro, after discovering it with an ethnic dining MeetUp group.  I like it because the food is sooo good and I like value.  I still can't get over how 15 people ate here family style for only $10 each INCLUDING TAX AND TIP for large group, we paid $150 total.    I later hosted my own MeetUp dinner here, ordered family style which I pre-selected with the owner, Fahima, for 22 people.   Some of the dishes Fahima and I selected for my group are Mixed Grill Meat Platter (Usbek Puloa, Kofta, chicken kabob), Goat Khari, Mantoo (meat dumplings topped with yogurt sauce), Gulpi (cauliflower stew), Badanjan (eggplant, oh I love eggplant),  Tandori Garlic and Paratha Naan, cucumber salad (comes with entrees), and Afghani rice flavored with cardamom seed (comes with entrees), and we each got one Beef Samosa.   We were served immediately upon arrival with hot dishes, and great service from her sons.  Because I ordered more goat and lamb dishes, our bill still came out to less than $13 a person. including tax and tip.  I never order chicken anywhere, because 90% of restaurants cook it dry and hard, but someone else did and I tasted it.  The grilled chicken was very tender and charbroiled flavor, best chicken I ever had in my life!    After I hosted my dinner here, several people told me they come back here again and again, and thank me for introducing Khyber Halal to them."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now and love it.  It's a family-run place serving Afghani/Pakistani/Indian food.  The Atlantic ran an article a few months ago talking about how to properly pick an ethnic restaurant.  You're supposed to find a little hole-in-the-wall in a strip mall where there are no laughing pretty people sitting outside.  Khyber Halal definitely fits criteria, as it's parked in a strip mall on 24th street in the ghetto zone.  Despite the authenticity, however, portion sizes are definitely American.  You get both quality and quantity for your buck here, and you don't need to use too many of those bucks to fill up.  I've had the Mantoo both times, which are kind of like meat-filled dumplings with spaghetti-like sauce on top.  They're super tasty.  I also have tried the chicken boti, which comes with a spicy sauce.  Definitely try the Chai tea while you're here.  It's an authentic Chai (read: not a sugar-filled chain coffee drink) and is perfectly smooth.  The mango lassi was also a hit.  I haven't tried any of the curries yet (they have goat!) but plan to the next time I come back, which will be very soon."}
{"text":"Another spot I drive by on my way home from work on 24th St and I finally got around to trying it. I have gyros enough times that I needed to find something else to try. I always enjoy north Indian food and found a dish I recognized. The chicken tikka was great but I ordered it a level of spice I couldn't handle. The sauce was so good but my mouth was on fire. I tried to reheat with yogurt but it didnt bring it down to doable. Cant blame them for my mistake! . The other dish I ordered was the was the Beef Nihari. I have heard of this dish from other Indians middle easterners but never tried. This sauce on the other hand was not something I could enjoy. The description sounded amazing and it was indicated as being one of the most popular. I feel like the dish a very distinct buttery masala taste but not very spicy or taste of many different spices. Another time I did the lunch special of Gyro and fries which was great. Finished it off with some baklava that was also on point."}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala is really good, but the star of the show is the naan!  OH-EM-GEE, it is gooooood!   I'll be back just for the naan.  As an aside, the menu has three options for heat -- mild, hot and spicy.  I typically like mine in the middle, so I ordered hot, but it was still a little too spicy for me, so I'll go with mild next time."}
{"text":"Very good! Reminds me of my mom's cooking.  The chicken karahi is light but very flavorful. The portion is also really large. The chicken tikka masala was very good. I was a little disappointed by the goat biryani - the portion size was good, but the rice was dry. I also thought the raita (accompanying yogurt) was a little bland. The chick pea masala was pretty good, but a little simple for my taste. Still, it was nice that it wasn't drowned in overpowering spices.  The service is slow, but I think the prices are reasonable. I could definitely see this place becoming my go to Indian/Pakistani restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"big food portions, great taste that would make you crave it later. simply the best place to get food in my opinion.   i highly recommend ordering the ''manto''"}
{"text":"Fully 5star food and service. Location I'd say easy to find and decor is homey but does the trick"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chix Tikka Masala. Fresh & spicy. Comes w/Naan which was also fresh. For desert, had Phirni and THE best Baklawa ever made on planet earth. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"2nd time here and I enjoy it even more. Great place to try different dishes ad they are all very good. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Afghan food, Kababs and rice are delicious. I haven't had anything here I didn't like. Always a good stop"}
{"text":"Named after the mountain pass that cuts through Afghanistan and Pakistan, we find Khyber Halal right here in Phoenix.... Another amazingly delicious mom and pop type restaurant.  The Phoenix Supper Club UYE visited Khyber Halal in January.  I was out of town on business, but I stopped in last month to sample a few things and I was very pleased with the offerings.     The most moist and tenderly seasoned  lamb!   Practically melts in your mouth.   Large portion.   Get the kabob with rice and order a specialty naan on the side.   Fluffy tender rice with a strong cumin flavor laced in every bite.  I don't usually eat much rice, but the house rice was a delicious treat.. The Lamb came with a Cucumber tomato onion and cilantro mixed salad.   I also ordered the Garlic naan.  nom nom nom.... The bread was perfectly tender with a lite crunch and bursting with the flavors of roasted and fresh garlic.  Deliciously spiced beef.   Reminds me more if a Jamaican beef patty,  spicier and more flavorful.   The chicken samosa is just as yummy,  but lacks the bold flavors of the beef.   Rather spicy for most Americans.  BTW: Halal means \"permitted by law\" in Arabic.  Halal food follows the laws for dietary needs described in the Islamic faith... humane slaughter of animals, no pork or pork by products, no animals without external ears and so forth."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Giant portions. I had a beef kabab with rice and a cucumber salad. Very tasty. The beef was a smidge dry, but mixed with the rice and salad it was great."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a hundred times and never gave it much thought until I saw the Yelp! Reviews had been pretty consistent. It's very close to my house and has convenient parking. I'm usually up for trying new things but I was in the mood for Tikka masala so I went with that and it came with a piece of naan and i ordered a side of rice. A good solid 3.5 stars but I was generous and rounded up. The restaurant itself has zero ambiance and the strip mall where it's located is pretty run down, but the food was pretty good. The chicken was all white meat and cooked well. The sauce had a bit of a kick even though I ordered the 'mild' which was actually a perfect amount for me. The food was all hot and fresh quickly made. I'd definitely try it again."}
