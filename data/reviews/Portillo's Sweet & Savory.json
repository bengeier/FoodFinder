{"text":"Food was delicious and service was good. Took a little long to get food, but kinda expected it due to it was only the 4th day they opened!"}
{"text":"After hearing some great things I decided to check the place out.  It's a small but clean little restaurant and the staff, husband and wife, are very friendly.  I had the special for the night, pepper steak with beans and rice.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  The rice and beans were good as well. I also had mozzarella  sticks and empanadas for an appetizer. Both were very hot and and tasted great. The prices were very reasonable.  They also deliver for a few dollars to the Southern Range Brewery."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat in Monroe. The owners are the only employees, and some of the hardest working people I've run into recently. The chef has worked in several quality restaurants over the last 10 + years and it's reflected in his menu that is diverse but well priced. They clearly understand the diverse population of Monroe as well as the economic constraints.

The Establishment is incredibly clean, but small so you want to get there early for lunch in order to get a seat. The menu has pasta dishes, sandwiches, and a few items that reflect their Hispanic heritage. We have eaten there several times already, and I have yet to have anything that wasn't well prepared and delicious.

I would suggest that you give them a try as soon as possible. I am hoping that they will be around for some time as there are still many items on the menu I would like to try plus they always have specials so you are not limited to eating the same things over and over.

So far we have enjoyed the mozzarella stick appetizers, the baked ziti, meatball sandwich, chicken parm sandwich, and one of the steak specials.  None were anything less than delicious!"}
{"text":"First time at this quaint new restaurant. We came for dinner with the children. The place is clean. The owners/staff are accommodating and attentive. Food was hot and delicious. My daughter had ravioli. My son had buffalo chicken pizza. Wife had penne ala vodka and I had a steak dish. All were excellent. We come from the NY area and this restaurant is way ahead of its time for this area! We will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Went here due to yelp reviews and I was pleased we chose this place.  Great food and wonderful staff.  Even though the restaurant is rather small I'd come here again.  Yummo"}
{"text":"I love the owners, they are very personable and down to earth! The food is great and delicious. I've had the lasagna and fettuccini w\chicken so far. The portions are incredible."}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant in Monroe. Nothing fancy but we enjoyed everything we had. Empanadas, jalapeno poppers, Cuban, Alfredo and brownie Sunday we all good"}
{"text":"PR girl here...LOVE the food!!!! Had the El Guapo plater and hubby had the Cubano. Both fantastic!!!! To top it off the owners are personable and very nice. We will def be back."}
{"text":"This place is small but worth looking for. It sits in a small strip mall with a Food Lion. Inside is very clean and the employees are the owners and both very personable. We opted to go with the El Guapo and the mixed house. Both exceeded our expectations. The sweet plantains were my favorite. The chimichurri sauce is to die for. My gf said the hot sauce was the perfect amount of spice. We will definitely come back often!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here 4 times now. Never disappointed. The food is amazing. Great pizza and pasta dishes. With fresh homemade ingredients."}

{"text":"Quaint new restaurant. We came for breakfast and enjoyed our meal. Our waitress was very friendly. The breakfast menu is limited but the lunch and dinner menu is quite extensive and looks delicious. We will definitely be back to try lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"First time stopping in (new to town). Food was amazing! Meatballs were delicious! My wife got a spicy pasta dish with chicken, and she could not stop raving about it! We will be back to sample more of the dishes! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing..... absolutely a must go and sit down and eat....salads are awesome....pasta is definitely a must try"}
{"text":"Be prepared to eat...a lot. The outside doesn't look like much, but do not let that fool you. This place is fantabulous! Yuca, plantains, everything is delicious and the portions are huge. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. They also serve pizza and sandwiches but the South American food is what we had."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic new family run restaurant! Everything here was fantastic topped with awesome service! Portillo's Sweet & Savory. We tried the Luna Platter and the Pollio Encebollado and it was awesome. The finest topping on the cake was when Ingrid told us about these Almond Croissants that were in the oven at that moment. These were one of the best things that I have ever put into my mouth! We traveled over from Waxhaw just for dinner and will be back many, many more times!"}
