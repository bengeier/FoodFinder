{"text":"Decent sports bar. Lots of tvs, love that. Nice specials. Lot of room open space. 

During the winter, outside wasn't open.

Now on to the food. It was alright. 

Had the quesadilla, it was ok. It was covered in butter or oil so didn't appreciate that. The didn't leave it on the stove long enough to get a crisp, was disappointed.

French onion soup and salad were good. 

Homemade fries were great. Tots were great."}
{"text":"This place was great. The service was outstanding and the burgers were great. We also ordered the garlic shrimp app and it was amazing.
They have some great craft beers and the prices are more than fair. I highly recommend this place to all of my friends.  My wife and i had a really good experience here.  Looking forward to getting the pizza next time we are her."}
{"text":"Great food friendly servers and a manager that truly cares about the customer. I will be back at Felix and Oscars."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment.  Unimaginative menu, poor service.  Lots of business outside, no one inside on a Saturday night?  Should have been a clue. First visit, last visit.  Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Food and service were well below expectations. Reminds me of a \"college sports bar\". I guess I'm too old for that scene. Food quality is certainly below average."}
{"text":"We ordered the pizza and it was great.  It was a really fun atmosphere and very crowded for a Monday night. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for Browns game. Great seating both inside and on patio. Good food and service. Even got to meet Oscar who actually operates the place.

Excited to come back and try the buffet that they will offer for each Brown's game."}
{"text":"The service is excellent. Our waitress was friendly and personable but that's the only good thing I have to say. The environment is dark and loud and all of the food is mediocre. If you're there for the bar scene you'll probably be satisfied but don't go just for dinner."}
{"text":"I went in to this restaurant for a cavs game. They have an awesome patio and huge big screen.  I ordered the chicken fingers for an app and was very disappointed to see that they were not real chicken.It was disgusting! I'm afraid to try anything else. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Lucky me, the first to review! This place needs to work on some things... First of all everyone was smoking outside - like huffing on fat cigars. So we moved inside. Food was Sysco-ish. I wish they could have been a bit more inventive with the menu. Staff was nice."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Why cant any place make it there? Their menu was nothing special. The food that I had was lackluster at best. It all came served on plates with paper on it like we all ordered mozzarella sticks. Zero thought or originality went into the food just like their marquee out front. I wish I thought to take a picture of their street sign, that would of explained everything. Staff was pleasant, I guess they haven't realised this place wont be there in 6 months yet."}
{"text":"I played on a volleyball league at Felix & Oscars this summer so I have frequented the establishment multiple times.  First, it's a new restaurant and every new restaurant has some kinks to work out but our server was always there, was happy and put up with several sometimes annoying/demanding people. 

We always got our drinks pretty quickly, were able to pay our checks when we finished our games and split our bills accordingly. The service was good! 

Second, it's a sports bar so I don't think you can expect some culinary masterpiece. How much can you do with fried chicken wings? The food comes out quick, hot and they have food specials depending on the day of the week. It's still good food! Also, they have a lot of drink specials too! 7 dollar Mille lite pitchers and 9 dollar summer shandy pitchers for volleyball players (I'm sure other people get these specials too). If you're craving bar food this is the place to go.

And finally the patio is amazing. I would defiantly recommend this sports bar!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday and had a great experience. The sammiches were good with a tasty cole slaw. We thought the patio would be great to bring our nieces and parents the following Friday late afternoon. We were wrong.  There were so many smokers we moved inside.  The breaded mushrooms were cold inside.  One person's burger was horrible in his words. Our niece described the children's Mac and cheese as 3 day old microwaved Kraft Mac & cheese. Our sammiches were disappointing; they used a different cole slaw. The corned beef had little flavor, but it wasn't the worst part of the sammich. The only meal that was satisfactory was the chicken quesadilla. How could we have such a dismal meal just 5 days later?  We are only giving a 2 star because our first experience was good."}
{"text":"Hummus good but needs double the amount of pita.  Side salad good.  Burger was ok not cooked as ordered.  Sub was not great. Potato chips were terrible.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Ordered the Corned Beef Sloppy Sammich with egg.  It was delicious and satisfying.  If you are a person like myself who really enjoys food and always hungry I recommend this sandwich.  I don't drink alcohol so I ordered a coke and the bartender did a great job refilling my drink as soon as I got half way done drinking it."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Excellent bar, great service and decent food. Don't expect white table cloths, just one of the best sports bar experiences in Cleveland. Volleyball is a great addition. Maybe bocce next?"}
{"text":"We sat on patio.  Table got some wings, potato skins and one of the \"sloppy\" sandwiches. Food was great! Service was also very good. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We walk in and there are a bunch of young employee's doing nothing and no one seats us for at least 2 minutes.  We get a real young waiter.  The first thing we order were the loaded nachos. For 9 bucks.  There were allot of chips not layered with cold chili and misc crap thrown on top.  But not dome properly not layered and no melted cheese just cheese wiz crap.  Bad start. THE decor hasn't changed much from the last disaster that was here called Pannins.  The worst food ever.  So they don't have to do much to improve.  Wings were good.  Served crispy with sauce on the side.  We had a big salad and it wasn't bad.  Beer glasses not chilled but beer was cold.   Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Stopped by before the grand opening.  DÃ©cor was the same as the former owners.  The menu was just about the same.  We were there on a Saturday so no happy hour.  There was no drink menu but I figured a glass of house chardonnay should be safe.  The wine came as did the food we ordered. Didn't knock my socks off but was ok.  Service was good but there were few people there.  The bill came and I was surprised that the house wine was $8  a glass at a sports bar. A country club sure but a sports bar? Wonder what the other prices were like. I may or may not return.  There are places nearby with better food and a drink menu so you know up front the prices."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals ever, we should have known when the were out of three of the items we ordered. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"We went in on Sunday evening at 5 PM and the place was empty with the exception of us. The volleyball courts did however seem busy. When we came in, it was almost as if they were shocked that customers walked in. We were greeted and given menus and a waitress was brought in from outside to service us which was quite rapid. She was very nice as was manager that met us. We both ordered beer, my wife, a bumble berry in a bottle and a blue moon on draft for me. At time of order my wife requested a glass. At delivery my beer was in a plastic cup and no glass for my wife. We ordered the Onion Petals which were amazing. I had seen on their menu they had fried chicken and I had come just for that. At Time of offer I was told they had no fried chicken had not had any for sometime I was not sure when they would have it again. We get the onion petals, Finished our beer and went to the local Chinese restaurant where we enjoyed our dinner. I won't be going back I was completely disappointed with the exception of the onion petals."}
{"text":"Just went into this bar... It wasn't busy at all. Took 5 minutes to get a server & the girl had no idea what liquor they had. Me and 5 other people ordered drinks.. 5 minutes later one person gets his Diet Coke and we waited another 20 minutes... No one was making our drinks or paying us any attention! We walked out. I will never be back again."}
{"text":"Subpar Bar food. What looks like a nice upscale restaurant from the outside is simply a sports bar on the inside. Loud music, a ton of tvs and pizza. I tried the coconut/curry pot stickers and they came out with none of that - they were just covered in teriyaki sauce. The chicken soup was like a snot. Gross. Never again. Bye bye."}
{"text":"A-Ok in my book. We really liked the patio and our service was great. As soon as we sat down at the bar a server greeted us and informed us about their drink specials. We ordered a pitcher of Miller Light, I know I know high class but hey it's a sports bar and I wanted just light beer. No judging over here! 

I loved the sand volleyball courts, it would be so much fun to join a league there. Possibly look into that if you are interested. 

Now onto the food. We ordered wings and french onion soup. Our food came out fairly quickly, probably waited 8-10 min your average time. The wings were great! Really crispy and golden in color. Now the french onion soup....do myself and yourself a favor and do not order this. I repeat, do not order this. I'm a huge soup person and I love me some french onion soup, but this soup was so thick. I don't ever remember french onion soup being thick. Upon first look, it looked delicious with the melty delicious cheese on top but as soon as I broke through the cheese it was so thick and salty. I personally didn't like it. 

Would we return? Yes, probably. Will we ever get wings again? Yeah, most likely. Will I ever get french onion soup? Nope, never again"}
{"text":"The great room was drafty and cool and through out the meal there was a smell of sewage, like we'd just been crop dusted (but all night). I ordered a burger mid well with bacon and cheddar. Came out medium. After being cooked up and I started to eat it I found the burger had a stale bun and American cheese. The French fries were great and my brothers pizza was also very good. The service was good and they comped a free dessert for the poor burger. All in all a forgettable experience."}
