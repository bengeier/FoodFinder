{"text":"Set dinner menus are of very good value and quite a bit to choose from.  Probably one of the best roasted ducks in Mississauga.  Nice sweet & sour pork and curry beef.  Also tried dim sum during lunch. Menu is not expansive but decent."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised.  

It is a small restaurant and you wouldn't expect it to serve dim sum.  They also have congee and noodles as a side option.  What I like about this place is they serve dim sum dishes that they don't serve elsewhere.  They had durian buns and melted sesame buns.  I was told they do not always offer it but it was something different and I liked it.

Unlike other dim sum places, this restaurant doesn't charge you for tea.  I would come back again to try out their dinner."}
{"text":"Recently tried their take-out dim sum and it amazing and cheap! My new favourite har-gow (shrimp dumpling) place. Will definitely be going back to this authentic family-run restaurant. Server was polite and answered all my questions since I couldn't read some parts of the menu in Cantonese. Food came out on time and was hot and fresh! Yum!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for dinner and never for lunch. This is the first time I'm here during a weeknight but not around any special festive holidays. Finally I'm not squashed. It's a small family run kitchen. The owner runs the kitchen as well as the front, so quality is consistent. They are running it way better than when they were running the restaurant at Mavis and Eglinton. This is a manageable size 6-7 small tables and two large tables that can be converted to extra large table) for them to keep the quality.
Their menu is not enormous, but still give you a good selection. They didn't put too many dishes there that are too complicated to make to keep the ingredients fresh.
They do have a selection of dishes that are special and complicated to make, but they HAVE to be pre-ordered.
So, food have yet to disappoint, even when they are so busy they ran out of chairs.
Service is there, but be mindful that when they get busy, they get busy, and because it's a family run restaurant they won't have enough server to go around. If they don't get to you right away, don't whine about it, please. That leads to another tips, if you want to come here during special days (New Year, Chinese New Year, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Summer Holidays, Mid-Autume Festival, Thanksgiving, Winter-season Arrival, Christmas, or whatever lunar seasons I've missed) and you don't make reservations ahead, either you will be stuck eating at 5, or you may have to go elsewhere, or wait for a long time as walk-in."}
{"text":"I went back to try items on the special menu. The chicken with the sticky rice stuffed inside was interesting. It was undercooked at first when they brought it out, so they had to take it back to cook it again. We also tried the melon soup where they brought the soup out inside the melon. The soup tasted alright, but not enough to say it was that special. The eel rice was an interesting take to a rice combination in a stone pot but I didn't really like this dish. The eel tasted a bit too over cooked. The fried fish skeleton with fish filet tasted great. Very fresh. 

Overall, I think this restaurant excels in the typical Chinese dishes you find at other Chinese restaurants. This restaurant is more of a bistro style, offers the flavors, but not necessarily the nicest presentation or plating for all the dishes. The ambiance of the restaurant is more family feel and not of a nice banquet hall feel that a lot of the bigger Chinese restaurants have. For the prices they offer, the dishes are reasonable size and great value. I would come back for the dishes on the menu, some of the dishes from the special menu you had to order at least a day in advance."}
