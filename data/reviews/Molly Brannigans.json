{"text":"The Irish selections on the menu continue to shrink and become less authentic.  The atmosphere is great and the beer selection is better than most chains."}
{"text":"I don't get the popularity of this place. Food is blah. Beer is okay but nothing to write home about or make one actually think about Ireland. It gets 2 stars because it smells better than the Saloon."}
{"text":"While it's beautiful inside, the food there is not good. For what it is, it is over priced. I wish I could give more of a review of this place to explain it better but the food just isn't good. We live walking distance from this establishment and will never visit it again."}
{"text":"I need to agree with the other reviews. This place is just not good. The food is blah and overpriced. The bar area is dirty and not well stocked. The customer service is below par. They have a small outdoor seating area but it also doubles as a place for all the bar patrons to come out and smoke. If this restaurant was not in the heart of the Mt. Lebanon business district it would be a struggle to survive. Location, Location, Location. just my opinion."}
{"text":"Working in Greentree, I used to frequent Molly Brannigan's for lunch. Very delicious! I looove the Guinness fondue and the fried pickles! The atmosphere is fun too! Almost feel like I am in Ireland.  There is definitely a variety if you are not into the traditional Irish fare, so it is great for everyone. I definitely will go back-this time for dinner!"}
{"text":"Breaking news courtesy of KDKA TV-2: Saturday night was MB's last night in business. Shadyside's Walnut Grill has purchased the building, making an offer that MB's owner's reportedly \"couldn't turn down.\" The Erie and Harrisburg locations will remain open.   The Post-Gazette also published an article on this...  http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11348/1196759-100.stm"}
{"text":"The beer and drink menu is excellent and the service is always friendly. It has a great atmosphere and the food is decent. I would recommend this place."}
