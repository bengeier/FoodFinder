{"text":"Came into town for New Years Eve and couldn't have been more disappointed by a \"BBQ\" place! Their mac and cheese is worse than Velveeta! I'm not sure if I was comparing it to SC BBQ, but I REFUSE to eat here whenever I'm in town! Everything was below mediocre!"}
{"text":"This place has really good brisket and pulled pork sandwiches. We got the full house challenge and it fed four people and a child. The onion strings are also very good and the waiting staff are really nice. This would be a good place to either come in and have a lunch or to feed a whole family. For how much food you get the prices are super reasonable and it's some of the best BBQ I have had."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some quick BBQ. Very accommodating staff and very friendly today. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"It looked from the outside like a small place,  so when my buddy and I went in, we really weren't expecting much --- but let me tell you --- this is an incredible BBQ joint.  Honestly probably the best BBQ I've ever had.  I find myself craving their BBQ pulled pork sandwiches on practically a daily basis.  It's juicy, and so tender.  I've never had pork this tender before.  They serve it with some cole slaw, and if you want, a side.  I always get their AMAZING potato salad.  I thought my mother made the best potato salad on the planet, but I'm now convinced (Sorry, Mom) that Tom's is the best.  

If you haven't had a chance to make it to this gem of a BBQ place, I suggest you do.  My buddy that was with me is from Chicago so he had high expectations on the hot beef sandwich, and couldn't stop raving about it.  

Tom's BBQ --- if you love good homemade smoked and grilled goodness you'd be insane to not eat here!"}
{"text":"I'm no expert when it comes to food, or BBQ for that matter. I've heard some people argue that this is not real BBQ. Honestly though, even a hint of my hometown food is good enough for me. This place is just enough for me to eat and be happy.

My wife and I love Vienna hot dogs, and until recently, I thought we'd never have them again unless we took a trip back to Chi-town. I was wrong, as they have brought a bit of home to us. This isn't the only place to do so, but they sure do it the way we like it and with a pleasant atmosphere. We also enjoy a nice Italian beef with au jus. I tend to get the hot giardiniera and sport peppers. The taste of these with their respective food is otherworldly in my book. This location in particular has never done me wrong and I doubt they could. They still have plenty of dishes I need to try and regardless of how it's cooked, as long as it's fresh, hot, and tasty, it will be devoured by yours truly.

It's just too bad they don't have jumbo dogs..."}
{"text":"I, personally,  judge a BBQ place by their hot links.  If the hot link is not good, I don't go back.  I finally noticed Tom's BBQ when heading home from a play and decided to give it a shot.  The decor is interesting but not very nice (in my opinion).  

I was amused by the \"BBQ Sundae\" they offered.  Yes, picture an ice cream based sundae but with BBQ related items as replacements.  Mashed potatoes instead of vanilla ice cream.  Then followed by the following layers: BBQ beans, coleslaw, bbq meat, bbq sauce, cheddar cheese... and, yes, a cherry on top.  Creative to say the least but I was not bold enough to try it.

I ordered the hot link sandwich with a side of mac and cheese.  Meh... I've had better.  The hot link was just okay and the mac and cheese (although creamy) was tasteless.

I'm not going back here."}
{"text":"A truly disappointment! I order the Rib tip dinner and was truly excited, until I took a bit. The tips tastes like they had been reheated a couple of times."}
{"text":"My husband and I are never disappointed with Toms BBQ. The service is quick and staff are always friendly. The food is great we've been to many bbq places and this one is probably our favorite. I love getting the seafood platter too with breaded fish and shrimp super delicious!"}
{"text":"My family and I went in a few weeks ago with a gift certificate purchased from restaurant.com
Nowhere in the certificate does it say that it was not valid on weekends. We had others that did state that thus the why we chose to redeem this one instead. Our certificate was for $10 off a minimum $15 purchase. Our family would have spent 3x's that amount amount easy as we are a family of 7. After we had ordered, we were told that our certificate was not valid. Even after pointing out it did not say that, Tom's would not honor it. We asked for a manager and were told that on a Saturday evening (typically a busy night in the restaurant industry) there was no manager available. We posted immediately on their Facebook page and no reply. Funny how they can reply to anyone giving a raving review but ignore and refuse to acknowledge anyone giving fair criticism. 
But good news yelpers- anyone want a $10 off certificate for Tom's? I certainly won't use it. Our family will stick to Joe's Real BBQ instead."}
{"text":"The chicken and Rib dinner and the pulled pork dinner is amazing and lots of food.    The service is great.    Place is a little small.  but I really enjoy coming here.    I always leave very full.   The staff is very friendly and care about if you are happy.     I love their daily specials.     You get two sides and a roll and lots of meat and you can add corn bread instead of a roll. for only 50cents more.  Which I highly suggest."}
{"text":"Love it!  Now a new fave. 

Only complaint was that there seemed to be only one chick working the front, and it could have been more efficient/productive if she had some help.

But the food is delicious, well worth the money.  Their BBQ is to die for, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Chicago BBQ it says and it's super good.  This place is nothing fancy but the menu and food makes a statement on its own. Probably not the best first date night but if your looking to get messy and forget your diet for one day this place should be on your radar. :) yummmmm. Staff is friendly most of the time but when it gets super busy they are humanly frustrated but this does not hurt the star rating in my opinion.  Not many places around have catfish and a great hush puppy recipe so it's a bonus if that's your thing. (It sure is mine)"}
{"text":"Over priced and not fresh most of the time. This place used to offer much tastier BBQ sauce at a descent price. It seems the restaurant has changed hand and the food from great gone to average."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not bad at all. Everythiing I have had here has been great. Ribs could be a little meater. But other then that. Great Place. Priced well as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in out of curiosity (doesn't look very inviting from the outside) ; and my pulled pork sandwich was AWESOME. Not dry, and cooked just right.  Fries were good too. This is a pretty laid back atmosphere, with interesting visuals all over the place. The decor is 'fun' and humorous.  Tom's is simply a great place to just enjoy a quick BBQ lunch and a cold soda. The woman behind the counter was very polite, and friendly to her customers.   

I will be back, the food was pretty good and I really enjoyed the experience. Wasn't expecting much, like some of the other reviewer(s) ; the neighborhood (country club) is kind of ghetto, so we're not talking about lunch at Tiffany's here folks.  We're just talking about good 'ole BBQ that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Tom's BBQ never disappoints!  They were chosen as a local favorite to feature at an event I host weekly.  My guests loved the pulled pork.  Yay and as always the customer service was fantastic.  My catering order was prepared and ready on time and delivered with a smile.  Can you get better than that?  Best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise! 

I walk into a waft of heavenly rich smokey air that filled my lungs, instantly making my taste buds stand up and shout. Needles to say, we were about to get stupid up in here.

We ordered 3 brisket sandwiches, 1 house special, two sides of coleslaw, French fries, potato salad, fried pickles and mushrooms, and a pulled pork nachos.

As I'm waiting I see they have a food challenge. 18\" of sandwich weighing 2 1/2 pounds a pile of onion rings and a pile of house fried potato chips. I had a 6 hour drive to LA to contend with or I'd been on that one. Next time!!!!

The order came out quickly and did not disappoint! My nachos came around the corner and I slipped a WTF out my lips. The waitress grinned and said \"and you want to do the challenge?\"  This bad boy was made of home fried potato chips, pulled pork, a slather of slap yo daddy good sauce, and measured about 8\"x8\"x11\" of solid packed come get some!

We tore into this ridiculously good food like starving Vikings! 

When it was all said and done we left fat and happy, and for those of you curious.... I killed those nachos, a fried pickle, and a quesadilla for the road!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Tom's BBQ for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised! Ignore all of the tacky, oversized car-dealership-style stickers on their windows and make sure you check out this hole-in-the-wall BBQ right on the corner! 

We were greeted by a friendly cashier who was able to give us recommendations? and answer our questions, and we each had a dinner plate. I had ribs, and the hubby had rib tips. We both enjoyed our pork, and we also enjoyed their mac and cheese a lot! Honestly, this is probably the best barbecue I have had in Mesa since moving here and we will definitely be coming back (and we may even have them fry our Thanksgiving turkey for us, because yes, they offer that too!) We found their dinner plates to be a bit on the pricey side, but it was totally worth it. The mild and the hot bbq sauces were awesome, full of flavor, and not too oily."}
{"text":"Wow! I never thought I would find good BBQ in Arizona but I does! This place Toms BBQ rocks and i bought the tee shirt too!"}
{"text":"I'll be damned , only BBQ place that plays blues .... great vibe and nice workers plus the owner said hi to us . 

Great sauce and BBQ , very happy and ready to get teeth cleaned lol great timing after the corn on the Cobb ! 

The bathroom was in the coke vending machine , hidden they used and retro fitted the vending machine to be a secret door to restroom . 

Not corporatey but quaint and family owned ."}
{"text":"My mom and I eat there regularly!
We love the pulled pork,corn bread and cobbler.
Better than the food is the cashier,Dani!
She greets us, remembers our orders, is polite and takes care of Everything we needThe food and service are unbeatable!
I would recommend the country club location."}
{"text":"Toms really is the best! We have tried about 6 different BBQ places in Mesa/Gilbert area and nothing can beat Toms! Pulled Pork and Ribs are our favorites, but try the All-In BBQ platter if it's your first time. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm from TX so I know good bbq and I thought this place was good but not to die for.  I don't think I would come back if we are ever in the area.  You order up front and the lady at the counter was nice enough.  Their restroom is kind of \"hidden\" which was a neat quirk.  

If you live in the area or are in the area and want some bbq, definitely give it a try for yourself but don't come out here just for the food.  THat's my take."}
{"text":"Ordered a combo platter to go--rib tips and tri-tip.

The rib tips are different in that there's no \"rack\" of bones... they seem to cut off the ends through the cartilage area.  Upside is no bones and a good amount of meat.  Downside is gotta proceed with a bit of caution as there are bits of cartilage in what looks like a chunk of meat.

Sauce and flavour is pretty good--I have no idea whether it's authentic Chicago style or not.  But the ribs definitely did not have that slow cooked BBQ taste.

But the prices are pretty affordable and the menu is big with pulled pork, sausages/links, chicken, fried fish, and fried catfish and some sandwiches, too.  I don't think I'll get more ribs here but the other things look like they're worth trying.

Ambience is casual (at this site) but place is clean enough."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were looking for BBQ on the 4th of July and decided to stop at Toms. I was looking for a reminder of how delicious BBQ is. For it to be the 4th of July the food was not satisfying. The ribs had lots of fatty pieces. The Mac n cheese was bland and it's possible that it was from the day before. The bake beans were straight from a can no unique taste. This place is good for someone who has never had BBQ before..."}
{"text":"There's something seriously wrong with a place that serves brisket slathered in bar-b-que sauce. Being from Texas, sauce is considered an insult to the cook. Ordered a pound of brisket and was told it would 'dry out' without the sauce. It didn't need any encouragement....the whole pound was completely dry. You could tell they smoked it very little (just a smidgeon of a smoke ring) and without any love. They also apparently cut off all the fat prior to smoking  and that is what gives this cut of meat its moistness. Anyway, threw it in the garbage. It was absolutely awful."}
{"text":"How cool is this place?!!! First off the trucks are built like pigs and are adorable, then you have hidden bathrooms that look like supermans phone booth and a Pepsi machine THEN you have bad ass BBQ. Doesn't look like much from outside but this place is worth the stop in! BBQ nachos are great to share!"}
{"text":"Recently moved near Tom's BBQ so I figured I would give it a shot. The fried pickles were great! I ordered a large but should have gotten a small order. There was too much for me to finish. Mac Daddy was great also. Thick Mac n cheese with pulled pork on top with a little BBQ sauce. I loved this and will go back again for it. I also tried the chopped brisket BBQ sandwich. It was ok. It was smothered in the BBQ sauce so it was hard to taste the flavor of the meat alone. The sandwich I would pass on my next visit and try something else. I will go back again to try a few more items off their menu."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 Gangnam Course.Everything's perfect. And specially Justin is a great server! We will come back again soon."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and all the times I've been here the place is always well kept and clean. The food is pretty good. The bbq sauce they offer is delicisous but they only have two types of sauces. The prices are a bit pricey but would recommend to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"BBQ is one of my favorite past times. The food here is pretty good but nothing to write home about. Maybe the menu is just too big or they have spread themselves a little too thin.

Inside is decorated with all sorts of items from the Chicago area. The walls are covered with plenty to look at and they even have an old timey phone booth in the back section. Ring ring!

Been here a few times and usually get some of the Brisket and possible a Hot Link. The meat is always tender and not dry like other places. The BBQ sauce is just a little too sweet for this bad boy. Would like to see a sauce with less stickiness per square inch. Maybe there is just too much molasses or corn syrup in there.

They also offer a large variety of many of the Chicago favorites. Chicago Dogs, Italian Beefs, so forth and so on. Maybe I'll take the Dog for a walk around the block next time.

Service is always friendly. Maybe too friendly. I'm usually in a hurry and sometimes do not feel like chatting about life's particulars. You do have to give them credit for trying. Some places just give you the stink eye and expect you to be happy.

Going with an average score of A-OK on this puppy. Give them a try and see what you think. I'll probably be back again for one of their lunch specials. Maybe I'll bring my own sauce. WUZ UP!

3.25 STARS"}
{"text":"After receiving a request for a more updated review, I returned to this establishment. The food is greatly improved over the old location I used to go. I tried the burnt rib tips sandwich with cole slaw. The meat was good, but a tad over salted. The cole slaw was improved, now having a thicker sauce. The biggest trick was finding the restroom. Spoiler Alert......





(it's behind the Pepsi machine)"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to agree with other reviews. If you have to smother your BBQ brisket in BBQ sauce there's something terribly wrong... got the chopped brisket which I've never seen on a BBQ menu or at a bbq place before. I also got burt ends and sliced brisket and I have to say blah. The burt ends and chopped brisket tasted like microwaved meat. You know how the microwave makes certain meats taste just a little funny. Well that's how my burnt ends and chopped brisket tasted like. The burnt ends were also overly salted not enough pepper on the bark. It all really lacked a smoky flavor. The sliced brisket was very tender. But it was also smothered in BBQ sauce and the pieces that didn't have BBQ sauce on them tasted very plain and like there was no seasoning on the outside of the meat. I'm guessing they smother the brisket in BBQ sauce to compensate for taste. Overall I see myself never coming here again."}
{"text":"I've been many times and my favorite is the Mac daddy. It's macaroni and cheese with shredded pork on top. I love the jalapeno mac and cheese and the spicy pulled pork myself. It's enough meat and pasta I got a side of cornbread absolutely love their cornbread very homemade. I love this place I love the decor I love the music love the food and I will continue going back."}
{"text":"I personally love Toms BBQ while they are a small hole in the wall place (which I personally think the best foods come from) they serve an amazing array of BBQ options. The pulled pork sandwich is a never fail option of for me, served with a tablespoon of coleslaw and just the right amount of bbq sauce( be sure ask for their hot sauce if you like a little kick). My Fiance loves their fried fish(fried perfectly and has just the right amount of breading) and ribs(which are always juicy and full of meat). Overall this is one of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"There are few things in life that make me truly happy. Babies being born, sunny afternoon trips to hang out with a few buddies and maybe the most important one of them all, really good food! The problem with most BBQ places is that there are those who have come to believe that throwing a few pieces of meat on the grill followed by a massive coating of sickly sweet sauce is real BBQ. 

Why then would people spend long hours tending smoke filled pits that sometimes look like they came off the back of a old tractor or the family car? Simple because it is NOT REAL BBQ UNLESS IT IS COOKED LOW AND SLOW!!! The smoke is as important as the meat itself when it comes to making lip smacking Q. It not only adds flavor it also adds a nice smoke ring that lets you know that the meat you are stuffing in your face is real BBQ and not some baked in the oven, made at someones mom's house, under flavored mess. I should have known better than go to a place that claimed to be masters of what they call Chicago style BBQ. 

First off there is no such thing as anybody with a real taste for BBQ knows there are five main areas or styles. Memphis, Texas, St. Louis, Kansas City, and South Carolina style. Chicago does not even come close to making this list. Each region offers a different take or variation on BBQ and those variations are almost like a calling card that informs others as to the origin of the food they are eating. The food from this place did none of those things. This was my first time visiting this chain restaurant so I went in with eyes and nose open to all they had to offer. 

It is no secret that when I walk in to your business that three things must happen in a matter of seconds or I am gone. First off the place should be clean not just look it  (clean floors but disgusting bathrooms). The staff must welcome you or at least acknowledge your presence, and finally the prices should be clearly marked along with the items being offered. As I said this was my first time in this place so I walked in and took a look around. They seem to have really put a little time and effort into creating what they believe is the ideal Q eating establishment. Clippings of newspaper write ups on the company founder, the food and even local charities they help (nice). They even have what I like to call a BBQ battle station. 

This consisted of three bottles of their sauce in various stages of flavor and heat levels, malt vinegar for those who enjoy a more vinegar based sauce, and even ketchup for little kids who do not like the BBQ sauce.  Note: the lack of wet naps that are often handed out at BBQ places should have tipped me off to the lack of sauce issue they have. They do offer free drink refills which is nice given that the cups are on the small side for what they charge, I believe it was $1.59 for a small or $1.99 for a large unless you get a combo meal then it comes with your meal. 

The prices range from $2.79 for a Vienna Beef Hot Dog to $14.99 for one of their three meat dinner combos. They also serve Italian beef sandwiches ( the reason I ate there in the first place) which tasted OK but the jar peppers they used over powered the meat and made the bread soggy. I also tried the beans and rice which seemed to be just that and nothing more! No salt, pepper, not even a little shot of onion or any flavor enhancer to be found. Their potato salad was on the sweet side as if it had been made with miracle whip or sugar was added either way yuck. I also had a few bites of their pulled pork sandwich which did have a nice amount of meat but REALLY lacked in flavor. 

The meat was almost mushy and only had a small splash of sauce. Now normally some places drown their sandwiches in sauce resulting in everything being overpowered with it but any real BBQ master knows that the sauce should only be added to enhance already well prepared meat. It can not make up for over/under cooked, under seasoned meat period!! But this is one of those times I think it could have made the food better. So to sum it all up I would recommend this place to those who are looking for a OK Italian beef place in the Mesa area but as for the BBQ I would suggest you let this little piggy go otherwise you will be the one crying whaa all the way home LOL."}
{"text":"Just an update.  This place is still very high on my list of places to eat.  Being the pig that I am, I normally go on Thursdays for the AYCE rib tips and on Fridays for the AYCE deep fried fish.  To help with my girlish figure, I normally only eat the entrée with cole slaw -- no bread or FF.  Dani takes good care of me and I appreciate that.  I am a stickler for good customer service and that is what I get when I go there.  They also open at 10:30 am and I like that.  I like to eat my lunch early and then have the whole afternoon to do whatever I have to do.  I was early this week and I arrived at about 10:15 am but they still let me in and let me have a soft drink from the self-serve machine, while I waited for them to prep for opening.  Then I had my AYCE rib tips and they were spot on as always!"}
{"text":"Totally agree with another reviewer.  I've lived in Memphis which has sweet BBQ sauce or dry rub, Kansas City which has spicy sauce with a little kick, and Texas which serves savory BBQ and savory sauce.  I've eaten Carolina BBQ in the Carolinas for their vinegar and mustardy sauces.  I went to Chicago for their dogs and pizza, but Chicago doesn't have it's own BBQ.  

Believe it or not though, this was not the worst BBQ I've ever had, but far from the best.  

The sauce did have its own unique flavor, just not sure if I liked it or not.  It was different, had almost an Asian taste to it.  So, I probably wouldn't go back.  I'll keep searching for good BBQ in the valley."}
{"text":"The Pulled Pork Sandwich was fantastic. Normally I'm not a big fan of coleslaw, but it was a perfect complement to the rest of the sandwich. The service was great, and the decor is entertaining. The bathrooms especially are unique and fun!"}
{"text":"Oh I love Toms BBQ! Everytime we come to Arizona, we come by Tom's without fail. I personally love the pulled pork sandwich, and the spicy BBQ Sauce is on point."}
{"text":"Been here now over a dozen times.  Consistently good food and service.  And the people there are fantastic."}
{"text":"The polish dog was ok. My hubs ordered the BBQ beef sandwich and every other bite was filled with meat fat. Nothing more disgusting than eating fat imho. Tip to mgmt... trim the fat off the meat for sandwiches. Gross."}
{"text":"Have been to several Tom's BBQ. All great. This one is especially gooood. Sauce great. Brisket tender. Staff very friendly. Be back. Just wish they would get a restroom. After finger lickin-need wash room.  Or would have given 5 star.........."}
{"text":"I always enjoy trying new styles of bbq, this is Chicago style bbq! Being from Texas you get used just one style TEXAS! The location is in a strip mall a decent but not very desirable area. When I first walked in the place had interesting decor from the bathroom doors being a Pepsi machine! The wait was a little long to order at the counter but I'm a patient man. I ordered up the brisket sand which basket came w one side and a pickle for about $10. Little over priced but it did come w a drink. The brisket was served w a little fat which I like and the sauce was good. The  potato salad tasted pre made from a tub. I'd recommend trying the place once but not sure I'll be back as there are certainly better bbq in phx."}
{"text":"Carol from the other location gave my first experience the only reason to come to Tom's amazing customer service, (carol was filling in for Jesse who just quit) it was my first time having Toms and she was so amazing I came back for more 

The food is great, I had rib tips, mashed potatoes, and Mac n Cheese corn and a roll. 
It was delicious. 

Toms Sandwich with Brisket is to die for with sweet peppers and hot giardinera. 

My only recommendation is to Have a better portion served for the mash potatoes and gravy as well as Mac n cheese  
It was like almost 6 bucks for a size with was a tiny container of Mac n cheese. 

Peach cobbler was great as well. 
I'm trying those MASSIVE brownies next time I go in."}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich with fries and a pickle slice for lunch ($10.25 with tax). They threw in a bottle of water since I don't drink soda. The counter staff was friendly and brought my food to me at one of the tables. 

This is my first trip to this Tom's BBQ. The interior is not as nice as the Tom's in Tempe. The food is average a BBQ place (the sauce a little sweeter than I like). The bun was a generic white bun (a whole grain bun might have added some texture to the sandwich). The fries were hot and a little greasy. The pickle was just a slice, not a spear. The decor did not have a Chicago theme like the Tempe store. Instead, just a running joke and pictures of a pig's butt.

Food is OK, nothing spectacular. Neighborhood is seedy. Decor and vibe is worn and tired."}
{"text":"Excellent cafeteria tray style bbq with cool combos, good sauces, beer, and quality food. Can't go wrong with this authentic bbq"}
{"text":"OMG!!! If you are EVER in the east mesa area (country club and southern) DO NOT pass up this place!! BY FAR the BEST HOT BBQ in the valley!!! The BBQ beans were AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent I cannot believe the flavor on the barbecue sauce. The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned - very smoky and delicious. I like the coleslaw and had just the right amount of sauce on it - which is surprisingly hard to get right for so many restaurants! 
I give extra points for the bathroom experience. I don't want to give away the secret, but you have to check out the ladies room! OK the men's room is pretty fun too, and I admit to peeking in when no one was in there!"}
{"text":"Food is just okay, I am from Texas where we know BBQ.   Here, you have to ask questions or you will buy the farm.  The ribs seem to vary in flavor, no consistency, and tough.  The mac & cheese is not good.   The online menu pricing was different at the lication.  Overall, I do not think I will be back.  This was not my first trip, but will be my last. Do not buy an online \"voucher\" of any type, they will hold you to every letter, restriction.  Soo sad."}
{"text":"I have been at quite a few BBQ restaurants (originally from the south.) I found it be pretty decent! I have the pulled pork; it wasn't dry, the BBQ sauce was really good! It reminded me of the BBQ place I would go to back home. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today and once again it was excellent! Had the Italian Beef and it was go good that I took some home for dinner tonight. Also the fries were as usual great!  Wish they would make a 1/2 order of onion strings, a full is just too much for me but thats life! Will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This particular Tom's location is my favorite BBQ spot in the Valley. I've been going here for years and absolutely love it every time. My weakness is the burnt ends - they're worth every penny. The mashed potatoes are deliciously peppery and perfectly covered in gravy and the cole slaw just melts in your mouth. 

The girl that works here with the dark hair, gauged earrings and awesome tattoos is so kind and is excellent with customers. I feel welcomed and comfortable every time I stop in. (I'm sorry I didn't notice your name.)

The bathrooms are always clean too."}
{"text":"Being a Chicago native you know I am picky with my BBQ!!  But what I wanna talk about is the fish!  Last Friday, for the first time, (and I've been going to Tom's for like 20 years since I moved out here) I did the \"all-you-can-eat\" fish.  DELICIOUS!  It' not the lake perch like we had back home, but it's as close as you can get!!  Flaky, hot, not at all greasy.  A great option for a Friday or ANY night!  Now, along with their rib tip dinners, I have TWO ready-to-go favorite meals at Tom's!  Thanks Tom for having a little bit of back home in my back yard."}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled pork and the cheap generic bread took away from a decent sandwich. I found this sandwich to be quite expensive and too small. In my quest to find the restroom, I pinched my fingers on the space between the lock. My finger turned purple and I was in pain the rest of the evening.  Do not plan to return."}
{"text":"When I was here two years ago I remember really liking the potato salad and the pie, especially the really good pie crust, but not being highly impressed with the BBQ sauce and rib. Today the whole thing meal wowed me. I got the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich with potato salad on the side and all were delicious. The pulled pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender and there was a generous portion on the $5.99 sandwich. It was mild in flavor and not over salted. The BBQ sauce was not overly spicy nor overly sweet and was perfect on the pork. Even the pickle slice, while not very big, was delicious and top quality. I'll have to come back to try the Italian Beef and Catfish."}
{"text":"Tom's is a long time favorite of many patrons in the valley. Recently had their Buffalo Chicken Salad. As with everything else it was great. Spicy enough for Chile-Heads, and mild enough for most light weights. You won't need any additional dressing for this salad as the Buffalo sauce coats your palate just enough to make this a viable Dieter's choice.
Try it. You'll like it!"}
{"text":"The food was overpriced and not very good. The staff is rude, I ordered a sandwich with no peppers and it was smothered in peppers. I had been to the one on McKellips and was happy. The Country Club is somewhere I will never go again."}
{"text":"I tried Tom's for the first time today in my qwest for tasty barbecue close to home.  I had a brisket sandwich with fries.  The brisket was tender and smokey.  I just happen to not be a fan of sweet BBQ sauce and Tom's sauce almost bowled me over with the smell and flavor of cinnamon or nutmeg in the sauce.  The only other sauce option appeared to be hot.  I would have scored this place better if there was another sauce option.  Other than that the establishment was clean and the staff friendly.  I would definitely recommend this to people who enjoy the sweet BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I was just out for a walk and the wonderful aroma just hung with me as I walked by.  That's just how good BBQ is: it grabs you.

Like another reviewer said, the music sets the ambiance, and the staff are super friendly and attentive. Love Love LOVE the classic blues as we're eating.

I got a burnt ends sandwich and fried mushrooms. Reasonable pricing on the combo, and huge portion! The sandwich was a little salty, but that's what I expect film what was in it. The mushrooms are like a cross between hush puppies and fried mushrooms in a beautiful way.

Very filling, and well worth it. I'd highly recommend them to anyone I know. And they sell their sauce too, so I could bring it home with me after my work trip!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good barbecue. I ordered the two meat meal with brisket and rib tips with macaroni salad and bbq beans for sides. The Brisket and rib tips were excellent. Perfect smoke flavor, nice crisp \"bark,\" and tangy sweet bbq perfectly coating the meat. The macaroni salad is amazing and the baked beans are good too.  I'm stuffed right now, yet craving more. Tom's is awesome. This is one great bbq joint, \"no butts about it!\""}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Took my family to this location for the first time and enjoyed all the food. Had the Family Pack - 2lbs of meat 2 sides and Corn bread. The place is small and comfortable and simple. We has the hot links and rib tips for the meats with mild BBQ sauce and it was delicious. The baked beans were very tasty and the coleslaw was very creamy ( no puddle of water). The cornbread wasn't dry and has really nice sweetness to it - loved it. I highly recommend this joint. They also have several other locations we have not tried yet."}
{"text":"Very good food! I am not sure why someone said on another review that the beans were gross. They are rich and very good. The fries are fresh. I got a pulled pork sandwich. I could not eat it all. My husband got a sausage sandwich and beans with potato salad. All was very tasty. I would recommend this place. Both of us ate for $22. Drinks and all."}
{"text":"I came here finally having lived in the valley for 25 years, ordered chicken BBQ sandwich, my boyfriend ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich. Pulled pork was way too moist, and not in a good way. Almost like it was sitting in water. Not appetizing. The BBQ chicken sandwich wasn't the best but not the worst either. The Mac n cheese was made with nacho cheese which I think is disgusting. The only thing I would recommend was the kids hot dog which is Vienna beef! Service was great though! Meh."}
{"text":"I used Tom's BBQ catering for my husband's birthday party at our home in North Scottsdale.  Rick was very helpful in planning the menu. The food arrived exactly at the committed time, and was piping hot.  Our guests loved it!  The chicken breast, pulled pork and ribs were excellent!  I will definitely use Tom's again."}
{"text":"Everything is great except for the fried wings. The wings are very bland and have no flavor. The BBQ WAS Incredible, the beans, mashed potatoes, gravy, and oh the onion strings are incredible."}
{"text":"Good flavor sauce.
Pulled Pork is sad.
It's excessively moist, like water was added to increase volume/weight.
The taste of the pork alone was unimpressive.
The \"Hot\" sauce doesn't even have a bit of nip of fire.
So many other barbecue places in the Valley that have flavorful meats and sauces."}
{"text":"Really delicious! A little pricey but definitely great quality food full of flavor. Great service as well."}
{"text":"It's ok here. Nothing great. The potato salad and slaw appears store bought and not homemade. The pulled pork was VERY salty and tasted like it was repeatedly heated up."}
{"text":"This review applies only to this location. Two of the Tom's BBQ places are owned by the father, and two are owned by the son. This location is owned by the son.

Companion and I arrived for lunch. Companion ordered the chicken sandwich, jalapeno mac and cheese, a brownie, and a drink.

I ordered a burnt end sandwich, cole slaw, and a drink.

Our first problem was that unlike the fathers locations the sons do not accept Amex. One would expect that in a chain using the same name the same rules would apply. We found a table and in due course our food arrived.

Companion's chicken was overcooked and dry. Some of it was left behind as being unpalatable. Next was the mac and cheese. Unfortunately, it too was way overcooked with the noodles being just mush. It was taken home in the hopes that refrigerating it might firm it up and at least allow it to be deep fried. The brownie was the highlight of the meal, being a nice portion of cake with an excellent chocolate flavor and texture.

My burnt ends lived up to their name and were truly burnt. Having eaten burnt ends in many places before, I was familiar with what they were supposed to be, and the burnt refers to being seasoned and cooked twice. They are not usually dry and/or actually burnt. I ended up covering them in BBQ sauce so that I could get them down. The cole slaw was excellent and seemed to be the same recipe used in the other stores.

The restaurant was reasonably clean and the restrooms (which are quite unusual) were properly stocked and reasonably clean.

I was fairly disappointed on this occasion as I have eaten at other Tom's and never  had food like this.

Two stars for a reasonably clean experience and a great brownie."}
{"text":"Had the brisket the other day not too bad a little on the pricey side but not bad we saw the Italian roast beef on the menu and it  sounded good so we tried it  but it was horrible dry and bad  so no stars for the roast beef and three for the brisket"}
{"text":"I used to eat at Tom's years back, and coming back here for lunch, everything's pretty much the same.  They do have the new addition of sugar free bbq sauce, which is very nice.  The burgers are decently sized and satisfying, and the fries are a perfect addition to eat with it.  The Italian beef sandwich, compared to others I've had in Arizona, is a good value, but I don't think it's necessarily the best Italian beef here.  The sandwich automatically comes with peppers which is nice, and is full dipped for you.  The broth was a little saltier than say, Lobby's, and there wasn't as much beef in the sandwich, although the beef itself seemed more tender.

The last time I ate their bbq sandwiches was years back, so I'll have to come here again to try out their bbq items."}
{"text":"GOT A CRAVING FOR SOME GOOD SMOKEY BBQ?!  

Well come on down to Tom's BBQ!  Sauce so good, make you wanna slap yo mamma!

I've been having a craving for some really good bbq and tender meat.  So, I jumped in my ride and drove my big 'ol booty cross town to Tom's.  Lucky for me, I got to meet Rick, the owner, this time around.  He was very upbeat, friendly, and outgoing.  Funny thing was he had a meeting the next day with Yelp.  Awesome!  

The food and service was amazing as always.  I enjoyed some left overs as well the next day."}
{"text":"I only get out here a few times a year and am always delighted at how good this place is. The Italian beef rules!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years, love the rib tips, catfish & pulled pork. Must eat when you check out Tom's BBQ!"}
{"text":"Tom's BBQ in Mesa has the feel of a fast food restaurant. As you can see from the image I provided I had the brisket, mild barbecue sauce, baked beans, and coleslaw. I thought the amount of barbecue sauce served overwhelmed the brisket. I would've preferred to just add my own sauce to the brisket and get more of the traditional barbecue flavor from the brisket. Because of this I didn't rate the restaurant as highly as I might have. They offer barbecued meats by the pound, you have to ask if they will sell by the quarter pound and a half pound. Even a half pound $9.99 for the brisket was a bit high I thought, when really what I wanted was two or three types of meats, coleslaw and baked beans for about $15.99. I am aware of some other barbecue places around town that are a bit more progressive and or competing for their business. I think they would do well to consider a transformational update in this store, in an effort to regain the competitive spirit I believe they once had."}
{"text":"The proprietors are trying really hard to have excellent service in a clean, well organized restaurant, so I'm giving them three stars, even though the food probably doesn't merit it.

I had their ribs yesterday. I took them naked with mild sauce on the side (hot is also available). The sauce was thick and sweet, but I didn't care too much for the flavor. It had too much tomato flavor and didn't seem particularly well-balanced. The meat was plentiful but not so tasty. It was tough and stringy, without much taste even though it had been seasoned. I really wanted to like their ribs because they were so nice when I ordered, but I just didn't care for them.

I also ordered a side of mashed potatoes without gravy. They were sort of bland, but silky smooth. In fact, they were so smooth that I wonder if they were from a mix, but I couldn't tell so I'll give them credit for blending them well. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have cornbread."}
{"text":"Awesome \"naked\" pulled pork! You can ad your own sauce too. We did take out. Dani helped us with our order super friendly and knowledgeable. Girl knows her Q Make sure you sign up for text rewards!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Bath too is hidden and fun. Menu is big. Lots of options. Specials are well priced. BBQ sauce is served hot. 

The best part is the food!!!  Absolutely AMAZING. Great smokey flavor."}
{"text":"Well, Yelp... My wife and I didn't feel like heating up the house by cooking again and we decided to get take-out from one of our favorite barbecue places, Tom's. Instead of getting the same old standby, I decided to try the Italian beef this time. I was hoping for the best but expecting the worst, as to not get my hopes up. I got it with the spicy stuff on top that I won't attempt to spell. This was an amazing Italian beef! Not only was the size large but the bread was delicious as well and able to hold up to the weight of the sandwich. I'll be back for the Italian beef again... You're missing out of you don't try it!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, excellent service. Had a half rack of ribs and could barely finish it. Sauce is a little sweeter than I like, but no real complaints. I left full and happy."}
{"text":"Am just recovering from severe food poisoning from this place. I should of know from the taste. I kept slathering on theyre yucky bbq sauce to try to get it down. I'm sure it was the chicken...it had no smoke flavor and bland, and the only item that the others didn't have. The smell was great outside, but the food was awful. Beans are sweet...Glad we didnt have an elderly person or a child...NOT WORTH IT!!"}
{"text":"This is a local favorite from what I heard. I was in the neighborhood and wanted to try it. It's a small place but the feel is so inviting and friendly and they have the \"A\" on the window which means they get a clean bill from food inspectors which is always a plus to see. The menu is really good from sandwiches to meals. I tried the pulled pork sandwich with Cole slaw and macaroni and cheese. I believe they make their own barbecue sauce and it's really good. The pork was moist and piled on a potato bun. Adding the sauce made it even better. I'm a Cole slaw snob so I'm really picky and this was super good. The Mac and cheese however was not a favorite of mine. I took a bite and it tastes like pasta mixed with velveeta cheese.  It wasn't good and I sent it back and got a mother Cole slaw. All in all my experience was really good. The barbecue is super good. I'll be returning for sure to try the Rob's."}
{"text":"Was expecting more from all the reviews and hype, great customer service good music. Let's get to the bar b q, I had the burnt ends rib sandwich my girlfriend had pulled pork sandwich was not good at all my ribs were so salty I don't understand what they were going for? If you want real bar b q try trap Haus in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in the valley  the ambiance is unique I know this sounds funky but be sure to check out the restrooms. The music is bluesy and not too loud. The service is friendly and takes reasonable time. Great for kids."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, tried the rib tips they advertised (down deep in Chicago).  Old, dried meat with fat and grizzle.  Not the tips from the bone ends.   I am not sure what their definition of \"rib tips\" were, but they weren't anything like what I have experienced.  Tips are the small ends of the back, not center cuts.  Really didn't taste like pork either.  I would never ever go there again.  $16.00 wasted."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ place! 
I usually get the Jumbo Brisket sandwich and spicy BBQ sauce with fries but everything on their menu is delicious. If you are man enough try to take on the full house!!!

{"text":"The BF and I went here last night for dinner and it was pretty good. The place is really close to our house, so I'm surprised we hadn't been here before, but we had a living social deal that was on the brink of expiration so we had to go use it! This restaurant is fairly cute inside with adequate seating and a neat looking phone booth thing in the back. I ordered Tom's favorite sandwich or something like that. It had pulled pork with onions, hot peppers, some sauce, amongst other unidentifiable foods. I thought the sandwich was tasty, but the bread was really wet and the whole thing was falling apart. The BF got a bbq pork sandwich and it was good, not the most flavorful sandwich in the universe, but not bad. Despite this not being the most exciting place to eat, I will definitely be back because it is close to my house and they have vienna beef hotdogs (which is what I'm totally getting next time....yum!)."}
{"text":"I work pretty close so I go to Tom's all the time. Pulled pork sandwich and the No Bones About It platter are awesome. Not a fan of the rib tips though... Quick service and a decent price."}
{"text":"Pretty good Italian beef, little dry, but good.  Fries were a tad over cooked.  Peach cobbler was not best ever, but good.  The best part was the hidden bathrooms!  The womans bathroom was hidden behind an old phone booth.  The mens, behind a fake soda machine."}
{"text":"I like Tom's.  It's good, serviceable BBQ.  The portions are reasonably generous, the sides are good (I particularly like their potato salad, though I'm not sure they make it themselves.. whatever it is, it's good).  But I can only give Tom's 3 stars because their BBQ sauce is utterly uninspired.  Not bad, mind you, just not... inspired.  The brisket, pulled pork, and hot links are my usual fare.  Lots of potential for improvement here, but not bad as is.  I'll keep coming back because the place is clean, friendly, and not a franchise operation.  3 stars on the Brak-o-Meter, but it's a solid 3+."}
{"text":"Sorry Tom. But this ones for you. It's all about the food and service for me. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with onions strings. Very friendly service at the register. I got my food very quickly. It was a Tuesday and kids eat free on Tuesdays! Love that. But when I got my food my pulled pork sandwich was super soggy, when you bite into the pulled pork sandwich it's a mixture of water juices and soggy bread with a load of BBQ sauce on 1 side of the sandwich. So I got myself some extra BBQ sauce and tried picking this thing up to eat it and it just falls apart everywhere. This is a sandwich you will most likely need a fork for. If you like licking your fingers and making a mess, go for it! The onion strings were good, really greasy and I would prefer needing to be a little crispier...but they were good. All in all the service is great very nice staff, very nice place.i will need to test out the brisket next.... And then the ribs. This is strike one, maybe they can make a home run with me next time."}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley all my life.  Personally not much of a \"BBQ guy\" myself but Tom's BBQ changed all that. Their delicious pulled pork sandwich with a spicy BBQ sauce made me smile from ear to ear.  Their courteous staff, great pricing and laid back comfortable dining area forever changed the way I feel about BBQ.  I Would highly recommend Tom's 
BBQ to all of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Food was well priced and you got a lot of it! Service was great and the people were friendly. The atmosphere was positive and the location is central to several different things you would want to do. The food was ok, I would eat here again and give it a second try!"}
{"text":"Here's my take.  The BBQ is good.  I sampled the ribs, rib tips and the brisket.  The sauce, however, is average.  For me personally, it could use a little more acid (vinegar).  The hot sauce (not BBQ) is pretty good.

The Italian beef is very tasty and the fried mushrooms and pickles are great.  My brother had the fish and chips, which seem odd at a BBQ joint, but he enjoyed them.  I saw a sign that said they have all you can eat fish and chips on Fridays.

There's also some food challenge which includes 3 sandwiches and 2 fried sides.  Finish it and you get $32.  It doesn't seem that daunting to me, but it looks like there are only a handful of winners."}
{"text":"In impressed! 6/3/14 The staff were less than happy to see me. The sandwich was small and there is too much cinnamon in there sauce. The pulled pork was lacking flavor. Fries were ok."}
{"text":"Honestly kind of a let down. I had the pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes. Let's start with the atmosphere, it's cool. They have a huge menu and large list of sides. So we order, we get our food and start digging in. To say it was greasy was an understatement. This thing was leaking. I asked for the hot bbq sauce and to be honest it wasn't that hot. It was extremely tame and barely even spicy which was disappointing. Now don't get me wrong it was tasty but if I'm getting the hot version i expect it to be hot. Now on to the side. I got mashed potatoes and honestly they were pretty unseasoned and the gravy tasted bland. Overall it wasn't horrible but it also wasn't making me do backflips."}
