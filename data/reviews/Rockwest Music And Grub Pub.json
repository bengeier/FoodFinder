{"text":"Not a bad place to stop in for a few beers. Their alcohol prices seem to be a little high for the atmosphere.  Food is always good."}
{"text":"I've been to Rock West twice now, once around midnight on a Friday night to see Pop Rocks (a pop music cover band, self described as playing pop music in a hard rock/metal style) and this weekend to see the Brownies play.

Friday night was PACKED, we were barely able to make our way to the bar (which is literally right to your left when you walk in the door) to get a drink and the floor was extremely sticky when we walked in. On top that (...and maybe this is just me getting old) there were a bunch of kids who looked to be *maybe* 21 standing outside smoking, and then everyone inside was obnoxious drunk. Up side? There was a lot of great people watching to be had. Very, very odd mix of people and this could very well be because of the band that was playing, but still I wasn't impressed. We left after probably 30 minutes, again... I'm getting old.

This Sunday, we headed out to Rock West to see the Brownies play. For all away games this season 92.3 sends Adam \"the Bull\" out to work the crowd. We got there early (noon) thinking that the place would already be packed. Um, not so. It was near empty and we were able to get a great seat with a view of the big screen for the game. The boy toy is all about Twitter lately, and had seen a tweet earlier in the day about a certain adult film star that would be making an appearance at Rock West and we immediately recognized her when we walked in. I guess she will be there for all Brownies games, so get out there and get your signed photos, guys! Another perk, and I'm unsure if this is for the whole season - but Rock West is giving out *FREE*, yes you read that right, FREE beer for every Browns touch down. It's PBR and it comes in a blue solo cup - but its free! How fabulous. I guess RW isn't banking on the Browns doing much scoring this year. Anyways...

On to the food. I had checked on the menu on their website before we headed up there and I was super jazzed to try out the Rockin' Red Curry Chicken salad or the Totally, Pad Thai because both sounded delish. When we got there? Neither of those items were to be found and neither were any of the other seemingly \"fancier\" options. What? So, we talked to our waitress (who also ended up identifying herself as the owner) and she filled us in that the menu had recently been revamped and while it had not included fried foods before - it was now chock full of fattening fare. Yick. I was dissappointed, but maybe the revamp was to pull in a different clientele, or maybe the higher class dishes just weren't hoofing it at RW, but either way I was sad about it. It's just another bar now, with just another bar food. So, we sucked it up and ordered some Teriyaki Wings, a chicken caesar salad, fresh cut chips with carmelized onion sauce for dipping, and the special of the day - the Cowboy burger. Here's the breakdown:

Teriyaki Wings - they were good, reminiscent of Winking Lizard and were just the right amount of crispy;
Chicken Caesar - waaay too salty, I don't know if it was like regular Sysco caesar dressing or something they concocted there, but it tasted like I was eating a salt lick, the salad's one redeeming quality was the chicken, I will not order this again;
Fresh Cut Chips and Dipping Sauce - yum, the chips were good and there were a few of those under cooked bubbly ones that are soft AND crispy and wonderful, the dipping sauce tasted like old Lawson's chip dip and I liked it a lot;
Cowboy Burger - it was tasty, the burger was done exactly as the boy ordered it (medium), the bun was nice and toasty, the fried pickle chips and BBQ sauce on top made it a fab choice (it also comes with fresh cut fries, and those were A+ as well).

All in all, it wasn't a horrible experience, I had a good time at RW but there wasn't anything outstanding or stellar about it. The owners are nice and the free beer is good, but aside from watching the Brownies with some 92.3 fans or heading out to see a band once in a while, I don't think this will be a regular haunt of mine.

Check it out for yourself and see what you think.

Oh yes, I forgot to mention there were people with kids in there for the game so its not like a down and dirty joint and also there were some after church goers as well, so a good variety of people. Ok, that's all for now."}
{"text":"Am I really the first to review? Rockwest (the old Savannah's) is fantastic. They did a great job renovating and changing the format up a bit. The food is outstanding. Where else can you get a ginormous fish sandwich? Make sure to get the poppers as a starter.  Great place for kids as well; my son was surprised with an entire baggie of crayons, activity pad, toys, etc. Aside from the great food and friendly staff, come at night too - the new bands they are bringing in are awesome! Definitely a good time."}
