{"text":"This was hands-down the worst restaurant I have ever been to.  I've never shit so much in my life, and I've been to Thailand. Thanks Honest Lawyer!  On the plus side, a couple of the waitresses had nice cans."}
{"text":"I don't usually jump to a 1 star review because every place can have an off day.   It's different if it's every day.  The beer is flat....if they give you the right beer. My bf had a hard enough time trying to get a beer that wasn't flat, I didn't bother telling them they gave me the wrong beer. The basic foods are good, but there's nothing made in house. I asked about a few dishes that are my 'go-to'; the server was honest and admitted they were not made in house. Blah.  The service was ok, but it's been practically empty every time I've been there.  That location must be cursed, nothing there seems to last."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment to say the least. My friend Stephanie and I went to have a girls meal together after not seeing one another for a long time. We ordered food which took at least 50 minutes (we thought they had forgot) to arrive at our table. We were a bit shaken but I'm not one to complain so we started eating it. The chips I had ordered were rock hard and disgusting and the sandwhich was miniscule and just plain bad.   I never ask for discounts but I couldn't bring myself to pay almost 30$ (overpriced) for such a terrible meal. I complained and got us a slight discount but never again. We overheard others complaining as well - its just plain bad."}
