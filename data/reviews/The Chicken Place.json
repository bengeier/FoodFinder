{"text":"Ordered a whole chicken a la carte a few days ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Very similar in taste to Portuguese chicken with a unique sauce on the side. Move over Swiss Chalet !!!"}
{"text":"The pulled chicken sandwich is amazing...but yes call ahead this is not a fast food joint,good food takes time to make . Little in the pricy end but considering the quality of food it's worth every minute."}
{"text":"This place is always so busy, call ahead and still wait. Chicken is pretty darn good though , better option then say like Swiss chalet, which seems to be the only Other choice around here..."}
{"text":"I don't understand why Yelp removed my initial review of this food place - was it because it was a negative review ? Well I am going to say it again - terrible service so I will not return here again.  All in all I would have given it a 0 star if it were possible"}
{"text":"This is by far the best take-out food I have ever had in my life. I live over an hour from here but anytime I come to the area I am sure to make a special stop to have lunch here. I bring anyone and everyone to this place and every person I have brought here has also LOVED their food! I get the quarter chicken with potatoes. I love the sauce! Plus it comes with a pop! Always call ahead as they make everything fresh. It is NOT fast food. My mouth waters just thinking about it.......mmmmmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmm"}
{"text":"It has been a while since we ordered from this, our \"go to\" place for delivery chicken. What happened?!? Turns out they were bought out a few years ago. Now called \"Idee Mama Chicken Place\"   What a difference in quality and service!   Have taken them off our list :( (Wonder where the previous owners went... cuz I'd follow them if they're still in TO.)"}
{"text":"Pulled chicken sandwich is my go to item here, get it made spicy! The chicken is nice and flavourful, and the aioli they put on is amazing. The staff are really nice & helpful.  The chicken may take a bit to cook, but its well worth it because its nice & fresh. The fries are fresh cut and taste amazing.   Have had family meals a couple of times, and the serving sizes for the sides are pretty large. The spicy Piri Piri sauce tastes amazing.   Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese Chicken I've ever tasted! I love going to this family owned and operated restaurant.  You can sense their pride in the atmosphere, service and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great food, great people. The food and sides are always delicious, highly recommended if you feel like Portuguese chicken. The potatoes are just awesome.."}
{"text":"Got the 1/4 chicken dinner. I didn't know that chickens even came this small. Add some soggy fries, sauce with the consistency of jelly, and a stale bun, and welcome to the chicken place. My first and last time."}
{"text":"Came here on an evening and ordered the chicken club sandwich (comes with fries). Sandwich was huge and had lots of chicken pieces. Chicken was moist even though it was rotisserie. Fries were nothing out of the ordinary- average. Service was fast and the lady serving was friendly.   The place has three tables that each seat 4 people so the place is quite small. The jazz radio channel was chosen as background music which was kind of odd (in combination with a chicken and fries joint) but was relaxing.   I overheard one of the people ordering complaining about the coleslaw (which apparently is not made in house but bought). Thank goodness I stayed away from the coleslaw!"}
{"text":"Great chicken sandwich, spicy wedges are delicious. The portion is pretty large, making it a good value. Service was very friendly. The restaurant itself was small, so I wouldn't go in with a group larger than 4. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"It's easy to drive by this place without ever knowing it is there. Their sandwiches and fries are great. I always get the chicken sandwich (not to be confused with the Chicken Burger, which I'm not a fan of) and another sandwich that comes with sourdough (if I remember correctly)"}
{"text":"Brother ordered club sandwich with a poutine instead of fries, there is no substitutions so he was charged combo price and poutine cost. This took a while to figure out when ai asked about the $20 cost for a combo. I tried to ask just for a sandwich so I could have said brothers fries but she kept trying to charge me for a combo and didn't understand what I was trying to tell her, ugh. I gave up and didn't bother.  Had brothers fries, they were decent. His sandwich looked great, he said it tasted that way too lol.  Will go back but will order a combo with gravy on the side to avoid extra charges and miscommunication.  *went back, sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. i went to The Chicken Place on the recommendation of my very beautiful daughter and fellow yelper, I am glad I listened.  This Chicken Place should not be considered fast food, it is prepared to order and you must expect to wait for your food, the wait is worth it.    When I finally got my order about 30 min later I rushed home to bring my family dinner and they were hungry.  Every one loved it,  the chicken was moist and full of flavour we could not stop eating until it was all finished.  If you love BBQ chicken this place is for you."}
{"text":"Checked for something in the area. Ordered delivery standard 45 mins came right when it was supposed to. The fries are tasteless, the wedges are OK nothing special, the honey garlic wings were absolutely terrible. Like inedible. No flavour. Seemed like they were sitting out for a long time very gross. The burger was the best out of these things and even then it was a 6/10. Would never ever ever even consider ordering food from this place again considering the whole ordeal cost me almost $40 and all I ate was the burger. I could have gotten a $40 burger at a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill ever since it was sold to new owners a few years ago. The original owners were Iranian and made sure every order was to perfection. The very last time I went to order take out was a few years ago, the lady owner messed up our order and because of that experience after being a long time regular (even with new ownership), I decided not to spend my money there anymore. The order was ceasar salad, large order of onion rings and chicken souvlaki dinner. Souvlaki was fine, ceasar salad was drenched in water hence the dressing wouldn't stay on, and last but not least, we got home to find out the onion rings were missing altogether. It was a Sunday evening so by the time we picked up and left, she had already closed up shop. I haven't and will not go back. Not even to get my already paid for onion rings. Sadly, a great local business down the drain. If only the original owners never sold it..."}
{"text":"*beware* this place is extremely slow, they even have a sign saying \"this is not a fast food restaurant, please be patient\".  I'm sure this is a result of people complaining but this place seems like a fast food type of restaurant.  Although I appreciate how they grill their chickens fresh but it could be faster.  I waited like 20 minutes for my order of half chicken.  I can't imagine how long I would have to wait if there was a line up.  Even for a full serve restaurant, I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes for my half chicken.  The chef later told me that I should call in next time before coming to pick up, I think even she realizes how slow it was.  One final note is that the quarter chicken portion is way too small, a better deal is to get the half chicken for like 2 dollars more but portion almost doubles."}
{"text":"Chicken place is the BOMB.  My boyfriend and his group of friends have been ordering from this place for years, and when we started dating about a year ago, he couldn't believe I'd never had it before.  I've never been in person, so this review is on delivery only.  They're friendly on the phone, one guy is a total boss, the other sometimes confused, but the food always arrives quickly and hot. I almost always order \"The Chicken Place Sandwich.\"  It's pulled rotisserie chicken, garlic mayo and pickles. That's it. Griddled between some tasty sub roll action. The mayo melts, the pickles stay crisp - it's a really happy place.  We order greek salads, which are good, as well as the spicy fries which are definitely frozen and completely delicious - I've got a soft spot for frozen potatoes.  All in all, if you're in the northern end of the city and looking for an easy tasty dinner, give them a call!"}
{"text":"Tried the whole chicken with 4 medium sides. The chicken was great and the medium sides are larger than most places large sides and excellent to boot. Great value too even compared to the big Ontario chicken chain.  Fair Warning: Call ahead with order to avoid wait."}
{"text":"Pulled chicken sandwich combo is to die for!! Piri piri sauce is coming home with me. Finish your meal with custard tart and you'll be happy you did!! The staff will see me here often."}
{"text":"Tasty Portuguese chicken and piri piri sauce, portions are small for the price. You will need to call ahead at least half an hour if they are not busy or over an hour when they are busy for your order to be ready. Expect a very long wait if you just show up there, they can be a bit unorganized at times."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from the chicken place over the last five years. Can't go wrong on any of the orders. Chicken is always tasty and the fries are always fresh. Side orders never disappoint. Recommend this place to a bunch of people. Happy a couple of my in-laws stumbled upon this place. I can honestly say it's the best Portuguese chicken North of College Street."}
{"text":"This is my goto place when I don't want to cook. The wings are excellent and priced right. But my favourite is the roast chicken.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"So long Nandos, Hello Chicken place!!! I had all but given up on Portuguese chicken here in the Burbs. Either it was too expensive OR the portions were meager and the chicken was boney. Who would have that my first visit to The Chicken Place after driving past it suspiciously for the past 3-4 years would completely turn my world upside down.  It's not an extravagant looking place, just a simply decorated take-away joint with just enough bar stool style seating around the perimeter for those (like me) who know they cannot wait to get home before stuffing their faces.  Coming in for a late lunch I knew what I was looking for and ordered it swiftly from the menu: 1/2 Chicken, Parisian Potatoes and a Caesar salad. I will note that the price factor here was at or slightly above what I was used to paying for Portuguese Chicken but as the staff member said \"you get what you pay for here, nothing less.\"  A bold statement in my books, many make the claim and few deliver. More on the food in moments...  One thing I noticed in the restaurant was the repetition of the statement both on signage in store and by the staff \"we are not a fast food, please be patient.\" I knew something good was cooking here once I read and heard this - who would make such a claim only to serve poor food? Not this place. Totally worth the wait!  After approximately 15-20 minutes my chicken, potatoes and salad were ready. The 1/2 chicken was plump and juicy and packed with meat, one of the most moist I've had and not to mention it was covered in a sweet and spicy sauce on the outside - perfectly glazed. More than the generous chicken portion was the portion sizes of the  potatoes and  salad in my Caesar.   The potatoes deserve high marks as well, perfectly cooked on the outside with a slight crisp and almost a mash potato center (that soft!!!). The last thing of high honor for me here was there PeriPeri sauce, clearly made in house and with 3 levels of heat (sweet, medium and Hot - I chose HOT...obviously) there is a delicious sauce for every ones taste.  I'm so glad I finally made the trek in here to this conveniently located Aurora take-away shop located at the corner of Industrial Parkway and Wellington Ave. My new fav chicken joint in the burbs - I HIGHLY recommend you try this spot - AMAZEBALLS!!  Protip: Due to their prep time to perfection staff encourages you to call ahead and place your order so its ready upon arrival.   21/30"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path this place has the best meal deal in town...  Two whole flame roasted chickens, two salads, fries, bread rolls and gravy... better flavour than the supermarket chickens... and no where near as salty as that ski cabin place. The wings that we have tried so far (honey garlic and hot) are good too...."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian lunch combo - goat cheese grilled panini with mushrooms and onions with a side of fresh cut fries. Delicious! Hearty portion that did me two meals. Would definitely go back and recommend."}
{"text":"Was just about to order the Tuesday night Chicken special, BUT according to their website, that special doesn't exist anymore.  Combined with the declining quality of the food, chopped up ground chicken instead of freshly pulled chicken meat on the sandwiches, etc. you can now consider me an EX-customer, and, like another reviewer, I'd love to find out where the old owners went so I could give them my business instead."}
{"text":"I totally forgot about this place! Havn't lived in the area in awhile but passed by here the other day and its just as good as I remember.  Delicious wings, and that chicken sangwich! to die for.  Support the little guy."}
{"text":"Chicken place sandwich is one of the best sandwiches in this city!! The Wedges are great over here. Family run business that deliver as well!!!"}
{"text":"Great to finally have good quality Portuguese style chicken north of Toronto. Call ahead to order as the chicken takes time to cook. You will enjoy. Love the hot sauce !"}
{"text":"I tried their Tuesday special ($18 + tax) - whole chicken, large fries, 4 dinner rolls, sauce. I'm definitely a fan. The yonge/sheppard area is lacking a standard chicken/ribs place and I'm glad I found this place.   The meal didn't blow my mind, but it was definitely what I expected. I like the seasoning on the chicken. Those grocery store chickens are dry and flavorless. This place does it just right. Not too salty. Just right. The fries are thick cut, which I like. The dinner rolls were not fresh but I don't really hold it against them. I would have paid $18 for the meal without the rolls anyways.   I studied their menu while I waited for my chicken. Their prices are decent. Not super cheap, but definitely not on the high end. They also have wings, fish and shrimp, ribs, and souvlaki dinner.   My first experience is good and I'm definitely happy to come again to try something else. The location is somewhat out of the way. It can be called a hidden gem. It's more of a takeout/delivery place. There are 3 tables in the restaurant if you really want to eat there."}
{"text":"If you work in the area, Chicken Place is one of the best lunch options around. I've only tried their pulled chicken sandwich; and only for takeout. I've always called in, so I never had to wait. The staff are really friendly, and quick. It's about $7, for a very filling, and hearty lunch. I do find it a little oily, so I don't have it often.   The chicken has a ton of flavour and and it's really a simple sandwich with not a lot of toppings (you really don't need it), and a good bang for your buck ."}
{"text":"Was in the area and needed some food. It was 5 min away and the reviews looked stellar so my wife and I headed over.  Easy to find and easy to order, staff is super friendly. There is 15-20 min wait, depending on your order, because everything is made per order. Definitely, more than worth the wait.  We ordered the quarter chicken with potatoes and Ceasar salad...and the Chicken sandwich combo (fries/drink) Bottom line, everything was awesome!! Best Chicken & Salad we've had in the GTA. Amazingly TASTY & FULL flavours with homemade  piri-piri sauce to die for. Our new GoTo place for Portuguese Chicken, A++"}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich is great! Piri Piri sauce is on point. Fries are always fresh! They also only drop them in the fryer when you arrive for the take out."}
{"text":"What can I say? This is a single stand alone \"mom & pop\" place. This place cooks the chicken over a grill. That delicious aroma of the chicken on the grill permeates the entire place. It's not rotisserie chicken. This is more a takeout place and slow cooking here so be prepared to wait for atleast 30 minutes if you walk in & order. But it's worth the wait for good Piri piri Portuguese chicken. The owner makes the Best piri piri sauce I've ever had in my opinion- I've tried other places & bottled versions but this guy has the #1 sauce in mild, medium or hot down to a flavourful condiment. Now the chicken is smaller than your standard chicken takeout places but that's the norm to me in any Portuguese BBQ places I've ever eaten at. (The same size at Nandos). You might want to order 2 whole chickens. As I'm writing this I'm salivating & think I'm going to call ahead & order dinner for the family. Oh I recommend you CALL ahead your order that way they can give you an approximate time to pick up your food. The side items I tend to get in my family meal are rice,potatoes & chickpea salad.  There are other items on the menu like choriço sandwhiches.- I've never tried anything else but the Chicken & side dishes because that's all I crave, but I'll get to the others one day."}
{"text":"Had their pulled chicken sandwich and my my it was perfection. Everything is made to order so it can take awhile but the wait is worth it. Open kitchen so you can salivate while watching them make your food. So good!"}
{"text":"In the area this afternoon and thought I'd drop in for a quick take-away. A cozy little shop, the chicken place offers up plenty of chicken based items, including wings, sandwiches and buckets. After deciding on the teriyaki chicken sandwich, I had to do a quick double take on the cash, which after some fiddling with the calculation came out to about $18.00 with tax. Over and above, the print asked for a tip, which was for takeaway? However, 10% seemed reasonable. After waiting about 10-15 minute, I got the goodies which included a big box of fresh fries (last thing I need) and a teeeeny sandwich.   Come on guys! $9.00 for the sandwich that was lost in a pool of mayo and mustard. Nothing about that sandwich made sense. A very subtle hint of sauce, lost in translation. The chicken was a very small amount, very dissapointing. I would suggest either losing the cost or bigger portions. The fries however, were fresh and the pedestrian service was pretty good.  First world problems with the portion aside, I think The Chicken Place has a lot of potential, but if the main attraction is chicken , then serving an anemic sad piece and passing it off as chicken may be the result of a identity crises. Guys, I'll give it another chance when I'm in the area next!"}
{"text":"The reviews had me thinking I had found my chicken place.  We ordered take-out...one souvlaki, three pounds of wings (the day's special), and a chicken sandwich.  Upon arriving home, was disappointed to discover the souvlaki was overcooked, with most pieces burned. Wings were average, a little on the small/lean side, and the chicken sandwich had an alarmingly high mayo-to-chicken ratio.    At $30 I might've tried them again...but it wasn't $30."}
{"text":"This place is small but you can dine in to eat. Wouldn't have known or seen this place if it weren't for yelp. My chicken club sandwich was huge and very tasty. The wedges and spicy fries are yummy and plentiful. My husband had the wings which weren't incredible but good and enjoyable. Too bad the delivery zone ends right at where we live but I would do the drive to do take out.  Will have to try their chicken place sandwich which other yelpers recommend."}
{"text":"Great chicken! Great sides. The sauce is worth its weight in gold. The  owner is friendly and always  welcoming. The staff is quick, efficient and they do a great job.    Love the fries and potato balls. The saffron rice goes well with the chicken.  I don't order the salad.   Every now and then they have the Portuguese custard tarts on the counter. Just can't resist them."}
{"text":"Wings!! Small small place in North York selling some good chicken wings.  The Chicken Place is a tiny place located next to some Korean small school. The place itself is located around nowhere. It's primarily a take-out place that also does some delivery. A place like this is the perfect place to come when you want some good chicken. The menu consists of rotisserie chicken, buffalo style wings, ribs, and some fish and chips (though the pictures don't make them seem appetizing). Now, I didn't get around to trying roast chicken because I love wings way too much. It's an addiction that won't go away and the only cure is more chicken wings.  The prices are no better than any other place to get wings though. Really hoping a small place like this would have some outrageously cheap prices, but no such luck. A pound of wings will run you about $10 plus tax. The wings are small but there are about 15 that come in a pound.   They do their wings a different way, in that they don't bread them and they come naked. They are marinated in a secret blend of sauces and spices. The wings are then deep fried in vegetable oil and served to you piping hot. Though the wings were small, I'm glad they give you a full pound by loading you up on quantity. As for the taste, they were wonderful. I loved the taste of these wings and thus far, they might even be the best tasting wings I've had in the GTA thus far (which isn't saying much). The medium sauce hits you with a nice spice that doesn't burn but adds ful flavor in every little morsel.  The place, I believe, is run by a small group of Koreans, and they were real friendly. I was also a tad disappointed that they didn't have individual combos that were cheaper. You will be hard-pressed to find anything below $10. The business wasn't booming at the time so she was able to answer all my questions. &nbsp;I would come back again if I were in the area. You can eat in if you like, as there are several small tables, but I would stick to take-out or delivery."}
{"text":"The food is OK, the wait and service is really poor, I haven't been back bc of the poor service"}
{"text":"With a name like \"The Chicken Place\" the chicken better be good!   It was!  I had the 1/4 chicken (dark) with a couple of choose-your-own-adventure sides. The sides were OK!  Good value food here"}
{"text":"Delicious! I always get the chicken place sandwich with spicy fries, the price is not bad either."}
{"text":"Not my first time eating at The Chicken Place and it won't be my last. This time we ordered take out for 20 people and everyone really liked it. I appreciate that The Chicken Place is not a fast food restaurant and the quality shows through, so yes you need to plan ahead and either call in your order or be prepared to wait while your meals are prepared. The sides are also high quality, fresh and healthy. Give them a try and I'm sure you will be back."}
{"text":"I agree with the last Yelper. This place is quite AWESOME.  The souvlaki dinner is the best in town. Big hunks of extremely flavourful chicken, tasty rice, a pita and tzatziki sauce. Enough to feed 2!!!  The chicken wings are also nicely made. Meaty not greasy. Better than most wings in the entire city.  Really!!  We can't get beyond ordering these 2 dishes because they never disappoint.  Service is always friendly. I think my voice is now instantly recognized because I've recently become a frequent caller. Delivery speed is decent (sometimes quicker than others). Guess it depends on their business volume for that night. Food is always piping hot.  If this place were a licensed restaurant, I would be there weekly. But since it's not, I pretty well order in weekly. Prices are very reasonable considering the amount of food you get.  All in all, it's Willowdale's best kept secret. It's a \"must try\"..."}
{"text":"Found this little gem on yelp and decided to give it a try. When it comes to Portuguese chicken we've only really had Nando's, which is a franchise. This was way better than Nando's. I loved how the chicken is made to order, though the wait can range up to 15 minutes, it was worth every minute. The chicken is fresh and the sides compliment the chicken well. Don't skip out on ordering extra home-made piri piri sauce! For sides I'd recommend the rice and the potatoes, however the salads seem popular as well."}
{"text":"2 and a half stars in my opinion. Overrated by yelp customers.  I got the Chicken place sandwich cuz everyone keeps recommending that but it wasn't even that dank. I think I'm better off going to Popeyes"}
{"text":"Driving to work each morning, I pass through Willowdale Ave and I always notice this yellow chicken shack.  Almost 3 years living in North York, I still hadn't tried them out yet.  It's such a small restaurant.  What would they have to entice me to go?  What do they got going on in that little hut?  Searched on Yelp and read the review from ANGIE C. below about ordering the Chicken Place (Grilled) Sandwich.  Impressed I was, she really liked it.  I went on their website and saw they have a wide range of food to choose.  Coming home, I was absolutely famished.  My stomach was eating itself!  I didn't want to stuff my gorge with anything super heavy.  I thought, the Chicken Place Sandwich...why the heck not?  I go into the little parking area in the back and get into the place.  A mother and young daughter were polishing off a pile of wings.  Surprisingly, they had 3 tables to eat on.  I check out the menu to the side and a lady comes out to take my order.  She lets me know that it'll be ready in 10 minutes.  Looking at the decor, it has a lot of jazz photos and artwork on the wall, Miles Davis and BB King. My guess is that the owner likes jazz?  The lady comes out with my sandwich in a paperbag, I take it to go and blaze on home.  Got home and unwrapped, it was still warm.  The sandwich itself was as flat as a pancake, just like the picture shows.  \"Here goes nothing\", and took a huge chomp.  Remember that this concoction has pulled chicken, garlic mayo and pickles in a sub-ish type bun... that's it!  I was not going to put my standards through the roof.  Anyway, back to the bite... mmm the sandwich is pretty decent!  Sure, it really is a plain 'ole Jane sandwich but something about it's tasty subtleness got me reeling!    Bun = Crispy! Chicken = Soft! Garlic Mayo = Creamy! Pickles = Crunchy!  Say what you want about this $5.99 small time sandwich from a small time shack, The Chicken Place has stuff to offer.  Don't be fooled!  They have a new customer in me.  I can't wait to taste much more food from their huge menu.  Thanks to Angie C. for reviewing!"}
{"text":"Limited seating for a non-fast food place, but that's not really a problem since most people get food for takeout. Best to call ahead to order and ask for takeout, since you will be waiting for your food to cook anyways.   I've had their pulled chicken sandwich, which was the best! Their quarter chicken dinner was better than average, but for the price seemed small. For sides I got the potatoes and Piri Piri sauce. Potatoes weren't special besides being round, but the sauce is great with the potatoes and chicken."}
{"text":"\"We are not a fast food restaurant, please be patient!\" is the theme at the chicken place.  They take awhile - it's also not a place where you would want to sit down and eat - they offer bar seating.    However, the food is great and such a welcome non-commercialized fare.  I prefer the chicken place to nandos and to swiss chalet/st hubert, etc etc.  You really are getting something akin to home made food when you go here.  I recommend calling ahead your order and picking up!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food. I took a chance after reading other people's reviews of this place.  Chicken very juicy! Taste is good. Looks like a small family run joint.  prices are relatively cheap too.   Renovations might put you off. they are just very very basic., but still clean. From the looks of it, the place used to be an office. You can tell from the ceilings and the layout. Strange that they let it convert into a restaurant."}
{"text":"Sorry but this is not the place for wings.  My wife and I go out occasionally for wings. We usually,, almost always go to Duff's.  A number of years ago we tried The Chicken Place for wings because it is conveniently close by our home. The wings were dissapointing. They were very small and dry whiole the accompanying sauces were nothing special. I do remember calling up the last time to complain about the fact that they weren't buffalo wings and the guy on the other end said that only sometimes do they have buffalo wings.  Recently my son said that The Chicken Place has very good take out food. He said they had great sandwiches and dinners.  He works close to the restaurant and some of his co-workers will get their lunch at The Chicken Place. I asked him how the wings were but did not know. I should have taken that as a sign.  Instead I had the urge to try the wings again and had ordered the 5lb special. Once again there was nothing special about this. They still advertised buffalo wings and these wings were definitely not. The biggest wing with the most meat was only 2cm in diameter at the widest part and 5cm long. Some wings were 8cm long but very narrow. They were mostly dry skin and bones. When meat was found it was mostly dry.  The bucket of carrot sticks and celery they advertize was more like lunch box size. They tasted alright but we were expecting to see a bucket as was advertized.  Sorry to report it this way but I wish I knew before shelling out $42. for skin and bones. The only reason I will give it 2 stars is because others like the other food that they have and because it has been around for a long time already. Otherwise I'd really give it only a half star if only for their wings."}
{"text":"It took me years to find out this place offers great selection after driving by for the past decade! We always order the CHICKEN PLACE SANDWICHES with EXTRA garlic mayo on the side. To DIE FOR!!! I can easily make this at home, but why go through the hassle when it can be delivered crispy with the right tang of pickles RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR or 10 mins for pick up.  We`ve tried the chicken souvlaki dinner but the kicker is that it doesn`t come with the greek salad (pay an extra $4 I think =( Chicken wings are good too. They got my order wrong once but the husband and wife who run the joint are very accommodating and always on par with their costumer service."}
{"text":"Got the low down on this place before hand so knew to call ahead and place my order. The food was delicious (had the pulled chicken sandwich) but I was slightly put off by the fact that I had spent $20 for lunch and was refused a side of mayonnaise. When I asked for it, they told me they didn't have or do that. They clearly had mayonnaise as it's in the sandwich and they have small side container to put it in, as they had some as the cash.  When I'm spending $20, give me a side of mayo or at least give me the opportunity to pay for it if I want!"}
{"text":"This place is located in same plaza as Domino's pizza in Aurora. It's a self serve place. Order and grab a seat; staff will let you know when your food is ready.   Chicken entree comes with 2 choices for sides. They offer a good variety of side dishes to choose from: rice, potato, chickpea and different salad variety. I would say chicken is above average, nothing to rave about and not bad either.   Cod cake was delish for $1.25/piece. Shrimp patty was not very good.  Portuguese tart was $2.10 which was not worth it IMO. Lunch specials are same price but come with free drinks.    Overall, ok food, friendly staff."}
{"text":"My finest memories growing up are running outside to bring my dad the kosher salt, or the tongs while he rotated the grill loaded with chicken. From time to time, he'd even let me rotate the grill: \"Devagar,\" (slowly) he'd warn me, \"the galinha (chicken) won't be good if you go too fast... good food takes time.\" So maybe it's these memories of growing up in an extremely Portuguese household that makes me a bit biased on what excellent Portuguese chicken should be like. I've lived in King City for almost two years, and have passed by The Chicken Place a number of times. The sight of a churrasqueira an hour drive away from my hometown where my family lives, but only 5 minutes near my current residence made me hopeful: would it be like Dad's? I was hopeful: so we ordered the works. 1  1/2 whole chickens, potatoes, rice, French fries, coleslaw and two containers of piri piri. Chourico, and two containers of shrimp. When we were told it was going to 30 - 45 minutes, I was completely fine with this, remembering what my dad said to me as a kid: good food takes time.   Maybe it was my high expectations, or my naïve belief that anything could be like my dad's, but this wasn't it. The chicken was curiously flavourless, missing that familiar faint taste of salt, those flavours that reminded me of my dad, and the Portuguese festas, and the family gatherings in parks. It was just...chicken. Overcooked chicken, that no matter how much piri piri I put on it, just didn't cut it. The shrimp was curiously oily, the potatoes bland, the French fries being the one thing I actually enjoyed.   Don't get me wrong, The Chicken Place isn't bad: but for almost $100 - I expected more: if not Dad's chicken, at least something that was reminiscent of the number of churrasqueira's I've frequented: something that would make me want more."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers!  Heard about this place through yelp & needed to order some Friday night take out.  Ordered ahead & when I got there staff was friendly and man with accent at front register I loved! He was so old school & said to sit right, they were working on my order.  I left the place with my order about to go into my car and he came running out with my chicken as I forgot it.  Thank goodness he was so attentive.  Loved the advice he gave me....to eat it all right away:) I picked up one of the family meals, one and a half chicken with sides. It was so yummy!  Wish we has more of these type of places in the burbs!  The piri piri was awesome.  We tried all three & everyone in the family liked them all. My fave is the sweet one as it's a bit thicker.  The chick pea salad was Devine & parissiene potatoes delish!  Loved it all. Will definitely be back & highly recommend.  Great value and taste!!"}
{"text":"The chicken place is great. I had been meaning to go forever and never got around to it. I'm so glad to finally wandered in one Saturday afternoon.   Location: It's located in the sunny suburbs of Aurora. On the corner of Wellington and Industrial. There's not a lot around. It's worth the drive.  Parking:  Well...it's an industrial area in the suburbs so no parking stress. Go ahead and drive!  Decor: On the outside its not much to look at. It's not exactly beckoning. It looks like it's a fast food place. It's not a fast food place though.  Inside you notice. No tables. There is a bar around the room with bar stools that you can sit at and eat. This is obviously a big take out place.  The room reminds me of Cora's with their farmy  city look.  Food: Omg. Delicious. Portuguese chicken that's cooked on a grill to order. They actually suggested that the next time we come in we should order ahead so it'll be done when we get there. Honestly, we didn't even wait that long. Not longer than any other restaurant.  We got the chicken. You can two sides. I got the quarter chicken with chickpea salad and tasted vegetables. The  chicken was terrific. Moist and juicy. It was grilled. I have no idea how they did it. The chickpea salad was super. I would definitely recommend it. The vegetables too. They were roasted/ grilled with a bit of char. What a difference the char makes.   My dining companion got the half chicken with rice and cucumber tomato salad. He really likes it too.  We were there in the middle of the afternoon and it was busy with people coming in and out for take out. It's a very popular place.   Price: Very good value for the amount of food you get!  Conclusion: Yeah, I gave it 5 stars. I'm going to be back!"}
{"text":"When we first moved to Aurora, this was a 4-5 star place -- we would bring it home for dinner for us and the children and be completely satisfied.  Unfortunately, I must say the last 3 times in a row we ordered from the chicken place, either my wife or myself had a case of food poisoning.   We think it has to do with the chicken not being fully cooked, as they throw a whole bunch on the grill and we did notice often times it was someone younger manning the station.   I am sad to say we will not be a returning customer, because it's simply been too many times in a row we had this issue...   Very unfortunate - our neighbors who also order from here also confirmed they have had bad diarrhea 2 times after ordering take out here and have since stopped coming.   If management reads this, please please reinforce some protocols on properly cooking the chicken to your staff -- many folks order from you and have young children at home who eat this."}
