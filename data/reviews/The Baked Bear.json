{"text":"I am huge sweets guy and Baked Bear is hands down one of the best. The idea is legendary and then they back it up with an amazing product. They could just serve ice cream cones and still be good! Seriously, that's how good this place. They could compete just on ice cream and then they have the idea of smooching it between a cookie and a brownie. 5 out 5 stars. Returning very soon."}
{"text":"This place is like Subway, but for Ice Cream Sandwiches. What I have described to you is next to achieving ultimate dessert nirvana."}
{"text":"Custom icecream sandwiches with a homemade cookie, doughnut and/or brownie. (Of course you can get just icecream too). I ordered salted caramel fudge and she recommended doing a combo sandwich with a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie. It was excellent, especially the brownie/icecream combo. Great texture and flavor of icecream. Cute shop with indoor or outdoor (misters) seating in a restatement/movie theater area of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of homemade cookies and delicious ice cream! They also have various toppings and combinations customized just for YOU! The service is also amazing! They are all very friendly! By far my favorite ice cream shop!!"}
{"text":"I'll summarize this in 4 words...slow,slow,bad service, average.  Just go to cold stone To start, it would've got 1 star if not for the fresh chocolate chip cookies. This dessert restaurant is overrated and even the water was bad, luke warm, no ice either. The ice cream is mediocre."}
{"text":"Delicious and worth the wait!  We ordered a Chocolate Chip Cookie with cookies & cream ice cream rolled in sprinkles.  So yummy!  My ten year old didn't finish it...pretty big ice cream sandwich.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream sandwiches. Even greater service from Jessica. Deserves a raise, always a smile on that face, skrt skrt"}
{"text":"Great treat on a hot summer night and reasonably priced considering what you get. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed and not worth the time spent in line!  Cookies were hard so ice cream slid out. Cone was empty with a small spoonful of ice cream balanced on top. Flavor was bland. Ice cream selection limited. Would have been better off using the time spent in line to drive to Baskin Robbins."}
{"text":"Great staff with some nice ice cream/cookie/brownie options. Been there 2x in the last few days. First time I was there was the pre-Grand Opening & ordered the cookie of the month which was incredible!  Mexican chocolate cookies (double chocolate with cinnamon) & a rocky road/mint chocolate chip sandwich heated. The next time I had an ice cream sundae, Mexican cookie with same ice creams & hot fudge.  Rob & Anthony are 2 very hard-working owners & thought Ginger was a terrific as well. Don't forget to tip the staff, they are hustling!"}
{"text":"Cookies are hard even when \"hot pressed\"   Cookies aren't soft or warm, just HARD pressed. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a killer spot!  Gourmet, build your own ice cream sandwiches? Yes please. Pick from your list of cookies (homemade), or brownies, or donuts and then your ice cream for the middle.  At night, expect a wait.  So glad Baked Bear made it to Phoenix! You gotta stop by."}
{"text":"Delish and affordable! Bit of a line but it moves pretty fast. Staff is friendly and efficient.  Cookies are perfectly cooked. I recommend hot pressed too."}
{"text":"So excited that it is finally open Scottsdale. We have always visited the original location in Mission Beach. Love, love, love this place. Fresh cookies with ice cream between them, then somehow they manage to warm the cookies without melting the ice cream. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I hope I'm not biased since I have a huge sweet tooth. I really don't think you have to have an obnoxious sweet tooth to like this place. It's pretty simple-If you like cookies, doughnuts, brownies, and ice cream there is nothing you won't like about this place. I got 2 funfetti cookies with cookie dough ice cream in the middle covered in fruity pebbles. The cookies were soft yet firm enough to hold the ice cream. You can also have your ice cream sandwich hot pressed to warm up the cookies. There's something here for everyone, you really can't do wrong if you like tasty, big, obnoxious ice cream sandwiches. I went on a weekday but I'm assuming they can get pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night. Just like any restaurant in Scottsdale. Not a ton of seating inside either."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time a week ago and we really enjoyed it. I'm not sure if I'm in the minority here, but the ice cream sandwiches are absolutely big enough to share. I got a combo with a brownie and cookie, and my husband got a traditional ice cream sandwich with two chocolate chip cookies. The cookies got super hard (because of the ice cream) which is to be expected.  I really liked the cake batter ice cream - way better than Cold Stone (and that's not a political statement, although it could be). One star knocked off because my husband's soy chocolate chip ice cream was not good. If The Baked Bear makes their ice cream in house - which is entirely probable - they should consider lactose-free milk... it makes for a much better product!"}
{"text":"Fun place. We asked for their favorite combo and they gave us a donut filled with birthday cake ice cream rolled in fruity pebbles and drizzled with frosting. Perhaps one of the best desserts I've ever had. Holy smokes! They are super nice and helpful. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in San Diego I ALWAYS stop by! Love this places prices, quality, options! Never the same thing and fun to play around with the possibilities!"}
{"text":"One of the best service experiences I have ever received, not to mention the cookie sandwich is amazing! I took my two year old son and nephew on an outing here, and wasn't thinking how difficult it would be to manage two boys of that age. One of them threw his water all over the floor in a fit of rage. The rage stemming from his cookie being all gone! The young lady working was so gracious during my embarrassing parental moment. She mopped up the mess, and was quite cheerful. Needless to say I'll be back, and without the naughty toddlers!"}
{"text":"The Baked Bear makes an amazing ice cream sandwich. They have an equally amazing super long line. It appears that one person works behind the counter in what can only be described as the most inefficient workflow possible.  The sad part about the super long wait is the fact that the excitement at the end makes it all worth it.  It has taken me about five minutes to write this review and I've inched up about three feet in line in this amount of time.  The review would be five stars if the wait wasn't so long."}
{"text":"YUM! Anything you order off of the menu will be delicious! Don't be afraid to mix and match your cookies and ice cream! Little bit of a wait but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Yummy place, good value, though personally I think Pizookies are yummier (and gooeyier) but this offers a ton more options to customize. I feel like that much ice cream makes the cookies almost freeze a bit and thus are harder to bite into even though they're soft before there's ice cream on them. I feel like the ice cream at cold stone is richer or creamier or something but I have a feeling the ice cream can't be quite so creamy or it wouldn't stay on the cookies. Also, if you dream of picking up your sandwich and eating it with your hands, don't get hot fudge etc on it or your hands will be covered in the sauce!  Kudos to employee Joshua, my boyfriend and I had never been here before and he was enthusiastic and patient while we explored the different options. You can tell he really likes his job and isn't just your average bored ice cream store employee behind the counter."}
{"text":"I love this place but, there are 3 things I dislike.   1. Line is torture at night. I went at three so the line was short instead of out the door. 45 minutes people had to wait.  2. They put way too much ice cream on the ice cream sandwiches. The ice cream falls out the back of the sandwich.  3.the portions are way too big in general. Even though it was delicious , I couldn't finish it . It was too sweet for it to be as big as it is."}
{"text":"Is Baked Bear really worth waiting for in line??  I can't tell because I'm still waiting here for the last 45 minutes...so after 1 hour and 15 mins of waiting in 103 degree weather outside, in my opinion it's not worth waiting for. I found out what the real issue of the long line! It's not because the ice cream is really good, it's because the servers have no sense of urgency.  They take their time like not realizing there are about 50+ people outside waiting in the heat on a Saturday night!!  In fairness to the servers, I'm pretty sure they're probably very tired servicing all these people.  No where in sight do I see a manager or at least the owner managing the craziness of their place.  Must be on vacation or sitting somewhere with central air...must be nice..."}
{"text":"We missed the free ice cream sandwich on Saturday.  But we still went to check them out on Monday, Memorial Day.  Pretty busy but the line was still inside the store and not out in the heat.  I had a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie on bottom, mint chip ice cream, and a chocolate chip cookie on top.  Maybe a little too much for one person but a very tasty sweet treat!  I love how simple they make it and the price is not bad.  Fun environment since they were kinda busy.  Total cost was about $8 for two of us.  Could spend that much on a Redbox movie that you forget for a few days."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an amazing ice cream dessert, try the Baked Bear. Not only do they have a large selection of ice cream and cookie flavors, but the portions are huge. We couldn't even finish ours. And for the price of under $4, you won't find anything better in Scottsdale.  We went on a Friday night in January, so I figured it would be dead...not so. I can't imagine how busy they get in the summer. Regardless, the staff was very nice and helpful. Definitely a fun place."}
{"text":"I'm more of a frozen yogurt kind of guy but Baked Bear is still pretty impressive. Very rich and tasty."}
{"text":"Cool concept. You select your cookies, ice cream and toppings. Resulting cookie is giant, probably would be reasonable to make this the meal itself rather than dessert. Very tasty but huge."}
{"text":"SO FREICKEN AMAZING!!! Baked Bear offers the best ice cream sandwiches there is. They have cones, bowls, and pizza cookies available too. I went in for my first time and the whole entire staff there was so friendly and had great positive attitudes. They have a great variety of ice cream flavors and cookies to mix and match. They even have brownies and donuts to make a sandwich.. HOW COOL?! I couldn't finish my sandwich while I was there so took it home and put it in the freezer. The next night the brownie and cookie were still so gooey and moist! I am definitely a recurring customer and cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The first time I went I got their ice cream sandwich with a chocolate chip cookie on top and their seasonal cinnamon twirl cookie on the bottom, all stuffed with the bear batter flavored ice cream.The creaminess of the ice cream along with the pieces of fudge inside was delicious. I decided to hot press my sandwich which made the cookies warm and gooey when I took each spoonful in. I did not have to wait in line too long and it was definitely a hot Saturday afternoon. The service was also great and you can even try each flavor before choosing the one you actually want to purchase. I also tried the birthday cake, strawberry and chocolate flavors, which were all pretty good as well, but nothing beat that blue bear batter. The nice part is that they also serve free water to help with all that sugar!   This place was so good that I came back a couple days later with a friend to have him try it as well and I ordered the same thing except I switched out the cinnamon twirl cookie for the smores, which was also satisfying.   Overall, the flavors of the ice cream are great and I will definitely be back with some more friends!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the ice creams however this place is tried for my husband based on the reviews here on yelp.   Completely agree with the negative reviews for this place. Their cookies are under baked and also their ice cream taste is not up to my expectations .Looks like this place got a hype which made me step in here and May not be a turn back place ."}
{"text":"Solid ice cream sandwich place. They offer an option to toast your ice cream sandwich, which isn't something I've seen before, so that was pretty cool.   One of my friends got the bear batter, which in my opinion, was a little too sweet.  It can get pretty crowded and they don't have much seating, so would be careful."}
{"text":"I'm coming back for the pumpkin spice cookie sandwich and Jakob with a J! This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place, totally different cookies with ice cream in the middle something i would of have never guess..Awesome..."}
{"text":"Attn Mgmt: Please hire more staff trained with a sense of urgency for weekend/high traffic days. I waited for one hour and by the time I ordered, there was no \"sorry for the wait\" or \"thanks for waiting.\" Also, I noticed that the staff working behind the counter were just leisurely working at a snails pace, despite the long line that went to the sidewalk.  The ice cream sandwiches were okay and hot pressed cookies were HARD. On the up side, great that you can customize your sandwich. Overall, so NOT WORTH waiting in line."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with cookies, brownies and ice cream!! The salted caramel fudge ice cream is so good!!!"}
{"text":"Omg yummmm... gluten free chocolate chip cookies, so I can build my ice cream sandwich ! Thank you :) Delicious cookie and ice cream! My so loved the donut ice cream Sammy too"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Cookie was nothing but sweet, ice cream was smooth but not creamy - doesn't have the rich flavorful milky taste like a good ice cream should. Few selection. Shop appeals mostly to kids and teens. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream and cookies. We got two cookie sandwiches. One with bear batter and a funfetti cookie and a donut. We also got a red velvet cookie and brownie sandwich with cake batter ice cream. They were so good.  The service was very friendly at first. It would have been 5 stars if it wasn't for this: At 9:40, 20 minutes before closing, this one girl starting taking the chairs from the dining area and stacking them. She also took the napkin holders off the table. New people kept on coming in and they had no where to sit. I work in the food and beverage industry and if an employee of mine starting closing the FOH 20 minutes before close, with a whole line of people waiting to order food, I'd want to know. There's no reason for it. It takes 5 minutes and if you do it while there is a whole lot of customers, it comes off as passive aggressive"}
{"text":"This place was disappointing.  After all the hype.  The cookies and brownies we poorly baked.  I ordered a cookie and brownie separately to see how they were without the ice cream.  The brownies we just okay, but were underbaked, cold and wet.  The chocolate chip cookie was cold, underbaked and grainy.  It reminded me of a food service product or something you would get in a grocery store.  The ice cream was okay.  We had a bear bowl and cookie sandwich, too.  We all agreed that there was nothing here that would make you want to come back.  You'd be better off going to Sweet Republic if you want something decadent."}
{"text":"Customer service can make or break a diner's experience. The employees here are rude and have bad attitudes for no reason. Do not plan on asking any questions about the menu, and make sure you have an easy order so they can follow or they will just give you a blank, confused expression, while trying to rush you along when there is no line at all behind you.   I ordered the bear batter ice cream (so good!) and had a red velvet cookie and funfetti cookie for the outside of the ice cream sandwich. I also got it heated up since other reviews stated the cookies are rock hard if it is not heated. The ice cream was really tasty and the cookies were soft yet chewy and flavorful.   I may go back in the future because I did enjoy the ice cream sandwich but still contemplating if it is worth the poor service and price."}
{"text":"Great service, I had a cookie/ ice cream/brownie sandwich in a bowl. Ice was amazing, others had the the half cooked cookie and brownie with ice cream, which was very yummy. I preferred the sandwich bowl over the half cooked cookie or brownie."}
{"text":"So pulled up on a Saturday night at 9 ..line was out the door ...figured I'd wait it out since I was already there.  Waited ONE HOUR in total for the sandwich.  Ordered the funfetti sandwich with vanilla ice cream and sprinkles.  It was ok nothing amazing .  The Funfetti tastes like a sugar cookie and not funfetti to me (I'm a funfetti freak).  Once inside girls were sweet they even gave my bf a freebie card for next time since they ran out of brownie bowls.  Id go again..however I wouldn't wait in the line."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the best ice cream sandwiches ever.  Fresh baked brownie on the bottom, a chocolate chip cookie on top with salted caramel and their signature\" bear batter\" ice cream.  We then topped it with fudge!!!  Going to make this a regular stop after the movies."}
{"text":"Love it. Cheap, super yummy, and so many ways to customize. Perfect for a hot day or even just because. Definitely need these in SoCal"}
{"text":"Unfortunately like the other Yelp Elite '17 reviews for this location, I too had a negative experience with this place.  Don't get me wrong: It's a novel idea, The Baked Bear, you choose your own \"sandwich breads\", you choose the ice cream, put some toppings on, all under a $10 price point, but man... The business offers so many options but offers so few TYPES of options.  What do you mean, you ask? Maybe it's the lack of advertised features that would cater to a more relevant audience amongst millenials. Where are the lactose-free options? Where are the almond/soy milk options? I get that these products typically require more process handling and paperwork in the food service industry, but if you're going to set up shop in a place like SCOTTSDALE of all places, why would you choose to alienate such a large portion of your potential customer base? Total business opportunity lost here.  For a business that advertises frozen desserts as their prime point of engagement (PPoE) with customers, I'm left scratching my head as to what the business lifecycle plans are for this place. The hype isn't real, it seems to lack visible foundation for business longevity.  Also:  -Why is their email address over 25 characters long? I checked online, there were definitely shorter domains available that'd be less of a PITA to type out. -Why are there multiple network SSID's for the Baked Bear and no obvious signage anywhere in the store that talks about wifi use for customers? If none for the customers, you need to re-label your SSID's accordingly so people are not thrown off by this. -Why is the lighting in this place so poor? It's 2017, the lighting style TBB currently chose is horribly dated.  If your employees are so completely out of touch that they lack the fundamentals of social bargaining platforms and its integration with point-of-sale (POS) systems, I question why the owners even turned to the Groupon platform. Why, you wanted to garner more business? If that's the case, you need to understand the platform and ensure SOP training is disseminated to employees before biting off more than you can chew. Otherwise, you get justifiably clueless employees, and worse, you get customers that get frustrated. Lines build up, customers talk, and as we say in the tech industry, \"Nothing is ever truly deleted off the Internet.\"  Speaking of chewing, when I came here, nothing on the menu indicates they have lactose-free options. So here I am, Groupons in hand, and I can't use any of them unless I want to land on a toilet all day. My date ended up using one of them, but I couldn't use any for myself nor my son; we are both lactose intolerant and the menu indicates no options that are lactose-free and their marketing is lacking at best.  All in all, unfortunately, some shoddy business implementation, poor marketing management, and lack of cohesive general business best practices makes me say \"Eek! Methinks not\" as Yelp labels one star reviews. The business just reeks of uninformed business decision after uninformed business decision."}
{"text":"OMG is this place yummy!  The lines are always long but so worth it! I loved every single item I tasted.     I like how you can have two different cookies to sandwich your ice cream.   I can feel my hips and thighs getting larger and I don't care - it's just that darn good."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, my family and I must have just had a bad batch of cookies. The cookies that we got on our sandwiches were hard as rocks. The place was slammed with little to no seating available but we got lucky.   Ice cream was so so, cookies were hard, either I have high standards or my group just happened to get the 6 worst sandwiches the place had to offer that day. My daughter didn't even want to finish her chocolate ice cream on a chocolate chip cookie sandwich, she's 4 and turned down ice cream and cookies... that should tell you what you need to know."}
{"text":"They make their own ice cream (not on site) and they make their own cookies (on site). They put the ice cream in between two cookies of your choice and you eat. We were there at 2pm midweek and had no line. I had some mini choc. chips added (rolled onto) my sandwich, along with the Rocky Road ice cream. The special cinnamon bun cookie was good and although you need a spoon to eat this messy thing, it was still worth a visit, but not worth waiting an hour in line..lol. Even if you hot press, the thing is still tough to pick up and eat like the chipwich from years ago. Maybe take it home and freeze it for a better eating experience."}
{"text":"delicious.  and the fact that they have dairy free and gluten free options.  I love!   will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So many fun choices! I tried the bear batter ice cream and it was so amazing! Was hoping the cookies were softer than they were. Bummed they were a little hard. But this place still rocked! If definitely come again."}
{"text":"What can I say. I live in Glendale and a friend told me about this place so I drove out to visit. It's tucked away in a shopping center but it's so perfect I couldn't ask for more. First when you walk in you get hit with a wonderful smell of cookies and it's wonderful. Second the menus are very easy to follow. Starting with what kind of sandwich. I got the brownie sandwich, second you pick the ice cream and they have an amazing selection. Third the toppings ranging from cereal to sprinkles to hot fudge. And oh I almost forgot you can get it warmed up the cookies or brownies I must say I said no to it but changed my mind and glad I did. Finally I get to the end and was rung up and the price for it was great a big sandwich for a great price. Also they have a stamp card I think it's great I can go back again and get more stamps. But in all honesty what sent this place over the edge for me was the staff. Not only where they friendly but they had a great knowledge of what goes good for people to try. Second I met the owner tonight and I must say her personality was great to be around she was happy to be there and was a wonderful woman to talk to. I must say this place deserves more then a simple 5 stars they deserve 10 if not 100 stars.   Thank you guys for making my first time memorable. I will most definitely be back soon to have more.   P.S. They have indoor and outside seating this place it truly perfect."}
{"text":"Love love this place. So many options and super nice employees. My daughter felt super special for our bday outing surprise!!! Make sure you tell em it's your birthday !"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out about baked bear opening in Scottsdale! We went about lunch time on a weekday to avoid long lines.   We got the cookies and cream sandwich, with bear batter ice cream and fruity pebbles. We also tried the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with salted caramel fudge ice cream with mini chocolate chips.   I'm not sure how fresh the cookies were, but they were hard -- it was a little difficult to eat into the sandwich. We realized you can heat press the cookie, but that still didn't make any difference. The ice cream was ok too, not bad but nothing special about it either.   I do like the concept, I was just hoping it tasted as good as it looked."}
{"text":"Very good brownies and ice cream. Line was not too long but by the time we left it was into the parking lot. Definately worth going, just not when it is too busy."}
{"text":"So I remember during grand opening they had a very long line wrapping around the corner, so I came back later cause it wasn't that deep. Although I am used to Afters in California, this place wasn't bad. The ice cream selection was good, they had many different wants to enjoy ice cream like pizzokies, brownie sandwiches, etc. This is an alright alternative to going to cali for Afters but it just won't be the same."}
{"text":"Stopped for dessert and kids were thrilled!  Ice cream was creamy and sandwich cookies were flavorful!  My daughter is GF and they were very conscious and could scoop from unopened ice cream and only used topping that were unopened.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Wow  wow wow. Great ice-cream and pure fun to eat.   Our group ordered the following combos  1. Cookies and cream cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream with hot fudge on top  2. Peanut butter cookie and white chocolate macadamia nut with butter pecan and Heath bar bits  3. Chocolate chip cookie white chocolate macadamia nut salted caramel fudge ice cream with Heath bar pieces  The ice cream is rich and thick.  The cookies are satisfactory. The chocolate chip was similar to a basic  Toll House recipe. Which I find rather boring   The blandness of that type of cookie is a good platform for the ice cream   The strawberry cheesecake ice cream had chunks of strawberry cheesecake in it. The taste was excellent   The butter pecan was lacking in flavour ..... Would give that flavour a miss next time  The real winner was the salted caramel fudge ice cream. The caramel was so warm and inviting and then the super huge chunks of fudge were amazing.   The heath bar tipping added that extra toffee taste the was \"the icing on the cake\"  The fudge on the strawberry cheesecake combo didn't add much to the dessert. Also made it near impossible to pick up. Although ordered on the side (if possible ) and dunking the cookie ice cream creation sounds rather like a good option.   The servings are really generous and the three of us left with a sugar overlaid. Next time I am going to share one"}
{"text":"This place is good but i don't know if its worthy of 5 stars. The premise is simple. Order  an ice cream sandwich with quality ice cream. The sandwich itself can be comprised with a brownie, cookie, or donut. I choose two cookies. The cookies are your average cookie, nothing spectacular, but still tasty. It's hard to mess up a cookie. The seating inside is really tight especially if you have children. It the footprint of the store was bigger it would really make the family experience that much better. Overall a great place to get dessert if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out finally! I got a chocolate chip cookie with rocky road ice cream. The girl behind the counter asked if I wanted to warm it, so I did! Not really sure why they warm it with ice cream inside. It does absolutely nothing. The cold ice cream makes the cookie rock hard and the ice cream tastes no different than anything you'd get at the grocery store. The finale was my rock hard average ice cream sandwich was close to $5  Nope, won't do that again."}
{"text":"Thank god they have a lactose free option! I would love a couple but still works for me. There are so many possible combinations and all of them are fire."}
{"text":"Line is a bit long, but definitely worth the wait! Atmosphere is nice- polar bear/color scheme design, and story of how this place started posted on the wall, are all very cute. Only complaints are the seating arrangement & tidiness- not enough tables, and employees are too busy with orders to clean up after customers between re-seating. Otherwise, delicious food and cute store. Will definitely come back again soon."}
{"text":"Simply put, you won't be disappointed, and I consider myself a connoisseur of things that will surely make you obese if you try hard enough.   We've been here twice now, generally I'd try a place more times than that before giving a precious 5-star Yelp review, but I'm confidently in love.   Tips: 1. Get the brownie as at least one of your sandwich sides  2. Don't get it heated (it makes the cookie hard and doesn't really add much IMHO)  3. The ice cream in general is phenomenal, cookie dough is my favorite but I think I'll be trying Rocky Road next time  4. If you're willing to share, they're splittable, just ask for it to be cut in half. All the joy, only half the guilt.   Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time. You can get your ice cream in a cup, waffle cone or a sandwhich. It's pretty sweet for me, but it's good my brothers like it. Definitely Instagram worthy pictures."}
{"text":"Go, go, go.  Like right now!  When I visit Scottsdale for work, I am always on the hunt for good ice cream!  Sweet Republic has been good to me, but I was craving something new...  Then Baked Bear appeared in my Yelp feed, and it rocked my world!  Imagine warm cookies and brownies coming hot out of the oven, with super friendly employees ready to pack your choice of ice cream and toppings between two of them.  Tip: you don't need to overdo it on toppings for an upcharge...the cookies add enough flavor. I had a chocolate chip cookie, mint chocolate chip ice cream, and a brownie on the bottom, all for about 6 bucks.  In Philly, we pay 8 bucks or more for something similar.    Just a warning: lines can be crazy long here, but I promise you it's worth the wait!  Stop reading this review, and go now!"}
{"text":"Call me a traditionalist, but I'm not a huge fan of ice cream sandwiches made with cookies... If that's your thing, I think you'll really dig The Baked Bear. You are presented with an option of 8 or so types of cookies (or a brownie, or a combo of a cookie and a brownie, or even a donut), a dozen or so ice cream flavors, and various toppings to make your ice cream sandwich.  I was feeling butter pecan for my ice cream flavor, so what cookie pairs with that?  My daughter suggested snickerdoodles, and I don't think there would've been a better combo, but...  Had it 'topped' (more like rolled in, which really makes the most sense) almonds.  The ice cream was good, the topping was generous, as was the serving.  The ice cream, however, was too soft, so, whenever I tried to take a bite, it would squeeze out all the sides, leaving me, at the end, with a bunch of snickerdoodle that was free of ice cream.  (They even offered to heat the cookie, saying it wouldn't warm up the ice cream - I think a quick freeze to harden the ice cream would've made it easier to eat).  All in all, and novel experience.  Tasty ingredients.  Just not my thing."}
{"text":"I went to the Baked Bear grand opening in Scottsdale on Saturday May 28th. Stood in line for an hour for FREE ice cream in 100 degree weather, totally worth it! Baked Bear is always a family tradition to stop at while visiting California. So happy there is now one in Scottsdale and it will be my new \"go to\" ice cream stop. I ordered the funfetti cookie with mint chocolate chip ice cream. So yummy! Hubby order the cookies & cream cookie with mint chocolate chip ice cream, my friend ordered the funfetti cookie with birthday cake ice cream and the kiddos shared the Baked Bear (cake batter) ice cream with the funfetti cookie! I had bites of all of them and they were all equally delicious! Love that they have such a big variety between cookies and ice cream. You can even get your ice cream sandwich rolled in M&M's, sprinkles, etc and you can even get whipped cream or hot fudge on top and better yet, have them hot pressed!! WHAT? I'm pretty certain there will be many visits in our future!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to order from on GrubHub since I live kinda far. The cookie sandwiches are always amazing but I can only give 3 stars because on two separate occasions I paid the extra 0.50 for fudge and literally had a drop. Not even enough to cover the top of the cookie. I finally had to add in the notes section on the GrubHub app \"please add fudge generously\"...honestly, for a ice cream place you would think I wouldn't have to say that...so be warned."}
{"text":"Oh....my....gish.... From one fellow baker to another this is a rock on idea!  #foodnetwork come do a #manvsfood challenge!! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am an 8 year old boy.  The ice cream sandwiches were  huge.  I  couldn't even eat half of it.  I love the ice cream and I liked the cookies.  The staff were really nice."}
{"text":"Genius business idea.  Delicious product.  Lots of options to choose from (various cookies and toppings), and you can even do things really custom like get the bottom of your sandwich as a brownie and the top as a cookie.  The only challenges are that it's a lot to eat for one person, and it's impossible to eat as an actual sandwich (you'll need utensils).  But it's always a treat to go here.  They also have two stands at Tempe Diablo (one on each baseline) where the Angels have their spring training games."}
{"text":"It's not MILK in LA, but it was definitely a fun experience.  We arrived 30 minutes before close and there appeared to be a line.  I was wondering if we'd make it.  We got in the door and the clock struck 9:45 PM, but it kept going.  The line was so long, one of the ladies in front of us ordered a dozen cookies and they were running out when one of ice creamers remarked: \"I don't know what we're going to say, we're not going to be able get them all.\"   I had the Combo sandwich with brown and chocolate hazelnut cookie with cookie dough and oreos around the ice cream.  The Brownie was EPIC.  May have to get it heated up."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place much more than I did.  It was pretty busy at night.  They have ample seating inside and out.  The service was friendly even if we had to wait in line a bit.  Tried the chocolate chip cookies with the blue ice cream, sprinkles and whip cream.  Looked yummy and delicious - was as you can guess VERY SWEET.  I am so glad I shared one with my son.... we still didn't finish it!  A little pricey."}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream!! The cookies are pretty thin but I guess if they were warm and thick they would fall apart as you hold there sandwich. Tasty place, probably the best sweet spot in town right now. Phoenix needs places like this in our 120 degree weather so we welcome all who come and offer chilled sweets and snacks"}
{"text":"Ice cream is great! Price is great! Brownies were great! FLYS on all the cookies/brownies NOT so great. Staff was friendly and helpful and let me try different ice creams. I really wish they had a blower on the front door to keep the bugs out."}
{"text":"Love it! High quality ice cream. Great cookies. The customization is endless and fun. And it's pretty cheap! Go here!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time a couple hours ago! I thought it was awesome! The line was kinda long but the staff breezed through it quickly!!! My friend and I both got the baked cookie bowls. A lot of the reviews claim the cookies for the ice cream sandwiches are crumbly but the bowls are warm and yummy! Plus the ice cream was super affordable! Less than$6 for essentially a pizookie and I couldn't even finish it!"}
{"text":"If you are a pizookie fan, you'll love this place even more. Worth the line that is constantly out the door!"}
{"text":"It's everything Willy Wonka would have dreamed in an ice cream sandwich.  Brownie and mint chip, Bam-it's all that"}
{"text":"Excellent opening! I had the M&M with vanilla and my husband had the M&M with Baked Bear ice cream. Both were excellent! The vanilla ice cream was very creamy and everything tasted super fresh and high quality. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I stood in line for 40 mins to give this place a try & it was worth it! So many different options of cookies, ice creams & toppings. As a pregnant lady, this place is pure heaven. I can't wait to come back & I've been raving to all of my friends & family about the Baked Bear. Only small downside is the seating. There are way too many people coming in to be able to sit them all, so if you don't mind standing to eat your treat (like me) then this shouldn't be an issue. You can even get your ice cream sandwich on wheels & enjoy it in the company of your own home...unless you end up eating it in the car because temptation is just too much!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Met the owner on my first time in who was super friendly and full of suggestions. The cookies were soft and warm, ice cream was spot on, Service was phoenomonal and prices were fair. Definitely portion to share...if you'd like"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! :( I've been dying to come to The Baked Bear since I found out they were coming to Scottsdale. Phoenix has some incredible locally-based ice cream shops, but I was so looking forward to an ice cream sandwich from here. (Le sigh.)  I'll start on the interior. Sorry, but there's no room in the vastly expanding food scene in the Valley for subpar build outs like at The Baked Bear. The lighting is terrible, the art on the wall is depressing and chintzy. There wasn't even a purse hook in the lady's room! The entire establishment just felt dirty and cheap. The LED \"Open\" light on the front door belongs on a 24 hour convenience store.   The ice cream was thin and cheap tasting. It simply can't compare to local scratch-made ice cream that you can find right down the street. The only slightly saving grace of my experience was the brownie bowl. During my visit I got a bear bowl with a brownie, cookies and cream ice cream, with hot fudge on top. While the ice cream was literally nothing I couldn't have gotten from a half gallon of Dollar Store brand cookies and cream, the brownie had good flavor. Was it heated up enough, as advertised? No. Was it all the way baked through? Not at all - in fact it was basically raw in the center. This works for me, but it should have been clearly described this way on their menu, if the shop was deliberately trying to serve undercooked baked goods to their customers. But, the taste was good. That's about it.  Note to consumers: read between the hype, and make a decision based on fact and quality as to weather a product is actually worth your purchase. A line out the door is not indicative of a bomb ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! This is our second time coming here. My nephew loves their old fashion vanilla with sprinkles. One of my sisters gets salted caramel fudge (my mom got that today in a cup as well) in a snickerdoodle sandwich with caramel sauce on top. My other sister tried their Mexican Hot Chocolate cookie (it was their flavor of the month) with cookies and cream and finished it in like 2 minutes!   I sampled their blackberry crumble and liked it but stuck to rocky road which I got the first time around on top of their warm brownie bowl. It was a great serving size but this time I just did one scoop in a wafer cone.   I think it's great that they have a vegan option ice cream flavor. I also think it's nice that you can buy their cookies to go, we got a dozen for my niece's graduation tonight.   The only thing that I wish was different was that they had a sherbet flavor. The flavors they have are great but they are very heavy, then you add a cookie, brownie or donut (or 2!) and it's a very heavy dessert. Sherbet would be a good lighter option for people who maybe don't want such a heavy dessert."}
{"text":"Best ice cream sandwich place in Phoenix! You choose the cookie, ice cream and toppings. You can even get heated brownie and cookie with ice cream in top. My favorite is the bear batter which includes hot fudge and brownie bites. They have seasonal cookies too! Get yours warmed at the end. You will be very full."}
{"text":"Talk about a sugar rush. Not for the faint hearted or sugar-sensitive. But damn it's good. First you pick homemade ice cream. Then you get to wedge it between whatever the hell you want. Homebaked brownie? Sure! One of five types of freshly baked cookies? Do it! A doughnut?! Hell yes! Then you can add toppings if you wish. We all barely finished half our ice cream sammies. Can definitely split one! Great dessert spot! Not a 5 only because the lines are long and in the heat it's a bit overwhelming :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a cool concept but the line is ridiculous. If you go during evening hours on the weekends expect to wait outdoors at least 30 minutes. Its definitely good (what icecream isn't?) But nothing too special. The servings are huge, definitely a sharable size. My sister asked for half the ice-cream on hers after seeing how big they were and they charged her significantly less.I found the brownie bits added as a topping to be very stale. I would be more likely to return if I didn't have to wait so long in 100 + heat!"}
{"text":"Really good creamy ice cream with quality fresh baked cookies and brownies. Went to celebrate National Ice Cream Day! Great way to celebrate! I got a punch card!"}
{"text":"I've been in multiple times and have seen the same employee, Sofie! She is always so sweet to me when i come in! She knows my order by heart now and makes it perfectly, just the way i like it! she is definitely the best employee there!! My favorite place!!"}
{"text":"I'm not normally a huge fan of ice-cream, but I had to check this place out. I was so overwhelmed by the customizability and options here. I also love that they can warm up your ice cream sandwich/brownie/whatever you get. You can ask to taste any ice cream you want before ordering, and don't forget that donuts are an option for ice cream sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"Best cookies and ice cream ever!!!! The cookies are fresh and homemade and the ice cream choices match perfectly for a delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"I think the hype of this place made me have too high of expectations. The cookies were pretty under baked and the ice cream was just okay. They didn't have a large selection of ice cream and the kinds they did have were standard. I got a chocolate chip cookie with the salted caramel fudge ice cream and it was good, but just good, not amazing. We also got the brownie, which was actually baked and it was good. I wasn't wowed by this place like I was expecting to be. I'd rather go to sweet republic down the street!"}
{"text":"Sorry. I wanted to love this place.  Long line--which I didn't mind. I truly felt I was headed for a great treat. My opinion?  Ice cream is average. Cookies remind me of the grocery store slice and bake. Nothing bad JUST not epic. Dairy Queen is just as good."}
{"text":"In theory this should be a home run.  But the reality is some pretty good ice cream smashed between two pretty good cookies in a treat that is impossible to eat as a sandwich.  I would have been better served with one cookie next to a small scoop of the ice cream."}
{"text":"A must on everyone's sweet tooth list. Tried to come by on Memorial Day and it was insane!!! People everywhere, line out the door! Had to come back and see what the fuss was about.   Limited seating so we did some parking lot playing. Popped the truck up and sat with our sammies. So many options, we weren't ready. Prepare before you come the line moves fast. Three options of donuts! Brownies or cookies as your \"bread\" and you can mix and match and here are so many flavors. Then pick out that ice cream filling and then finish it off with sprankles or toppings of choice. You can get it heated as well. And it's cheapppppp!  I think we went full fat kid and had so many toppings and flavors and it was around 4.50$ each! Legit!  The girls working were killing it so they don't chit chat too much, prob because their main goal is to attack the line. Great job! Maybe get a couple more outside tables. I'm also guessing y'all are planning your expansion! Let me know if you need help! I want in!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 45 minutes because I was curious about the hype. It's all right nothing to run home about. I think the cookies are just ok. My grandmas cookies taste better. I also think that the ice creme is nothing special too. It taste like store brand ice creme. Now that I tried it I won't go back. I'll make my own. You will end up saving a lot too. For $5.00 an ice creme sandwich, just make your own. I give it three stars for the cleanliness, cheerful staff, and variety of toppings and cookies."}
{"text":"I'll sum up my review with saying it looks better than it tastes. I went with a group of 4 and all of our experiences were different. 2 of us had giant portions that we couldn't even finish and the other 2 were significantly smaller. We all had sandwiches so you'd assume they'd be similar in size? Some of the cookies and 1 brownie was so hard they weren't edible and some of the ice cream was freezer burned.  My funfetti cookie/vanilla ice cream combo was really good though!  Not sure if I'll be back since I've heard more and more negative things about this place."}
{"text":"Our favorite ice cream sandwich shop is here! Long lines at the opening but free . If you have never been here come have their ice cream sandwiches.  Should have opened one of these myself. Went next door and had some garlic knots. I'll do their review separate but they do pizza by the slice. Made the perfect lunch!  Now to the gym...."}
{"text":"It's ok. Customer service lacking. Not the \"fun\" experience its made out to be. It's a $5 ice cream sandwich. Definitely not worth the trip."}
{"text":"It was good, nothing spectacular like a baked bear on top of my ice cream, but decent."}
{"text":"ordered: - white chocolate macadamia/ snickerdoodle cookie + butter pecan ice cream + m&ms  pros: - huge potion, could feed two people easily - cookies were tasty  cons: - $5+ for my sandwich - the hot press didnt warm my cookies much - wasnt feelin the selection of ice cream too much"}
{"text":"When you're craving a ice cream sandwich, it's hard to beat this place. I'm a big fan of the bear batter flavor ice cream with chocolate chip cookies. If you can avoid a line, it's definitely worth checking out. It can be very busy at times, and I'm not very patient when it comes to waiting for dessert."}
{"text":"The ice cream itself along with the cookies was good. What ruined the experience for me was the staff. 3 people walking around not helpful. Didn't ask if we needed help or had any questions and the girl that served us was so standoffish and rude. She spoke maybe 5 words to me. I live in Peoria, came all the way out here for it and was disappointed. Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Stellar. The cookies are supreme and excellent. They do not burn like some other local cookie shops amd their ice cream is excellent too. The o ly downside is the very long lines but with excellence like this its expected."}
{"text":"I was referred to baked bear by a friend and since you can't go wrong with ice cream, why not try this place out. Especially since Arizona's blazing heat will make you need a bite of something cold to cool you down for a bit. I had an ice cream sandwich with the cookie being hot pressed. Even after the hot press, the cookie was still hard. I honestly thought the flavor I got was too sweet and compared to what I'm used to, this place didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"A fun ice cream sandwich shop! You get to pick the two cookies and the ice cream flavor. They make your ice cream sandwich and you can add toppings and/or choose to have them heat it up (like a p'zookie). They also have brownie options. Day old boxes of cookies (1/2 dozen and full dozen options) are for sale at a discount price. The cookies are amazing and it's always tempting to buy a box to bring home. You can eat inside, outside, or take it to go. They have lids for the containers if you choose the to-go option. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was a sweet treat! I would definitely recommend coming here. I've never seen a place like this before. I made an ice cream sandwich with funfetti cookies , cookies and cream ic and rainbow sprinkles on the outside. The girl working talked me into warming up the cookies. I was afraid it would melt my ice cream too much and make a mess. Which it did. Next time I'll definitely get my cookies warmed up but I will eat it in a bowl. The cookies were fresh and soft. It was absolutely delicious!! There is not a large selection of ic flavors but I think with the options of cookies and toppings that having a limited amount of ic flavors is probably a good idea. Lol. I loved this place!! I'll be going back and bringing people with me. MUST LOVE ice cream AND cookies:)"}
{"text":"I have been to this location as well as the location in Pacific Beach. It is the best ice cream sandwich I have ever had. I got a brownie top with chocolate chip cookie bottom, filled with cookies and cream ice cream. When they ask you if you want it heated up, say yes! It makes the cookie/brownie warm like it just came out of the oven and the ice cream perfectly soft and a little melty. Great way to consume a days worth of calories in one sitting!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's modern inside and very trendy. Essentially, you create your own ice cream sandwich, brownie sandwich, or donut sandwich. First, you choose your type of cookie, then ice cream flavor, then toppings. Of course, because I have a huge sweet tooth, I asked them to double the amount of ice cream they put on the sandwich (6 scoops instead of three). I had chocolate chip cookies, cookie dough ice cream, and a ton of whipped cream. The guys working at the counter were very friendly, and I think a bit humored by the massive size of the sandwich. As far as taste, the cookies were soft and moist. The ice cream was excellent as well, loaded with tons of cookie dough. (NOTE: If you order abnormal sized ice cream sandwich, you can actually eat it like a sandwich. Mine was so huge I had to use a spoon.) They have a great patio as well."}
{"text":"Good treats but 2 workers only. Line wrapped around entire interior. 2 couples served in the last 10 minutes. Once you get past the wait it is good though."}
{"text":"Good place. Wide variety of desserts. Ice cream is really good. Ice cream cookie sammy is spectacular"}
{"text":"It was good, but not waiting more than 5 minutes good and definitely not the 30+ minutes wait I've read in others posts.If I want outstanding ice cream and toppings, I'll drive a little further to Sweet Republic.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"So, how could a place that makes homemade cookies and ice cream be wrong? Different flavor cookies that you stuff with the ice cream of your choice. Then roll them in crushed oreos and het it and dear God!!!!I cannot wait to try the stuffed donut with ice cream. DELICIOUS! great staff, ask for their recommendations they know the ropes.YUMMMMMMMMMMM"}
{"text":"Mmmm mmmm mmmmm  This place kills it! If you have a sweet tooth, don't hesitate to go here!  They have yummy confetti cookies, chocolate chip cookies, cookies and cream, and flavors of the month.   Not to mention, it's a great treat when you're visiting the Arizona away from Arizona... San Diego! Haha"}
{"text":"Yum! Not a lot else to say! I had a warm brownie bowl with their bear ice cream. My wife had an ice cream sandwich with chocolate chip cookies and cookie dough ice cream. Decided to share next time because they are such large portions we both threw half ours away."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying the Baked Bear and oh man was I excited! 3 of my favorite things: cookies, ice cream and sandwiches!  Pretty easy to order, the menu is up and you can decide while waiting in line because that gives you PLENTY of time considering how long the line was. Choose your cookie, then your ice cream, then toppings (optional but $.50 each), then you can choose whether you want it hot pressed. I highly recommend because who doesn't like a warm cookie?! I tried a butter pecan ice cream sandwich between a peanut butter and snicker doodle cookie. AMAZING. My boyfriend got a brownie bear bowl with cookie dough ice cream. That was also to die for. I love brownies and that hit the spot! Only reason I docked a star is because of seating. I hear this place is always busy, but the reason I'm docking is because we went at 10pm at night on a Saturday and there were hardly any settings. We ended up sitting on a bench and let me tell you, it is not easy eating a cookie sandwich on a bench. You need TWO hands for those lol  Overall, if you have a sweet tooth then this is a must try!"}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth this is the place for you.  But eat it outside because they need to kick on the air.  It was hot in there."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the try but not necessarily my favorite. It's one of those \"do it for the gram\" places for me.  Their ice cream is great! I love their variety of flavors. But their cookies are average. I do love that you can customize your ice cream sandwiches with cookies or brownies. Definitely \"warm\" your ice cream sandwich when they ask! It does make your ice cream melt a tiny bit but it makes the cookie warm. However, if you're a slow eat, your cookie will get hard once it cools back down again. So eat it quick!"}
{"text":"I've longed for an ice cream cookie sandwich place, in AZ, ever since eating at one in Cali a few years back. Baked Bear answered that longing with a phat cookie sandwich that brought a tear to my dessert loving eye.  The concept is a simple. Pick a cookie, brownie or glazed donut for the 'bread' of your sandwich (you can also pick a cookie/brownie combo - no one initially told me this). Then pick your ice cream. You can also split flavors there (again I made this gem of a discovery on my own). Personally, I like the chocolate chip cookies, with half strawberry cheesecake ice cream and half cookie dough ice cream. Lastly, you pick your topping (for me, it is Fruity Pebbles for life). Once your sandwich is in your possession, you take your IG photo(s) and grub.   It's definitely legit. My first visit, I chuckled as there were 4 Coldstone employees in line in front of me. Kind of like seeing 4 Burger King employees in line at McD's.   It can be busy sometimes, and while I love eating ice cream cookie sandwiches, I do not heart waiting in line, so time out your arrival for non-peak times."}
{"text":"One of the best ideas in the ice cream world in a very long time! Talk about the best of both worlds: home baked cookies surrounding you favorite choice of ice cream. Try it for dessert or try two for dinner...!"}
{"text":"Our ice cream delights from The Baked Bear! Refreshing and tantalizingly sweet, these were indeed an incredible treat! Thank you April, co-owner of this wonderful establishment for your help and sending me 3 coupons to return! You made it right and we enjoyed this visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place. You pick if you want a cookie Ice cream sandwich or a cookie brownie sandwich. They have several different fresh baked cookies to choose from and around 12 different flavors of Ice cream to choose from to make the ultimate custom cookie sandwich"}
{"text":"If you like cookies, and you like ice cream, you will like this place. Not much else to say!  Except, I'd skip on the root beer float. Other than that, everything was great."}
{"text":"My favorite dessert spot on Phoenix. Hands down. I say dream about their cookies and cream cookies. I wish they'd open more locations."}
{"text":"What can I say other than, amazing! This place is so great I can not believe it! You go in and order your cookies, you can order 2 of the same or one brownie, one chocolate chip, then you order your ice cream and up to two flavors and they have great ice cream, let me tell you! The cookies are warm, they put the ice cream in and make a sandwich and then you choose if you want your sandwich rolled in sprinkles or nuts or all these other delicious things or if you want any hot fudge, etc and voila, they give it to you!!!!!!!! You just want to die, it's so good. The first time you go, eat there because you must experience the warm cookies, ice cream , etc. Now I take them home, still good but not as good as eating there, fresh......Warning....there can be a very long line so be prepared to wait or go right when they open at 10am"}
{"text":"We have always wanted to try this place but it's not close to our house. We drove by and thought we would give it a shot! My son had an ice cream sandwich with a brownie bottom, white choc macadamia cookie on top, and dark chocolate ice cream. My daughter had the same, but with an M &M cookie and bday cake ice cream. They both got them warmed, which they highly recommend! The cookies and brownies were soft. Both said that the brownie was the best part.  The people working here are friendly and patient. There is plenty of seating both inside and outside and it's very clean. I can see how the line gets backed up on busy nights, as making these sandwiches is a process. It will be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The idea is a 5 star idea for sure (the Subway of ice cream sandwiches). The reality was an overpowering sugar bomb that was so sweet it was hard to enjoy and left me feeling sluggish. I left the additional toppings/sauces off and it was still too much. The place could also use a full time table washer. The BB was busy and eating the cookies is pretty messy so the place and tables get dirty quickly. Next time I would probably get better ice cream elsewhere with cookie toppings."}
{"text":"The ice cream and the food was pretty good. I was there last night 09/30/2016 around 9:30pm. I was serviced by a younger looking African American female who had the worst attitude I have ever seen! Slamming the ice cream doors, her tone of voice was extremely rude!  I came in with a party of 8 and they all said the same thing. She was extremely rude. And even while I was eating inside, I could hear how she was talking with other customers. Asking \"what ice cream\" as if her tone was \"wtf do you want, quit wasting my time.\"  She belongs no where near any customer/client facing position. I was shocked someone could even hire this lady that clearly had zero customer service skills. Over all ruined the experience for us."}
{"text":"Got a chocolate chip cookie and brownie sandwich with coffee ice cream and Heath bar crumbles. Guys, it brought tears to this pregnant lady's eyes. Do yourself a favor and go there."}
{"text":"Soooo amazingly good! The ice cream was delicious and the warm cookies were perfectly made and melted in your mouth. They leave you with lots of room to adjust your order, so you can get just one half of the sandwich or both cookies. They also offer brownies for the sandwich, which looked great. I had the cookies and cream ice cream with chocolate chip cookies for my sandwich and a sprinkle topping. Would definitely recommend for a big dessert!"}
{"text":"Ice cream sandwiches between two freshly baked warm cookies. Need I say more? Literally. I got cake batter sandwiched between snickerdoodles and I don't even remember breathing because it was so good I couldn't eat it fast enough. I'm a major lover of sweets so this place is right up my alley."}
{"text":"Trust me I wish I could put 5 stars for my whole experience. I definitely rate the ice cream cookie sandwiches 5+ stars but it is pretty expensive it adds up very quickly. I would definitely come here again but maybe on special days."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place for the first time today after hearing rave reviews from several friends. I bought a Groupon a couple of months ago which was about to expire, so today was the day.   The portions are generously sized, and there is a wide variety of cookies, ice creams and toppings to choose from. It was also delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"place hasnt opened yet, tonight was a part of their soft opening but I had a great time. I got an mnm cookie sandwich with rocky road ice cream and the girl behind the counter (emma) was super friendly and helpful. 100% going back again soon"}
{"text":"This place will make a fat kid out of anyone! Seriously.   My wife and I are trying to eat well, but now that we have found this place it's nearly impossible. We were celebrating a new career change and wanted to take our daughter to get some dessert. We were incredibly surprised!   I love the Bear Batter ice cream especially when sandwiched between two warmed peanut butter cookies...*drool* If you are a fan of cookies and/or ice cream I strongly suggest checking out The Baked Bear. The bonus is: their staff is super laid back and attentive!"}
{"text":"This is most definitely a kids place. Most of the ice cream flavors (and cookies too) are oriented to a child's palate. It was hard to find an adult combo, and that was just ok. Chocolate ice cream on chocolate chip cookies was pretty bland;  the cookies were the best thing, but the ice cream lacked deep chocolate flavor.   A cute idea for kids, but I can't see it being popular with adults."}
{"text":"So walking into Baked Bear you're greeting by a big neon sign that says \"Homemade Cookies Baked from Scratch.\" After eating one of their ice cream cookie sandwiches, I don't believe it.   But let me back up a minute. Their service was not very \"homey\" either. We went on a Friday night so it was pretty busy. Maybe the staff was tired or something because by the time we got to the counter they were not very friendly. We were greeted with a stark \"Do you know what you want?\" Not even a \"hi.\" We chose one with a peanut butter cookie, a M&M cookie and vanilla ice cream and one with chocolate chip cookies and vanilla ice cream.   We got both warmed up although it didn't seem to do anything - the cookies were cold and hard. I tried to use a spoon to get through the sandwich and it broke - that's how hard the cookie was! The ice cream was okay but the cookies were like grocery store quality cookies. They tasted plastic-y and mass-produced. Nothing about them seemed like a homemade cookie. Although I will say the peanut butter cookie was better than the M&M.   We were completely underwhelmed with this place and surprised that there was a line out the door. I guess people like mediocrity."}
{"text":"I love this place. I ordered a cookie sandwich with one cookie being replaced by a brownie. Their ice cream is creamy and sweet. This ice cream sandwich is decadent and explosive with sweet goodness. I highly recommend getting their brownie as one of your cookies. I like both their peanut butter ice cream and their cake batter ice cream.   I will say the only thing that I see as a con is that it is difficult picking up like a traditional ice cream sandwich. You have to eat it with a spoon, and that's for sure! It's a messy messy and I mean very messy treat."}
{"text":"Ice cream cookie sandwiches...yum!! It was tasty as expected...ice cream sandwiched between two cookies. A lot of possibility for customization. Had the sandwich hot pressed but not sure that made a difference. Cookies weren't as soft as I thought it would be....and by the time I ate it, the cookie wasn't warm or maybe it wasn't that warm to begin with."}
{"text":"Probably the BEST ice cream cookie sandwiches I have EVER had! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Baked bear has been bookmarked since it opened and I only just now visited. While I am ecstatic that I went I am sad that it took me so long. It's delicious! I got a brownie sandwich with cookie dough ice cream in between. I had the brownies warmed, they were soft and gooey and chocolatey. The ice cream was creamy and perfect. I could not be happier & I only wish my diet allowed me to visit all the time!"}
{"text":"I agree, the hype isnt worth it either. So we went on a Sunday night, the lineup was huge but I was expecting that. I managed to keep my kids contained with eye-spy and people watching. B.B. offered misters and a big jug of cold water. There werent many cups left and the water was nearly empty. The outside tables were dirty. We finally snaked our way inside & got to see our ice cream & cookie choices. Hmmmm. :-/ i wasnt impressed. I would say there was about 5 staff working out front taking customers. See pics of the menu, maybe 5 or 6 different kinds of cookies and about 10 flavors of ice cream. Meh. I ordered single cones for my kids and a single (not sandwich) red velvet cookie with a scoop of rocky road ice cream. The cookie LOOKED tasty but had a weird after taste. The same with the ice cream. Maybe all the high quality non-gmo food I've been eating for past couple of months has destroyed me for cheap preservative laden ice cream/cookies but I couldnt finish my desert. It just didnt taste right to me. They were missing something in the mix? I just dont know. The restaurant was dirty, with spills and trash on the tables and floor, the trash cans were full and the water jug inside was almost empty too. Someone needs to be circling the restaurant to keep the place clean even when its busy. I would say this place would be a matter of personal taste for each yelper. The deserts look big and amazing but to me the combination of a dirty restaurant and mediocre food just wasnt worth the hype. Btw the bathrooms were predictably thrashed as well, but if they cant keep the restaurant clean then how could they keep the bathrooms clean? 'Nuf said."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ice cream and the home-baked cookies. It was fun making an ice cream sandwich out of all of it. My whole family got ice cream cookie sandwiches and we all mixed up the flavors. This is a great place to take your family and get a sugar high.   They have flavors of the month as well as their usual flavors. Mix and match, then enjoy."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA and stopped by Baked Bear to satisfy my sweet tooth. Had the best cookie dough milkshake ever. The cookies have such a good flavor and texture. Hubby had an amazing ice cream sandwich. Clean facility, friendly staff will be back next visit to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The concept of selling ice cream sandwiched between two cookies isn't new to Phoenix. We've had a few local joints that have been offering up the cookie/ice cream combo for quite some years now. And while I can appreciate what they're doing here, my girlfriend and I just couldn't quite see what makes this place superior to its competitors.  The process is pretty straight-forward, laid out by the usual \"step-by-step\" menu found at all millennial chains these days. Choose your ice cream, pick your cookie flavors, and then decide whether or not you want the cookies heated or served cold. You can also add a topping if you wish.   I opted for the Bear Batter, which is cake batter flavored ice cream with chunks of chocolate. My girlfriend chose the Birthday Cake. We both decided on one chocolate chip cookie and one snickerdoodle. Based on most Yelp reviews, they recommend heating the cookies to soften them.  The ice cream is okay, but the cookies seemed too doughy. Keep in mind, the size of the \"sandwiches\" are astronomically large, meaning that a couple could easily split a single order and probably still be full. The amount of the ice cream they provide is generous, which can be both good and bad. Good, in the sense that you get a lot of it. Bad, in the sense that, it's virtually impossible to pick up and eat with your hands without mushing the ice cream to the point where it spills out and makes a big mess. Some people might like it, but we weren't impressed. In the end, we both ate maybe half of our sandwiches before tossing them.  I'm sure this place, which is an up-and-coming chain out of San Diego, will probably do just fine in the area. But unfortunately, there's a local place here in town that keeps things a bit more simple, smaller, cheaper, and dare I say, just better.  It was worth trying at least once, but I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"I am a huge ice cream fan, and the only thing better than ice cream is ice cream and cookies!  Great place to take the family after a long day in the hot Arizona sun! I hope the open a store in Oregon some day ;-)"}
{"text":"I tried the donut ice cream sandwich. The donut wasn't really anything special. It tasted like dough and they put glaze on top of it. The ice cream was okay as well. I don't understand why this place has such a long line all the time. I do have to agree that the cookies do taste pretty fresh though compared to other places."}
{"text":"We I came familiar with this place on our trips to San Diego. So glad we have here now in AZ (scottsdale and Tempe). Pick fav ice cream to put between 2 of your favorite cookies!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight, they did not disappoint.  The Bear Bowl is great. Friendly staff, prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"So good and so cheap!! Best cheat day snack ever! Endless combinations! Usually a really long line, but the line moves fast and it's so worth it!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday and it was busy with a line out of the door, which was expected. They had the door open to the store inside was extremely hot and uncomfortable. The staff was very busy and has an efficient system for taking care of customers. The reason I wasn't thrilled with my experience was I felt like they were a bit distracted when I actually ordered. I felt like I was just a number and they just weren't very helpful or friendly. The ice cream sandwich ultimately fell apart because the cookie was too hard to bite into and the ice cream was melting all over the place. I ended up eating it all separately which took away from the whole idea of being an ice cream sandwich... I might go back and give them another try once they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"We have passed this place several times and didn't realize it. This time we stopped after lunch because apparently my son has a 2nd stomach when it comes to ice cream. We walked in and we were quickly greeted. They explained how we could mix or match the cookies or brownies. I picked a funfetti cookie and snickerdoodle. Then we pick the ice cream and I was torn between the Apple pie ice cream and the birthday cake. She said I could do both that it's usually extra but this time she wouldn't charge the extra. She also told me they switch their flavors and apple pie might not be here next time. I also liked how she said how well it would pair with the snickerdoodle cookie. So she makes my sandwich and then asks if I want it warmed up. MINED BLOWN! I couldn't believe it they put it in what looks like a waffle maker but it fits the sandwich just right to heat the cookies and soften the ice cream. We passed on the toppings but these ice cream sandwiches were the best we have had. They sell the cookies and ice cream separately also if you would like. It was a wonderful treat, friendly staff. They even have a complimentary water cooler, which I needed after all that sugar yumminess. They even have a punch card to earn free items."}
{"text":"We loved this place in San Diego, so as we walked out of the movie theater and found this gem, we knew it was meant to be!  My husband had the Red Velvet Cookie Sandwich with vanilla ice cream and sprinkles.  I got something less...normal: Cookies and Cream and Strawberry Cheesecake cookies with coffee ice cream and fruity pebbles.  Weird? Yes.  Flavorful and yummy? YES! Cookies were perfectly baked and hot pressed.  And they're HUGE!  We wanted to finish each of ours but knew our bodies wouldn't handle that well.  The staff was friendly too.  I hope they open up in Chicago soon!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the hype was all about.  Maybe I missed something but the ice cream I had was underwhelming and that was a step above the lack luster service.  I hate giving a new place a bad review, but it just didn't seem like anything special to me. They must have had great marketing though, because I expected a lot more than I got here."}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of sugar, so I didn't make it a point to check this place out when it opened. And for that same reason, I didn't really expect to like it. So when my employer decided to show us some love by way of ice cream sandwiches (hold the wheat bread and lettuce), I had very low expectations.  That being said, this was a mf-ing TREAT.  Snickerdoodle cookie, mint chocolate chip ice cream, brownie with rainbow sprinkles. The cookie was soft, the brownie was not too rich and held together nicely. I have zero complaints, even with the fact that it was transported to my office in a cup.   Enjoy your sugar high!"}
{"text":"Wow what a wonderful grand opening after weeks of waiting.  I had the brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge.  The ice cream is made onsite and has a nice consistency and flavor. The price point at about $4 is right on for me.  Welcoming treat with the heat or after a movie.  Welcome to the Neighborhood Baked Bear, and congrats on your grand opening."}
{"text":"Baked bear is amazing. Made to order ice cream sandwiches. Fresh cookies choose one kind or two different kinds with ice cream in the middle. I prefer the house ice cream. Get it warme"}
{"text":"We got a hot pressed, gluten free cookie sandwich with coffee ice cream and chocolate chips. It was amazing and perfect for splitting! The line was insanely long but moved quickly. Most people were getting half brownie, half cookie sandwiches that looked delicious too!"}
{"text":"Holyyyy smokes this place did NOT disappoint! I saw an ad posted on Instagram about this place opening in Scottsdale (props on the marketing!) and just knew I needed to go ASAP! I ordered the funfetti cookie sandwich with cake batter ice cream rolled in fruity pebbles. The cookies were soft and fresh and the ice cream was the perfect creamy consistency- so delicious! My husband got the peanut butter cookie sandwich with chocolate ice cream rolled in Heath bar, and my friend got the cookie of the month sandwich (Mexican hot chocolate) with mint chocolate chip ice cream! I had bites of both and they were equally as delicious. They have so much variety (tons of ice cream flavors that sound awesome, sandwiches that can be made with cookies, brownies, or donuts, and all sorts of toppings) that I'm certain there will be MANY visits in our future!"}
{"text":"Awesome ice cream sandwich shop with lots of variety.  The cake ice cream was a bit rich for me but the kids loved it.  I also like the bowl and the sea salt Carmel ice cream was pretty darn good.  A little pricey for ice cream but I'll take it over Dairy Queen any day of the week."}
{"text":"I didn't know anything about this place, but someone in my running group suggested we stop in here after a run for a birthday. I thought it was delicious!   I think I've said this in other reviews involving dessert type stuff, but I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to sweets. Also, I'm more of an ice cream & cookie person (opposed to cakes or pies) so The Baked Bear is right up my alley.   There's a good amount of cookies & ice creams to choose from (actually, I would say there's quite a bit of cookie options). They also do brownies & donuts (and you can combine if that tickles your fancy).  I wanted to guarantee I had a safe combo that went together so I went w/a salted caramel sugar cookie (which was the cookie of the month) & salted caramel ice cream. I had it warmed up. Surprisingly, the cookie warmed up perfectly & the ice cream only slightly softened and didn't melt. They cookies aren't huge, but decent enough size and I thought tasted really good (it's hard to say how fresh they were since they were warmed up). I also thought the ice cream was tasty and they use a good amount of it.   I thought the prices were good for what you got. I believe my sandwich was $4.95. The brownie & donut sandwiches are a little bit more. Everyone I was with liked what they had and the birthday girl got her treat for free :)"}
{"text":"No words can describe how amazing this place is from their delicious creamy ice cream to their soft incredible cookies. They do everything right and they have it all, except buttercream icing! It's fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone craving a sweet fix! I know they originated in San Diego, CA, but I would vote to say they are contenders for the best cookies in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"If you have not yet had the honor of stopping here for ice cream, then you are most certainly missing out. This is by far, THE place to go for a sweet treat. They have so many different combinations you can choose from - my mouth is watering just at the thought. Their selection ranges from creating your own cookie, donut, or brownie sandwiches to a delectable cookie or brownie bowl warming your ice cream from underneath. Surely a basic plastic cup is also a choice, but why opt for that? I am more than positive that I am leaving out a few more ways that your ice cream can be prepared, like as a sundae perhaps, but I made an attempt to include personal favorites. Each time I visit any of the Baked Bear locations I always manage to get a brownie bowl with bear batter ice cream.  You can't go wrong with whatever you get here, but you will more than likely leave wanting more. Don't forget that you can purchase day old cookies at the register and to ask for one of their stamp cards because believe me, you will be back."}
{"text":"This was good, didn't quite live up to all the hype as I was expecting. It was a special occasion and we traveled a ways to get there. It's not a bad treat if you're looking god something sweet and love ice cream sandwiches. We might stop in again if we are ever in the area.  I would suggest eating it with a spoon unless your cookie is really soft. Ours were somewhat firmer and it made it a little trickier to eat without the spoon."}
{"text":"The best salted caramel ice cream I've tasted so far!  I opted for the combo - funfetti cookie/brownie with salted caramel & hot fudge, it was good!  I've already mapped in my head the next two combos I'm trying.  This is in walking distance for me, that's a bad thing !"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for the 4th of July weekend with my boyfriend and we came here for a late night treat. I have been to the San Diego location and had a great experience, but my experience here was rather so so. The line wasn't terribly long, but it took almost half an hour to get to the front. After waiting so long It almost turned me off to the ice cream as it hindered the experience."}
{"text":"Very creamy ice cream. Moist and delicious cookies. Will definitely come visit again. We had chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream. Service was excellent. Friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. The cookies were big and solid and the amount of ice cream was perfect. Now, the cookies crumble easier, they're smaller and the amount of ice cream used is so overwhelming it always spills out of the sandwich making a huge mess. I keep giving this place more chances but every time it's the same."}
{"text":"Since opening out here in AZ, I have heard nothing but rave reviews about Baked Bear from friends and classmates. Ice cream sandwiches using cookies, brownies and donuts is a newer thing out here and I was excited to try it. However, I do NOT think it is worth the hype. Baked Bear does have a very wide selection of cookies, ice creams and toppings. I went for Birthday Cake ice cream sandwiched between a red velvet and a s'mores cookie. I got it pressed because nothing beats a warm cookie with ice cream. The ice cream was DELISH. The cake flavor was not overwhelming and I love the sprinkles that were mixed in. The cookies however were pretty meh. The s'mores really tasted like an off chocolate chip cookie and the red velvet was pretty bland. Instead of being warm and gooey from the press, the cookies hardened which made the entire sandwich really difficult to eat. Additionally, my friend ordered two cookies and both came out fairly raw. Perhaps we got a bad batch of cookies, who knows.  If I was in the Scottsdale area, I would definitely come back and get some ice cream. However, I would not make the drive from the West Valley just to have this. Not worth the drive or the calories in my opinion to make that trip."}
{"text":"When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by a friendly face, which is nice to see. However, this place is a little on the pricey side for an ice cream sandwich place. The ice cream itself is pretty good and you have an option of heating your cookies. This place is more for taking \"artsy\" pictures for instagram/snapchat than for enjoying actual ice cream. I did however enjoy eating there. Not sure if I would drive all the way up here for some ice cream though. 3 1/2 stars in total"}
{"text":"Came on a weeknight. Had to wait in line about 10 min. Cookies were legit. Ice cream was good. Staff was nice. All the flys inside landing in the cookies was off putting and should not be tolerated. If you have a fly problem, get a fly zapper or something."}
{"text":"We were there on opening weekend and the line was long but not terrible.  I had the red velvet cookies with mint ice cream-oh my goodness....So good!  The seating is tight..it was a full dining area and we had to squeeze in to sit but it was doable.  I had mine hot pressed which was just lovely and a must-how else can you eat it?!  If you are as tired of fro yo as I am,this is a must."}
{"text":"Yum!  I'd like to try the doughnut sandwich next time!!"}
{"text":"We went here because of the hype, turns out it was just alright.   With the lines being so long, I was expecting to leave Baked Bear wanting more and to come again and again, but I was wrong. First off, the cookies that they used for the ice cream sandwiches didn't taste that fresh. I knew this due to the texture of the cookie. It was super hard and stale, and they ran out of a lot of cookies that we wanted to pick in the first place.   All the ice creams tasted alright. The best one was probably their most famous one, the blue ice cream, I think it's called like Cookie Monster flavor of something. I forgot, it was that unmemorable.   So also with this type of dessert, be prepared to cause a huge mess. The thing about just-prepared ice cream sandwiches is it won't hold its shape after the first bite. The cookie will break, the ice cream with start to melt everywhere, and you'll be forced to eat it in most sloppy way ever! I don't really like that kind of feeling after I'm done eating my dessert.   Overall, it's not worth the wait in line. It's just a trendy place that serves an alright dessert. The cookies were subpar, the ice cream was alright, the overall experience was not so great. I see the reviews and I'm kinda confused about them, cause I don't want to leave a negative review but it wasn't that great.   I'll have to go here again, and I'll edit my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Love the Cookies & Cream cookie at Baked Bear!  While it isn't my personal go-to place for dessert, my kids totally love it and look forward to their treat days when we go there.  My daughter LOVES the Funfetti cookie with cookie dough ice cream, my son gets the half brownie half cookies and cream cookie with mint ice cream and my husband loves the Rocky Road ice cream. YUM! We always go to the one in Pacific Beach and now we get to enjoy it in Scottsdale!  Great place to go before or after a movie since Harkins is in the same complex."}
{"text":"$10 for two ice cream sandwiches with toppings on them!!! Good price good ice cream. Kids love it:)"}
{"text":"Overhyped?? I would say so...  Cookie shells -- hard even after they were warmed up... Thought it was going to melt in my mouth like a pizookie.  Ice cream -- not many to choose from..   Price -- pretty reasonable, 3.95 for a cookie ice cream sandwich   Customer service -- friendly and very welcoming which is why I gave them 2 stars.  Overall, I'm not impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Yum! Took the boys while in Scottsdale for something a little different. Constantly busy with a fast moving line.  Both adult and kid flavors. Could use something a bit health conscious or maybe non-dairy for those of us who have to look on from afar and nibble the fallen sprinkles while the family throughly enjoys themselves. Take one for the team!"}
{"text":"Ice cream was delicious and we love the concept of choose your own flavors. Cookies were a little under done but good none the less."}
{"text":"The hype is not real. Definitely underwhelmed with The Baked Bear when compared to ice cream sandwich shops such as: CREAM, Slickables or Milk. I'll just say the long line is not worth the wait.  The cookie selection is typical and so are the ice cream flavors. Think classic flavors. You can do an ice cream bowl (think Pizookie), donut sandwiches or ice cream cookie sandwiches. Decided to split a cookie ice cream sandwich with a friend and chose to mix and match cookies: Cinnamon Bun and White Chocolate Macadamia with their House ice cream, Bear Batter which is a cake batter dyed blue with brownie pieces. We got it warmed and split as well.  The cookies were underwhelming, crumbly and not warm at all. Definitely expected a soft, chewy and substantial cookie. As for the ice cream, it was icy and tasted freezer burnt. The artificial cake batter flavor was off putting and stains ones mouth blue. Definitely not good nor acceptable to be eating pieces of frost.   The interior is simple, with a vibe of being unfinished. There is however, lots of seating indoors and out on the patio area.  Didn't think The Baked Bear would lack in quality, but found it lacking. Not sure if it's poor execution since I know TBB has multiple locations in San Diego and San Francisco with stellar reviews."}
{"text":"Okay, I have mixed feelings about this place. Excellent selections but the product is VERY heavy on your stomach. The customer service was pretty good but not the best! I enjoyed my cookie the most but I will be sure to come back and sample a few more ice creams before I make my final decision on this place... how I felt the remainder of the day may not be worth it."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! While visiting Scottsdale my friends and I decided to stop into the baked bear. We each got an ice cream sandwich which includes the choice of two different cookies or a brownie and a cookie and then your choice of ice cream and toppings! I chose a funfetti cookie and a white chocolatier macadam but cookie with birthday cake ice cream with sprinkles and Oreo crumbs as my toppings or this case sidings. It was soooooo delicious and the staff was so friendly and made the experience fun! I would highly recommend going ere for dessert! Prices are also very reasonable!."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the place was packed with toddlers and screaming children, so it was very hard to enjoy anything. Not the fault of the establishment of course, but nonetheless, an uncomfortable experience. Also, if you're just going to sell cookies and ice cream, they better both be of the utmost quality which they are not. Very basic boring cookies and tasteless commercial ice cream.    A real disappointment."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  There are better ice cream sandwiches to be had out there.  Can't get on the 5-star bandwagon here because it just doesn't warrant it.  The Baked Bear ice cream sandwich is the equivalent of the overstuffed or Dagwood sandwich.  For $4 you get a very large scoop of ice cream between a couple cookies.  Or brownies, or a doughnut.  Let me compare this place to Ice Cream Sammies down in Chandler.  The cookie is pretty good, superior to Ice Cream Sammies.  It's one of those cookies with a little crunch on the outside and chewy on the inside.  It is often warm without having it warmed.  This alone helps this place out.  The ice cream here, though, is not good.  An average-flavor, too-soft mess that when sandwiched between two slightly warm cookies . . . I'll get to that.  I ordered vanilla between two chocolate chip cookies.  Again, no complaints about the texture of the cookies.  It was a little overly sweet - totally overpowered the vanilla ice cream.  Which was coming out all over the place.  This thing is a little unwieldy, more suited as a spoon affair than just your bare hands.  So again, the fallback comparison to Diddy Riese.  An always warm, well-balanced ice cream sandwich that at $2, is pretty perfect.  Even with ice cream that is not their own.  This is not that place.  All told, it is a pretty average ice cream sandwich where the cookie outshines the ice cream and where the finished product does not exceed the sum of the parts."}
{"text":"The ice cream sandwiches here are so great. There are so many different options from the different cookies to the selection of ice cream flavors and toppings.  The price is affordable, and the sandwiches are big, I went with my boyfriend and we split one and it was enough for both of us. Definitely recommend this place if you have a sweet tooth or an ice cream sandwich craving:)"}
{"text":"This was a serious let down, and to be honest I probably docked it an extra star, because it just doesn't live up to the hype. The cashiers and servers were nice enough, but nothing special. The inside was clean, but again nothing really stood out. I approached it much like I would when ordering a pizza from a new pizza place, which is to order something basic and traditional like a pepperoni pizza. In my opinion a good restaurant should excel at the basic traditional things. In this case I ordered an ice cream cookie sandwich, vanilla ice cream, chocolate chip cookies, and sprinkles. They asked if I wanted it hot pressed, and I enthusiastically replied yes, hoping that this would address the problem many other reviewers noted with the cookie being to hard. It did not. Upon my first attempt at biting into the sandwich, a majority of the ice cream squeezed out in every direction except my mouth! I decided to try eating some of the excess squeezed out ice cream with a spoon first, and then attempt another bite. The second attempt did not go any better, and neither did the 3rd attempt! I ended up eating a majority of the ice cream with a spoon, which in my opinion is not very good tasting. I ended up with two messy cookies and a thin layer of ice cream in-between them. The cookie was not that amazing either. I feel like it was to thin, and to hard, especially for an ice cream sandwich of that magnitude! If you want a good ice cream sandwich try Trader Joes Sublime Ice Cream Sandwiches, or for a truly gourmet ice cream sandwich check out your local Fry's or Whole Foods for Coolhaus Ice Cream Sandwiches. If you want amazing ice cream desserts, stick with Sweet Republic!"}
{"text":"I walked into this establishment planning to buy a dessert. But while I was looking over the choices, I noticed one of the workers yawn directly on the brownies and cookies that she was arranging. Hence, I walked directly out. It is not only proper etiquette to cover your mouth and not breathe on food to be served to others, but also as a general mannerism to cover your mouth when you're coughing, sneezing, etc."}
{"text":"Brownies are balanced and chocolatey, not too sweet and the perfect size. What's more, when you get that extra bit of melty chocolate chunk- even better! The ice cream itself is ok. Some of the flavors tasted a bit too artificial for me. The cookies are a bit too hard for my liking- I'm guessing because they need to hold up the ice cream? (we tried the chocolate chip and bear tracks).   I'll be back again when I'm in the mood for a brownie."}
{"text":"SO AMAZING!!! I saw multiple ads on FB about this place before I had an excuse to visit. I used to live down the street from where they put this gem but I'm happy (and sad) that I don't because I'd be visiting way too often! Actually I still go out of my way sometimes to drive up here lol. I've had a few of their cookies to which I've decided that red velvet is my absolute favorite. Their brownies are also scrumptious! I've topped every cookie/brownie with hot fudge and I die a little inside knowing that something as bomb as this is a zillion calories! You definitely get a lot for what you pay for an ice cream cookie sandwich here. They have a bigger selection of cookies than other shops I've tried too. EAT HERE! They are generous with their toppings :)"}
{"text":"Great concept, cool ice cream, but wish the ice cream was better. 4/5 considering the best of the best is milk cream bar in NYC"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The line can get pretty long but definitely worth the wait. Endless choices, and huge portions!! It was so hard to choose!!! Not to mention, the customer service was amazing as everyone was just so \"up-beat\" and friendly! Definitely recommend this place and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Omg so good!  This place is amazing.  Better than your typical Baskin Robbins or Coldstone.  There are many options to pick from-brownie or cookie bowls or ice cream sandwiches.  I had gotten an ice cream sandwiches with a brownie on one side and a chocolate chip cookie on the other.  The brownie and cookie were nice and soft and warm.  Made for the perfect ice cream sandwich. Can't wait to go back when I'm on that side of town!"}
{"text":"Must try! The cookies are soft and flavorful & the ice cream is really creamy. It's so hard to choose from all their delicious looking options. I chose a funfetti and cookies and cream cookie with birthday cake ice cream. They warm it up with the ice cream in it which I thought was weird and was going to melt and ruin the ice cream inside but it didn't. It came out with warm cookies and the ice cream was fine. It was so good warm and it is a pretty large size.  When I went there was a lot of people right after we came and very limited seating inside or outside."}
{"text":"I remember when this place first opened the lines were so bad I didn't want to brave a visit. Well, I finally got around to it. And it was worth it!  The concept is cool: custom ice cream sandwiches. You can pick cookies, brownies, donut or a combo to be the top and bottom of your sandwich. Then pick an ice cream flavor and topping if desired.   Considering I always seem to be making a mess when I eat, no matter how hard I try, I decided the classic sandwich was a recipe for disaster. I opted for the much easier to eat brownie bowl, where you get a brownie and then add your ice cream and toppings on top. I got espresso ice cream and sprinkles. I believe you can also get a cookie bowl.   The scoop of ice cream was huge. For $6.50 it was a good size and I thought worth it. My partner got the same except with vanilla ice cream, and she really enjoyed the brownie.   The girl working was nice and offered us samples, although we didn't need any, and was available for any questions. The inside was clean and they have a water station. They also have punch cards - buy 9 get the 10th free. Not a bad deal.   I'd return to try some flavor combos and maybe some day I'll be brave enough to handle an actual sandwich."}
{"text":"The service was as sweet as the confections. First visit today. I chose an chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich with chocolate chip cookie dough. The servings are very generous and the price is inexpensive for what you get. I honestly had a great experience. The cookies were fresh and yummy and the cookie dough ice cream was to die for. Too bad it's so far from home otherwise I would visit several times a week. I have absolutely to complaints to make about \"The Baked Bear.\" The great reviews speak for themselves."}
{"text":"After a so-so pizza, I headed on down here for some dessert.  I haven't really been to any \"cookie ice cream sandwich\" type places before, so I decided to scope out The Baked Bear.  I was glad I did!  I walked inside and was greeted immediately by a sweet young lady.  I placed my order for a Combo Sandwich with cookie dough ice cream, and Heath bar pieces.  Paid the lady my money (just under $6.00), was handed my sandwich, sat down and dug in.  Here is how it was.........  Combo Sandwich- The combo sandwich includes a cookie of your choice (I chose chocolate chip) for the top, and a brownie for the bottom.  They put a massive scoop of cookie dough ice cream in the middle, and then roll it in Heath bar pieces.  Good lord, this thing was great!  The cookie was probably my least favorite part of the sandwich, but even then, it was still delicious!  The ice cream tasted great, there were tons of little Heath bar pieces, and the best part of the whole sandwich..THE BROWNIE!  They cook their brownies on a huge cookie sheet, and they are incredibly thin.  They are flat out delicious though!  These thin brownies are perfect!  Chocolaty, fudgy, crisp yet chewy.  Pretty much the perfect brownie.  Next time, I am bypassing the cookie, and just going with a brownie sandwich.  These things were awesome!    Overall, I am happy to have found this spot.  Ice cream is probably my favorite food in the whole world (followed closely by pizza), and this spot does it right!  Those brownies are to die for!  Dare I say, the best brownies I have ever had?  Damn straight!  Can't wait to come back to get a brownie sandwich!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong here?! Very tasty and highly recommended. I ordered a cookie/brownie sandwich with cookie dough ice cream in the middle. Definitely suggest the \"Hot Press\" option to warm it up. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Yep, what else is there to say about this place sent from Jesus. I got the half cookie, half brown sandwich with vanilla ice cream and brownie bits in it. It was knock your socks off good!   Thank goodness I don't live close to this or I would be coming here every night!"}
{"text":"I'll probably have to stop by every time I am in town! We went on a Friday night and it was packed but we went through quickly. The staff are super friendly here and the ice cream and cookies are beyond delicious! I recommend the Baked Bear to anyone looking to satisfy their sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, wonderful concept and fantastic food! Just be prepared to wait in line, I have never been there when there wasn't a long line! Not because of bad or slow service, just because it's so stinking good!"}
{"text":"Three stars is summed up as \"A-OK\" and that's exactly how I feel about Baked Bear. We were excited for them to open up in Arizona and I'm glad we stopped by. Is there better local ice cream shops in the valley? Yep, definitely. Is Baked Bear worth the visit? Sure is!  I got an Ice Cream Cookie sandwich with chocolate ice cream. Cookies were soft and gooey, ice cream was lacking flavor but was ok overall. The wife got the cookie bowl with vanilla ice cream and enjoyed it.   If I'm nearby and craving ice cream, I'll be back in here. Otherwise I'll head to some other spots in town for great ice cream."}
{"text":"I'm really between a 2 and a 3. For such a highly anticipated, highly rated place, I was very underwhelmed and unimpressed. It was just okay.  My husband and I went with our 17 mos old twins on a Friday evening. We had planned this day all week and chose Friday bc just the two of us are leaving our twins for a week for the first time since they've been born. We love trying new places and wanted this to be special for them. We should have thought that out a bit more- going to an already busy plaza on a Friday evening. The place was packed- great for business. But not so much for toddlers. I ordered chocolate ice cream sandwiched between two peanut butter cookies. My husband ordered the bear bowl with a brownie and cookies and cream ice cream. While both were good, it didn't leave either of us hankering for more. Mine was supposed to be warmed up and they put it in what looks like a panini maker but no warmth whatsoever. It tasted very artificial. Nothing authentic, unique or really homemade about it.  Additionally, bc it was so packed, there was no seating. Understandable- can't fault them for that. However, one table was actually being used by the owners/general managers/shift managers, whoever they were. They were in the middle of an interview. I thought this was in poor taste at a peak hour and no tables available for paying customers. We ended up sitting at a bench along the wall that I actually think belonged to pita jungle.  All in all, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything special either. I think if there wasn't so much hype about it, I wouldn't have been so disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg!! Ah-mazing!! I was having a chocolate attack... This place more than field it!! Plus, Jake is a rockstar he hooked me up"}
{"text":"If you want two soft, savory cookies with ice cream and toppings rolled on and for you tongue to experience pure euphoria, plan a trip here. Period.  If you hate delicious desserts, stay away."}
{"text":"I Scream You Scream! So delicious! So many choices it's crazy! You dream it, they make it! The cookies, brownies, and donuts are baked fresh on site everyday! Contrary to what another reviewer mentioned, I was told they do not make their ice cream daily but it is the recipes do belong to Baked Bear. I'm picky about my ice cream but I was super impressed. It was so great! And there's over a dozen flavors. I overheard that they even have a gluten free cookie and soy ice cream. The staff is really happy and pleasant. Super busy Grand Opening but worth the wait. The price is perfect for what you are getting. All around a fun place to sit on the patio and enjoy a treat :-)"}
{"text":"Being that I am originally from San Diego, thought I would try out The Baked Bear which recently opened a location here in Scottsdale near me after seeing them on a local news show.  Because of the news show, seems everyone else decided to come try them out because it was busy. Actually overtime I am near this location, there is always a lot of people there including those bringing large groups of kids which I can tell you is not fun because of the size of the shop.  Seating inside is likewise very limited so if you don't want to sit outside in the heat best to have one person in your group grab a table while you order.  The menu offers a decent selection of ice creams, unfortunately the flavors seem to be those that appeal primarily to kids and women who I am guessing are their main customer base.  Depending on what you order, the staff are pretty good at putting it together quickly unless you have to wait for a fresh batch of cookies.  Overall the ice cream was OK, not as good as Cold Stone and the portions could have been better for the price.  I will likely go back at some later time once the \"newness\" wears off .... which might be a while.  In the mean time, not worth spending 15 to 30 minutes waiting in long lines for."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of The Baked Bear but frequent visits would be colossally detrimental to my waistline, so I definitely will NOT frequent this place often.  That said though, I love the concept. Ice cream sandwiches galore...not just made the \"traditional\" way with two cookies. No siree, not at The Baked Bear! How about two brownies! Or two donut halves! Or a brownie and a cookie! OR a donut and a brownie! It's like a sick, sugar infested, calorie-laden dream/nightmare in this place.  They have numerous different ice cream flavors and numerous cookie flavors also, which was awesome but a little stress inducing to have so many choices!  On our visit, I ordered an ice cream sandwich with a donut on top, strawberry cheesecake ice cream in the middle, and a peanut butter cookie on the bottom- WITH SPRINKLES. It was deeeee-lish to say the least. My blood sugar probably sky-rocketed but who cares? Diabeetus here I come!  My brother and my niece ordered brownie ice cream sandwiches with cookies and cream ice cream in the middle and raved about them.   This place is the bees knees y'all!  I will come here four times a year, once a season, for a quarterly indulgence and that's it! ;-)"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!!  We are glad you came to town.  Everything is delicious and worth coming back for."}
{"text":"My wife dragged me here and got to say it was worth it. You choose your exterior of your ice cream sandwich cookies, brownies or doughnuts.. Then your ice cream and then toppings. We didn't get too wild and get toppings. My wife did ask for it warm and they put it in this waffle maker that warms up the cookies on the outside without melting the ice cream too much. It was pretty damn good, its pretty nice size to so we split one. Should have come with a insulin shot its so sweet!"}
{"text":"I took the grand kids to the new Gilbert location.  Place is very small and NO where to sit. I think this location will have issues...just to small to accommodate their guests. The treat was good, not great.  Great idea, but you have to have room to sit and eat. You get this in the hot summer with no where to sit, melts all over you, not sure they thought this out."}
{"text":"First time last night for my birthday, such a great place. Only bad thing is having to decide, so many yummy options. I already want to go back and try another combination!"}
{"text":"What do bears really do when they hibernate? They make irresistible ice cream sandwiches. Not any bear, The Baked Bear.  Bred in San Diego and judging by the crowd level, it seemed like a convincing proposition to have.   I don't know how the lines are during the week but the weekend looked quite busy. If you arrive at night, you might see fog hovering around the entrance created from the water mist to help cool the eager crowd.  While cookie sandwich is the core concept, you can easily opt for a cone or a sundae.  As a first timer, we went traditional and got the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich! If you are not in the mood for cookies you can opt for brownies or even donuts!  There are a picking of flavors but one that stood out like a cactus on a hot summer day, was their Bear Batter flavor! If you love chocolate cake, this is for you! Each lick is a lick of cake.  It's quite delicious and tasty! Its bright blue color will make your yummy creation pop.  Additionally you can have them warm up the cookie sandwich before its served to you.  Don't worry the ice cream won't melt.  I too was worried about that.  Next time you think of Bears in the summer time or even winter, think of The Baked Bear."}
{"text":"Nice different concept in a needed area, have been going to Slickables on Mill Ave for the Ice Cream Sandwich, Slickables is half the price at $2.00 per ice cream sandwich.  At Baked Bear the ice cream sandwiches are $3.95.  Baked Bear claims that they bake their cookies and are fresh, which they are pretty good. They also will heat press the cookie sandwich before serving to you.  Not much of a complicated process, get 2 cookies, place ice cream in between.   Priced at $3.95 a sandwich compared to $2.00 at the other place, the only trade off is I don't have to drive to Mill Ave from North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We stopped into the Baked Bear because of the constant line they drew in. I am not sure what the hype is about. It is a neat business idea and people seem to love it, I just don't think it's worth $4.50 for two hard cookies and an average scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"Fun experience with something that my family has made at home to much success.  Take 2 cookies and put some ice cream in the middle.  This place was busy on the night we came, line was out the door, but we waited no longer than 10 min to get our ice cream cookie.  A nice treat and something different than the usual froyo we usually get when my wife and I go out."}
