{"text":"My take-out half-chicken dinner with lots of vegetables was quite good. I also ordered a small order of olives which at $3 was a very generous portion and some of the meatiest olives I've ever had. That is why they get an extra star. Because these damned olives are so meaty."}
{"text":"I came here from a friends raving recommendation that this place serves the best chicken in town.  It has a small store front, but when you walk in you see there's actually a big space for dinning at the back.  However, I just came for the take out experience and order the dinner for two package for $18. 

Expecting the chicken to be overrated from my friends glowing review, I was actually surprised by how great the chicken actually is here.  The chicken is perfectly moist and tender, it's by far the most juicy chicken I have ever sliced into.  I can see the difference even before I've taken a bite out of it versus say something one buys from Metro or gets from Swiss Chalet.  The sides of rice and fresh potatoes were just ok to me, but the in house made hot sauce was splendid."}
{"text":"I've been back a number of times ordering the chicken dinner and each time it was delicious.
* The salt content has improved.
* The hot sauce is a little less vinegary which is subjective (I prefer red peppery)."}
{"text":"Came recently.  LOVED the chicken!  I thought it was juicy and tender.  Got it with the hot sauce, which was just spicy enough to make my lip tingle.  Also tried the potato balls and paella, which were bland in comparison.  I'd stick with the chicken.  Can't wait to come back and try the burnt custard! I know they have live music on the weekend, but just took out and didn't stay around."}
{"text":"$18 including tax for a whole chicken, a big container of rice, and a big container of potatoes. What a steal!!! To me, it's not really a combo for 4 but that's just because I'm a big eater. It was more like a combo for 3 because I count as 2 when I'm hungry. I alone can eat 3/4 of a chicken when hungry. Yup. I'm a beast that looks like a sheep. 

Anyways, the 2 of us finished the whole chicken but had about half the rice/potatoes left. How was it? Good. It's really hard to go wrong with grilled chicken. 

They didn't add enough hot sauce to it. The rice wasn't the best rice I've had at a Churrasco place and the potatoes weren't the best I had. The potatoes had quite a bit of oil to them. The chicken was not the most juicy I've had. But all these can be overlooked because of the amazing value. Besides, it's grilled chicken. How can I hate on grilled chicken? It's already miles above those grocery store air chilled chickens. 

It's definitely not a fine dining place. I saw nobody sitting inside. Everyone was getting take out. You'll probably do the same. 

They have other things too like ribs and fish but I have a feeling I'll never get around to trying those."}
{"text":"It's always exciting seeing new restaurants open in my neighbourhood, and tonight I had a chance to check out this recently opened churrasco by grabbing some take out while heading home. While perhaps the Little Italy to Dufferin strip of College St does have a lot of chicken places already, this place impressed me so much that I don't see it failing, and am looking forward to returning. 

I started with the \"Combo for 4\" which is a whole chicken along with one big container of rice and one of parisian potatoes as well for $18. Everything was a win. Tender and moist chicken, rice with just the right amount of fluffyness and seasoning, and potatoes just big enough to cut in half for the perfect forkful of chicken/rice/potato combined. The hot sauce was also a nice consistency with a good savoury yet spicy kick, and wasn't as oily as a lot of churrasco/churrasqueiras can be. I also grabbed a rack of ribs ($9) which were fairly priced and had a great sauce but were a bit on the dry side. Also, a big phyllo pastry filled with spinach ($2) which was a great starter and will buy again for sure.

One weird thing that had been bothering me since first seeing the signage put up outside the building while the renovations were being done over the past couple months...
Paul.S Churrasco. 
Paul dot S Churrasco? In no context (internet domains, people naming, or standard grammar usage) have I seen a period in such a weird spot. Well anyways I asked the girl working the cash register and she was saying that while the pronunciation is Pauls Churrasco, the S stands for the last name of their family. So while I still don't necessarily understand the period usage, I'm willing to overlook it since you rarely go wrong with a newly opened family business that actually has a couple generations of the family involved. And based on first impressions, the period usage will be quickly forgotten after destroying a tasty plate of chicken rice and potatoes."}
{"text":"I live in the area and thought, \"who cares just another chicken place\".  I finally tried it the other week and I am hooked!  The chicken is so much juicer and tasty than others around.  Also the potatoes have more flavor & less grease.  It's also refreshing that there are ribs, fish, cutlets, diffrent types of salads, olives and grilled veggies.  They have amazing daily deals!  There is a lunch special, whole chickens for $8 before 4pm (7 days per week) and the last time I went I saw a sign for all you can eat ribs on Wednesdays.  It's clean, modern and you see all the cooking done in front of you.  What also set's Pauls apart from the others is that the staff are polite and want to help you!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. Was kinda just walking and trying to find somewhere to eat and found this place, eat-in or take out.

So here's the thing, Little Portugal has a lot of places that sell rotisserie style chicken. This place seems like most people get takeout, but it's a real deal. $10 for a half chicken with rice and potatoes. $18 for a whole chicken dinner. These prices for what you get is a steal.

So the Chicken was quite tasty, it wasn't particularly hot but when I asked for the hot sauce (yes, ask for this and give it a try), the taste was super!

The potatoes, seems boiled then fried into potato balls which was great.

On the way in I saw this paella which I don't know if it was special for that day (a Friday), but for the extra $2, it was well worth it as there were a lot of shrimp in there.

Right on the corner of Ossington and College, it has a lot to compete with but I think it's doing quite well."}
{"text":"As many have been saying here \"Much more than just another Portuguese Chicken and Fish Shop\".  For something of a change, other than their wonderful rotisserie and grilled chicken and wonderful battered and unbattered fish, I suggest the pork chops or the roast beef in reduced wine gravy. Succulent!"}
{"text":"I've been back probably 10 times since writing my initial review and I have to downgrade a star for inconsistency.  While the potatoes are usually delicious and crispy, they have been undercooked a few times.  Also, the rice can be extremely greasy.  The service continues to be a bit rude as well."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars*

Came here a couple times, and I am going to be honest, almost everything sucks but the chicken. It is safe to say that the chicken could be the best around this area. The rice, is alright, and the potato balls are always under cooked. (Still not bad) 
I had the fish the last time I payed a visit there, and there was nothing really special about it. I was a bit disappointed. 

The decor through out the place, was very pleasing to the eye, and the service was speedy and friendly."}
