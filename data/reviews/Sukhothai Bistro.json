{"text":"Try the Mango Tango Curry. You will not regret it. It was just the right amount of sweet and savory with good size chunks of meat. The portions of these meals are also very reasonable. This place is a bit small so if you're planning to go with a large group, I recommend you make a reservation if possible. BYOB. And they also give you a piece of candy when you receive the bill which is a great touch."}
{"text":"I can't believe there is yet another Thai place in Squirrel Hill...but I had to try  it. Sukhothai stands up well in comparison to the other Thai establishments! Service was good, the atmosphere was slightly nicer than the others (white tablecloths, excellent presentation of food).

We had: 
-fresh rolls (VERY good, especially the flavorful sauce)
-papaya salad (good, but on the limey-side and a slightly small portion for $7)
-dumplings (fine, as dumplings go, but a fantastic sauce elevated these)
-drunken noodles (great flavor; we got the American spice level which wasn't especially spicy to us)
-spicy fried rice (maybe the least exciting entree--nothing wrong with it, just not nearly as good as the noodles) - note: we ordered this Thai hot and it still wasn't overly spicy. The waitress brought out extra spicy sauces for us, which was nice.

Overall: Not the best Thai I've ever had in my life, but a solidly enjoyable experience. I liked it better than the other Thai in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I wrote a review about this place more than a year ago. Alas, many things have changed since then. I believe that they changed the cook, because the food is now terrible.
I used to get two of my favorite dishes--the red curry and the drunken noodles--and share them with my lunch partner.
Last week I went there for lunch with one of my best friends. Both of us had lunch at this place before, together and on separate occasions.
I am not sure whether dinner options are better than lunch dishes, but what we ordered was terrible: the soup looked and tasted just like dishwasher water; the greens in the salad were wilted and some salad leaves were yellow. The drunken noodle dish barely had any trace of green peppers. The curry had lots and lots of bamboo but not much else in terms of fresh vegetables. A very sad lunch--thank goodness for my friend's warm company!

To add insult to injury--or rather, injury to the insultingly bad food--  my friend also had an unfortunate accident: she caught her finger in the broken chair she was sitting on, in between the chair's metal structure and the seat. I cannot believe they kept a broken chair in the restaurant! A kid could have also gotten hurt with that chair.

The waitress did not fully understand what happened, even though I took the chair away and asked her to not put it again at the table. I also asked her to bring ice for my friend, who was amazingly polite given the pain she was experiencing.

No one came to apologize. The waitress then brought the dishes, and that was it. I think she was nice, but I really believe that she did not understand what happened because of her limited English skills. 

After such an incident, I believe that some people would probably either leave the place immediately, or at least expect to be given a significant discount.
We did not leave. On the contrary, we left even a nice tip.
However, this was the last time I would walk into that restaurant. It is unfortunate that the owner did not know how to maintain and improve a business that started so auspiciously."}
{"text":"We'd eaten in the restaurant and had a good experience, which is why they are getting two stars.  The delivery service we had was HORRIBLE.  Food was ordered at 6:30 on a Saturday.  Estimated time of delivery was 7:30-7:45.  Food arrived at 8:45 and was a best tepid, so by the time everything was reheated it was 9 pm.  Unacceptable and calls to the restaurant got only the vaguest of apologies.  The yellow curry was swimming in sauce, which would have been okay if there was plenty of solids in there too, but that lacking.  It was SO bad an experience overall, we won't be re-ordering or returning."}
{"text":"Overall, a splendid experience.  Excellent, very tasty and well-presented dishes, and a very personable host to boot!  Go, and enjoy."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and don't have much patience for watered down versions. 

My visit to sukothai encouraged me to warn others. Food was bland and uninspired, the waitstaff was absent and when they forgot to bring us a dish, we rejoiced and went to grab some dumplings down the street."}
{"text":"This place went down hill along time ago.... to answer the previous poster's question, they haven't been open in at least 3 weeks.. no sign or anything."}
{"text":"Pleasant environment. Good service with active take-out business. Mango Tango Curry is a specialty entree which is excellent. Appetizers are good esp Sukhothai roll. Sweet sticky rice with mango is a winner! Worth multiple visits to try their other entrees."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner later on a Saturday night. This is a small, cozy restaurant, dimly lit and prettily decorated inside. They seemed short on staff so the wait times were longer than I would have liked overall, which is the main reason I am not rating them as 5 stars. (Also, the bathroom is located in the basement and wasn't the cleanest.)

We ordered the Sukhothai Roll and Noodle Delight with chicken to share. Everything was delicious. The rolls were served piping hot, and the skins were delightfully crispy. The sauce was pretty good as well. And it was presented so beautifully! The Noodle Delight, which we ordered as \"baby hot,\" was pretty hot by my standards. Thank goodness I had a glass of water, or else I may not have been able to get through much. It was the best Thai food I have ever had--so many flavors in one bite! Sweet, sour, salty, tangy... it was delicious. I only wish there was a higher vegetable/chicken-to-noodle ratio.

Overall, a wonderful experience. The owner was very friendly. I would return in a heartbeat if I wasn't so concerned about my wallet!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. Their soups are delicious. Lunch is the Best Buy  soup salad and a main dish for as little as $8
I just brought two Korean students here. One said it was the best meal of her life
The three stars is because of late delivery of meals. The food itself is fantastic"}
{"text":"One thing that distinguishes Sukhothai from other similar priced Thai restaurants in Squirrel Hill is it knows how to present their dish. This quality really gets me. 

The food is also very good. I ordered Penang Curry and love it!!! My boyfriend had yellow curry said it's OK yet can be more strong flavored. Also loved vegetable crispy rolls. 

Above all, I enjoyed everything including the service. There is not too many options around Forbes if I want to have an around $30 meal with my boyfriend and at the same time enjoy a little elegant style. Sukhothai totally made it."}
{"text":"This is not Thai food.  Every dish is a soupy mess with no developed flavor.  I didn't order meat in a broth for every entree I expect distinct dishes and flavors.  I don't think this is actual Thai.  Plus, the owner has no idea about Thai food.  Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant when it first opened. The food is fairly good and the BYOB policy (no corkage fee) was very appealing. I was going to Sukhothai on an almost weekly basis, but then I had a very negative experience that has kept me from going back.

I ordered my usual dish and I noticed that it was $4 higher on the bill than on the menu. I figured that it was an honest mistake and pointed it out to the server (who was also the owner). He pretended not to understand what I was talking about. I asked him to bring the menu back so I could show him the listed price of the dish. He said he would fix it, I gave him my card, and then he brought my bill back -- and he had still overcharged me by $2. I never returned.

This may seem like a strong reaction to a small overcharge, but there are so many Thai restaurants in Squirrel Hill that I refuse to eat at a restaurant with bad customer service."}
{"text":"The food was quite tasty. We had a cashew nut vegetable dish, which was as one would expect, but in a good way. We additionally ordered a peanut sauce curry (the Rama curry if my memory serve me), which was new. It was quite a different experience but an enjoyable one. I will probably be back to try more dishes. It's good to have another DIFFERENT Thai experience in Squirrell Hill since the competition, Bangkok Balcony and Silk Elephant pretty much have the same menu."}
{"text":"Ordered at 8:12pm.  It is now 10:02pm and no food. Awful. Do not order.  Unless you want to wait for 2 hours and not get your food."}
{"text":"The requested mild pad thai was too spicy for our kids, but we loved the food."}
{"text":"Sukhothai has become my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. Some of my favorites are the Mango Tango, Pad Thai, Spicy Fried Rice, and all of the curries. Sukhothai manages to find just the right  balance of spicy, salty, and sweet. I also really appreciate the spicy sauces on the side."}
{"text":"My recent experience at this place is specifically the reason why I like to try new places. I came here last Saturday night pretty hungry. I ordered the Pad See Ew, which was wide rice noodles in a sweet sauce, and the banana coconut milk with tapioca for dessert. The entree was delicious and hit the spot. While my dessert was a tad too sweet for my taste I still found it to be a unique and exquisite little dish. The service was excellent as the staff were very friendly and efficient in bringing my food and refilling my water. The atmosphere effectively combines fine dining ambiance with the simplicity and laid back atmosphere of being a bistro. I most certainly see myself coming here again to try their other selections."}
{"text":"Sukhothai Bistro is awesome. The restaurant is  very clean, the staff is so kind. You can feel Thai culture if you stay in this this restraint. The Tom Yum soup in this restaurant is the best in Pittsburgh. You can enjoy eating delicious Thai food in this restaurant definitely!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Sukhothai has gone downhill in the past year, and food quality is well below par.   The pad thai was completely uninspired -- a blob of brownish noodles on a plate and not much else.   The curry was reasonably flavorful, but the sauce had \"broken\" due to overcooking, and it wound up an oily mess.   Even the water tasted off -- tap water with no filter to speak of.    There are much better options for Thai in Pittsburgh, including Bangkok Balcony and Silk Elephant, both less than one block away.    Pass on this one."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a group of ten on a Saturday evening before the rush.  Everyone enjoyed what they had.  The service was great.  They manage to get the meals out in a reasonable time for the small kitchen.  The owner, John, is engaging and helpful in interpreting the menu.  The food was well prepared from fresh ingredients.    
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant through yelp and I am so glad I did! This has to be one of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh if not the best. The last two times my boyfriend and I ordered simian island and pad see ew the first time and pad thai and green curry the second time.The flavors are authentic and flavorful. The portion size is of good value for the price. Besides the meal, the staff is actually nice. The boss is friendly and saw to it that I was satisfied with the order. Overall, this place has become my go-to restaurant for a delicious meal!!"}
{"text":"Of the many Thai places in squirrel hill, this would be toward the bottom of the list. 

Went here for dinner and the place smelled moldy and musty. My water and the water of my two dining partners had some type of debris floating around in it. After three attempts at clean water, we gave up and decided not to drink any water. 

One of my dining partners had an issue with her meal, requested to order something different. Our server had difficulty understanding what we wanted due to a language barrier. The server eventually asked the chef to come out to speak with us. The chef immediately became irate with my dining partner without fully understanding the issue and refused to accommodate. Eventually we were able to explain our needs to the chef and she  begrudgingly obliged. 

Overall, the food was mediocre. Our server was nice. The only good part of the whole experience was that they are able to accommodate for vegan needs."}
{"text":"Best thai food I had in a long time. I ordered the chefs special sukhothai entrée and my wife got penang curry. Both of them were delicious and can't wait to go back and try something new"}
{"text":"Good new spot. It's small and cozy but not cramped. Waitress hustled and was on it. Had the dumplings and the roll for apps. Both very tasty. Tum yum soup. Great. 4 entrees. Pad thai, not enough peanut flavor and more sour than sweet. It was good but not typical pad Thais and not as good as silk elephant. Coconut curry with seafood was very good. Shrunken noodles were the best dish and highly recommend it. Fried rice with chicken was a little bland. All this food was 67 bucks. Can't beat that. I'd plan to be a regular here. Byob and prices are very reasonable. Check it out."}
{"text":"This restaurant is new to Squirrel Hill, where it opened about 5 months ago. The staff is warm and courteous. The food is prepared fresh in an authentic Thai style. I started with their Silver Soup, a simple mix of chicken, vegetables and simple broth, with mild spices they popped more and more with each spoonful. My entree was a noodle dish entitled Se Ew. I had it with duck. As I'm not a spice Fan, I had it mild. It's savory flavor really hit the spot. My wife had the Kaw Soi, a noodle curry soup, which she enjoyed immensely. The owner came out to say hi, and he was extremely gracious. I would recommend this small little gem. But get there early, it fills up fast!"}
{"text":"I know what you are thinking. Does squirrel hill need another Asian restaurant? One always needs great restaurants.   And this is delicious  perhaps the best pad Thai I have had.  And I eat a lot of Thai.  Service is great and the people care.  Bravo"}
{"text":"I wouldn't order delivery unless you do it well in advance. Delivery takes 1+ hour and were about .7 miles away from the place. Do take out if you want the food warm and timely."}
{"text":"Okay so I normally like Sukothai, but I have to start this review by saying that they have really terrible Pad Thai. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it the next day. I don't know why its so bad, but I hate it. I will never order it again. Besides the Pad Thai, everything else I have had there has been good. The angel shrimp, vegetarian crispy roll, drunken noodles, and different curries. I love their vegetarian crispy rolls and they have good lunch specials. We usually order take out, but have enjoyed eating in the restaurant on multiple occasions. It is very clean with great service."}
{"text":"This is the place that I will go every week!! I come here because my friend recommended me to go if i want to try the best curry in Pittsburgh so i went there! I was ordered the Mango Tanggo curry with American spicy. I did a good thing! It's the best curry I ever had!! This curry served with mangos !! It's very fabulous!!! Like my friend said if you want to try the best curry in Pittsburgh you should come here!"}
{"text":"I tried to go here on 2 different nights for dinner, once on a Monday night at 6pm and another time weeks later on a Tuesday night at 7pm...and both times they were unexpectedly closed. What are the chances?! Restaurants should have consistent hours (unless there is an emergency of course)."}
{"text":"My friends and I were hungry and decided we would try this new Thai place.  While very unassuming from the street, the atmosphere was very classy but casual.  Each of us ordered different meals--a curry, fried rice, and pad thai--all were excellent.  All of us enjoy spicy foods, but with the warm weather, we just wanted something with a little kick.  The fried rice and pad thai were medium spicy (spice level 2), while the curry was ordered to be hot (spice level 3).  The levels did vary among each dish.  The pad thai was a little mild, while the fried rice definitely had a kick.  I was worried about the curry, but the coconut milk lessened the heat, so it was a pleasant heat.  Overall, the food and service was great.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty around 6 p.m. The server was polite, very slow and barely spoke or understood English. After a 20 minute wait for the meal, I was given the wrong dish. It was returned and the correct dish was served. The food was tasty and fresh, but the service was horrible. This restaurant will not survive without proper management. There are too many other great Thai restaurants with wonderful service in Pgh."}
{"text":"I had Salmon chushee. And my husband had Kho soi. Both dishes were so good. I want to go back to try Tom yum noodle."}
{"text":"I finally tried this restaurant after hearing great things from friends about it. I cannot believe it took me so long! My husband and I tried the fresh rolls and shared the green curry and drunken noodle lunch specials (all vegetarian). The rice soup was absolutely delicious as a starter, and all of our food was incredibly fresh, hot and delicious. We had the mango with sticky rice for dessert and loved it as week. Great Thai food+ great service=my new go-to restaurant in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"From the beginning to the end....yum! The Thai iced tea is terrific..not too sweet. Fresh rolls, curries, noodle dishes...all awesome. We've been there several times and I have not been disappointed AT ALL. We can't wait to go back again!!

The owner is very helpful and personable. The wait staff equally as helpful and personable!!

Welcome to the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Squirrel Hill, and maybe in Pittsburgh. The food is delicious and the owner is extremely friendly, which makes me feel good about supporting the place. It's fairly small inside, but they also do takeout which I take frequent advantage of.

Best appetizers: Fresh Rolls (uncooked, soft wrapper), Sukothai Rolls (fried, delicious).
Best entrées: Drunken Noodle, Tom Yum Soup, Spicy Basil, Noodle Delight.
BYOB.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wasn't even aware this place existed but I noticed they added themselves to the GrubHub ordering app so we gave them a try.

Anyway, the food was really good! We had the pad thai, dumplings, tempura and the basil chicken.  Everything was cooked well and tasted fresh. The \"American hot\" spice level rating was spot on...just enough to make your lips burn a bit but not so much to make eating uncomfortable. 

 I especially enjoyed the tempura, it wasn't completely covered in \"fry\" and the veggies were not sliced flat but in stick shapes. Prices were good, what you would expect for the area, maybe even a touch less."}
{"text":"Satay chicken was too salty. But the curry was good. Presentation of food was great. Will come back if I'm back in Pittsburgh someday"}
{"text":"Vegan options abound.
Affordable.
Delicious.
Large portions.
Friendly.
Quaint.
Only place open at 11am in this gawddam town.
One single Thai song on continuous repeat. (true)."}
{"text":"Excellent food, enthusiastic service. Cozy, modern atmosphere. Not too pricey. I reccommend the mango chicken curry"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here using Grubhub, and it went generally fine. Took about an hour to get my food, but that was fine with me. I got a Pad See Ew and a Pineapple Fried Rice - both of which came nicely presented for take-out (the fried rice came with a spear thing of pineapple on the side that was pretty cool). So no complaints there. Nothing revolutionary and I was a little disappointed that they didn't offer a Massaman curry variant.

But then I'd also ordered a Thai Iced Coffee with tapioca. Normally, Thai restaurants can do no wrong with my and Thai Iced Coffee - I love the stuff. But this one - it didn't have the touch of sweetness that most do, it was really just a generic iced coffee. And then there was the tapioca - rock solid crumbly balls that were just plain unpleasant to eat. It was truly awful. Maybe I just got one bad batch of tapioca, but it was still just plain unacceptably bad.

So long story short - their food is just fine, but whatever you don't don't order a thai iced coffee with tapioca."}
{"text":"Sukhothai Bistro is without a doubt my favorite Thai food restaurant. This is the Thai food go-to place if you really desire original and delicious Thai food. Do not let the 2 negative comments out of 100 good comments mislead you. Just because they had a not so pleasant lunch experience at Sukhothai does not mean the food and service of the restaurant are bad. In fact, I completely disagree with their comments on the quality of food there. I am a Thai food enthusiast and I absolutely adore the delicacies that Sukhothai offers. I usually start with a nice icy-cold Thai Ice tea, because everybody love that. My favorite appetizer is Fresh Roll combined with house made peanut sauce. One bite of this goodness blew my mind away. Also, do not sleep on the green papaya salad. Then I usually order a curry dish and another noodle dish for my girlfriend. Let's face it. All of their curries are wonderful. They mix fresh cooked veggies and my choice of meat in the curry. And it comes with one of the best rice I have ever eaten in my life. Sometimes I order brown rice to substitute and it is great! I strongly recommend green, Panang, and yellow curries. My favorite noodle dish is Pad See Ew, but their Pad Thai is really popular as well. Again, you can choose any meat or vegetable or tofu to go with your noodles. They also offer house noodle soup and noodle delight with peanut sauce. It goes without saying that they are wonderful. If you are particular hungry the day you go, I suggest you to order mango tango curry or love salmon. They are chef special and they will make them perfectly for their customers. I have to mention their dessert options. I go for fried bananas and ice cream every time, because I love the combination. They also have the best sticky rice in town. I asked their chef about the sticky rice and found out that their sticky rice is home made and fresh everyday.

The people at Sukhothai are one of the nicest people I have ever seen. The owner, John, is a well known businessman in the neighborhood. He holds a high standard for everything of the restaurant. Their servers are very nice and tend to my every needs in terms of getting me drinks, checking up on my meal, and just generally chatting with me, especially the new waiter. I give them 10 out of 10 in customer service. 

Overall, Sukhothai Bistro really distinguishes itself as the best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. Words can not describe how good it is. I strongly recommend you to give it a try. It will be a dining experience of a lifetime and Thai food sensation."}
{"text":"This place used to have my favorite Thai food but I think the cook and the attitude has changed because it just doesn't taste the same.  I thought maybe they just weren't a lunch place when my order was off the first time. Unfortunately the last three times I've gone their has always been something wrong with my order and today having them bluntly not acknowledge my preferences was the last straw. They have officially lost my business."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was so horrifically slow that I had to actually leave the table, run across the street to Rite Aid, and buy some peanut butter crackers to eat at the table so I didn't pass out.  Their food is also needlessly spicy, even if you order it extremely mild.  I'm not talking curry dishes, I'm talking simple stir fry.  So, if you don't want a fire in your mouth, you have to stick to fried rice or bland noodle dishes. 

Thursday night at 8:30 with a half-full restaurant and it took about an hour from the time we walked in the door until our entrees arrived.  From our table we had a view of the kitchen where only one person was cooking, and at a snail's pace.  Clearly this cook has never worked in a restaurant before.  You can take your time slicing pretty pineapple garnishes and arranging spring rolls in martini glasses when you are at home, or when you are adequately staffed, but when you have tables of people waiting for food, you need to learn to step it up. 

The food was very good, but I think I will stick to Thai Cuisine."}
{"text":"Dishes are delicious and served like pieces of art! Worth the higher-than-average prices."}
{"text":"The food is good but what makes the five stars is the owner! Very friendly man who treats his customers well. Service is quick. If you wanted to modify something from the menu, there is also that option."}
{"text":"This has to be the best restaurant, Thai or other, that is in Squirrel Hill. The dishes all display their unique taste traits while coming together perfectly. I'm addicted to mango tango and the fresh rolls. They actually make the dish Thai spicy if you ask for it, not just American spicy.
What's wonderful about this place is that the it's not just about delicious food. The owner and staff are extraordinarily kind and go out of their way to make your dining experience enjoyable. 
Please eat here and don't miss out on an incredible meal with kind people."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff. I asked our server for a recommendation and she suggested the Mango Tango Curry which seems to be one of their more popular dishes. It was very good. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I just finished eating the blandest, most boring pad Thai I have ever had.  This dish consisted of noodles, a bland sauce, a smattering of peanuts, and some plain bean sprouts.  That's it. No spice or flavor whatsoever.  I realize now that this is partially my fault, as I did not read the inside of the menu, which said I had to request spice and flavor.  

The server didn't ask either though...and she had plenty of time to, since I was the only person there.  Well, almost the only person.  There was an employee or family member sleeping at a table in the corner.  I'm not sure if that counts or not.  The server was pleasant and all, but she clearly was in \"no one is here\" mode.  After bringing me my meal, she sat at the table with sleeping guy and played with her phone.  She didn't look up again until I was done with my meal and had an empty water glass.  

The other thing I noticed is that staff drank bottled water, rather than water from the pitchers they serve guests.  I was not offered anything other than water and drank the whole glass before I picked on that little tidbit.  Overall, I can't say anything about the experience would prompt me to return..."}
{"text":"This is a lovely Thai Bistro.  The food is good and everything is presented very beautifully.  Their dumplings are particularly delicious, with a delicate assortment of flavors that just melt on the tongue.  The service has always been attentive; I have never had problems with slow or inattentive service.  The only reason I don't eat here more often is that while the food is a bit more upscale than a lot of the nearby competition, and very well presented, it just doesn't make the increased price worth it for me most of the time."}
{"text":"Really great food! A little bit pricy, but definitely worth it! We ordered a cashew duck stir-fry and the roti scallop green curry. They were both delicious and we got good portions. Definitely the best Thai restaurant in squirrel hill!

The cook originally forgot the eggplant in the green curry but after telling the waitress, we got the eggplant quickly and the service was nice and polite!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Sq Hill. Better than Bangkok balcony and silk elephant. Lately my favorite is the mango curry but really everything I've had here has been delicious. I'd also recommend green curry (really any curry), pad Thai, and the fresh rolls. I do think they could improve the texture of the tofu, a little too soft for my taste, but overall the best Thai in the area."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my spicy basil lunch special here. Service was super friendly, and the soup and salad were brought out even before I ordered my meal. The salad had a tasty peanut sauce dressing, while the soup contained some congee but still packed some flavor. For the entree, I ordered mine \"Thai hot\" which would probably be around a 7 or 8 on the usual 1-10 scale, and it was pretty perfect for me. The dish was surprisingly large for a lunch, with lots of chicken pieces and fresh vegetables, as well as enough basil to round the whole thing out. I would definitely look forward to trying something else there again."}
{"text":"Sukhothai has turned out to become my favorite Thai restaurant in the Squirrel Hill neighbourghood. 

Frequently visited here with my colleagues at work, and we are always impressed with the taste and quality of the food. My favorite here are the drunken noodles, which I have never found to be better else where. The curries are great too. The lunch specials are always a steal, and always so good!

Overall this restaurant is a notch better than it's competitors in the area and I would go there whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"It is so difficult to find a good Thai restaurant. Most of them water down the flavor in the food to cater to the American palate; I despise when that happens. I LOVE the pungency present in Thai food. While this establishment has diluted the flavors I love, they have not diluted them so much that I do not enjoy them. Our usual dinner options:

Chicken Panang Curry (Thai Hot)
Beef Basil (Medium)

I love the flavors of both of these dishes. The crushed peanut and coconut milk flavors present in the panang curry are really good. Add in the earthiness of the chili and I am sating primal desires. Then the beef basil comes into play and I am taken to another realm. They use real Thai basil. I don't care for Italian basil; I just don't like the flavor. Thai basil, on the other hand, has this wonderful licorice flavor that melds so wonderfully with the beef in its brown sauce. 

I return routinely to quell my cravings."}
{"text":"Very good taste for food. Nice environment, good place for dating. Love here so much. Ordered yellow curry, one of the most dilicious Thai food for me."}
{"text":"I tried this for lunch. The prices were reasonable for the area. I got Thai fried rice with chicken. The spiciness was right on and it was tasty, BUT, the Thai fried rice I've had at other restaurants has had lots of great veggies in it and this was pretty much just rice, chicken, and onions. Pretty boring as a main dish. I'll try the other items since it was pretty good still, but I like food with a little more color and variety."}
{"text":"The head chef came out and talked with us about our meal / the area and what he could do to get the word out (maybe he was the owner too?) and it impressed me so much I had to add my review from urban spoon to yelp. 

Anyway the review: 

Amazing. Out of all the Thai places in pittsburgh, this place hits the spot. It has no MSG and you can tell all of it is fresh. The staff is so nice and willing to bend over backwards to accommodate you in every way possible. When I went there, I tried the drunken noodles and the spicy Thai rice (as those are the dishes I've had at most of the Thai places in pittsburgh) and both were streets ahead of my expectations. The deserts are fantastic and not what you would expect on a Thai menu (in the best way possible). In an area and city where Asian food dominates, this place is by far my favorite and I will be coming back week after week as long as they can keep up the quick, personal service and amazing food. 10/10"}
{"text":"Do not  get delivery! 2 hours, still waiting, less than a mile away, I've already called. They say it's on the way. I remember this happened last time too.  I'm done with them. 
Honestly the worst food I ever had. Pad Thai was dry & tasteless. The Panaang curry tasted like straight coconut milk that was broken down from improper heating. $35, and all the leftovers went straight in the trash"}
{"text":"Did you ever pass by a restaurant over and over, and every time you pass, you look in the window and say, \"I ve got to try this place\". Well, the time finally came for me with this place.  All I can say, what the heck took me so long!  
We started out with the YumTom Soup and the moment the bowl hit the table, I was engulfed with the smell of hot spices, lemon (Lemongrass) and I think thai basil?  The soup included, sliced chicken and mushrooms, but when it comes to soup, the broth is key, and this broth was absolutely amazing!  The entrees were the Mango Tango with Chicken and the Drunken Noodles with Tofu.  First, the Mango Tango had a broth (coconut and curry) with heat and flavour that blew my tastebuds away!  The Drunken Noodles were just as flavourful with just the right amount of heat.
Sukhothai is a must try thai place.  The owner/chef is VERY passionate about her food, cooking--she uses authentic and natural ingredients!"}
{"text":"I've only ever had takeout from this place, so I'm not sure about the in dining experience. 

Everytime I order for delivery the food is prompt, piping hot, and perfectly seasoned. I think the delivery minimum is steep, but given that most curry dishes are between $10-15 a piece you can easily get there. 

I've tried the mango curry, the Thai fried wings, Thai samosas, and Tom kha soup. All but the soup were delicious. The soup felt thrown together at the last minute for someone who doesn't know what soup is supposed to taste like. 

One con is that they serve their curry in containers that are prone to dripping all over the place. If they were in tall round cylindrical containers it would be world's better for a saucy dish than a wide rectangle."}
{"text":"Sukhothai is a new addition to Squirrel Hill. Being my first time here, I asked the waitress what dish she would recommend from the chef. Without pause she immediately suggested any of the curries. I settled on the Mango Tango Curry with chicken and shrimp with the highest Thai spice level (Thai Hot 3) and my friend ordered the Penang curry with chicken. Both meals were very flavoursome and, for once, the shrimp in my dish was cooked perfectly.

I love extremely spicy food so I was a little disappointed that \"Thai Hot 3\" was not hot enough for my preference. However, when I mentioned this to the waitress she immediately brought me over a set of 3 pots. Each contained a different chilli condiment. There was a samba oelek-type paste, ground chili powder and straight-up chopped green chilli, with the later being my favorite! This little set of pots completely redeemed my experience and I happily improved the spice level of my dish.

Although there are quite a few well-established Thai restaurants in Squirrel Hill, Sukhothai is a fresh addition worthily of a try. It definitely won me over with the genius chili pots. Also, special bonus points for our waitress who was exceptionally helpful!"}
{"text":"Very nice service and food! I got the rama curry which wasn't quite soup, but still very delicious! (a good amount too) their lunch specials can be less than $10 with pretty good food! Highly recommend!! :)"}
{"text":"I'm in love!  

We were looking for a close and quick dining option before heading to a movie at the Manor Theater when we spotted this venue with the word \"Bistro\" in it. It's a non-assuming façade and from across the street we didn't know what awaited us but thought it would be worth crossing the street to find out.

Oh my!  Are we glad we did!  It's a small quaint setting very tastefully decorated with white tablecloths and the décor is soothing.  The menu was excellent with the usual great Thai selections including fried rice and curry dishes.  I opted for the pineapple fried rice and my husband ordered a duck curry dish.  We shared the dishes and they were both scrumptious.  Prices were very fair, also.

John, the owner, came over and greeted us.  In fact, as we left, he ran out the door after us with our boxed leftovers we had mistakenly left on the table.  He seems to be a very proud owner, enthusiastic about this rather new establishment.  As well he should be.

I love walking into an establishment with no preconceived notion of what to expect and then being so pleasantly rewarded."}
{"text":"I have Thai food all over the city.  Needed a  to go lunch in between appointments and a coworker recommended.  I got the Green Curry Lunch Special.  Salad was OK, soup was bland.  Ordered it \"Thai hot\" (8-10 ).  It was maybe a 3. Four shrimp and only one piece of eggplant. Won't return as there are better options within 5 miles"}
{"text":"We've being here twice and really enjoyed the food. Their fried rice are awesome and see-yew is pretty good too. The service is a bit slow-but that does not irritate me that much. Last Saturday when we dined there we asked about if they offer any birthday special since it was my hubby's 30th birthday, and the owner and the chef are kind enough to customize a off-menu dessert for us! What a surprise! It is mango covered sticky rice roll with banana in the middle. Will come back in the future!"}
{"text":"The previous reviews made this restaurant sound like a slam dunk. My experience is that Sukhothai is good ideas gone bad. The restaurant has a very attractive dining room. We started off with vegetable tempura. The batter was too thick and chewy. The sweety and spicy dipping sauce was more sweet and salty. Next we had the wings. They were the smallest wings I was ever served and were mostly skin and bones. The little meat that was available was dry and the sauce was spicy but tasteless.

Our entrees included ginger beef and the duck salad. The beef was pretty good but nothing special. The duck salad had a really good dressing but the rest of the salad fell flat. The duck lacked flavor and there was too much fatty skin on it. There were numerous large pieces pieces of raw onion in the salad...way too much.

I was really looking forward to eating at Sukhothai given the previous reviews. The execution was so poor on the few dishes that we ordered that I can't imagine anything else on the menu could be that special. I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and was impressed both times. It's clearly the best Thai food in Squirrel Hill and definitely the best that I've tried in Pittsburgh.

The both times I went, I had \"drunken noodles\" / pad kee mao with \"American spicy\" level. The presentation was great, the food looked wonderful and was really delicious. I liked that the veggies were cooked just enough but still a bit crisp and the chicken was flavorful.

My girlfriend had pad thai one time and \"House Noodle Soup\" the other. Both were delicious. The soup was well seasoned with some subtle flavors mixing in. (I mention this because of the other reviews saying everything is spicy here, which is clearly not true.)

We haven't had the curry but will try that next time."}
{"text":"*****The wife/owner just called me - got my
Number from the eat24 order-- because of my review below- she was telling me I'm a liar- that I was wrong and started calling me a b**** for the review that I wrote. Sorry we were honest in our experience and how dare you find my number online and call me to yell and scream. THEN she continued to texted me with harassment! Do not support this family's Restaraunt. Very unprofessional...and... Crazy behavior from the owners there's way better places to spend your Money ********


Horrible customer service. Bland, boring and poor quality food- we ordered pick up- they didn't have our order... So we waited another 20 mins on top of the 30 already- we ordered the eggplant special... They gave us a completely different dish- we called back and the woman told us we were Wrong... Never apologies...And Didn't even offer to re make it... We didn't eat it- we gave it to the dog - it was THAT bad. The soup- had pieces of hard grass like veggies... That I actually choked on and it was cold.... Over all so disappointed and we were sooooooooo hungry- will never dine there again. If the owners had been professional and tries to fix
The mistake... I'd be willing to MAYBE give it another try...Waste of money and waste of energy trying to be compensated to correct their mistake. If I could give it a 0 rating I would."}
{"text":"Sukhothai is one of many Thai restaurants in Squirrel Hill. It's consistently a good option as a student because they offer delivery. 

The food is good, always delivered hot and they are true to their spice scale. A favorite is the Pad See Ew noodles w/ chicken, I do think that Noodlehead in Shadyside/East Liberty has a better version of this dish, but they don't deliver. I also have tried the Tom Kha soup, the Pad Thai, and Penang Curry. All of these are typical Thai dishes and Sukhothai does a good job of being a typical Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"We've never eaten in the restaurant; we always order it as take-out or delivery. The atmosphere is cute although a bit cramped. The dining room is somewhat small.

The food is good. I'd like to give it a 3.5 because it's just not a 4. It's not my favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh, but it is consistent acceptable. They are able to make things gluten-free, which as you know, is a requirement for me!

Beware: they are not kidding on the spices. For Thai restaurants, I usually order about halfway up the scale. However, I once ordered a \"2\", and it painful.

We like pad thai, the curries, the fried tofu, and the beef salad. We pass on the pad see ewe although pad see ewe is often meh when made gluten-free.

The prices are very reasonable.

TL; TD: Give Sukhothai a try for solid food, but don't expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"I'm actually very disappointed to have to leave a negative review. I ordered takeout consisting of steamed dumplings and pineapple fried rice. The dumplings were not the traditional ones, but were actually shu mai. This is not a big deal because I like both, but there were only four in the order (for $6) and the sauce was not good. I couldn't quite put my finger on it so I had my husband taste it and he agreed that something wasn't right. Although the pineapple fried rice portion was generous (as it should be for the higher prices compared to other local Thai restaurants), it basically just seemed like the standard ingredients doused in soy sauce. Again, no great flavor and even something that just tasted a little off. I was also a bit put off by being charged a good bit more than the prices listed on an online menu that I had checked beforehand. I didn't make a stink about it and was hopeful that the food would be worth the extra money, but it wasn't. Lastly, when I went to pick up my order I was immediately smacked in the face by the odor of raw fish when opening the door and waiting for the hostess. There were about 4 people dining inside and I can't imagine how this did not ruin their experience. There are so many other great Thai restaurants in the area and even right up/down the street in Squirrel Hill that there's no need to waste your time on this one."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with two others for a late dinner. 

What we sampled: 
Fresh Rolls (very good)
Fried Tofu (even better, delicious)
Tom Kha Shrimp (good, not great) 
Pad Thai Chicken (very good)
Red Curry Chicken (not good at all. the consistency was all wrong).


Overall the appetizers out-shined the main courses and I was particularly disappointed by the granular texture of the red curry.  This is my litmus test for all Thai restaurants and this did not measure up. 

In a neighborhood with great Thai Sukhothai needs to step it up."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch specials from here directly from their website. Note that when you order online, it says they'll notify you when your order is processing but they actually don't. Expect it to be done in 20min or give them a call instead. 

I really appreciate when restaurants do not put MSG in their food and Sukhothai advertised that they don't. I also like that for takeout, they insulate the food with aluminum foil and this prevents the sauce from spilling over to the rice. With the lunch specials, you can choose rice, soup or salad. I got the spicy basil duck with rice and the beef pad see ew with soup. I liked the generous amount of veggies in the spicy basil duck. The soup that comes with their lunch special actually has a lot of rice in the inside (about half rice, half soup). The spicy basil duck came with two scoops of white rice. So I ended up having rice, rice... and rice!"}
{"text":"The food here is closer to 4 stars; I've eaten there twice and the first was a little more impressive than the second, though that's likely partially due to dish choice (the second dish was a red curry, which tasted good but unremarkable). The reason I m docking them a star is that the service, while friendly, was excessively slow on the second visit--it took me 10 minutes of being very obviously finished and ready for the check to get the check."}
{"text":"Great food and extremely friendly service in a small, cozy setting conveniently located near the Murray bus stop. The setting is humble and intimate compared to nearby Thai restaurants like Bangkok Balcony and Silk Elephant. The selection of food is also diverse but not overwhelming, having all of your classic Thai favorites as well as a selection of entrees unique to the talents of their chefs. Definitely looking forward to coming back here"}
{"text":"FOOD:
We started with the dumplings as appetizers, and they were very flavorful. We continued onto sharing a small bowl of Tom Yum - we asked for Thai spicy, and the kitchen didn't disappoint.

I had the Panang Curry, which was excellent and a pretty big portion for the price. My better half had the Eggplant dish, which he gave two big thumbs up.

Only downside: they serve tap water, which in Pittsburgh tastes like your local swimming pool.

SERVICE
Service was great. Server was pleasant and quick. No complaints. 

VERDICT
Bill came to 37 for two meat entrees, one app and one soup. Would definitely come back - great taste and value."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was dry, salty, and otherwise flavorless, and the eggplant tofu was super salty and poorly cooked.  Not recommended."}
