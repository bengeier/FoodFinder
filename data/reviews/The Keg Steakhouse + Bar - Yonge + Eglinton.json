{"text":"Had dinner at this Keg last Saturday night. The steak (rib steak) that I ordered was likely the best I have ever had. The service was great, sat at the bar and was well taken care of by Chris. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Food and service are good but they never get my medium-rare steak right. My steaks always come out over cooked. I will be ordering rare from now on to get it cooked medium rare."}
{"text":"I frequent this location often and I have to say, the staff and managers do a great job. The hostesses sometimes are oblivious when you walk in, but service staff give their all. My fiance ordered a steak once, and it came out a bit too rare. Our waitress took it back and the manager brought out another one. Again, it was not cooked properly and (although my fiance eventually just ate it), the manager came back and offered to re-cook it and ended up taking his whole meal off of our bill. Not necessary but totally appreciated. I love the decor/atmosphere - very romantic and overall a nice environment to eat dinner in. I think it is a couple of notches above the standard cookie-cutter keg restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday. We both ordered the top sirloin medium rare and it was brought out rare, maybe less. I understand how steaks work, and I usually never have an issue with The Keg as far as anything being under or over cooked but by the time I was finished eating it looked like my dish had turned into a plate of beet soup. If I wasn't paying with gift cards I would've sent it back. Definitely won't be returning to this location. Food and atmosphere is better in the esplanade or mansion on king."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to for milestone dinners. This past Saturday we were there for a birthday and the experience was fabulous, as always. Everyone was happy with their meals. I had the pistachio-crusted salmon with bacon brussels sprouts and garlic mashed potatoes. The server said the chef recommends \"medium\" which I went with. It was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"if your taste runs to a cavernous dark place, then this is the one for you. The darkness does not help with hearing your companions. On my latest visit, I gave another go to their burger. Recent change means that the burger is made with a combination of fresh meat. I preferred the old one made from a single cut of frozen meat. I feel guilty not being able to appreciate the \"new and improved burger\". I am afraid the meat is just too meaty for me. The burger comes with a thick generous slice of un-crispy applewood bacon, therefore increasing my anxiety about the healthiness of this meal. I stressed to the helpful staff, that I like fresh fries and they did deliver. When fresh, the fries bear a strong resemblance to what fries should be like. I was impressed on seeing a staffer, with a fully grown 'movember', checking all the glasses in his section for spots. My bottled beer came in cold; I made sure to ask the staff. No problem, their fridge is large."}
{"text":"It is hard to beat the Keg when it comes to a casual and impromptu steak dinner. The steaks are great value and it has a reasonable corkage fee for your favourite grape juice to bring along."}
{"text":"If you've been to one Keg, you've been to them all; the food is the same. This particular one, however, is set in a posh and impressive atmosphere.  I recommend their escargot."}
{"text":"This Keg location is baffling. Since I work minutes away from the restaurant, I've been to this Keg numerous times for work lunches and more often than not, something goes wrong. Their mistakes aren't that terrible, but it's the simple things that they have trouble with.  If you have instructions about your order, like putting the dressing on the side of your salad, it will most likely be ignored. They'll acknowledge it when you say it, but that's really just for posterity. When you come in the restaurant, there may or may not be a hostess there. If you have a jacket, they will sometimes ask if you want to check it, but other times they won't.   In my last visit, it took them almost an hour to serve our entrees. They consisted of three salads and a hot dog. On top of that, the waiter hadn't come by our table in 40 minutes after serving appetizers. No water refills, no update on the entrees. When we finally confronted him about it, he immediately said the manager would be over to talk to us.   The manager seems like a friendly person, but she doesn't exactly seem like a professional. Instead of being apologetic, she seemed more intent on placating us with humour. She was kind enough to give us our entire meal for free, so I shouldn't complain too much.   The Keg Dog was outstanding and the only real highlight of the meal. If you haven't tried it yet, you should. A hot dog with bacon jam is a match made in meat heaven.  Overall, the service here is inconsistent but the food is what you would expect from a Keg. It is definitely not my first choice in the area."}
{"text":"How hard is it for a steakhouse to cook the stake right?!?!  Apparently, it is very hard if it is the Keg.  I ordered my stake medium rare, it came overcooked.  The server had an attitude and called the manager.  The manager agreed it was not cooked right, had to send it back and we had to wait for another one which arrived too rare.  Had to send it back again.  After that the server just disappeared on us and we were served by the manager.  We thought the server got fired or something, until in the end she showed up with the bill.   We spent the whole night dealing with the server's attitude, waiting for the food to be made right and feeling like we were asking for too much.  Our special event dinner was completely ruined and still cost over $100 for two.    The Caesar salad was terrible. Service sucked.   Never again I am going to this pathetic place with this terrible food and service."}
{"text":"What a disaster yesterday. My Son and I went for lunch and this is how it went. I ordered a cranberry soda and the lime was dry and the soda was flat. The server was confused when I asked her to combine pineapple and cranberry for my Son's drink. I ordered the 10oz Prime Rib and the mashed potatoes were cold. The server was was no where in sight (no table check back to ensure quality) so I physically had to find her. Couldn't find her on the floor anywhere so I went to the hostess stand to direct the server to my table. There were 2 other tables in my area for lunch it wasn't busy at all. She finally came and returned my mashed piping hot, so hot in fact that that if I didn't wait a bit I would've burned my mouth. I wasn't finished my meal and the server didn't even ask before taking my plate. It was so awkward I just let her. She asked if I wanted desert and I said I'd like to look and it was a possibility. She came back and asked if I wanted a desert and I was undecided between the Billy Miner or cheesecake and was considering a coffee. Nope..wasn't having anything as she clearly wanted me gone as she dropped off the bill with a couple of mints. She seemed frantic running around trying to understand why she was having issues with the Gift Card machine (or debit/credit card machine). I couldn't understand why she seemed so busy or 'lost' when I only saw 2 other tables. She seemed like she was not trained properly or hated her job, maybe both. What a shit show."}
{"text":"Always a go-to place for a nice & quiet dining experience.  We usually go for a birthday/anniversary and they always provide a free desert. The food is not the best of the best, but you know what you're getting and it's good. Their Caesars are super spicy and definitely worth ordering.  The price has crept up over the years ... esp. the prime rib."}
{"text":"I go to The Keg on a regular basis, 2-3 times a month from the Ajax location to other Toronto downtown locations. It was my first time visiting this location this week on April 8th where I had a below par experience.   Let's begin with the service: The hostess was very grumpy, not friendly at all and did not make me feel welcomed at all. Was actually thinking of just walking out right then and there due to her negative vibe. Maybe she was having a bad day which we all do, but at the end of the day the hostess should be friendly and welcoming that's all I expect and ask for. I had also dropped off a cake with the hostess.  We were sat down within 10 minutes at 7:30pm at a booth which was nice. The server greeted us right away and was very kind and knowledgable. My boyfriend and I started with the Cesar salad, also bought a bottle of red wine. The salads came out within 15 minutes along with the bread, although that was supposed to come prior to the appetizers. The Caesar salad here is probably the worst I've had in a long while, I am a lover of a good Cesar salad, guess The Keg doesn't make it to my liking which is not a problem just won't order it again. We did ask for some extra butter but that wasn't brought to us at all, not that it was a big deal. The server always kept our wine glasses filled but was lacking on filling up our waters. Then we ordered the peppercorn New York strip steak with twice baked potato which was to die for!   After the plates were taken away the cake came out, which wasn't supposed to just yet since we were stuffed. Usually I go tell the server or hostess to bring out the cake when I want it to come out but this time he brought it right away, luckily I was sitting in a spot where my guest didn't see it while I yelled \"no, not yet!\". The surprise cake now turned into a disaster since I did spend a lot of money on the custom cake I was disappointed it came out and ruined the surprise. Plus I didn't put candles in the box or bag I handed to the hostess and he decided to jam in the candles in the chocolate fondant cake that I know have 5 holes in that ruins the look of the cake.   After half an hour of chatting and having our wine my boyfriend wanted the Billy Myer cake since he's been having it since he was young. We ordered that and it looked great, tasted yummy just until I found one long, thin piece of plastic then another hard piece of plastic! I spat the pieces out and put them on the napkin so our server could see what was in that cake. He started to tell us that he guesses some plastic got in the cake from the plastic box each piece of cake comes in.   All in all I had a terrible experience at this location. From the hostess to the cake coming out 2 mins after our dinners were finished to the PLASTIC in the cake. Oh and not to mention the huge cake being ruined with holes on the top of it which he stick candles in which I didn't bring for a reason and never insisted them on putting them in."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this Keg recently and we were thoroughly impressed.  The salads were excellent and the steaks were perfectly cooked as usual at any Keg.  Our waiter was excellent, even making a suggestion regarding coffee.  The ambiance was so relaxing, we both hated to leave."}
{"text":"The food was good. The steak was absolutely nicely cooked, juicy and highly recommended.   However, the atmosphere was more like when groups hang out. The waitress set us to a seat surrounded by large of groups...very noisy the whole meal. A little bit disappointed.   Will go again!"}
{"text":"Who'da thunk?  The Keg at Yonge and Eglinton is open for lunch, and as it's Decemburger I decided it's finally time to try the standard sirloin's ground-up kid brother, the Keg Burger.  This beefy bad boy comes topped with cheese, mushrooms and your choice of \"smoked applewood or peameal bacon.\" * Our server forgot to ask which bacon I wanted, and in the excitement of catching up with some friends (Tara J., Carolyn W. and Sonya F.), I forgot to specify. I somehow ended up with the applewood as a result, though the peameal was what I really wanted. **,***  The burger itself was tasty, but in a nondescript sort of way. I demolished every last bit of it before moving on to my garlic mashed potatoes. The great thing about the Keg is that besides getting a really nice piece of meat most of the time, you also get awesome sides and accompaniments. The Keg bread, a standard at dinner, was a hit at the lunch table too. My aforementioned garlic mash was heavenly comfort food on a cold winter's day, and my Caesar was perfect, served in a tall glass (on request) with a celery stalk and a pickled string bean. Service, despite the bacon incident, was top-notch (and usually is at the Keg, in my experience).  * Who wants applewood on their burger, even if it's smoked? ** If you forget to ask how I want something (and I forget to tell you), please just come back and clarify. One trip wouldn't have killed anyone. *** Joe \"Backseat Yelper\" B. will no doubt object to **, as he's worked in the business and thinks I don't appreciate the fact that serving is a hard job."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a beautiful steak dinner. The appetizer we loved baked goat cheese with perfectly toasted bread. Out Entree's we both ordered the Sirloins with the almond crust and goat cheese, they were both cooked to our taste perfectly. For our side we both enjoyed the twice baked potato which was hot and incredibly savory. We accompanied out meal with a glass of Baco Noir , a perfect companion. Out desert was an insanely great mocha ice cream desert on a chocolate crust with caramel and chocolate drizzle. It was called Miner something, please forgive me I don't recall exactly what it was called, but I'll never forget how much I enjoyed. Our server Mark was the golden touch to our meal. His professionalism, friendliness,and timing was impeccable . Well done Keg! We are so happy and impressed with your overall experience. Our date night was a Complete success!"}
{"text":"We we were told we could sit anywhere so we sat in the lounge ready for drinks and a full dinner. Our server passed by us three times and didn't even say hello. I've worked in service and even if it wasn't my table to serve, I would always make sure guests were acknowledged so that they knew we weren't ignoring them and wouldn't leave.   We felt ignored so we decided to leave.   Will it kill you to just say, \"Hello. Someone will be right with you\" ???   What a disappointment. We were looking forward to splurging tonight.   We ended up going to Fin Izakaya where they KNOW customer service is key. Had a great meal and time there."}
{"text":"This particular location is much better than others.  Steak was cooked well and the accompanying vegetables were plentiful and delicious!  Service & ambiance were also great! Will return!"}
{"text":"Out of all the location choices, the Yonge/Eglinton location is just A-OK.   I always order the prime rib at The Keg, and the cut at this location was a little bit dry and way too fatty for my preference. Since it was the boss' treat for my birthday, I have no complaints. The service was really good - our waiter was very friendly and personable. He didn't even check my ID to see if it's actually my birthday, and brought out free dessert of my choice after our meal. He also gave my friend a bowl of boccacini when she asked for more for her salad.   Though I liked our server, the food was very average. David Duncan charges around the same price for their Prime Rib, and it's much much more tender."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood to spend some money on good food and service. This is the place!  Fresh ingredients, steaks cooked to your liking and perfection, friendly service all combined with a contemporary soothing decor."}
{"text":"Consistently good, as the Keg tends to be.  Highlights: great lunchtime filet and side vegetables; great service that checked in with just the right frequency; bowls and bowls of those great chocolate mints scattered throughout the restaurant so that you can pocket a few extra ;) directly across from the south entrance/exit of the Eglinton TTC stop.  Medium: parking available underground, but it was a bit expensive; side caesar wasn't served a lemon wedge.  Low: opens exactly at 11:30 am, or shortly after, so if you arrive a bit early be prepared to wait outside and not in the lounge."}
{"text":"Steak Dinner  Ambience: 4/5 fine for a business mtg, date etc. But nothing unique. Food:4/5 Service:2/5 friendly but slooooow Value: 4/5 Repeat: not sure"}
{"text":"My new favourite steakhouse. They really serve good food here- love their bread! We had a second round for it while waiting. Staff were nice and friendly. The place was nice and clean. Although your order will take some time but it was all worth it. I see people don't mind waiting so I guess this restaurant is a place to go."}
{"text":"It's a Keg!  A big fancy one, too!  I loved our booth for two.  Service was really friendly...my favourite part was when our pale, red-headed waitress said, \"If you need anything, my name is Coco,\" and then there was a pregnant pause because I'm *sure* this is always followed by some sort of comment at the table.  But my dining companion and I kept our mouthes shut....until she left, that is.  (She was a great waitress though! Two thumbs up)  He got the prime rib dinner which comes with horseradish, and he just asked for more horseradish...not a problem, so I got to use it with my bone-in rib steak.  They also offered us steak sauce and dijon mustard, something I've never been offered before at a Keg, and it was also delicious! (the dijon, that is)     Only strange hiccup was he asked for a manly drink of some sort on the rocks (can't remember what...) and it came in a martini glass w a cherry and it really threw him off."}
{"text":"Keg food is well... Keg food. its the same across the whole chain and varies very rarely... but the service in this location is just plain awful. whether you get there with couple  of friends for drinks, have a client lunch  or plan a corporate xmas dinner ( never again), they will find several creative ways to mess it up.  my latest experience with them has been absolutely dreadful: our company booked a dinner for 20 people 2 months in advance. on a Wednesday night - not that busy for Keg. we have checked out the area where we would sit, confirmed the menu, drinks, appetizers. since they messed up a previous client party for us(that's another long story), i made sure to follow up with them few weeks ahead...and two days before the event. and the day of the event. each time the management was struggling to remember our party specifics, which was making us really nervous. anyhow, i was assured that everything is A-ok!  on the day of the party, when we walked in, they had no idea who we were.  it was a complete disaster. it took them about an hour to dig up our order, we got tons of attitude from the wait staff and the hostesses, and the since they (obviously) gave away our sitting area to another party,  we were seated at a very awkward long table. waited for our food and drinks forever. DISASTER! no apologies from the management just demonstrative  'take it or leave it\" attitude. regular dinners / lunches are pretty bed as well. staff completely overlooks you, constantly socializes with each other instead of taking orders. huge difference in service between other Keg locations. save yourself some dignity and have your meal in a place that actually wants your business"}
{"text":"The line up was okay at this keg, but was pretty average for a steakhouse. I was expecting a lot more considering its price range and its multiple locations across Toronto. I went there for my birthday, but they didn't do anything special for me... T.T but its fine, I don't hold a grudge for that.  But back to steak. I ordered a New York Strip and it was pretty bland and it didn't come with any sauce to boot. They had steak sauce A1 but I was expecting sauce to come with it with that level of blandness. The food was okay, but for what I was paying it could have been a bit more well seasoned. Dunno if I would go again, but I would definitely not go back for the steak."}
{"text":"Even though it's a chain, one thing you can appreciate is that the quality of the food always remains at a standard and you know what to expect ! Consistency is always something we look for at repeat places to eat and that is what The keg is good for !   Keg is still the best moderate priced steak house, if you don't wish to spend over 120$ usually with this amount you'd get a good steak for two and an appetizer.   Usually I order calamari, scallops wrapped with bacon, New York strip and the Prime rib roast !   The service is friendly, fast and attentive. If there is any issues like one time they ran out of specific cut of meat, the management goes above and beyond to still make your experience the best !   Make sure to reserve for the evenings or if you live close by, I suggest the take out isn't too bad either !"}
{"text":"Throughly disappointed. This was the second time in about 4 months. Similar to out previous visit, our prime rib was as tough as leather. The vegetables were undercooked, to the extent that they were still raw.   Fortunately, the prime rib entrée was replaced with a better slab, but unlike the original order of medium rare, it came medium well. The veggies remained rare, but our replacement was missing the mushrooms. We could have complained yet again, but it would have been futile.   Going forward, we shall not return to this location. I have given this locate a well deserved one-star and will visit others which I have had better luck."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner in a large group. The service and atmosphere were great. I had the filet mignon with fries, which was delicious! The steak was tender, and the cheese on top matched it well."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times. I keep going back because the food and service are impeccable. Jordan is a server there, who always picks the perfect wine pairings for me. I always leave smiling...and stuffed. Haha!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner on a Friday night with four other people.  We had a reservation for 7 o'clock and we were about 10 minutes late - our table was given to someone else. A little weird, but it didn't put a damper to the night. About 2 minutes later, my pager started buzzing and we were seated at another table.  The menu/cuisine is your typical Keg stuff. I'm boring when it comes to The Keg and I always order the grilled chicken. You'd have to be intoxicated to mess this one up.  My last meal on Earth won't be from The Keg, but nothing will stop me from going back. It's a-ok."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years. Was last here this New Years Eve. We were given a buzzer and told there was a wait for a table. Found a table in the bar area and didn't even notice the time go by. We had cocktails and ordered appetizers while we waited. By the time the table was ready the appetizers were not so they brought it to our table. Food was as expected for the keg. I have noticed that the entrees are quite salty. We ordered prime rib dinner and steak and lobster. It was a twin lobster tail. One was great but the other all mushy and deteriorated. Could've been better. Prime rib dinner was expected but the onion strings  were very salty. They have a kids menu but portions very small and for pricI think you're better off ordering off the main menu. Service was great but server was missing for long periods of time. Overall typical keg experience."}
{"text":"The service was good, they were attentive. I went with work for our Christmas dinner, without a reservation it would be a 1.5 wait but luckly they had space in the lounge area. Had the baked brie and tuna tartare for starters and Filet Mignon as my main. The brie was good-can't really mess up baked brie and the tuna tartare was fresh and enjoyable. The steak however, was ok. I order medium-rare doneness and always emphasize that I like to see pink and blood.  Had a previous amazing experience elsewhere and not sure if this raised my expectation but it was a lack-luster one here. The meat was tough for my likeness and had no desire to finish. My side (the twice baked potato) was also just alright. If I do go again(which probably won't be by my choice or at the same location) I will try something else and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Worst location ever.  Every time i come (every 3 minths or so), more than one hour wait for food.  We went as soon as restaurant opened on a friday and still waited 10 min for our table of 8.  With a reservation.  Took another 10 min for drink orders and another one hour for food.  Lobster taco was good but pricey.  Sirloin steak was over salty.  Only reason i come is everyone else keeps picking this place.  Don't ever want to come back again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this restaurant could have only 3.5 stars. We went early for dinner tonight and they were not yet too busy. The reception was friendly, efficient and we were seated in a pleasant booth immediately. Our waiter appeared shortly after and took drink orders. Drinks arrived and we were ready to order. The food came quickly on super hot plates and was cooked perfectly to order. The bone-in rib steak was tender and well seasoned. The waiter checked on us a couple of times. We didn't have time to stay for dessert and coffee as the Leaf game had already started. All in all an excellent experience at a medium priced steak house."}
{"text":"Well, it's the keg, don't expect something extraordinary but do expect something good.  It's a steakhouse chain, so it's on the expensive side, however not as expensive as the good steak house restaurants but I like it, it's convenient, the service can be pretty good or average it really depends who is serving you.  The deco is nice, modern and fancy (not too fancy) you can go very casual, here you will find all types of costumers the snob and the ones wearing blue jays hats, so feel free to dress as you feel like, no one will judge.  Alsooooo Free dessert on bdays :)"}
{"text":"Second visit to The Keg Steakhouse Yonge/Eglinton after being unimpressed last time. This time - it's just slightly better. At least the steak was cooked right.  I can't pin it as to why but even a good juicy piece such as the New York cut could turn out dry and somewhat bland while served lukewarm. The cook was about right which is medium rare with some redness inside. Still though - again, ingredient / seasoning of the steak was just off the mark. Definitely couldn't justify the price.  On the upside - the place has great ambiance (perfect for event, etc) and service is also terrific. Unfortunately the food did not deliver."}
{"text":"This place is better than some of the reviews say.  Location wise, I think it's great. Yonge and Eglinton has people with money and people want to eat steak. It's right on the subway line, just a bit of a tip, exit the subway at the South end of the platform, it'll take you out onto the street at the furthest south point across from the Minto building which is where The Keg is.  Right when you walk in, you are greeted by some very nice ladies. There is a comfortable seating area right there in case you have to wait for your table. The bar looks very big, I'm sure it's a good place to have a drink.  Once we sat, I ordered the Prime rib, roasting for the full at the perfect medium rare. And it was awesome. Paired with a nice wine, I think I just chose a safe glass from Mondavi and it was the perfect dinner.  The only thing holding this back, is it feels a bit empty. It's probably the day of the week (Wed), but still. I think the layout makes it feel as if it's empty. I'm not a fan of eating in empty restaurants, says too much.  The server, he was awesome. Gave explanation to any question we had, courteous, came back when we needed him and not too often.  I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"Let's face it, The Keg is like the Swiss Chalet of steakhouses. You get mediocre steak covered in tonnes of Montreal Steak Spice at jacked up prices.   Had the New York strip and it was overcooked and tasteless, except for the steak spice which it was COVERED with. The sides were good and the appetizers were so so. But the service and desserts were excellent.  But for these prices, why eat at a mediocre chain when there are so many better restaurants in Toronto?"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  I must say that the Keg is not my favourite restaurant.  But I have never been to this location.  I must say ambiance wise I was pretty impressed.  It looks really nice and not chain like inside.  A place where you wouldn't be embarrassed to take a date.   In fact we saw a lot of early daters in this place.    Pretty big with a nice lounge/bar area, this place can accommodate a large group quite easily.  The service we had was great.  We decided to have a few starters and some drinks.  We had the sliders (not bad); calamari - pretty decent; and the baked garlic shrimp - pretty yummy...but what happened to the rest of the shrimp??  For the price you pay I would have thought I would have gotten twice as many, but there were only 5 shrimp.  Yup you read right 5.  Five.  Cinq.  5.  Overall the food is overpriced which is why I'm giving it 3.5 Stars.    I was also impressed with their drinks selection!  This would be a great place to grab drinks and chill after work.  Skip the overpriced food, feel lush in here with a dirty martini and bitch about the boss.  Ahhh..what could be better?"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Keg in Tdot. Great midtown location and easy underground parking. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is very chill. Only comment is that some steaks come over-salted for me at least, so make sure to tell your server to go easy on the salt."}
{"text":"I came back here a few days ago   Let's just say, you come to a steak place for steak (which they do well), not for chicken. Anyways, the grilled chicken breast came extremely overcooked and tough and dry. As a Canadian, I was loathe to complain, but seriously, I should have."}
{"text":"I don't get out into the burbs too often, but a client suggested lunch here.   The obvious thoughts ran through my head with such a remote branch of this familiar steak chain.  Would it be like McDonalds, where there's McLobster in the east, McRice in Manila, and the Royale in France?    Well, don't worry, it's just the same as more urban locations like York, Church, or Jarvis.    That's to say, mediocre.   I had a burger that was overcooked and a little bland.     The high point was that service was very efficient.  I had my soft drink refilled three times.  It was only through careful timing that I avoided an accident on the subway ride back to Toronto."}
{"text":"I think I'm the only person who has never been to The Keg before (I've never been a big steak eater)...but I thought it was due time, so we went to The Keg - Yonge & Eglinton to celebrate my partner's birthday yesterday. I am usually really picky when celebrating special occasions and I have to say that this place exceeded all of my expectations.  Reservation: No resos on weekends from 6-9ish, but that's okay because we wanted a late dinner anyway. We showed up at 9:15, and only had to wait a couple of minutes. Got a nice and spacious table.  Food: So delicious that I only remembered to photograph our calamari appetizer. Woops. We ordered some sparkling water, wine, calamari, New York Striploin Keg Classic (x2) which came with salads, veggies (usually mushrooms but I hate mushrooms so they subbed it out for delicious asparagus and peppers), a side (I got the twice baked potato...it's MARVELLOUS! The star of the meal - get it!!! My partner got French fries and they were tasty too) and I added on lobster tails with butter for dipping. We finished with two cakes, cheesecake and the signature coffee ice cream cake. 50000 calories later and I was left smiling and satisfied.   Service: A+ all around. From the hostesses, to the food runners and our server himself - everyone was kind and making jokes, happy to suggest items and eager to help make my partner's birthday very special. Perfect attentive service, in my opinion.   Atmosphere: it's dark and spacious, romantic and classy - nothing to write home about, but it's great for dates, birthdays, whatever!   Cost: the bill for two *including* tip was about $200ish. Considering we got fancy $6.50 water (lol), wine, appetizers, salad, steak, lobster, sides, etc. and all of it was simply delicious...I'd say that is a very reasonable price for a special occasion!   Overall, I would definitely go back to this location and would be happy to suggest it to anyone going on a very nice date or celebrating a special moment."}
{"text":"Went here a few months back with my girlfriend for dinner. The Atmosphere was very nice and calming even. Couldn't complain about the food either, it was good. The wait staff were kind and courteous and quick, no complaints there either. Reason this place is getting a bad rating ffom me is because it was really quite dirty. We were in a booth near the back, and my god there was so much crud and debris under our table we kept hitting and knocking with our feet. Seems like the cleaner missed a spot...Anyways it was gross, crumbs upon crumbs, and a dirty crusty straw. Hopefully they change cleaners or something, because I won't be going back until I hear that has been addressed. Still a nice place overall...Maybe just don't sit in the back area, seemed the most unkept. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Always a favourite and always a guaranteed win coming to The Keg. It was pretty busy when we went recently but the staff were very accommodating and kept us up to date on how things were moving along. They sat us at the bar while we waited for our table and we got some nice wine ...this lasted 10 minutes and hey! our table was ready...hardly a long wait at all.   This time round I had the lobster bisque and an appetizer of scallops and bacon (I always order this and its amazing!!) the lobster bisque was on a special menu just for the night so I quickly ordered that one and glad  I did as it was fantastic!   Amazing atmosphere, amazing food, amazing staff. You could say I think this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"An update... I promptly emailed The Keg (as advised in their response here) and I also sent a copy to the email listed on their corporate website and have NOT received a response."}
{"text":"The Keg so far has always meets or surpasses my expectations. Their services from west coast to east side of Canada are always excellent. Love the steak in particular and love the passionate staff!  Also, this location has lots of romantic, spacious and private spots for lovers and families!"}
{"text":"Decent meal at the Keg last night as a group of six. Meal started with warm bread and butter which was delicious. Server was very welcoming and quick to take drink orders. Overall, service was friendly and server did a good job of taking care of our group's requests. I had the sirloin steak off the classic menu, with a side of green salad and the twice baked potato. Meal was okay, salad was very average, steak was okay, but I just don't find the meals worth the price (around $35). If I'm back here again I may try a burger or something else other than a steak."}
{"text":"I've been to the Keg before and always had a nice experience. Especially after I found what I believe is the best steak I've ever had. They had this blackened herb crusted steak which I tried once and after that i was hooked. Every time i went to the Keg I ordered this herb crusted steak. The plan was the same this time until I looked through their menu and  realised it was not on it anymore. I asked our server about it and I'm not sure he knew what I was talking about since he started recommending the blue cheese steak instead, which let's face it is not in any way near to what I was asking for. Disappointed I settled for half a rack of bbq ribs while my company ordered the Keg burger. The ribs were ok but since I really had my heart set on the herb crusted steak I was kind of disappointed with the dish. Sure it was tender and the meat fell of the bones but it did not provide that fresh herby flavour I was looking forward to. It was too sweet. In fact I would even say that the burger was better than the ribs. Service was nice and there's absolutely nothing bad to say about it.  Needless to say, despite the nice service, I don't think I will return to the Keg any time soon. At least not until they reintroduce the blackened herb crusted steak. Please bring it back!!! Until then you get 3 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"We go about three times a year. Consistent solid stakes and service. Loved my dirty martini to start. Garlic shrimp too small but tasty. Fillet minion delicious. Not enough veggies. Staff excellent. Happy nite."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Keg so it was the first choice in the area for a late lunch/early dinner. Between the hours of 3-5, their bar/lounge is open and we can still order from the regular menu. It was great because they have some happy hour specials on drinks and apps. Thursday was Keg Caesar and Heineken. For food, I knew I wanted the Keg Classic so I went with a Top Sirloin and Caesar Salad and the waitress recommended the Burger to my friend.   Oh my goodness...I took a taste of my Friend's burger and damn it was good. It had cheese, bacon and the perfect usual condiments on a brioche buttery bun. As you can tell, I still remember all the ingredients. My steak was super flavourful and good.  Overall our drinks, meal and service was pretty good. I also liked how we sat in an area that was secluded so it was a nice change from sitting at the bar or lounge where it was louder."}
{"text":"The keg is one of my favourite restaurant in the yonge and eglinton area to go too. The food is always amazing, the service is always good and friendly, and if anything is not to our liking , they will always comp something to make us happy. Big fan of this place we go at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Dear Y&E Keg: I hate you.   Really, this place sucks. I feel like a bit of a negative Nancy today  - but this review is long overdue.   I have had 2 very disappointing meals here. I made the mistake of going here on New Years Eve last year. my group was so overlooked it was unbelievable. We waited over 60 minutes for our food. We were told this was because the kitchen was busy cooking for a large party and the server pointed over to a table of about 15 people. On New Years Eve, you should be more than equipped to handle this. I had reservations way in advance - I can understand that I had to wait to be seated, but not that long for my food. My reservation was for 6:00 and I left here at 9:00. The worst part is the food was mediocre. None of us finished our meals.   Just recently I went back here with a friend during the week. I assumed the service would be better. Again, mediocre food - and this time we asked the server to split our bill (at the time of ordering) and when the ONE bill came, he wrote \"Divided by 2 = ________\" I really thought this was a joke, but it was the way he interpreted our request. huh."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant. I was greeted upon arrival, we had a reservation for four. Our waitress was very accommodating and knew her stuff, had very good recommendations. We ordered drinks, they came fairly quickly. Our food didn't take long either. All of our steaks were cooked according to what we asked for, speaking for myself, I had the pecan crusted sirloin with goat cheese and a twice baked potato on the side, both were amazing. Our waitress checked in once we had started eating to make sure that everything was to our liking and our water glasses were always full. I had the brownie sundae for dessert, it was delicious. We stayed for a bit after dessert chatting and as it turns out, they needed that table for a different group, but they were very polite about it and offered to move us to a booth and gave us a free round. I think it was the bar manager and she was soo nice. The ambience of the restaurant is great too, very low light and intimate. I was a little hesitant to go to this specific location because of the reviews, but I'm glad I did and I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"What can i say? Another great Keg location. The servers and team here are exceptionally nice.   Came here in a large group, and the service was extraordinary. It's strange getting service like that in a large group. The manager Michelle also came by a few times to check in on us, and she really made us feel special.    Only downside is the parking situation."}
{"text":"Love the keg. Always get the prime rib because it's so delicious and juicy.  And the sauce that goes with it is absolutely amazing. Service is on point."}
{"text":"I recently went to the Keg for a work dinner and it was my first time in the Keg. I absolutely loved all the food I had. I haven't tried that much from the Keg but I do recommend the filet mignon and the appetizer was amazing I can't remember what it was called it was a mushroom in a sauce simply amazing! I wish I had room for dessert because people's dessert looked amazing too but I was stuffed from all the food. I also really liked this location right next to work and lovely dinning area. I will definitely be going back to try some other items in the menu."}
{"text":"Classic Keg experience for me, I have been going to Keg restuarants for years, the quality here is up to Keg standards. I used to live in the building above, and have spent the odd time here. If you haven't heard of the Keg, I highly reccomend it, great for a steak dinner for 2 under $100."}
{"text":"I like this location probably more than the others because it's new and very clean.  Server was OK, i'd say a 7/10 for that..the food is always great at the Keg...must try the French Onion Soup and the Garlic Bread with any order!"}
{"text":"My hubby & I went here for lunch on the weekend since Mandarin across the street was ridiculously busy. Anyway, we were shown to our table quickly & our waitress didn't leave us too long before getting our orders. The food was delicious. My only complaints are that it was freezing in there & the music was on too loud.  As for the a/c, turns out I was sitting under the vent. They were nice enough to lower the a/c at least. But other than that, nothing really stood out in the service at this Keg location."}
{"text":"My first visit to the Keg & it's a nice treat. I organized a Thanksgiving dinner for a meetup group & it was a nice successful event."}
{"text":"For the money I paid, I can get MUCH better bang for the buck at other restaurants in the city. These guys charge what they do because it's supposedly meant to be an upscale experience. The service was A+, no questions about it. The waiter was super friendly and knowledgable about the menu. However, the food was alright at best and definitely not worth the money they charge. It's a safe bet for a date, but if you want value for your money, I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is our second time at this location and everything was great. Service was perfect, as was the food and drinks.  This time we came on Friday evening and we were given a booth (no reservations during peak times) but there was plenty of seating available.   We ordered from the classics menu and I added a lobster tail to my meal, it actually ended up coming with 2! Great deal. Steaks were cooked to perfection. There was too much food since they start you with warm bread and salads so we packed up our leftovers so we could have a bit of dessert. We chose the mini brownie (no nuts) and creme brûlée and they were prefect. For $3 each it was definitely wort it.   I'm so glad this location is close by as we will continue to come for a great steak dinner."}
{"text":"I have had varied experiences at this place, but my last visit was strange in terms of service. I've been here a few times because it is close to work. Once they took AGES to get my salad and got it 15 minutes after the 9 other people got their food. Anyhow, the food was good and made up for it.  The last time I went here, however, was strange. I had called in advance to let them know we were celebrating an occasion, and they said the person concerned would definitely be given a surprise dessert at the end of the meal. After we reached there, I reminded the person who showed us to our table, and she said she was just going to tell our server. After our meals were over, they disappeared for a while. I couldn't find our server, so I told another server, and she said she'd have our server get it to the table right away. I told her we had no issue paying for it. Another 15 minutes - no dessert and our server gets us the bill. I remind our server (now in front of the person for whom we were celebrating) and she said none of the 3 other people told her!!!  Food is usually good ans quite standard at the Keg and the ambience here is good, so no complaints on that front. Service needs to be looked into."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's huge. I arrived with one friend and we were seated at a crappy table RIGHT beside another couple (with a baby - ugh) even though the place was empty. We asked the hostess to move to a booth, and we might as well have asked her to perform brain surgery because she was terribly confused. After some back and forth we were moved to the booth.  The prime rib was decent and the sides were alright. For $40 I guess I can't complain. The bread is delicious."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my steak dinner at the Keg. I think this location may have a better chef than others I've tried out.   I ordered:  BLEU CHEESE FILET- A filet mignon wrapped in applewood smoked bacon and grilled to your liking. I asked for it chicago medium rare, which just means it's medium rare but slightly charred on the exterior. HEAVEN.   This 7oz cut  of meat was covered in a blue cheese topper, served golden brown and sprinkled with roasted garlic cloves.  Just to make sure I flirt with that line between hungry and gluttonous, I ordered mashed potatoes and a bearnaise sauce on the side to boot. Just cause I can.   So glad I did! Others at the table tried fries, and veggies, and different cuts of meat, as well as lobster and shrimp. We were all licking our plates and loosening our belts by the end of the evening.     I RECOMMEND: Their specialty cuts. Any of them really.   EXTRA TIP: Birthdays or wedding celebration? Alert the staff for a dessert on the house. Yum."}
{"text":"Obviously some Kegs will have a slightly better atmosphere than others. This one does not disappoint. The bar area is quite lively and the service has been stellar everytime I have come here.   If you are a big Keg fan than I would definitely recommend the Eglinton location. 5 Stars given based on knowing the Keg and expectations of service - in relative terms to other higher end steak houses this may get a 4."}
{"text":"We went here with a specific goal. To have a great steak, baked potato and a beer. The food did not disappoint. The steak was perfectly cooked for both of us and had the great flavour the keg steaks are known for. It did however disappoint in the server and service side. The restaurant wasn't busy but the service would have thought otherwise.   We normally have a good time at this location but this one left something to be desired.   Will return and give them another shot and hope it's just a one off."}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner while I was visiting Toronto.  My cousin had made us a reservation since we had a party of twelve so we didn't have to wait.  The Keg has a nice atmosphere inside, partially restaurant, partially lounge.  A bit dimly lit, but not so much that you're tripping over yourself to find the washroom.  It's quite expensive, but luckily I wasn't paying.  I only ordered appetizers however, since I wasn't that hungry at the time.  I had the crab cakes and lobster gratinee.  The crab cakes were great, especially with the sauce they come with and a little squeeze of lemon.  The lobster gratinee was very cheesy, but honestly didn't have much lobster.  It was mostly cheese and oil.  Also, they only gave me two tiny slices of bread, which definitely was not enough to finish the food with.  I didn't try the steak so I can't vouch for it, but everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals so it must have been pretty good."}
{"text":"I love The Keg and was looking forward to my friend's birthday when she said we would be having dinner here. They don't do reservations on Saturdays which sucked because there was a 45 minute wait before we could get a table for our group of 13. We were served by two waiters and they were wonderful all night. Very knowledgeable on what the special was for the night, filled up our waters and checked up on us the appropriate amount of times.  I got the Prime Rib Sliders ($16) that was cooked medium rare, came with a dark au jus, and horseradish. It was so good, and quite filling for me!  I will definitely come back here to splurge if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Have been to this Keg many times as it's walking distance. Almost never disappointed. Consistency in service (we usually sit in the lounge) and also in food. My husband takes a very blue steak and 8-9 times out of 10 they get it right. They're also always accommodating to our keto diet with substitutions if required. Have been to many other kegs and this is one of the best. Ask for John if you can - he's awesome! Definitely recommend!"}
