{"text":"LOVE this place! Great lunch specials, my go-to is two slices of pepperoni and a drink for $5.50. Can't beat that price. The pizza is really great, the slices are big and delicious. Sometimes there's a long line at lunchtime (it's a very small hole-in-the-wall type place in Latta Arcade) but the wait is worth it and they move people through pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Great NewYork Style pizza that you have to fold over with the grease dripping. Good lunch prices!"}
{"text":"Great place to pick up a quick lunch in uptown. The NY style pizza beats most places in NYC by a long shot. 2 slices and a fountain drink for $6 is hard to beat, especially when the pizza is so good."}
{"text":"Great pizza & salads. The spinach salad with chicken was absolutely delicious. They have great prices, friendly staff, and extremely efficient during lunch time. I will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"It's a walk in / take out only pizza place in latta arcade. You can usually get in and out of there pretty quick at lunch. It is very affordable. They have all sorts of delicious pizzas ready to go by the slice. It's thin New York style pizza.  They have calzones and stromboli. The  CHICKEN PARMESAN STROMBOLI IS INCREDIBLE! (it is a must try but warning it is totally addicting)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite uptown lunch stops! Right across from another popular uptown lunch spot (Crisp), Pie in the Sky seems to always have a steady flow of customers. I was drawn in by their lunch special: $6.50 for 2 slices of either cheese or pepperoni AND a drink! The space is really small, but the employees do a good job of keeping up with a confusing and usually crowded line around lunch time. Once someone behind the counter takes my order (always 2 pepperonis and a pink lemonade), I can hop into the payment line to pay and receive my drink. Sometimes my co-workers and I wait about 5 minutes after paying for our pizza, because it's usually fresh out of the oven, which I can't complain about. They have a station with parmesan and red pepper flakes to sprinkle onto your pizza once it is out of the oven and handed to you. There is little seating right outside the restaurant in the Latta Arcade, but bank on taking your food elsewhere to eat. The pizza is always made to perfection, and I love the New-York style of pie.

This is by far the best lunch deal in or around uptown, with 2 slices of pizza and a fountain drink for only $6.50."}
{"text":"Not too bad, but not great. NY style pizza in a place with vintage charm. Pizza was a little greasy but it was tasty. No places to sit as it was in the Latta Arcade. Quick service. Would go again if I was in the mood for pizza but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal and love the atmosphere of the place. It was almost like time traveling in a way! There are signs all over the walls that are so witty and fun to read with friends. It's such a quaint little part of the city! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident the other night - it's in the Latta Arcade, so it's not super easy to find.  We grabbed a couple slices of pizza and some drinks - they have a deal that you get 2 slices of pizza (cheese or pepperoni & get a fountain drink free!).  The pizza is super thin and crispy - true NY style.  There isn't a lot of seating available since there is no seating inside the restaurant, but there are some high top tables outside of it.  

I would definitely go back here next time I'm in the city and need a quick slice of pizza!"}
{"text":"You can't beat a huge salad and drink for under $7, especially at an uptown joint with quick and very friendly service.  It's takeout only, but there are plenty of cool places around Latta Arcade to go sit.  I keep saying I'm going to try the pizza, but every time I can't resist the cobb salad.  There is half an avocado in this thing - I love it."}
{"text":"Good pizza and affordable prices.  I stopped in here for lunch the other day and got their special: 2 slices of pepperoni and a drink for $5.95.  Not bad, especially for a restaurant Uptown.  The pizza was really good too.  It was that thin crust pizza more like the type you would actually find in Italy than stateside, where the crust is the same thickness all the way through, and there is no thick edge like in American pies.  The tomato sauce ws good too. I was very pleased with my meal, grabbed a refill of  orange Fanta on my way out and was good to go.  If you are looking for reasonably priced pizza and are Uptown, give Pie in the Sky a try.  The service was also great.  The guys working there were very friendly and the food was out in no time.  When I went back to get my refill, both fellas behind the counter asked how my pizza was.  I appreciate that sort of interaction with restauranteurs, they genuinely cared about my experience at their restaurant.  Very friendly ,accomodating and easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"You simply can't beat their $6 lunch special. Love the decor with all the miscellaneous jokes posted everywhere, and the old school menu board reminds me of Jersey..."}
{"text":"Great pizza, in a TRUE New York style. The specials are always awesome but you won't go wrong with classic cheese or pepperoni!"}
{"text":"What a gem to find!! 

A hole in the wall that's pretty much just open during work hours!!! I got a medium cheese pizza that my friend and I split.  It was Increadible!!! It won't be my last time!!

They have a few bar table type seating right outside the place.  They also have couple stools inside. It's mainly a to-go place for uptown. When I was sitting at the bar table outside they had a constant flow of people and even a steady line at times. A perfect place to come for lunch in the city!!!"}
{"text":"Just as a background, I have tried just about every pizza place in Charlotte looking for the NY style pizza.  This place fits the bill the best in uptown Charlotte in my opinion.  The toppings and tomato sauce are well done.  The only quibble I have is that the crust is a bit thicker than I like.  Also, just as an FYI, this is a carryout place.  There is some limited outside seating, but plan to take it with you.  Otherwise it's hard to beat the price and taste!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I got tired of Fuel Pizza (barf) so I found this place thanks to Yelp. Great service overall. Pretty small place too. Order pizza to take out if you plan on bringing alot of people with you."}
{"text":"The perfect place to grab a slice of pizza uptown. It is located in the Latta Arcade. The service is friendly and the decor is eclectic. There are a million funny signs to read and pictures to look at while you wait for your food. It's mostly a walk up counter but there are a few tables.

The pizza is NY style and you can get it by the slice. The sauce is awesome as is the crust. No complaints from me! Cannoli was delicious too. The prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Pie in the Sky has very good food.  Lunch is always a busy time for them.  Reasonable prices and great service.  I usually get the spaghetti and Meatballs but today I had the Calzone with Sausage, Ham and Olives.  Amazing!  My co-worker had the 10\" Pepperoni Pizza and he said it was very good as well.  No seating is available in the restaurant but is availabe outside in the lobby of the building or the nearby atrium."}
{"text":"Tried them 1st time for delivery on St Patty's day.  They were slammed and didn't think they could delivery under 90 minutes.  I appreciated the honesty and placed my order for a large pie with mushrooms.  75 minutes later they were knocking on my door.  Sweet!

The pizza was still warm, lots of shrooms, and a large (really), thin crust.  They go easy on the sauce, so I cranked it up with some peppers and cheese.  Great job and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Lets start with first impressions. The pizza isn't quite an Italian masterpiece and to be honest the texture is sort of funky. I will give them excellent points though for flavor because I probably ate 2 giant slices (equivalent to 4 normal ones) of the BBQ chicken pizza in one sitting. There was plenty of chicken, red onion and BBQ flavor. The cilantro (parsley?) looked a bit depressed, however.  For those who like their pizza the next day reheated, this doesn't fly as well so order only as much as you can eat."}
{"text":"I've actually haven't had their pizza here yet, which sounds like I'll have to try! I'm a sucker for their subs and salads. The chicken cobb salad is about $8 and its huge!!!! Lots of toppings and the dressing is delicious. It's well big enough for two people. Trust me- try a salad once. I'm also love their buffalo chicken and Italian sub. For lunch, you get a 8-12\" sub with chips and a drink for only $8! Cheapy cheapy, almost free!"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza... The barbque pulled pork pizza is my favorite, usually have to beat the lunch rush to get it though. The $6 2 slice and drink deal is great too ! The same 3 friendly guys are always there and ask me \"what would you like sweetheart\" :)"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a slice of NY style pizza.  Good prices. Gets slammed during lunch hours, but they a normally pretty fast about it.  More of a take out place. Not really anywhere to sit, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"First off, don't expect to find anywhere to sit inside. It's barely enough room for 5 guests to stand in line to order, and it's too hot inside anyways. Small hole in the wall in the alleyway of restaurants. We felt so rushed that we just ordered two slices and a drink and left and found public seating in front of the Bank of America. The margherita slice was really good. I liked the thick tomato slices on top. The pan chciken bacon was also really good. Not as good as my home town pizza place, but I am biased. Overall a really quick bite. Everyone else was ordering salads. I would go back if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Came back to try their slices of pizza. They have a nice special- any two slices of pizza and a drink for $6.50. 

Fairly large slices. Super thin. Barely any sauce. Not too cheesy or overly greasy. Crust has a hint of garlic butter.

Overall, good lunch deals here and pizza is decent."}
{"text":"Finally got over to Pie in the Sky for lunch today. It has been on my list for a while; but uptown goes into hibernation over the weekend so I had to make it for a quick work lunch. 

The place is tight with room for a handful of people. They are built for the work lunch. A slice of the BBQ chicken pizza and grabbed a table in the Latta Arcade walkway. 

Great authentic NY style pizza. The BBQ chicken was traditional, but done well. 

They also have a great lunch special - 2 slices of cheese and a soda for $5.50! I will be back for more"}
{"text":"What a great lunch deal! If you work in the area and you're looking for a quick place for lunch, I'd definitely recommend it! Two slices and a soda for 5.50, cheese or pepperoni, and quick service! How can you beat it? The pizza is delicious and greasy-goodness!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to quick lunch joint downtown.  It's in the Latta Arcade, and I love that I can take my meal outside into the Brevard Courtyard and enjoy the great NC weather.

I love the pizza (large slices, not at all greasy!), but lately I've been hooked on their salads.  Yes.  A pizza place with fantastic salads.  They have a cobb salad with romaine lettuce, egg, huge chunks of fresh avocado, crumbled bleu cheese, tomatoes and bacon.  It's gigantic, and a wonderful, affordable, healthy lunch.

Great place, great people, and I love supporting small businesses!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in Charlotte. As a bonus, the price is completely reasonable!!! In addition, they have a great Greek salad. But seriously, why did I ever pick salad over slices?"}
{"text":"Pros: 
-The pizza is really good. We ordered a 18'' pepperoni so it was made to order, not just warmed up.
-Nice casual atmosphere.
-Staff is just ok, nothing spectacular

Cons:
-It took so long to get our food. We waited close to 40 minutes for a pizza and wings. When we got our wings we only had 9 instead of the 10 it was supposed to come with.
-The wings are not that great. I also asked them to be cooked hard but we got them and they were very soft and no type of crunch. 
-The servers kind of forgot about us. The place is very small so it's not like they  couldn't see us sitting at the table staring at them with empty cups waiting on a refill. The place was not crowded either so no excuse. 

I probably would only go back if I just want a slice a pizza to sober up after drinking too much while at the epicenter."}
{"text":"I stop by and picked up too slices when I was in a hurry for lunch one day. I had a bbq chicken slice and a vegetarian slice. It came with a drink for only $6.50 which is a great deal for uptown. They were heated up and served quickly. It's in Latta Arcade so there isn't any place in the actual place to sit. Right out side there is two tables and outside in the court yard a few more but during lunch it is hard to find a place open. I'll definitely stop back if I'm ever in need of a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Big sucker for pizza here... Well, anything with bread and cheese, I am pretty much a the head of the line.  Been wanting to try Pie in the Sky Pizza for the longest time, but never got a chance to due to walking by and having a line \"out the door\".  I totally understand why there is a line now- so worth it.

The place is tiny, you walk in and order (so hence why the line usually goes out the door), but it's located in Latta Arcade, which is one of my favorite places to go for my lunch hour working Uptown.  No matter what the size this place is, they sure know how to pack a punch in their pizza.  NY style pizza, where folding is optional, but maybe required... but they do their pizza well here.  I am definitely a fan.  I haven't had any of their specialty pizzas, but two cheeses and a drink for $5.99.... is hard to beat.

The even bigger bonus is that you can take the pizza and walk over to the park to eat it, or be lucky enough to get a small table in the arcade to enjoy it."}
{"text":"a great NY style of pizza for a cheap price. Conveniently located in Latta Arcade for those who work in that area of Uptown. Service is quick especially if you choose a slice from the constantly made selection of pizzas."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised by all of the great reviews. We got pizza and cheese sticks (which turned out not to be mozzarella sticks, but breadsticks with cheese). The pizza crust is nothing like NY pizza - it's very bready and lacks that crispy chewy bite NY pizza crust is known for. This would be fine if the crust were actually good, but unfortunately it's quite flavorless and the texture is unpleasant.

There was very little sauce on the pizza, and the cheese had a strange oil sheen and cheap, plastic quality to it as it cooled. Very unappetizing. 

The cheese sticks were also very dry and bready and flavorless. They're basically just a thicker pizza cut into breadsticks. Not enjoyable. 

Overall some of my least favorite pizza in CLT."}
{"text":"Y'all..... I have a bad habit of getting salads from here at least twice a week.

My favorite salad is the strawberry spinach with raspberry vinaigrette.  It is AMAZING.  $7.47 and includes a drink.  You can add meat for $2.00.

If you are in the mood for pizza it is NY style.

The prices are very reasonable.  As a warning this is a to go spot only and it's very hot inside bc of their large oven that makes the pizza taste amazing.

This is a hidden gem uptown in the latte arcade!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem that if forget about all to often for lunch. Two slices and a soda for 5.50, cheese or pepperoni anyway. No place to eat here so walk down the arcade or out to Bearden Park or across to the Plaza. Pretty close to NYC pie. Good enough for me anyway and I'm a Jersey guy."}
{"text":"Hello Friends, 

First let me say, I'm NOT from NEW YORK but really so what! Your birthplace doesn't give you a culinary degree in pizza does it?? Well... does it? 
I used to visit this location often, (the previous owners were from OHIO.. goo Buckeye's). 
anyway. Its a small place, and they use every inch of it. I love the pizza dough. Its a nice \"New York\" style pizza. 
Ez to fold, nice and soft crust. 

They now offer cannoli's (sp) and sub's. The guy said they offer Brisket! I asked oh really, so where do you make the said Brisket. He points over to the stove! (ummmm?????)  I'll pass on that, but as far as the Pizza... umm umm good!!"}
{"text":"me and a co worker fell upon this place n Lunch break. its tucked off in a alley way that randomly links to the French quarter. The space itself is small and not the problem. the Pizza I had which was a regular peperoni just wasn't that good. I'm not trying to put them down or anything but it wasn't cheesy it was a little dry. I think maybe it had been sitting for a while I'm not sure what it was. In the future I would ask if it was just made."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that there are only 2 reviews for this place.
Love the NY style pizza here. Used to get it for lunch at least once a week when I lived in Charlotte (07-08). And on really rough work days, I would get two slices (don't judge me).
The guys that work there are really down to earth nice. Always remembered my name and order."}
{"text":"Pie in the Sky's pizza is way better than Fuel's, hands down. I would absolutely recommend this place, especially if you need to order for an inexpensive business lunch. I have never been dissappointed! My favorite pizzas are the Supreme and the BBQ Chicken, but they are all good. Also, get the Greek salad. They don't skimp on toppings and the dressing is great. Love this place."}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza in Charlotte, hands down! We just wish there was another location where we didn't have to pay to park uptown just to grab a pizza. I call this place, \"constant cravings pie\"."}
{"text":"Came for an early lunch around 11:00 before the lunch rush descends upon the Latta Arcade. I ordered a single slice of the Chicken Alfredo, and for whatever reason, this version had bacon and no mushrooms (a swap I was totally fine with).

The slice was a really good size for $3 and the garlic alfredo sauce was incredibly flavorful. The sauce was so good that I felt like it didn't even need the chicken or bacon, which is weird for me to say, as I usually load my pizzas with as many toppings as I can find.

The staff was really friendly as well. I was greeted from so many different directions when I walked in that my head was spinning. I'll definitely be back!

UPDATE: Ordered a Sausage & Pepperoni slice today. It wasn't quite as good as the Chicken Alfredo & Bacon slice I got last time, but it was still really good. There was no shortage of meat, and I liked the smaller pieces of sausage. Once again, the size and price were perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Pie in the Sky is a decent place to go for a couple slices, heated up quickly, for lunch.  They are not going to win any best pizza in Charlotte contests but it's serviceable with a very thin crust and good, not great toppings."}
