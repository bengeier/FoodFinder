{"text":"Summary: ok pizza, may not get delivery  We have used this place twice. The pizza deserves 3 stars. It is ok. Not bad, not that great. The delivery service the first time was ok as well. However, the second time they didn't have anyone to deliver my pizza for 3 hours, so I had to go pick it up."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite places to get pizza  Small enough they know who you are by name!  Hot and spicy pizza (add sausage please) Is without question the best pizza in Cleveland ! Fresh sausage  always good The Lady Diane who is the owner is one of the nicest people you will ever meet ! She works more then any shop owner I know! Even there red sauce is great it's not sweet ! It full of oregano and Italian  spice  No sugar filled sauce here people"}
{"text":"Carmino's is the best pizza in the Brecksville, Broadview Heights, North Royalton area.   The sauce is flavorful, and the crust is very good if a little doughy.  My favorite part is the sauce has a mildy seasoned, non-sweet flavor, which is what I really expect in a good pizza sauce.  The only reason Carmino's doesn't get a 5 is that the pizza, as many here have said, is often greasy."}
{"text":"Carmino's is another one of Cleveland's little known GREAT FANTASTIC pizza places.  For me, Carminos has GREAT CHEESE.  I usually order extra cheese...somehow whatever cheese they use tastes amazing, more so than my other favorites, when baked.  The Sauce is tasty, slightly acidic, but come on were talking tomatoes here...really it's a good dish and consistent.  Crust ok took.  If your dong a pizza tour of Cleveland add this place to your list!"}
{"text":"Delicious old school pizza, only deliver in a small area so we pick up whenever in B-ville. They are quirky but delicious pizza and stromboli too"}
{"text":"What-do you expect from a pizza joint?  I expect really good pizza, fair prices, friendly staff.  Check, check and check.!"}
{"text":"The people who were working there were very friendly and enthusiastic - so I had to give them at least 1 star for that!  The pizza was not so good - very thick crust and the cheese wasn't gooey at all.  It was kind of chewy - strange!"}
{"text":"They say that they're open until 9pm most nights but that is hardly ever the case. We've called on multiple nights at 8:30 and no one answers.   Tonight we called at 8:15 and were told they've stopped delivering because their driver already has to go to to the next town over, which is 5 minutes away.   The fact of the matter is they should stop saying they're open until 9pm when that is never actually the case. It's a shame. But whatever, we've decided to only order from Antonio's from now on. At least they're open the hours they say they are."}
{"text":"Although this used to be known as Carmino's, the pizza is still the same. I frequently pick up pizza for me and the kids from here when in the area. I really like the sauce they use, and their prices are reasonable."}
