{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had in a restaurant. A minor incident involving foreign matter in our food, which I would have easily forgiven, was turned in to an extremely unpleasant experience by the manager/owner reacting rudely and aggressively to our complaint. After pointing out the problem to our server we were presented with the bill and told we were being given 15% off. When we explained that we would pay for the rest of our dinner but would not pay for the tainted dish we were treated like common criminals, yelled at and argued with by a manager who obviously knows nothing about customer service.

Other than that I found this place very poor quality to begin with. I have no idea why so many people say this is \"authentic\" Mexican food. It's closer to a mall food court version of Mexican food if you ask me. After a bowl of complimentary chips and dip which is a nice touch, the rest of the dishes were either undercooked or overcooked. The worst thing has got to be the refried beans which are served in an edible bowl and and thin enough to almost be bean soup. The margarita was watery  and I think came from a mix and the service, while not horrible was pretty poor. It's also very pricey especially considering what you get, there are many, better Mexican restaurants in this city that don't charge this much.

Their menu and their website touts them as being \"vegan friendly\" but all this means is that they're willing to leave items out of their dishes. They do not offer any vegan alternatives and have very few dishes that are vegan to begin with.

I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend and his co-worker.  Most bland mexican food i've had.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!

Some of the worst service I've ever received.

Dashed in to get out of the rain on a Saturday for a late lunch after shopping and the place was empty. So it seemed outrageous that after we were seated we waited at least 15 minutes just to get menus! After that probably another 15 minutes to bring us water.
 We tried ordering something with fish or shrimp but were told they were out of it.
Ended up getting crab cakes (big mistake) and duck taquitos to share. Which were decent.
Our server never came back to check on us, I was dying of thirst but she was no where in sight.
An hour later we both felt incredibly ill. Probably food poisoning.
I'm warning everyone I know to stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate here. The atmosphere is nice but the food left much to be desired. We shared the amigo sampler platter. it included duck taquitos, which  were good. It also came with two chirozo   empinadas  but we only got cheese ones, and a shrimp salad, which wasn't bad. There were not enough dips for the platter.  at least not enough guacamole or salsa, and even when we requested more, we were only given a very small amount. I had the black bean soup; it was not bad but not special either.  And my wife got the spinach salad; for $9 there wasn't much to the salad and some of the spinach leaves had spoiled, looked like it came from a bag and they cut up a hard boiled egg on it and a tiny bit of nuts and avacodo. Overall,  not an overly impressive meal, wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"this has to be one of the absolutely worst mexican food restaurant that I have been to. Came in starved. Had the guacamole ($10) hmm, thought quite steep for portion, BUT IF it was good quality, portion size doesn't matter, this  just tasted very watery - and the tomatoes on top were mushy and old, which didn't add much to the dish. This also was on a thursday, not beginning of week. The comp nacho chips and salsas were very nice. we had ordered fish tacos, and were told that people come there specifically for them. I have to admit, they were actually the worst I ever tasted, and I love fish tacos. Is it because we came in around 9pm? The fish was so limp, greasy and, just not at all fresh tasting either so not sure when it was actually prepared, earlier in day? The cole slaw had no taste or flavor at all, or crunch of any kind. Chilli relenos looked great and were fine, but then ¼ of the order was just onions.  Bottled beer was good, but margarita was so very watered down. This was just a big disappointment overall. I suggest trying some of the other mexcian restaurants in the city, where freshness and quality play an important role in the food served"}
{"text":"This was probably my last time at this restaurant. I came here on a Sunday afternoon with a friend and the place was empty! We ordered chicken burritos, only to find out after a bite or two that we had been served beef!! Moreover, the beef didn't taste good at all! The server offered complimentary dessert for her mistake, but we were in no mood to eat anything else in this place."}
{"text":"We had a good experience. It was a hot July afternoon and a lunch on a small neat patio was a perfect remedy. I had a cactus salad with chicken - the portion was very generous and the food was fresh and delicious. I also had a michelada, which was a bit too sour but still good. 
I recommend sitting outside as the dining room inside has a faint but persistent smell of smoke."}
{"text":"Hosts: The servers were lovely, although we were low maintenance. Water glasses re-filled and our waiter apologized for interrupting our conversation to ask if we wanted dessert. Service I admit was slow, but that's the kitchens fault, but they gave us free nacho chips with two types of salsa as we waited so that was pretty great.

I went with Flautas and a side of Elote - Steamed corn on the cob smothered with mayo, shredded feta and chili pepper. My total was $20 which is a great value and the portion sizes were big. Loved the Flautas!

I will definitely be back.

{"text":"I walked in because I saw this on a Bay Street trip earlier in the week and I decided to try it since I will be in that neighbourhood once my company moves.

I got sat down it wasn`t too busy and immediately I get a plate of basic chips, a salsa dip, and some guacamole. 

The salsa wasn`t bad I`m not a huge spicy person but the guac seemed like baby food and I`m not of the latin descent but most guacamole I`ve seen is like a paste where as this was runny. The taste was ok nothing too extravagant.

I ordered the tacos they come in 4 ($15) and they had 3 flavors of meat; Pork, Beef, and Chicken. The beef was chunky much like the kind you find in a stroganof same with the chicken and the pork was shredded. The tacos came with the meats below, some fried pepper, onions, a separate dish with the cheese/tomato/chives a pasty guac all wrapped in a soft taco shell and served with a small side of a bean dip in a corn chip bowl.

The taste was ok nothing to rave about.

It seems like a place you could bring your date to if they were in the mood for some Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been going to their Yonge and Bloor location since they opened and it's one of my favourite places to go. Every time I'm there, it's packed - and I don't even go there on the weekends!  So it's disappointing to see so many negative reviews about my go-to spot. 

I've tried pretty much everything on the menu, and while I have my favourites, I always leave there satisfied with their service and a full belly. 

I love their back patio!  It's enclosed and away from the Yonge street chaos, which means I can be outside and enjoy my meal without eating exhaust fumes too."}
{"text":"I am regular in this place. We love it for the fajitas and chimichangas. The food is fresh and really in the Mexican style. I usually have Margarita or Orchata ( which I find the best one so far in TO). 
The service is fast and they usually have a special menu that is a good deal for a complete lunch .."}
{"text":"Decent handmade Mexican food. Service has always been good when I've gone. The fajitas compared to a place like Lone Star didn't hold up but the Burritos weren't too bad."}
{"text":"Alright. So the food was fantastic, no complaints. They also give you free nachos with spicy guac and spicy salsa; my wife is pregnant and I asked for mild and they brought it right away! The drinks. No complaints there either; I had Tommy's Margarita and the Mexican bulldog. The reason this place gets only 3 stars is the fact that the heat was very high, there are flies everywhere including the bathroom as well as spiders; lastly, the service could be a little faster although the waiters were great and friendly. Definitely would go back for the food though."}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance in this place, excellent service and a live mariachi band! Unfortunately I found the food to be ok. Maybe it is authentic and I'm just no used to it but I didn't really like it."}
{"text":"The Good

1. Cute atmosphere
2. Amazing food (I've only tried the standards - tacos, burritos, etc)
3. Every second Friday they have a mariachi band
4. Best Guacamole!
5. Friendly service
6. Chips and 2 kinds of \"salsa\" are on the table at all times.

The Bad
1. Slow service."}
{"text":"When it is cool and cold outside, I always crave for something hot and spicy!  And when I don't feel like driving very far, La Mexicana is a good choice for me.

My favorites:  
Cochinita Pibill (Chunks of pork seasoned with achiote and habanero peppers, steamed in a banana leaf).  Pork was tender and juicy, with the right amount of spiciness from marinated sauce.

Mariscos al Guajillo (Tiger shrimps, basa fish, scallops and Atlantic lobster  gently sautéed with onions, guajillo pepper and salsa verde).  Love how the guajillo pepper and salsa verde bring the shrimps, fish, scallop and lobster together.  This dish is probably very spicy for some people, but for me, it needs a notch or two of guajillo pepper!

Service was prompt and friendly.  Go early, if they're busy ... service usually slows down a lot."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with my boyfriend, who regularly has hankerings for Mexican fare. 

I've given La Mexican 3* because I feel it could step up the food and flavour *just* a bit more.. This is only our go-to place for lack of better Mexican food in the city..Wassup with that, yo? All we want is a little atmosphere, good service and yummy, authentic Mexican...Is that too much to ask?? :) 

La Mexicana is not so bad. The servers are very kind and accommodating and it's never too busy that we feel neglected. The drinks are OK -- I actually preferred my mango daquiri at Cocina Lucero the other day, but it's all good -- we went for the food, so let's talk about the food.

We started with the \"tlayoyos\" -- try saying that fast a few times;)... they were fine if not a bit dry and flavourless. Pour a little salsa on that, though, and you're good to go.

My bf always *always* gets the chimichanga. In fact, we don't go to Mexican restaurants that don't have chimichanga. And theirs is really good! It's not too greasy, which is something I appreciate -- sometimes I'm in the mood for chimichanga too, and my waistline could do without the pounds! Anyway, the chicken is always tender and moist, the tortilla portion always perfectly crisp but not thick and fried -- it's almost pastry-like.

I had the mariscos al guajillo..it was a delicious medley of fish, scallops, lobster and shrimp. I'm a sucker for quality seafood and so I was immediately wooed -- each bite was fresh and juicy, and I was pleased that they didn't skimp on the lobster. The sauce was good too, though I felt it could've had just a little more of a punch to make it stand out. 

This dish took me back to the mountains of Baja California, Mexico, where I visited as a child and ate a dish that tasted much the same.  That must say something for La Mexicana, si?"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best Mexican fare in a great location. Fun, cozy environment that serves for a drunk Friday night out as well as a family spot for Sunday brunch. If you are hungover, get the huevos rancheros and you will be like new in an hour."}
{"text":"Wow. The people who didn't like this place, REALLY didn't like it.  Like  REALLY.  I didn't like it, but it wasn't that bad.  The service, however, is unpredictable.  One time it was good, the last time it was really, really bad.

Bana and I met up for holiday hugs with a side of lunch. Did I ever mention that Bana LOVES Mexican? Because she truly does. 

Their homemade salsa and salsa verde were good, as were their guacamole and hot sauce.

I got the lunch special of four empanadas - two pork and two chorizo and potato. They were good, although once you go Las Palmas you never go back.

Bana enjoyed her chicken burrito with beans:

Overall, simple menu, reasonable prices, and tasty food. Authentic Mexican cuisine? I don't know, do I look like Rick Bayless? He'd probably say it's not and scoff at it, but that's like asking Jordan if he watches the Raptors? Haha.

I ate all my food. That's a good sign. Well, not really, I eat anything...

I liked my food."}
{"text":"Went there with a large group last Saturday evening. Because it was a large group they forced everyone to have the $25 dollar prix fixe menu which included an appetizer (the salad or soup), a main (burritos, fajitas and one more), and churros for dessert with tea and coffee. I had to really force the waitress to give me an a la carte dish as I do not eat dessert and she reluctantly agreed after calling her over for a second time and told me not to tell the other group members (I sat at the end of the table). I had looked at their menu online and it said that their Pollo con Mole was their \"main house specialty\" so I ordered that. 

Firstly they forgot to give us their complementary nacho and salsa which was admittedly good, once we told them we didn't get any after 25 minutes of waiting. 

When everyone got their appetizers a whopping 30 minutes later (because it was a group perhaps) it was the miniature salad with 1000 islands dressing that seems to be on the pictures of all the main dishes in the reviews below. I'm confused, IS THIS MINI SALAD AN APPETIZER OR IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF THE MEAL. Methinks scam. In any case it was a pathetic salad. 

Finally we got our main dishes. My Pollo con Mole didn't look like the picture online, did not contain any feta and as stated in other reviews the rice seemed bland. THIS IS THEIR SPECIALTY? WHAT A JOKE! The food was NOT good but edible. All of the 10+ members of the group who got the prix fixe meals agreed. From enchiladas to fajitas to burritos all overpriced and lacking any discernible taste.

To follow this up they provided two churros for dessert to the prix fixe members of the group, which were probably the worst I've tasted. I got a chance to taste part of one as almost everyone stopped eating after they forced down the first. 

Finally, an automatic gratuity. I understand this policy but for such garbage service and food I wouldn't have tipped as much.

If you want better go to: fat bastard burrito, big fat burrito, burrito boys, chipotle or even mucho burrito. La mexicana is not in any way more authentic than these places. The fajitas at Kelsey are just as authentic, are far more tasty, have much more quantity, and are far cheaper. 

Did I mention my stomach was upset afterwards? Must've been the premiumly priced $20 refried beans."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible food- I actually felt guilty dragging my friend here for dinner. 
Terrible service- and terrible ambiance. 
That is all."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, waiter and the music! It's a great place to go to in you're craving nachos or anything Mexican! Food was great and waiters are very friendly and helpful - they knew they menus well. This is my second time here and haven't been disappointed ever! I believe now they give you a free appetizer of nachos and very unique sauce to dip in. I recommend this place to hang out when catching up with friends or feel like nachos!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good...not fabulous...but pretty good.  LA Mexicana is ideal if you want a casual resto, some pretty decent food, and want to just relax with some friends and eat."}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place. I mean, it is not bad. There is something about it that rubs me the wrong way. I must admit it is completely subjective from my part. However since I am Latin and have lived in D.F I do feel like my opinion does carry some merit. 

They do try a lot with the decour... Hey, they even hired my friend's Mariachi band to play on Fridays --actually if you go for a drink or two and watch them perform this place can be quite a lot fun. 

However, you will get some dirty looks from the staff if you don't order something to eat. So we did, and we got the Amigo Sampler which at $16 was really not a lot of food for the price. Like really, not a lot. 

I think a lot people will agree with me, La Mexicana is on the expensive side for what you get. I mean, that is how normally it rolls with Mexican restaurants in Toronto but this place is a particular example of that.

The truth is most Mexican food, like a lot of ethnic is food is meant to be well, pleb food. Meant to be neither difficult or expensive to make. Now, don't roll your eyes because what I am saying may sound odd but trust me, it is also 100% true. 

So if someone looks at me square in the eye and expects me to pay $10+ for refried beans, then that means I will have to keep checking for my wallet in case you later try to steal it outright, sans refried beans, of course. Now you don't have to worry because as far as I could tell they are not even offered in their menu not even for breakfast/lunch.

For example, Google Image 'Mixiote de Borrego' and look at the photos that come up, it is a good dish in general but priced at $23? Ay, que robo! I think not. 

Also, remember my rule of thumb regarding authentic Mexican restaurants:

\"If it has Fajitas anywhere on the menu, then it is not authentic or it has authenticity issues.\" Specially when they sit at $18 a platter. 

I would say this place tries to be Mexican and for some it might be enough but it is not as authentic as it claims to be and at their menu price point, I would expect it to be a serious contender. 

Case in point, their ceviche was not authentic. Heck it looked like the type of ceviche I could easily make for cheap at home but one you could not serve in any Latin American restaurant unless you wanted to get laughed at....and using tons of lettuce as filler in the ceviche? That's just wrong. Mind you it is not on their menu that I saw but they do serve it as part of their Amigo Platter. Yet sneaky.

It is not completely their fault. You see, unfortunately, when it comes to authentic Mexican (or Spanish/Latin) restaurants the bar has been set way too low in Toronto as most restaurants have to Gringo-up their menus and as such there are only a very few serious contenders.

If you want something more authentic, look for authentic ingredients on a menu, like say, crema fresca for example. 

Still an alright place for a beer, if come outside busy dinner hours."}
{"text":"ordered ceviche($12) and fish taco($16) for take out.

The portion of the ceviche is generous! It tastes fresh but nothing else. 

The fish taco was a disappointment: the coleslaw was not refreshing at all, the fried fish was slightly below average, the taste was mediocre and it cost $16. It is not expensive but it should be better. 

The people were nice and friendly, but when I finished my taco I realized there was NO NAPKIN! 
 
 Waited about 20 min for my take out. Maybe not a very good choice for a quick lunch for ppl works nearby."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food. Minus a star because the kitchen always takes forever and things are priced a tad high.

I'm a fan of the chimichangas, but if you're looking for a smaller meal try the taquitos. They also have great horchatas and a wonderful back patio (in the summer).

On weekends they sometimes have a mariachi band come by and sing/play as they walk from table to table. I hadn't experienced this before and it was really neat.

It's too bad they won't be around for long, sounds like the condo developer for 1 Yorkville is kicking them out as early as March 2015."}
{"text":"It was an alright experience. The Enchilada's were good and the decor sure fits the place! My friend ordered the combo platter and as you can tell from above I ordered the Enchiladas. HOWEVER, I ordered Chicken and my first two enchiladas were chicken.. The last one was steak. So For that reason not a good experience not to mention to get one of the servers attentions was like pulling teeth!"}
{"text":"Toronto is becoming less of a Mexican food dessert I suppose, but the Mexican food in a lot of places in the city has a long way to come. La Mexicana is a place I found while sort of wandering around the area close to the Toronto Reference Library. The food was ok, i found the salsa to be ok, the guac to be fine, I got a quesadilla. The food wasn't bad per se, but it wasn't really very good either, and the prices were pretty steep for what we were getting. I didn't have any real issues with the service that I could notice. It wasn't stellar service, but it wasn't bad service either. Overall, I found it to be a very middle of the road experience."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times since it's close to work.

I find all their main dishes made with quality and care, however they are a bit slow.  Usually takes 15-20 minutes for dishes to come out and if you have a big party, it may be more.  

Good place to come, just make sure you have enough time."}
{"text":"2 of us went May 28 @ 9:35 pm at my suggestion as I'm a Mexican and Tex/Mex food aficionado and remembered having enjoyed the place a couple years ago. There was only one other table occupied and the waiter returned within 1 minute to ask if we knew what we wanted as the kitchen was closing in 5 mins, giving the impression that he would be just as happy if we left. Posted closing time is an early 10 pm. Unfortunately, we stayed...

I sat my reading glasses case down on the table when we arrived. When I went to pick it up to read the menu, it was practically stuck to the table. Classy, eh? After some mediocre tortilla chips and salsa, we both had the combination platter described in the previous review and guava margaritas. All of it was utterly bland, so I asked for some Tabasco. The server informed me there was no Tabasco and was walking away when I called after him asking if they had any other hot sauce instead. He grudgingly brought another very spicy sauce and spent the remainder of the evening cleaning tables, stacking chairs and generally making it clear that he wanted us out of there ASAP. I did manage to request a glass of water from him as he reached across the table mid-meal to remove our candle. The lights were very bright, so I asked another server if they could be turned down. After asking if I wanted to go to sleep (!), she turned them down just a touch, but a few minutes later our waiter turned them on full blast. By this point the place had less ambiance than your average McDonalds at 3 am. No one ever inquired if we were happy with our food (we were not). The hot sauce I'd begged for added the only taste. The 'quesadilla' was practically an empty tortilla. I know where to find much better tacos and enchiladas in Toronto for less money. The margarita was ok, but it wasn't enough to make this joint acceptable."}
{"text":"I've been going to La Mexicana for awihile now and have never been disapointed by their food. I feel like the made their portions slightly smaller over time though which sucks, cause it's so delicious but you don't feel as stuffed as you should afterwards.
Their drinks are amazing, especially the strawberry daiquiri and they're definitley not afraid to liqour them up, haha. 
My only complaint would be that me and my friend didn't get enough attention when we were there last time, out on the patio."}
{"text":"Went here for a Brunch tasting. We got there early, the waiter was very attentive and made sure we were comfortable with anything to drinks (mango mimosa) while we waited for the rest of our party to get here.

They're complimentary chips and dip were really good especially the red salsa dip. 

We tried the huevos rancheros, it was very good I can't compare it to anything because it was my first time trying this dish. My Bf doesn't like sunny side up eggs and they were able to accommodate with scrambled eggs on his. Next we tried the Mexican benedict and it was very good. I am a huge bennys fan!

For dessert, we had the plantain pancakes. It was sooo good. It was very different. I really liked the flavours/textures.

I definitely will be returning when I get my Mexican food cravings. It was very tasty and the service was very good. This was the first time I have been to a really good mexican restaurant...which is hard to find in Toronto?"}
{"text":"I gave La Mexicana another shot today (it's been 10 months since my first visit), and things have improved a bit. This time, I avoided the fajitas and had chicken enchiladas ($14). The chicken was tender, and they were served nicely cheesy, saucy, fatty and terrible for me -- all the factors I look for in a good enchilada. The accompanying rice was kind of dry and the salad had a little bit of wilt. Unlike last time, the service was far more attentive; I only had to ask once for stuff (water, sour cream) and it was brought quickly. 

Authentic it still ain't, but for Tex-Mex, it's not half bad."}
{"text":"After having some good Mexican food in New York,  I decided to try out this place for dinner as its close to my apartment. Food was OK, tacos were not up to the standard and a bit overpriced in my opinion..I might give them one more shot and see if my opinion changes"}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend in Toronto and when asked what I wanted to eat for dinner as we drove around downtown TO, I exclaimed, \"Mexican...or Italian.\" Mexican is one of those cuisines that I could eat every day of the week and not get tired of it. My friend informed that there aren't really good Mexican restaurants in Toronto, and we were about to give up and go to an Italian place instead when we drove by La Mexicana. The outside looked interesting, and when we found some cheap & easy parking on a side street, we decided to give La Mexican a try. 

The inside is painted in different earthy colors which are both lively & inviting. In fact, there are cute little sunflowers painted on the back of each chair. It took a few minutes to get the attention of a host, but when he came he was friendly & hospitable. 

The menu prices did seem a bit higher than what I've been used to in other Mexican restaurants in the US, so be forewarned. The entree prices all range between $15-20, and appetizers are around $5-11. However, the portion sizes were rather large, and the food was fresh & delicious. I ordered the Pollo con Creme de Rajas, which was cut up pieces of sauteed chicken in a creamy sauce with corn & poblano pepper. It came with salad (with a really yummy dressing), black beans (which tasted amazing), Mexican rice & tortillas. Overall a lot of food for one person and the only way I managed to finish it all was that I was extremely hungry. My friend on the other hand ordered the Combo Platter which included a beef burrito, chicken enchilada and a cheese quesadilla served with some guacamole, sour cream and beans and salad. She also loved her meal and was pleasantly surprised to learn that there is actually some good Mexican restaurants in Toronto, and told me she would definitely be back. 

The only qualm I have of this restaurant is that they gave us complimentary chips and salsa when we came in, however when we asked for more chips and salsa, they charged us for it without telling us. We only realized that they charged us for the extra chips and salsa when the bill arrived. It was $2 for each extra chip basket and 50 cents extra for each salsa. I found that a bit ridiculous, considering at any other Mexican restaurant I've been to they gladly refill the chips and salsa without a charge. Also, if they were going to charge us they could have at least told us! Aside from that issue, we loved the food here and had a good experience."}
{"text":"I know Toronto doesn't \"do\" Mexican, but if you are just looking for a decent lunch and nothing too authentic, this place is fine.
It is never very busy in La Mexicana, and usually the servers take good care of you, which is generally better than restaurants TRYING to be authentic Mexican who only manage to be authentic in terms of bad service. La Mexicana has nice competent servers.
The food is pretty good and the prices are OK - they do give you quite a lot of food.
You start off with some fresh corn chips/tortillas that are quite tasty and some salsa. Warning - the salsa in the big bowl is spicy! the salsa in the little bowl is milder. 
We all had the combo platter which consists of a salad (nice dressing!), a beef burrito and a chicken enchilada, served with rice or black beans. The presentation is simple and the food tastes good. They provide some sour cream and guac and it does the job.
As I said, this is not authentic Mexican, but it's fine for a lunch with friends. It's not cheap, the lunch plates are approx $15, but they do fill you up."}
{"text":"The food was bland, the service was terrible and the atmosphere was blase. We had to ask for cutlery and our bill!
If you're looking for even remotely authentic Mexican food, you won't find it here. Even the guacamole was watery. How do you mess up guacamole? Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Sloooowwwww kitchen and service. Nice atmosphere. Overpriced, bland and small-portioned food. Inattentive service. Did enjoy free chips/salsa appetizers. Elote could use cilantro and lime and way more chili pepper ... 

Vegan friendly sauces and rice, beans - that's a plus. I don't enjoy waiting half an hour between courses though. 

Flan is not bad tasting, but not great as far as flan goes (grainy). Churros were shameful ..."}
{"text":"I was SO disappointed. I used to go to the North York location all the time in high school and university...I am Mexican and feel guilty dissing them like this but .....

Context:
1. We had dinner here on Sept 18th, after just having celebrated Mexico's 200th Independence Anniv at Nathan Phillips Square.
2. I am Mexican born and came to Canada at age 6.
3. I live in California now and was home to visit. This is relevant because I am surrounded by great Mexican food in the San Fran Bay Area.

Feedback:
1.  We entered with a baby in a stroller and the server was immediately confused. His face said, \"Crap, where do I put the baby people?\"
2.  The prices are insanely expensive. The best Mexican place I know in Northern California is cheaper and it is super gourmet and wonderful. $16 for one Chile Relleno?  Are you insane?????
3.  Not vegetarian friendly. They simply boil tasteless veggies and stuff them in a tortilla no matter the item. 
4. No changing table in the restroom. Servers didn't even know if there was or wasn't.
5. No spicy salsa. Their \"spicy\" salsa was not spicy at all. 
6.  The Guacamole was the only good thing we tasted. It was VERY good but $$$.
7.  They used a mix to make the Margaritas. GASP!!!!  AND they SUCKED. It was expensive lemonade full of sugar.

Overall, this is not an authentic Mexican restaurant. It isn't tasty or flavourful and Chimichangas aren't authentic. They are Tex-Mex."}
{"text":"#MEXICAN #YELPTO #SUMMER #TACOS #BURRITOS

5 stars because we had 3 musicians serenade to us in Spanish. Ola! So what if they were a tad loud (which they are and conversations are difficult), they made my day! 

La Mexicana is such a cute restaurant. Small, cozy with a great ambience. Perfect for some family time, and great for dates. The margaritas are delicious - the traditional one was the best I've tried ever; and the frozen one was not bad either. 

For appetizers, we tried Tostadas - mini crispy tortillas with mexican chicken topping, 2 a plate. Not bad. But it's the actual entrees that are totally rave-worthy. My friend and I shared a Combo Platter that consisted of the best quesadilla ever, an enchilada and a burrito. The portion was huge and totally shareable. What a steal for $16. I highly recommend this one - especially because you get a taste of a few things on the menu. My cousins ordered an entree each and the portions were massive. So, if you're not a big eater, it's safe to say that everything here is very shareable. 

Verdict? I'm coming back :)"}
{"text":"If I was stranded for days without food, the first thing I'd eat would be a taco. Actually, several tacos. With sour cream. And guac. And the doctors would probably say \"No...we think you should just have an IV...\" and I'd say, \"Mind your own business!\" (or something much ruder).

All this is to say that I really love tacos, and I'm always looking for Mexican food places to indulge my cravings. 

La Mexicana is right across the street from the Reference Library, which is dangerous because after a day of working there, where they don't let you bring food, I'm usually starving when I leave.

This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the tacos are really good and not a bad price. It's clean, cozy and the staff is great. It's no gourmet, but what tacos are?"}
{"text":"A very good place for Mexican food . 
Service is very good , food is great and a great atmosphere . Highly recommend ."}
{"text":"To be honest I don't eat a lot of Mexican food and we had heard this place was ok so we thought we'd try it.

We started with a Mojito.  I don't drink much but I know I like Mojitos and I have to say I really enjoyed theirs, they do it right.

They brought us some nacho chips with two dips, which was nice.

I ordered Faijita's because I'm unoriginal and not very daring.  They were $19, which seems high.  My fiancee ordered the combo platter which had a burrito, enchillada and quesadillia.  It was $16 I believe.

I had seen some other Faijita platters come out and they were all sizzling.  Mine lacked any sizzle.  It wasn't cold but it wasn't hot neither.  They were very generous with the meat and peppers and rice and beans, very ungenerous with the cheese and salsa (I passed on the Sour Cream and Guac, not a fan).  

The food itself was tasty but then something weird happened.  They brought me 3 teeny-tiny tortilla shells.  So I ran out of shells and still had tons of food left.  I asked for more, she said they were FIFTY CENTS EACH!!!  Are you KIDDING???

I explained, quietly and calmly that I have never once run out of toppings before shells before and SURELY I wasn't the first to say so in their fine establishment.  Her answer was \"Next time try the whole wheat tortilla's, they are a bit bigger\".  I found a giant hole in her suggestion, that part about \"Next time\".

My fiancee didn't finish her meal, which means she wasn't a huge fan.  She said it was \"ok\".

The desserts looked good so we tried some.  My fiancee got some apple dish, I got \"Rice Pudding Brulee\" which promised a creamy rice pudding underneath burnt sugar loaded with cinnamon.  On the picture it also came with fruit and whip cream.  My fiancee's dessert showed up with fruit and whip cream, I got a dish on a plate and that was it.  The cinnamon, which was the part I was looking forward to the most, was nowhere to be found.  So when the server asked how dessert was, I was honest with her.  Without having to ask, she didn't charge for my dessert.

However, 2 drinks, 2 entrees and one dessert came to just shy of $90... for Mexican food.  

No need to go back.  To save myself a review, Cocina Lucero just south of Wellesley is owned by the same people.  Their menu is about the same except everything is a dollar more but not nearly as tasty."}
{"text":"On the last day of our visit to toronto we were in a particularly cranky mood. We had been screwed over at our previous restaurant choice, and now it was late and we were starving. We came upon La Mexican and figured ah what the hell!
The restuarant appeared slightly dive-y and quite small, we were seated in a booth by the window that was VERY small. 
They had imported beers for 5$ which is awesome, and we were served a basket of tortilla chips with two types of salsa.
I ordered the enchiladas and a side of refried beans. The beans were served in this cute edible cup which I liked. The enchiladas were decent but the rice was kind of stale tasting.
My boyfriend ordered the combo platter, A beef burrito, a cheese quesadilla, and a chicken enchilada. He loved his meal.
The pricing was fair and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"They were \"out of huevos rancheros\". What kind of Mexican restaurant runs out of beans, salsa and eggs?

Somehow, after hearing the news, I didn't walk out. What got me was the Cafe de Olla (Meican sweetened coffee) that was listed on the menu. Well, well.

My Cafe de Olla turned out to be a watery mug of twigs and flotsam that had nothing to do with cinnamon or nutmeg.

This did nothing to wash away the tinny taste of the canned salsa.

So I went to talk with the owner afterwards...you know,,,see where he's from and all. Well, don't take the \"authentic Mexican\" claim seriously..that's all I can say.

Even after a long day at Toronto Reference Library, save your pesos and go anywhere other than here."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner it was not bad. I ordered chicken taquitos, there was not really anything special about it. But, the limo soup was spectacular, lots of Favours. The staff were friendly, nice patio In front. 

Moreover, just your typical Mexican place."}
{"text":"While somewhat a long time ago that I ventured here, it will always stand out for me.  My then recently broken-up-with ex-gf and I were looking for some place to chew the fat and figure out what to do with the pieces of our broken hearts, when we found this quiet looking little place, North of Bloor.  

Weepy eyed and emotionally exhausted, we asked to sit on the back patio.  Very quiet and secluded, with a few groups sitting around quietly eating and chatting.  My ex and I set down and had a few glasses of beer.  The only \"Mexican\" beer they had was Corona.  Fail.  I had a wheat beer of sorts to quench the heat.

As we proceeded to stab each other with words and accusations, and the occasional fork, dusk fell over the already sombre patio.  

The food came, in the form of a chicken mole with a spicy black bean something.  As she started to open a can of worms about trust and honesty, I slid the first piece of chicken into my mouth and completely ignored her.  Tasty.  She then proceeded to start on about something about not listening to her enough, but I was seriously engorging myself with that chicken.  I looked up at her.
\"What?\"
\"I said you never listen to me anymore\"
\"Sure I do\"
\"Then what did I just say?\"
\"Something about trying my chicken.  Here, want a piece?\"
\"You're fucking hopeless\"

Onwards into my meal, I delved quite heartily.  I really don't remember what she had ordered, given that I was busy concentrating on my plate, and didn't really give a flying rat-fuck about what she choked down.  I'm sure it was good though.

Upon finishing up my meal, we argued a bit about who was going to pay, before settling on the idea of going Dutch.  We parted ways with a final \"fuck you\" and I quietly slipped a dose of LSD onto the top of her chapstick.  That'll teach her to tell me that I have no sense of reality."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I am a Mexican expat to Toronto and I am usually not impressed with Mexican restaurants and rather prefer preparing my own Mexican food. However today, September 16 (Dia de la Independencia-Mexican Independence day) I was feeling rather festive and found myself too lazy to cook Mexican. The hubbster suggested we treat ourselves and go to out for a Mexican dinner. We settled at La Mexicana after checking their menu online and comparing it against the other Mexican options near our place (Cocina Lucero, Burrito Bandidos and the new Como la casa) 

When we got there we were given a sit right away (did notice there were a bunch of of reserved tables and a few larger groups of people). The waitress brought totopos (tortilla chips) and a red and a green salsa, both of salsas were pretty average but free is free. After she gave us a special menu, which was rather decently priced but it had no items I was interested in. I asked for the regular menu and was told they were not serving of the usual menu, I said we would then skip, so the waitress said they would make an exception and serve us of the regular menu. I thought we had gotten off the wrong foot and was expecting to be disappointed. (We also saw a couple close to us asking for the regular menu and one of them was asking to have a particular item grilled instead of fried, to which the waitress reluctantly went to ask the manager, but ended up accommodating the request) 

We ordered the Tartitas de Jaiba (crab cakes) to share and I odered the tamalitos (pollo con rajas-chicken) and my husband ordered the combo plater (quesadilla-enchilada and burrito), We also ordered a strawberry margarita ($5 special) and a horchata glass. Oh boy was I impressed? the margarita was delicious, I could taste the tequila and it was blended which fresh strawberries, which was awesome. The horchata, which I got a sip of, was really good, it was not watery at all and was possibly the second best horchata I've ever tried , I was extremely impressed!. The crab cakes were a bit of a let down, as I didn't felt they were especial, I wish we had ordered the queso fundido with chorizo insead, but they weren't bad and they were very nicely presented. Then our main courses came and the portions were really generous. My tamales were moist and beautifully presented with a little red salsa on top and a side of beans and rice (the rice did come in a cube shape, but I can tell that it was NOT microwaved stuff, as another reviewer sugest, but it was rather just put on a glass with that shape; the beans were nicely refried and presented in a tortilla chip bowl). My husbands's meal was equally delicious, especially the burrito, which was not stuffed with rice and veggies, buth rather had some juicy and tender beef in authentic Mexican fashion. While we were finishing our dinner, a waiter came and offered us a complementary shot of the new tequila they are using (1800 I think), which was a very nice touch, especially given that a shot like that anywhere else would have been $3-5. I was really impressed, our waitress picked up that I was Mexican and was talking to me in Spanis, which is a bold move, but I liked, as most places will continue to address me in English even when I am obviously hispanic. She was attemptive and refilled out glasses with water as needed.

When the bill came, my margarita had been charged at regular price, which I told the waiter and she fixed immediatly. They also asked us if we wanted to sign for their email special alerts and get a free sweater for it, which was a bit weird but nice.

Overall I really enjoyed the meal. Yes it was on the higher range of prices, but I felt like it was worth it, especially considering the restaurant is steps away from posh yorkville, where food is pricey anyways. I believe I will definetly come back and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"A simple menu with some authentic and some not-so-authentic Mexican food. The decor is very colourful and vibrant, staff is friendly (and cute!) and the music is upbeat. I love the secluded patio in the back and the Micheladas ($8). The complementary chips and homemade salsa and salsa verde are really good but \"muy picante\". The fish tacos ($16) I had were battered (rather heavily), which is something I wasn't expecting. Nonetheless, they were hot and crispy as if they had come right out of the deep frier. This was one of those reviews hovering between 3-4 but I had a pleasant experience so I'll be generous."}
{"text":"Visited la Mexicana the night of March 27 @ around 6:30pm. The place was fairly busy and although we did not have reservations, we were seated without having to wait. We were a group of 3 and the restaurant was the suggestion of one of my dining companions, who has been here several times, and recommended it as she \"loves\" the place and it's in walking distance of her condo.

Myself and my partner were not so equally impressed.

The food is not authentic Mexican fare, but more along the lines of Tex-Mex...which is not a bad thing if you go in expecting to get Tex-Mex food. I had hoped a place called La Mexicana would be a bit more authentic, but hey...to each their own.

They start you with some tortillas and salsa (a creamy version, not a chunky kind that most people are used to). They were fresh and tasty.

One person ordered a pre fixed meal...soup, entree and dessert. It was reasonably priced at $20. The waiter came back about 5 minutes after taking her order to let her know that they were out of what she ordered, but he did offer her other more expensive options and would still charge her the pre fixed meal. Nice recovery but still....

Soup was Potato/Cauliflower, entree was a Tamalita (sp), I had no idea what the dessert was...looked like a creamy rice pudding. She liked it, which I suppose is the most important thing, as it was her meal.

Two of us each ordered the Sample Platter....it was $16 and contained: salad; black re-fried beans in a tortilla shell; enchilada (covered with a slightly spicy red sauce); shredded beef burrito (very, very, very, bland); and a cheese quesadela (sp).  It was good, not great. Everything was fairly bland other than the chicken enchilada.

Decor is ok....however our table was uneven and \"rocked\" whenever it was touched. Drove us crazy as we're \"elbow resters\"...

While I wasn't that thrilled with the place, I will give it another try and will enquire if the heat factor can be taken up a notch."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner.  Got there around 530 and it wasn't too busy.  Service was ok.  We ordered drinks, an app and our entrees.  After 30 minutes our entrees came but we never received our app.  When we told the server she said \"oh I guess I never put that through.  Do you want it now?\" Hum no thanks.  My husband got the steak which he said that really good.  I had the combo platter which was also good.  Server never stopped by to ask how our meal was.  Had the fried ice cream for dessert and my husband got the churros.  Both were great.  Total bill was with tip was under a hundred dollars.  Might try another location because I didn't think the service at this location was that great."}
{"text":"Delicious mexican cuisine at a reasonable price $$$. Rarely does authentic Mexican restaurants have tamales on the menu. La Mexicana's pork tamalitos were full of flavor and by far the best tamales I've ever eaten. The margaritas were weak and the decor was tacky but the food and service made up for what they lack."}
