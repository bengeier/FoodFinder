{"text":"i feel like im here all the time, i love this place, who knew something so simlpe can be soo goood, my favorite place in monroe!!!"}
{"text":"You cant get anything better! this is the go to place for Japanese food, always a meal to have on Fridays nights to relax from the work week. great food and friendly staff. You have to go and grab a plate of the hibachi chicken and shrimp with the brown ginger sauce, you will die and go to heaven after tasting such glorious food!"}
{"text":"The food is great HOWEVER the server was beyond rude; almost hateful!  I thought I was on a hidden camera it was that bad..... I WILL NEVER return here and would not recommend it to anyone!!!!!  If the staff doesn't want to be there maybe they should find somewhere else to go. RUDE!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here on the way back from an event.  Fam was in the mood for Asian food and the reviews looked promising.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  It's a limited menu, order at the counter, sit down, table service concept.  Food quality was good for the price point.  We tried the Hibachi chicken, Salmon salad, and Soba noodles.  At lunchtime on a weekend, restaurant was busy but not full.  Took about 10min from order taking to eating.  Everything came out hot and fresh.  The chicken was slightly on the dry side but not over cooked.  The sauces were flavorful and delivered on the side.  We had the ginger and shrimp sauces.  Both got a thumbs up.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, which kept the stars on the review. Water tasted funny and a hand full of flies buzzing around. These two factors removed this from having 5 stars. 

Hibachi chicken and spring rolls were on point. You will not be dissatisfied with the food taste for the price.   

Plenty of seating and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Japanese food that has been adapted to the American palate, this is the place to go!  The people are very friendly, and service is excellent.  I placed my order, thinking it would take at least ten minutes, but it was out in five!  On the other hand, if you're looking for authenticity, you might need to leave the Carolinas or find a really good hole-in-the-wall.

I give it three stars: It's good for what it is."}
{"text":"Yummm this place is the bomb! Its always out super quick when i call in for an order. The sweet tea is a little sweet but its good. A little expensive but i think very worth it. You get a lot of food. Overall this place is the best and everyone should give their salmon and rice a try. Definitely my fave."}
{"text":"Cheap!
Delicious!
Fast!
I order here alot of lunch runs from work. I grab the hibachi chicken - It is amazing! That shrimp sauce is the best thing ever!"}
{"text":"Great service always with a smile. My wife has been craving Koumi ever since she had our son. So when she sent me out for hibachi I went to the drive through and only waited two minutes and 24 seconds before I had delicious food and a happy wife. They also have a health score of 100."}
{"text":"Every time I drive past here there is a line of cars, so one day I decided to give it a try. I figured if that many people were eating there it must be good. I'm sorry to say I was disappointed to some degree. We ordered several of the items that are recommended on reviews, and found that nothing we ordered was any better than average. It was basically fast Chinese food that all basically tasted the same. Fortunately that taste was not horrible, which is why I've given it three stars. If I had to eat there again, I would but I don't think I would voluntarily go there given many other options nearby."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here.  The food is constant and the service is fast and friendly! Pricing isn't too bad.  They give you a lot to eat."}
{"text":"The drive thru was fast! 

Served really good teriyaki chicken! Went through the drive thru to bring home to eat for dinner and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Not bad! Good food for a good value. Shrimp was slightly over cooked, considering this is an established restaurant...they should work on that. But, other than that minor detail my family and I enjoyed the food!"}
{"text":"This was the first Japanese place in Monroe of this style (quick hibachi). We have been going here since High School, and it is consistently good.

This past time we came here after a winery day, hangry (so hungry you're angry). We all desperately needed food, and I suggested it trying to think of something that would really hit the spot, and be quick and cheap. I got the hibachi shrimp. For $8 it can't be beat. You don't get a soup or salad, but you get plenty of rice, mushrooms, and shrimp (I opted out of the carrots). 

The service is quick, and the people are nice. If you get the chance, give Koumi a try."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are friendly. They give you a good portion of food for the price. They have a drive-thru which is great for on the run people."}
{"text":"First off- I am so very sad they are closed on Mondays!!! But let's move on. This place is the bomb!! I've ordered ahead and then picked up and I've ordered in the drive thru- both times were super fast! They are nice. The food is great for a fast hibachi dinner. It's huge as well!! And they give you a massive cup of shrimp sauce  So glad I live nearby!! We will be frequent guests."}
{"text":"Best fast food Japanese I've EVER had. Good food. Clean restaurant. Great servers. Best shrimp sauce and homemade ginger dressing! 
And if you are in a hurry they serve their awesome food at a drive through too! Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem, I'm glad I decided to stop in. I travel between Charlotte and Wilmington on a regular basis and I've made a habit of grabbing dinner here. I wish they had a location in Charlotte!

The food is delicious, fast, and cheap!! I tried the drive thru the other night and ordered \"fast entree #1,\" grilled veggies with fried rice and steamed carrots...all for under five dollars. :]"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Koumi in Durham, NC and I was an instant fan. Therefore, seeing this restaurant in Monroe, NC brought me utter joy. This location does not disappoint. The service is fantastic, they are quick, and food is as good as ever.

In general, Koumi tends to be more of a casual atmosphere. It is not the type of hibachi joint where the chef will cook it in front of you but the food still comes out piping hot. If you dine in, you will place your order at the register and then they will bring the food to your table. 

The food tastes and looks fresh, especially the  veggies and the shrimp. They also have this amazing carrot side that comes with the combination plates. The carrots are slightly sweet and oh so delicous. The price is comparable to a typical asian dish. I usually order the combination plate with chicken and shrimp for ~$12. The portion is large so I will tend to have leftovers or leave super stuffed.

Cannot wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I always come here when I visit NC. I ate here a lot in high school and now years later they're still delicious. The food comes fast and well portioned which I love because it guarantees zero food waste. The staff is friendly and courteous"}
{"text":"My absolute go-to for express hibachi!  There is always a line in the drive-thru, but that speaks to how popular this place is!  And the line goes quickly since their service is on point.  My food is always fresh and delicious every time I go there.  They cook the veggies just right and the meat is never overdone.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for many years and the food and service is always consistently good. I always get take out so I can't comment on the inside of the restaurant but the drive thru is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first time here , we order chicken & scallop combo it comes with soup or salad and the drink is separate. All together it was 15$ witch was a good price, the food was pretty good but the soup tasted funny it was different from other soups we've had at different expresses & japanese steakhouse. The service was great."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for the last ten years and it Never disappoints, staff is always polite and food is always great."}
{"text":"The customer service is very good. sometimes it is hit or miss, but I would pick this place over any other Chinese, Japanese, Hibachi place in Monroe"}
{"text":"Inexpensive for the portion size and everything tasted great! Carrots are sweet and soft, not typical of stir fry."}
{"text":"Koumi is easily one of my favorite restaurants to eat at. Their service is excellent, sanitation is always above a 95%, and the food is consistantly on point every time. Koumi has great quality food and you'll get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Koumi Express is a hibachi fast food joint in Monroe.  We've tried a similar one in Charlotte called Tokyo One, and the verdict is that Koumi is better.
It's a bit more up service (5/5) as you counter order but the food is brought to you as are your drinks, salads and soups, if your meal came with the latter two.  
The food was excellent (5/5) and we had steak and shrimp and I had something called a \"Side of hibachi steak\" which was perfect for me as it only came with the steak and some broccoli. 
The service was fast and they are very attentive (5/5).
The name may have express in it but it only relates to the service speed as the hospitality made you feel like you could take your time."}
{"text":"Great value ($10 for dinner). Tasty food (I had hibachi steak with white rice and unsweetened tea). Fast and friendly service (a food runner even refilled my drink, brought me a side of steak, and handled payment on the additional order)."}
{"text":"I love this place food and service are always good. No MSG unlike most similar places. Best deal for hibachi food $"}
{"text":"On my way to myrtle beach I was in for some hibachi so I stopped by.  I figure it was all the same hibachi but this place is amazing.  Their house shrimp sauce is cooked crack!!!! Everything was so tasteful and I will stop by here every time I'm in Monroe!  We need a good place like this in Charlotte.  I got the hibachi steak and scallops with noodles.  It comes with broccoli and carrots.  best hibachi I ever had.  Their price is just right also.  Pretty cheap for hibachi in my opinion cause everywhere I go it's $20 for a small plate."}
{"text":"Food is good and pretty fast. Servers are polite and attentive. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. You can also call in an order and pick up in the drive through. It's \"fast food hibachi,\" but I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best shrimp sauce ever- I grew up in this town and every time I come to visit I have to get my koumi fix- still have yet to find a better hibachi place then this and doubt I ever will! Koumi is the best by far!"}
{"text":"Always a good place for Japanese.  The sweet tea is great, the food is always consistently good.  The sushi is great as well.  We always get our food to go, so don't know about the service inside, but they are quick and efficient.  

A great place and good portions."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. The food is consistently fresh and great tasting. 
The service is great too. If you like terriyaki chicken, you will want to try it at this restaurant. Prices are reasonable and the drive through service is fast."}
{"text":"First off, great customer service and clean, well-lighted space. I went with the teriyaki steak and it was just okay. It wasn't anything out of this world. The steak was overcooked. The shrimp sauce didn't have a kick and tasted watered down. Since we're on the topic of water, don't get the cup of water. It seriously tasted like sink water. Overall, the customer service and atmosphere was the best part. It wouldn't hurt to stop by if you are craving hibachi."}
{"text":"Been coming here for ten years. Great food with fast and friendly service. Haven't had anything I didn't like. The grilled salmon is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great prices and delicious food!!! And I also got a card where your 7th meal is free!!!! 
Also it's right on hwy 74 and close to a stop light so you're not stuck in traffic for a while. 
Great place def would recommend to stop by"}
{"text":"Outstanding, exceeded our expectations. The Food was fresh and the service was fast .  Try the egg Rolls as a app, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"If you're looking for quick, tasty Japanese dishes in Monroe, this is the place. I've been here numerous times. It's located in the same shopping center as the Regal Union Square 8 movie theater. Their teriyaki chicken hits the spot (under $6). Good amount of chicken, veggies & rice. They add on the side these steamed carrots that kick a$$. I really love the shrimp sauce too. I'm sure it's just some combination of ketchup & mayo and maybe a few other ingredients but it is tasty and it goes really well with the dishes.

They have on the menu some express dishes which can be put together in just a few minutes. I've used the drive thru to order those before. Works great. Everything else, I'd go inside to get. The staff is friendly too!"}
{"text":"Hey if you guys like a Japanese quickie........ this is your place located right here in monroe.  Yep there is many other places all over charlotte but in monroe its just a great place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Wish they still had the sushi menu. I've tried the chicken, shrimp and steak hibachi options and the fried rice and they are all delicious. As far as noodles, they are too thin. But overall a must try if you haven't gone yet."}
