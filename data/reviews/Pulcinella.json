{"text":"Not impressed.  The food was mediocre at best.  The acoustics was horrible ... we had to yell across the table to hear each other.  I had the ravioli and it was under cooked and hard.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in the neighbourhood. We have had some great meals here and I would have rated it higher except it isn't always consistent. It is one of my go-to places for a nice lunch or dinner.   The service has always been good and the ambience is nice."}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant for a few years since we moved into the neighborhood, but today we finally made the leap and checked it out.   The food was superb!!! Very fresh tasting and authentic. Beautiful atmosphere, small and romantic. Staff also very warm and attentive.   Our new favorite spot in south etobicoke!"}
{"text":"I am more and more impressed with this place. This evening was excellent starting with our Ã¼ber knowledgeable waiter, Giovanni.  He offered specifics on how the food was prepared and the various wine pairings with each of our meal choices. I was very impressed.    This evening my dinner date started off with the Carpaccio and arugula salad with pine nuts and I has a simple salad. For mains I has the Cioppino, a seafood stew with pastina pasta. I had it the last time I was here but needed to have it again.  The broth was perfection!  My partner had the house feature which was Bison rib steak with Brocoletti.  There wasn't much left on his plate and he said it was outstanding.  The bottle of wine we chose on recommendation from Giovanni was Blazon from California.  This Pinot noir was so yummy and I could have easily had more ..... Burb!  We didn't have dessert but the feature was Zeppole and any proper Italian would know that Zeppole is a treat this time of year. I kind is regret not getting them.  I am liking this place more and more and I feel taken care of when I come here.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"After finishing my last Italian class for the season and in preparation for my trip to Rome, I decided to have some good Italian food. The issue is that the weather was crappy and I was not willing to drive much and go to my favourite Italian places so I decided to go to Pulcinella.  Pulcinella is located on Lake Shore West and it is surrounded by some run down businesses, a pain centre, and a convenience store. It is not the prettiest part of Lake Shore but if you walk a bit more to the west you will find Woody's Burger and Burrito Boyz. Not that will get prettier, but it will get tastier.  The decor was nice and on the contemporary side. Wooden tables, white table cloths, pictures of italian landscape and stone on the walls. The list goes on...  The service was attentive and extremely polite.  The bread was delicious! I had the papperdelle ortolana, a pasta dish with sweet sausage, peas, asparagus, and leek, tossed in a wine creamy sauce. The food was tasty and good, not exceptionally good.  Will I return to Pulcinella? Of course I will! The have reliable comfort food."}
{"text":"Based on the previous 4 stars of this restaurant, we invited friends to lunch on a Thursday. There was no lunch menu, just the regular menu. The grilled calamari had the grill flavour but was chewy. The accompanied chopped vegetables was minuscule. The arugala salad while tasty had no visible blue cheese or candied nuts. And then came the Margarita Pizza.  If I didn't have guests, I would have insisted on being presented to the chef who allowed such a horrible pizza to leave his kitchen.  It was by far the worst pizza I have ever had. What did they do to the crust? It was like soggy toast and the topping was was so thin it could have been sprayed on. Thank you yelp. Hope this review keeps someone from making my mistake"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday in May and since then I have had the opportunity to go back on two other occaisions- once with a girlfriend & once on business.   It is a bit of a splurge if you do the appie, entree, dessert & wine however; the food is so good I don't mind."}
{"text":"Had a late Friday night dinner there with the girlfriend recently. Walked in without reservations and didn't have to wait for a table, but the restaurant was medium busy with one large group and a couple of regular sized tables. It was a cold night though, so during the warmer months, it might be a little busier.  The wait staff were super helpful, recommended beers for us when our first choice was out of stock.  For the appetizer platter, I have the salami board, which featured a bunch of different types of cured meats with olives and a large portion of chunks of parmesan reggiano. The house made duck breast prosciutto was crazy delicious.  I have the daily special, a huge Fred Flintsone sized bison steak. I wasn't too familiar with the meat so the waiter recommended the best temperature to cook it to for me. All of the sides were delicious.  The prices were high, but the food was not just better than anything else you would find in the area, it was incredible. Will visit again."}
{"text":"We were so happy when this place popped up in our neighbourhood early this year! It stands out as they gave a complete facelift to the outside of the restaurant. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff are incredibly friendly! We splurged on our meal but it was well worth it for the quality of the food. The menu is seasonal, so see what's available when you're in, I'm sure it'll be delicious, and the staff will be more than willing to offer up some recommendations. Go for the antipasti tray to start - fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food/service is 5*!! Great selection of wine too. You're going to pay for the food and service though. A bit over priced and that's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. I do recommend going here if you want to be treated well and munga like a king!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place at first, but cannot find a reason to go there any longer. It is really, really overpriced for the quality of food they provide.  Last time my pizza was so burned on the bottom, it was charcoal black and bitter. And things like that happen quite often there - which is unfortunate, is it's one of the few places with a summer patio in the ares (and I love Italian restos... but not this one)  Now I go there only if I am dragged by friends."}
{"text":"Surprisingly the south Etobicoke neighbourhood of Longbranch, while up and coming, still doesn't have many \"nice\" places to go for a date night, so when we discovered Pulcinella for the first time after moving near the area we were thrilled!   It's located near 37th and Lakeshore and is trendy looking spot that doubles as an event space with a main dining room and a smaller private dining space in the basement.   It's the type of place where the owner or one his son personally come around each night to ensure you're having a good time. An element of service that isn't as common these days.   Occasionally on the weekend you might be lucky enough to catch some live entertainment in the form of classic Italian guitar or accordion music. Again a GREAT date night spot for you and your special someone.   Every menu item I've had here has been fantastic (and I've only had appetizers, salads and pastas). My favourite pasta is the CINGHIALE ($19.00 ) which is 3 hr braised ragu of farm raised Boar meat and red wine, with fresh rigatoni & shaved cacciocavallo cheese. Mamma Mia what a dish! That fresh rigatoni literally bounces across your tongue and the rage is so flavourful I typically continue to eat 5-10 bites after I'm full!   Admittedly I'm a creature of habit so I've had this dish on 2/3 of my visits but this past weekend we went for a special dinner out and I stepped outside my comfort zone and went for their Atlantico ($25.00) which is fettucini \"alla Carbonara\" with pancetta, egg yolk, parmigiano & black pepper with Fresh Atlantic Lobster Meat. Yes. Lobster meat AND Italian Bacon in one of the creamiest sauces I've ever had in Carbonara dish. Omg. It's so good I've been feverishly scouring the internet for a duplicate recipe so I can make it at home for friends and family... but until I find one, I'll just bring them here.   One last item of note is their Caesar salad, which is uncut full pieces of Romain lettuce which is less creamy and more... fresh, if I had to use a word to describe it, than any other Caesar salad I've ever had before.   They do have an extensive wine list as well and I think in future that I might just order bottles because the per glass prices are a bit expensive for 6 oz. Which is odd because the rest of the menu is such good value for money.   Good news as well, they took over the restaurant next door and after a length renovation are about to open a wine and tapas bar with small sharing plates. I can't wait.   Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"We live in the hood and four friends and I dined there during Summerlicious.  As disappointing as my previous experiences with my husband, who actually doesn't mind the place but I think that's mainly because our hood has very little competition.  My salad was blaze', the trout cooked perfectly but had no sauce, herbs or anything to add flavour, the faro the same.  Two others had the chicken and they left half as it was dry and chewy, when we mentioned this - politely - it was shrugged off.   Our server/manager was almost condescending when we first arrived when he started explaining the wines to us.. believe me we look like seasoned wine drinkers :)    Previous meals have been less than adequate in my mind, tasteless Bolognese, underdone pizza, mediocre salads..not to mention it's over priced.... I don't care what my hubby says, I'm not going back.  there are better places even in our hood."}
{"text":"This place is a gem along Lake Shore. Living in Woodbridge I have to say this is one of the best Italian restaurant I have eaten at. The food is quick fresh and tasty. Appetizers are quite intriguing I had the polenta and it was delicious. I have been there twice and for some reason it is half to almost empty not sure why it is a bit pricey but well worth the money. Service is quite good as well."}
{"text":"The food was really good! But the price you pay for it is not something that someone might be happy about. Maybe for some people who wish to splurge then go for it. Its not the best Italian restaurant out there but the ambiance is quite convincing! Servers are friendly and helpful. I just think they need to re evaluate their pricing considering the location their serving at."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Pulcinella for dinner tonight.  We were a tad anxious about bringing our 4 month old with us, because it looked like a rather fancy place.  There was no need for that, as the staff adored our baby!    The restaurant was very nicely decorated with beautiful paintings of Italy and of course, Pulcinella (the Comedia Dell Arte character.)  There was a man playing guitar, singing lovely Italian songs in the background. He took breaks to come over and strum for our daughter.  They started our meal with delicious bread in olive oil and olives to the side.  I'm not a huge bread fan, but we asked for a second plate to go with our appetizer of burrata cheese (accompanied by melons, arugula and onions).  Oh my goodness, the burrata was melt in your mouth goodness!!!  It is made in house.  If you have not tried burrata and like buffalo mozzarella, brie or other soft cheeses you should order it.  I think it's my new favourite food.  For mains, I ordered the Pulcinella pizza and my husband ordered a sausage pasta. Both were perfect.  We accompanied our meals with birra theresianer. We both preferred the blonde to the amber.  We will be trying to find it at the LCBO.  Overall, this was probably the best Italian meal I have ever had (and I stayed with a family in Italy for a week, experiencing 'mom's home cooking' so I do not say that lightly!)  I noticed Pulcinella won the \"Gem of the Lakeshore\" award and I can certainly see why."}
{"text":"This place is retarded, always empty, looks more like a funeral home. the patio is crazy if you want to eat and inhale exhaust fumes by the road. hmmm most of these reviews are from the employed staff lol anyhow will never eat there. besides the iconic sign with the face looks like  someones butt!"}
{"text":"Italian food made fresh, with the love and care we found in Italy. The wait staff is competent and friendly, the kitchen is fabulous, and the house red wine is a beautiful Montpolicella Abruzzo. They treated us very well from the moment we entered, and I can't say enough good things about the food and service.  We went on our 5th anniversary; there happened to be a couple celebrating their 50th anniversary--the staff treated both tables and parties well. Our waiter was charming and efficient; the guitar player was enjoyable, never too obtrusive but always providing enjoyable music. When he learned that my wife was of French descent (from our waiter, who was himself from southern France), he played a traditional French song that my wife thoroughly enjoyed hearing. The decorations and ambiance on the upper floor (where we ate) are cozy without being too dark; the downstairs dining room is much darker, but would still be fairly cozy.  We had the Semplice salad (fresh, crisp), the soft polenta (amazing, and a must try), the Carmela pizza, and the butternut squash and mascarpone ravioli. For dessert, we tried Lella's Decadent Plate and it was tremendous. (We were also able to try the tiramisu because the staff gave us a piece of tiramisu in honour of our anniversary. A definite win in the customer service department.)  The prices are in line with the quality, freshness, and service you receive."}
{"text":"Winterlicious baby! Love the location, decor and atmosphere. Very happy with the house wines, though frankly the wine menu is generally beyond my budget. And the food overall is honestly as good as you'd want it to be, so I'll get that out of the way early because it really is the most important thing in my opinion.  Pulcinella came very highly recommended by a friend. It's relatively new to the area but has already established itself well from what I gather. I just wish the overall experience had lived up to the hype. Two \"areas for improvement\".  First, the table we were seated at was quite near the kitchen and tilted diagonally to fill an awkward space around a support column. Not even remotely a dealbreaker, but disappointing (especially since the wait staff were back and forth right behind us all night and the kitchen was pretty loud -- seemed like they were having fun back there). We didn't complain, even though we'd had the reservation made for two weeks and probably were entitled to a quieter table. (There were some available, had we asked, but by that same measure, why couldn't we have had one of those tables right off the bat?)  Second, our server pretty much phoned it in. He mixed up our first course, made an error on our desserts (then charged us for it even though it was part of the Prix Fixe menu), spilled cracked pepper into my water glass and seemed to be trying to avoid eye contact. It became a bit of a joke how consistently he'd look around the room instead of at our table while placing something down or taking something away. I imagine (hope) it was just a bad habit, but at times I wondered what it meant. Was he uncomfortable? Judgy? Distracted? We'll never know! (And the rest of the staff were great, so maybe it was just this guy.)  As for the food, I had the vitello tonato and the mushroom risotto, with creme brulee to finish. My friend had the octopus terrine with the beef bolognese and gelato. She did remark that the gelato had more of an ice cream consistency, and I found the risotto just a tad heavy on the truffle oil. But on the whole it was delicious, paired very well with their house red wine which I would give ANYTHING to be able to buy at the LCBO. (COME ON PEOPLE GET ON THAT.)  So, I don't think Winterlicious was the best way to experience Pulcinella for the first time. I don't think we saw them at their best, service-wise. I'll certainly give them another go when I can order whatever I like. At the Winterlicious price, it was indeed an  excellent experience. At the regular menu prices? Well, I'd probably have asked for a new table. And tipped less than 15%.  4 out of 5 stars, taking into account the value of the Winterlicious price and minus 1 star for the service and 0.125 star for the disruption caused by the proximity of our table to key work areas. (But it's statistically insignificant so I still rounded back up to 4.)"}
{"text":"It's been 20 mins....stillllll waiting for someone to come by to take my order... Recommended by the owner's friend to try this restaurant....and I'm ready to walk out... And they're not even busy.  Finally ordered, and got my pizza. I ordered a very simple pizza of fior di latte cheese (which costs more - but it's delicious), sauce, pepperoni and mushroom. Hoping it to taste like beautiful Famoso Pizza, but of course it doesn't :( So Mr. Waitor comes back and tells me they don't have anymore fior di latte......fine :( Then he tells me there's no pepperoni either....ok I get it, it's an italian place, so I'm good with soppressata.  Then I get the pizza, and they also put this chunks of fat on it which they called sausage...which I never asked for. I only agreed to the soppressata as it's the italian version of pepperoni.  Then I get the bill, and I'm charged for the most expensive pizza ....  Never going back, wish I never went."}
{"text":"Really not sure why this place isn't getting good reviews.  We went there for summerlicous but decided to just order off the menu.  Everything we had was great and fresh.  Starters: Grilled calamari with sauteed tomatoes.  This was absolutely delicious, the calamari was cooked perfectly and the sauce was super tasty.  Main: Pizza and pasta - Pasta was amazing, they cooked it to perfection and both me and the wifey were fighting over the last bite.  Pizza - was good, think crust, tasty toppings.  All in all a nice meal.  I'm also not sure why this place is rated with 4 $$$$, it's really not that expensive.  Maybe having lived downtown we are accustomed to meals costing around $20...  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for a family dinner. The service was excellent with a very friendly atmosphere. The decor was very nice. I had the pasta which I did enjoy, my wife had the steak which was mediocre. There is no children's menu."}
{"text":"So happy to find this gem of a restaurant in our new neighborhood. The food is amazing, you can really taste the flavours of the fresh herbs and ingredients. Unlike some other Toronto fine Italian restaurants, this place uses real olive oil and does not douse everything in butter for flavour and didn't mask the taste of the dish with an overdose of cheese.  I started with the delicious lamb skewers and had the gnocchi for main (also yummy). The house wine was a perfect compliment for both my main and my fiancÃ©'s pene bolognese.  Our waiter Julien was courteous, friendly and knowledgeable. We will be back for years to come."}
{"text":"It was pretty good but not worth the amount of hype it gets.  It was nice for them to have a live jazz band but to tell you the truth, it was too loud for me.  The restaurant is quite small and cozy but when you have a live band in there, I felt it was overwhelming in terms of the sound from the band.  My wife and i had to really raise our voices to hear one another and so did the waitress.  I think if the sound was mixed right and lowered by at least 10-15 db it would have been a more pleasant experience.  I do audio and understand the challenges.  In regards to our food, my pasta was a little too al dente and i didn't want to raise a stink about it but i did mention it to the server.  She mentioned another customer had the same complaint a moment ago before us."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner at Pulcinella during the Summerlicious event which I strongly recommend. It's within walking distance from my house, Friday, summer night, birthday... just perfect! Good thing we had a reservation because the place was packed!! I think we took the last table for 2 (they have a nice patio too). Service was impecable! Our server was quite the character... French, had lived in Brazil and Mexico, spoke like 5 languages, very funny and charming, he knew the menu extremely well. The food was amazing! Perfect temperature, perfect texture, delicate flavours, authentic Italian, very nice! We ordered a bottle of Italian red wine and: Appetizers: beef carpaccio / arugula and strawberry salad Main: veal ragu / seafood pasta Dessert: tiramisu / fruit tart Summerlicious was $29 per person + the wine, so it was awesome!"}
