{"text":"Solid food, solid service, TVs are everywhere for you sports folks, good selection of adult beverages.  EDIT: They don't allow firearms, even if you are not drinking."}
{"text":"you definitely lost me as a customer. my friend and i went in on a Sunday afternoon  specifically for the veggie tray. We sat outside considering it was a beautiful day. We waited 15 minutes, while flagging down  the waitress. she completely ignored us. the people at the table next to us noticed her ignoring us and said they would ask her to come over to us when she returned to their table with their drinks. Still, she continued to ignore us. Then I proceeded to tell the hostess and she did not seem very concerned and said she would send someone over. We waited another five minutes, still no service. So, we left. that is SO ridiculous! never again will i return to this place. That was the absolute worst customer service and made us feel very unwelcome."}
{"text":"Much more open floor plan than old Southern location. Flat panel TVs everywhere. All sports shown, including boxing, UFC, and WWE ppvs. Draft beer selection not as vast as some other sports bars and drinks can be somewhat pricey. Still one of my favorite hang outs in the east valley."}
{"text":"Loyal customer at the Stapley location for several years. Went to watch UFC fights and discovered my location was sold. Sign in the window directed us to the Superstition Springs Blvd location. I arrived and the place was packed. Got on a waiting list and were told we would get a table. Waited over an hour and watched as a table got their checks and paid but didn't leave. I am a diabetic and was reaching decision time to figure out if we had to go elsewhere. I politely approached the table and inquired if the people where planning to stay for the fights. An employee named Barry immediately came over to me and told me I couldn't speak to people, he insisted I told the people to leave which I did not. He then decided we would not get a table. We always loved the food, but this was too much insult to bear. I will never return as I have never before been so insulted. Barry made assumptions then acted on them. Even while he was accusing me I remained respectful to him, but feel that respect was only one sided.  I feel bad for the crew that is now a combination of Stapley and Superstition employees, the place is a madhouse in dire need of management to help them turn tables. We witnessed several parties leave because they were delayed in giving checks, bussing tables etc.  Update: Barry mentioned above tried to add a \"compliment\" on my account and said I am \"only a keyboard warrior.\"  Though I remained respectful and stuck to facts in my review, he felt it was necessary to turn to a personal attack.  Is this how RT O'Sullivan's wants their managers to represent their company.  It has been more than a year and a half since our bad experience and I have yet to return.  The franchise lost a loyal group of customers, but we found a better place with exceptional wait staff.  Go to Cogburns on Val Vista instead of here."}
{"text":"Used to have a great time there - service was good because they came to know us pretty well when we started showing after Friday softball for karaoke.  Unfortunately, the  Karaoke host has gotten a bit...comfortable.  In his defense, I did flip him the bird.  In my defense, he gave us \"10 seconds\" to get our friend out of the bathroom because he won the karaoke raffle draw, and I thought he knew us well enough to know that if I have a big smile on my face, don't take it so personally.  However, as a karaoke host, you should NEVER get on the microphone and start announcing that you think a customer has \"no class\" - pull them aside, etc. C'mon - Show some professionalism!  What makes you think I'd want to return there when that's how you treat people?"}
{"text":"I've been having a taste for fish and chips for a week or so now. I seen the words \"Irish Pub\" under the name of the restaurant and figured they should serve fish and chips. Walked in the staff was great, everyone was very friendly. This was a Thursday night so not so busy, but you could tell the few locals were there at the bar. Ordered my fish and chips, my husband had the recommended Ruben on Rye with Sauerkraut and we have to say the food was excellent! Service was quick, I received my food before I finished my dinner salad, the food was hot, and fresh. The prices are fair and the portions are more than enough. If I'm ever in Gilbert again and craving some Irish pub specialities, R.T. O'Sullivan's will be my first choice!"}
{"text":"Draft list is weak no Stouts and very limited IPAs. Cheese Steaks were mediocre no cheese whiz. Waitress gave me a funny look when we ordered at Bloody Marys at 1630 she seemed very confused.. I really enjoyed their selection of music on the Jukebox though. Very sports orientated TV stations where the Futurama ? Lol!"}
{"text":"Poor management and inconsistent pricing. Be aware prices you may see on the table menus may not match your bill. We had this happen to us and the manager was very childish about it."}
{"text":"The guys that work here rude and sad treat people with lack of respect I feel sorry for our snow birds who come to our  great city"}
{"text":"My favorite  sports bar in town!!! Sexy ladies in the house was so nice and always put attention on customer. Great special price for drinks and the best part they  serving tea in here for comfort!!!"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting our son from CA and found this place in our hotel parking lot! Food was very good! Fresh and hot! We were very pleased! Ordered the queso and chips to start (it was flavorful and hot), then had the chicken sandwich with bacon and Swiss! Definitely would recommend! The staff was very nice and attentive! Kaylie was our server and she took great care of us!"}
{"text":"Visited R.T O'Sullivans for the first time tonight with my boyfriend and was not disappointed. It was very busy but we were seated quickly and didn't have to wait long for our server. I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the O'Connell burger with nachos as an appetizer. I tried the sauce on the Buffalo chicken sandwich and couldn't eat it due to it being too spicy for me. Our waitress was very nice and understanding when I asked for something else. I ended up with the Philly cheese steak. All of our food was phenomenal. Everything down to the chili on my boyfriends chili cheese fries to the chips in the nachos. We don't get to go out very often and this was the perfect pick. I plan on going back every chance I get."}
{"text":"The food good was ok. I had the fish n chips and wasn't impressed. Our potato skins appetizer was pretty good. It is a good place to watch sports. They have a lot of tvs. Our server was nice but the overall service was just ok. We'll probably go back just because they have multiple tvs to watch football but won't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat outside seating !!!!!! Staff was in training ok service !!!!!! You can also bet on the horse races !!!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to check this place out. Love me some sports grill & pubs.  The restaraunt is average. Probably the best thing about it is that the booths have dedicated LCD TVs for viewing your games. Heck, you can even change the channels. The food is nothing special, but does the trick.   We ended up going to watch an ASU football game, as well as a UFC event. The place was packed, and service was pretty slow (considering the other restaraunts I've been to during sporting events).   If you're looking for a place to be loud, and watch sporting events with the volume turned up, this place is for you. Food is cheap, and the the staff seems to be friendly."}
{"text":"R.T. O'Sullivans and places like it are the reason people pretty much just stay home.  Terrible service, overpriced drinks and an atmoshere that makes watching paint dry seem exciting. Three dollars for a 14 oz draft? And thats when you can get the bar wench to acknowledge your existance. Oh, and you will need to go to the bar for a drink because the high school mentality wait staff are too engrossed in each others dialog to realize they actually work there.  Short of a pool table this place has nothing to offer."}
{"text":"last weekend I was in town and we had a great time at rt O'Sullivan. food was great, special and staff was outstanding, highly recommended"}
{"text":"Just stopped in by chance, it was close to the hotel.  Great sports bar, lots of tv's, even outside.  Good service, fish and chips were Awesome! Very large place, easy to get seated, people very friendly...."}
{"text":"The service at this place is top notch- great place to hang out with your friends. Will definitely return- again and again."}
{"text":"Not a true beer connoisseur, so I ordered my stand-by Corona Light...and it was perfectly chilled and served just bottle (no glass) with a healthy looking lime (too many bars, restaurants serve them dried out or tinged w/ brown, bleck!).  50 points to Gryffindor!  Hot wings were okay, not on par with the Vine or Zipps, but serviceable and I would order them again.  Maybe order 1 stop above hot because they weren't hot.  Nearly every other place not the Vine or Zipps I would never order wings again, so 25 points to Gryffindor for the wings.  Shepherd's pie tasty.  Have truly not had enough to know if RT's is any good, but I liked it.  Hubbie's chicken sandwich looked good too and I think he liked it.    RT's is big, w/ tons of TVs, including one at your table. WIth that viewing potential, we will be checking it out when football starts back up.  If it lives up to the viewing potential, it will be a great place to alternate with Zipps."}
{"text":"Good food. Fairly priced. Beer selection well the server had to ask the bartender? Kind of weird? They should know what's on tap. (Ya think) all in all good place for social gatherings and family time"}
{"text":"If you like seriously greasy bar food. Go here. Everything is deep fried and lacks freshness or any imagination whatsoever. If you like a dull, quiet sports bar atmosphere..go here.  Want a fun and friendly, lively sportsbar? Don't go here. The best part of this place is the beer selection. The drinks are expensive.  I spent TWELVE with a tip for a mid shelf tequila shot on the rocks. The bartenders are usually snobs and aloof, but the waitresses are very nice.  Have visited 3 times now once with four of us, and then twice just two of us at the bar for boxing and they didn't have the sound on in the main bar area.  I'm done until I hear they OVERHAUL the menu and hire someone who can use something in the kitchen other than a FRYER. Suggestion: to change the table set ups to get a FUN vibe going in the big room where all of the good TVs are located. This place is ok if you bet the horses OTB and like it quiet.  I like a lively sports bar with decent food."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sporting events. Anywhere you turn there is a TV!! This is a true bar with bar food. On the menu is the typical variety, bacon cheese burger, fish & chips and the famous grilled reuben. I enjoyed my reuben and the others said the same of theirs.  If you want a place with the game on, this is it! Food was served hot & tasty, you can not go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great food. We had BLT, Dublin dip and a Reuben. Everything was good. Great atmosphere. Only negative thing, out waitress was not friendly... However that won't stop us coming back to watch Sunday football!"}
{"text":"Great for watching sports! Had the Club Sandwich which was very good. Big enough to share. On the breakfast menu the corn beef hash is nice chunks of chopped brisket - very good!  Service has always been good and there are daily specials and happy hour prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a glass of wine, late Sunday afternoon.  The waitress was extremely pleasant, but obviously had way too many tables, as it took almost a half an hour to be served our wine.  The place had a good crowd, but I only counted three wait persons for the large restaurant.  It obviously was not enough wait people for the football crowd.  I would suggest to the manager that he needs more wait people.  I am not sure that we will return."}
{"text":"The patio was nice,  but don't expect to get good service when you sit there. Took over 15 mins before we got our drinks even ordered.  Everyone finished our drinks before our lunch order was take.  An hour later the food finally came out. It wasn't really hot and looked like it had been sitting out for a while. The server said they had a large party come in. So she was spending her time with them and forgot out the people outside. There was 4 tables outside and we all complained.  The food was not worth the wait"}
{"text":"Good people, great beer, tasty food.  Everything I have had here is a couple steps above \"bar food\".  Can't believe it's my first check in... I have been here many times..."}
{"text":"In town on a business trip and tried this place out because it was super close to my hotel. It was a Tuesday night and the place was half full.....but all senior citizens. Nothing wrong with that but was almost like I walked into bingo night at the moose lodge. If that was the case I would have been game but it wasn't the case.   They have decent happy hour prices on beer and certain food items. Changes each day during the week. I tried the beef sliders which were \"meh\" and my server literally disappeared at one point. I wasn't in a rush so I hung out for a while but it got to the point where I had to ask another server for the check."}
{"text":"Service for us today was good. Decor and a million TVs are cool. It's the food that kills this place.  We sent the pizza back as impossible to eat. My meatloaf was plastic mashed potatoes,  processed slabs of meatloaf, and tasteless frozen vegatables. Honestly I've had better Hungry Hunter TV meals.   If you want to watch a game and chase a cold beer then great. If your hungry then stop off at a fast food chain before you arrive. The guacamole and chips was fair btw."}
{"text":"Went to RT O'Sullivan's for lunch for my first time. My draught beer was warm and skunky, I sent it back. Ordered their special Dublin Dip, which was horrible. My stomach is in such a knot. Now I'm \"Doublin\" over with heart burn. I will not return."}
{"text":"Served watered down tequila and tried to say it was because they were cold and found out they were watered down because they let it sit in ice.  Then shorted us wings on three different orders.  When we complained the manager argued with us!  Bad customer service and disappointing help by the manager!  I will never return to this bar!"}
{"text":"I'm one of those people that typically doesn't write reviews, I just read them. But this place was so terrible I felt compelled to do so. THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.  We went in for lunch on a Tuesday around 12:30pm. Our waitress took our drink order, brought the drinks, and never came back. It wasn't even busy. There were five other tables and people at the bar.  After 20 minutes I had to leave my table to go find someone.   Once the food came it was edible but not enjoyable. My sister and I ordered the O'Connell burger with fries, since it's 2 for 1 burgers on Tuesday. I've definitely had better.   I would never recommend this place to anyone or even return to it myself for that matter. Save your money."}
{"text":"Came here after a wedding in the East valley. They have a great menu with excellent service."}
{"text":"I really don't even want to give them one star. When this place first opened I would go frequently. I always had good service. Place started going downhill about two years ago. I stopped spending my money there. I decided to try it out again last Sunday. Soon as we set down the waitress comes over and had an attitude right from the start. Then she kept referring to my boyfriend as honey. My family owns successful bars in AZ, none of the workers refer to customers this way. It's not professional or appropriate in my opinion. My boyfriend was annoyed by the fact she felt so comfortable to do so. We went to watch a baseball game, then it switched off. Of course the waitress was no where to be found. I had to finally get up and ask what happened to the game to another server. We missed a whole inning. Felt like the waitress should of told us it got moved to another channel. Then the mimosa I ordered was terrible, worst drink I've ever had. Waitress comes over and tells me, well no one else has complained about them honey. Really sweetie pants is what I wanted to say. Unless your Flo, and you tell me to kiss your grits while filling up my drink, don't use a term of endearment towards me or anyone else I'm siting with. It's condescending and your way to young to call me that. Save it for kids, and your close family. Not strangers, I'm not your honey. I could of seriously even overlooked that. Having an attitude and not fixing the drink issue is what set me off. I then talked to the manager who didn't look over 21. She really didn't seem to care about my experience, told me all the young servers refer to everyone as honey including her. Drink was not taken off the bill. Called and spoke with Lee the general manager, he asked me why I waited a week to call, really? Like is everyone working there a complete jack a--? He then tells me well come in and I'll buy you a new drink. Nope Lee, how about you train the staff on customer service. Sounds like you need some as well. I'm a business owner and I would never treat customers like that. Lee acted like I was bothering him on a Sunday and had no empathy, just like the manager girl. Steer clear of this place. I refuse to spend money at an establishment that feels like they can treat customers like crap. I can go next door to Maddogs. The service is great and you all should take a lesson from your competition. If I was the owner, I'd  get rid of this general manager, and the incompetent manager child. Obviously the server acted this way because she was trained by this management staff. Wake up, get a clue, tons of competition with bars. You need some serious customer service training for your general manager on down the line."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to go for great food and drinks but not any longer. We were very disappointed the last 2 times we were there. We won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and wanted to catch the Monday Night Football game. This place has lots of TV screens throughout the facility....I think they also have off-track betting. They have a good selection of beer on tap as well as those in bottles. I didn't have any food but did look at the menu...it looked like a typical bar & grill menu (burgers, sandwiches, etc.). I saw others with food...the portion sizes looked pretty decent. There's also an outdoor section with TVs for smokers. As far as sports bars goes, I liked it....and I have seen far worse. Next time I'm in the area, I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Stop by to play golden tee and have a couple of beverages staff was super friendly but the bar was really slow to be expected because it was Labor day"}
{"text":"If I could give a 0, I would. The Gally Burger and Chicken Fingers were terrible. Dry and overcooked. The service was slow. We received our food prior to the drinks we ordered. The bartenders were rude and ignored us until we had to go to great lengths to get their attention (waving like idiots). My sister-in-law fell due to the slippery floor near the bar area and the doorman was sent to ask us to leave. After speaking to the store manager, Chris Schwienburg, we required clarification as to the circumstances of the supposed situation that prompted us to be expelled from the establishment. We requested to speak to the Store Manager's supervisor and were directed to speak with Chris Mancini, Operations Manager. He was equally as clueless and offered no further answers as to why we were being asked to leave, other than it was reported that our sister-in- law fell. They had no comment in regard to her current sober state although she was allegedly \"drunk\" 20 minutes prior. Despite their inability to prove that she had drank more than one alcoholic beverage via \"security footage\", we left. After being a REPEAT customers for the past three St. Patricks' Days, I will NEVER give this establishment my business again. $150+ wasted on an establishment that clearly was not deserving of our repeat business."}
{"text":"I went last night with my sister and brother-in-law for the two for one burger deal. They got theirs but I was denied ordering two burgers for myself. Actually, I'm not that much of a pig...I wanted to take one home for my 89 year old, WWII veteran father. I mentioned this to the bartender and she presumably talked to the manager. Again, no deal. Really? It just floors me that as a single I get screwed. I proceeded to order my burger, had two glasses of wine and tipped 20 percent. Not the bartender's fault. The food was good, service fine. So what does management get out of this? Someone that won't go back. I don't understand the issue...cut me the same deal (I did order two drinks) or make mine half price. What is the loss???? I guess the only loss was for the bartender as I would have tipped for the price of two burgers, not one."}
{"text":"me and my husband wanted to try RTO Sullivans for karaoke  so we went there about 11.30 pm on July 17 2015, wasn't too  crowded place looked nice. About an hour later a large table  of people left and there was us and about two other tables and  some playing pool. we sang a couple songs and liked the KJ  and the system sounded really good.   Then the host says turn in your last songs now for the last  rotation etc. which we had already done so it was no biggee.  My husband song started to play but then all of a sudden my  husband sees the manager whisper something to the host, my  husband music stopped and then he announces that \"due to  unforeseen circumstances he has to scratch any people left on  the rotation because the manager wanted to close up early\" -  i cannot believe he shut off my husbands song after it had  already started for no good reason. don't tell people to turn in  one last song then cut them off as they start to sing it! then  when i ask the manager peter mullen why that happened he  just says \"im not gonna answer that\" -  what the hell kind of customer interaction is that? then the host  puts on a song by snoop dogg that last over 10 minutes and we  are like \"what the hell? - like if you're closing, close, but don't  cut off our song then put on music then refuse to answer  us when we asked whats going on\" -  rude, unprofessional.  Extremely poor management and vast  absence of customer service  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWMwP5VnYqA"}
{"text":"BOGO BURGERS ON TUESDAYS SAY WHAT?!? These burgers are really juicy, tasty, and a good size so count me in! Our waitress was super nice and very attentive! We were seated promptly even though this place was full.  There are tv screens every where and people playing which looked like some sort of poker games in the center of the dining area! Very great atmosphere, and will definitely come back to this location since the Stapley one closed!"}
{"text":"Been coming to RT's sporadically for a year or more but am frequenting it more because our group meets there for meetings and its really close to home.  It's a big place with a small business mentality: personable service, friendly staff, and an owner that walks around greeting people.  Servers remember your name! Lots of TVs yo watch your favorite sports, too.    Lastly the food can be enjoyed inside or on the spacious patio.  Speaking of food, they have a variety of options on the menu and great weekly specials   Try the curry fries.    Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had never been to RT O'Sullivan's but assumed by the name that this was in Irish Pub.  When we arrived it even looked as if it were an Irish Pub but the second our feet hit the threshold we could not have been more wrong.    The very first thing we noticed was the music that the DJ was playing.  It was vulgar, disgusting and degrading rap music.  Don't think me a prude....I like some rap music myself but every other word was the \"F\" word with explicit sexual content and I mean every single song the DJ played.  The clientele on the dance floor all looked like thugs (me thinks I'm going to see a throw-down on the dance floor any minute).    The place was dirty and it stunk.  I couldn't figure out what the smell was......We didn't order any food (the stink and atmosphere prevented me from doing that) and although my friends ordered a drink I did not.  I felt so uncomfortable there I couldn't wait to leave.  We stayed about 45 mins. which was 45 mins. too long.    If you are looking for an Irish Pub this is NOT THE PLACE!  It is so far removed from Irish (beyond the Irish decor) that you can get.  Not only do I not recommend this place I recommend you stay far, far away!"}
{"text":"Wow!!.  I took my brother here because it was near my house and I have enjoyed this bar years ago.  We eventually ended up outside after the indoor bar was dead.  NOT ONCE, did either one of the two waitresses take our order.  They catered to the large party and others but acted like we weren't there.  For an hour and a half, we had to go inside to get a drink from the bar.  They would only take the empty bottles and walk away.  I really don't expect that much from a bar but this place actually angered me.  Never again!"}
{"text":"I went in with great expectations, but wasn't that impressed. The place has potential, but next door has major competition. They need something to make them stand out. I went there on a first/last date, I believe it was a Monday so obviously it would be slow, but it was completely dead. I think that there were a total of 3 other people.  The food was decent which made it easier to deal with the idiot with me. Stayed maybe an hour and haven't been back. I've lived just across the bridge for almost a year and have yet to see it packed. It's a shame really, it's a great space and amazing location. They should drop the sports bar and go to an irish pub."}
{"text":"A bit of an annoying crowd at this older bar in Mesa, but that was overcome by the taste of the Reuben sandwich. It seemed like the clientele was all regulars and that included a loud talking high pitched gay man and a biker couple who decided to play cards and whistle loudly at the bar. Luckily, I had finished and was heading out when that annoying couple wandered inside. Anyway, the corned beef is made in-house and was excellent and it was perfectly paired with the traditional russian dressing, saurekraut and rye bread. This was one good sandwich for about $12. Bartender talked me into the mac and cheese as a side dish and although not the greatest ever, it was a nice change from fries."}
{"text":"I tried the restaurant on a week day lunch.   There was no one to seat me, so I gave up and found a table myself.    The place was almost empty with maybe two or three other tables of diners.  It took almost fifteen minutes before a waiter showed up, good thing I brought a newspaper.   A scruffy waiter finally showed up wearing beat up jeans and a t-shirt.   I would not have believed he was a waiter, I thought he was just another customer.   I ordered a sandwich and fries.   It took a while to get the order, but the sandwich was tasty and the fries were hot and salty.   Again it took quite a while to get my check and pay it.  There was a mini TV at the table, but no channel listing to use so that you have to manually go through the channels to find something to watch.  It was far more trouble than it was worth.  So the food was good and the service was terrible.  Maybe they were just understaffed?"}
{"text":"45 minute  wait for cold fish  and fries. Belligerent  manager.   Don't  waste your  time  and money."}
{"text":"This local has awesome waiters & waitresses. The bar/pub has an brillant owner as well, who is mingling with his patrons all the time. The daytime managers are great! The night time manager is the worst. He ignores his regulars and is downright nasty. Just last night he called myself and another regular a swear name I do not want to share. He has NEVER even said one word to me. My husband & I spend A LOT in this establishment every week (any where from $500-$1,000 week). We will not being going back to this pub for awhile, now. I am a very laid-back person and extremely kind & nice to everyone. I am not the one who tries to start anything. But Cody really made me upset last night. Something will have to change or I will need an apology before my husband and I will be back. We have been going there for years even their previous locations. Ray is GREAT, but he really needs to adjust new management. I would give this pub a 5 star but the management at night is awful."}
{"text":"It has been a cool two years since i popped in this bar and it does look remodeled or I can't remember what it looked like two years ago is also a possibility. The bartender was pretty cute and the beer prices were decent for cold draft beer. They have a bunch of TV sets for sports, but you need to be seated in certain areas to get the best views. The menu though clearly hasn't changed and could use some updating. This is a decent enough place to grab a drink if you live in the area, but not worth a special trip, although I think they show UFC matches for free."}
{"text":"Saw the neon painted sign advertising \"Buy One, Get One Free Burgers\" on Tuesday nights.  Sounds great since I am a penny pincher...   so the wife & I packed up and visited \"Sully's\" to strap on the bargain feed bag.   However, after it was all over we kinda had the feeling that it was all really a bait and switch and the advertised bargain was not received. Here's why:  They have \"rules\" for the burger promotion that the waitress had to recite to us (didn't see any asterisks on the sign outside!).    Rule #1: The only sides you can get are fries or coleslaw.  Normally you can substitute other sides like sweet potato fries, mixed veggies, etc.. or even a soup or salad for a $1.49 upcharge.  Bzzzt! Not today!   Those other sides are a $1.49 upcharge and the soup salad option was $3.   Whaaat??   I am diabetic... so I can't easily consume a bunch of high glycemic fried potatoes slathered in sugar loaded ketchup.  And, I hate cole slaw!  I am screwed. (unless I an willing to pony up extra money)   Rule #2:  They require a drink purchase for each burger.  Sigh... we just got bait and switched. Of course, there is no mention of the additional purchase requirement on the sign... or we would not have come.  Buy one get one free should mean just that. Remember I don't drink soda (sugar!) and I am a penny pincher... so I always drink ice water. They ended  up charging $5.98 for two iced teas.  We all know that you can buy a 24 pack of Luzianne Family Sized Tea bags for $2.25 and make 12 GALLONS of iced tea.  It is practically criminal to charge $6 for two glasses of iced tea. It costs less that 2 cents a cup to make.     So, a \"free\" burger actually costs us $6.     Be aware...  \"Buy One, Get One Free\" actually means \"Buy One, Get $3 off a second one\"  There was nothing special about the burgers.  If you normally pay for soda, ides tea, or an alcoholic beverage then you won't notice the scammy deal.  Us water drinkers get the shaft.    I'd give the restaurant 3 stars for a middle of the road pub burger.. and ONE star (or less) for the bait and switch marketing plan which left us feeling like we just visited a sleazy used car dealer.  Average that out and you get Two... even then I feel like it is overly generous.    There are a million other restaurant choices within 2-3 miles of the Power/I-60 intersection... Next time we'll pick one of those.  There is really nothing compelling about this place."}
{"text":"We've driven past RT O'Sullivan's a zillion times and always said we should eat there some time, but would always end up a BJ's instead.  We finally forced ourselves to stop and were we pleasantly surprised.  It's not much from the outside, looks like a dive bar.  The inside is dark as you would expect a sports bar to look, but it was very clean and had lots of TV's and seating options, including a large outdoor patio.  They had both Guiness and Four Peaks on tap and a wide selection of food.  I ordered the hot corned beef sandwich with a side salad and it was delicious.  The corned beef was lean and included melted cheese and Boar's Head deli mustard.  Just beware of the Leprechaun on the way to the restrooms, I'm sure I've seen him on some horror movies.  We will definitely go back and it might even become out new haunt."}
{"text":"beer is here.....2 stars.....other than that...adios. The same 8-10 loud mouth drunk regulars are there I am pretty sure every single day for hours and hours at a time. Service is alright i guess. The patio tables have never been touched by soap and neither have the floors. Id rather eat a pube sandwich than ever spend more than 20 minutes at this place. the plus side of this bar you may be asking??????........there's a wing stop next door."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday 9/3/16 around 6pm. Came here with husband and his uncle.   Got a couple of beers and I ordered a BBQ mushroom burger with no bun or cheese with waffles fries, and a martini. My husband got egg rolls and fish n chips. His uncle got corned beef and cabbage.   PROS: - martini was strong and tasty - burger meat was good and cooked the way I liked it, med rare. I wanted specific adjustments to my meal and the server was able to do all of them, without writing it down.  - waffle fries were delicious - egg rolls were good but too spicy for me - Fish N Chips: my husband said it was really good  - his uncle really liked the corned beef and cabbage - everything was tasty and services was good - friendly staff and helpful  CONS: - took a while for beers to come out - that's it."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends at the bar, the horse betting area or out on the patio. I like the atmosphere here very friendly staff as well. I like the Irish shepherds pie and the lunch specials. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Lots of TVs for sports.  They are really good at putting games on for you.  Staff is really nice.   Monica is a great server.  Very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Visiting family from out of town, came here for dinner last night, liked it so much we came back for lunch today!! Great food, games & now family is addicted to the OTB!! Everything tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss but late on a Monday there are not many options. We came in after family landed @ Sky Harbor for a quick cocktail. We sat @ the table @ the bar & didn't get served so we moved to the bar top & then got to order. The place had that weird dirty bar towel smell & my sister cocktail had a gnat in it. We didn't order any food but the service we did get was less than average and slow especially for a mostly empty building. The drink prices weren't bad though... $3.50 for well drinks. Overall it's not a place I could find myself going out of the way for unless it was the only thing open again...."}
{"text":"Awesome, lively atmosphere. Great place to watch a game or grab a bite/drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar.  They have every game.  The food and prices are food too.  Nice environment and good service."}
{"text":"Went for a UFC fight. Started well. Horrible ending. Food was good, plenty of tv's, good service.   The negative. Immediately following the last fight ~30 seconds or so, the dj announced the post fight party. Then the music started. The music was painfully loud in the dining room. Not just too loud to speak, but rock concert loud. My ears were in physical pain. Probably because there was a large speaker hanging directly above my table. Again, this was in the dining room and not the bar.  We were given no opportunity to pay and leave before this began. It started only seconds after the final fight.  I'm not some old fart either who loves to complain.  I enjoy loud music, but this was obscene. I went to watch a fight and have some beers. I did not go to listen to music louder than most dance clubs. It seems there should have been time between the end of the fights and beginning of this \"party\" for patrons to pay and leave.im assumi  I never miss a fight, and usually spend quite a bit on food and drinks when I go. I had a great experience until the end of the night. If this is the norm, I will be taking my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"The waitress kept rushing us, asking if we were finished barely minutes after she served our food, even though there was barely anyone else in the entire restaurant. She asked if I need a to-go box 20 minutes before we even asked for the check. The food was so-so, I got a club sandwich and it's very obvious that they use Kraft Singles cheddar cheese for it. The cranberry vodka that was ordered had barely any vodka in it - for $7. I over heard staff loudly bantering with each other, and a customer (I think) actually screamed at one point during the dinner. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because their macaroni and cheese was great...you can't really screw up that."}
{"text":"If you remember and like the television series Cheers, this place is for you.   Stumbled upon the place while looking for a new neighborhood watering hole. Something different than the chain restaurants and bars popping up like shopping malls.  This is the kind of place where everyone knows your name, the bar was filled with regulars who knew each other, and on the afternoon I visited, the staff took the time to make me feel welcomed.   Good selection of national and premium drafts. Excellent happy hour price. Plenty of televisions to watch your favorite sports.   I ordered teh wings, nacho plate, and two pints of Four Peaks Kilt Lifter Beer.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best sports bar in Mesa!  Awesome atmosphere with tons of TVs for every sporting event.  This is my go to spot every single football Sunday. Reasonably priced drinks and great food!  Top notch service, and they even were able to accommodate a large group for me when my team was playing."}
{"text":"We came in to watch the games this morning. There was some frustration in that only one tv in the main room was showing the AZ Cardinals game while there were several tvs for the Vikings game. We asked our waitress if the one to our right could be turned to the AZ game since it was hard to see the one little screen that was showing the AZ Cards game (above dj booth). We unfortunately got our request denied. Jessica T was very gracious and amazing today in that she has asked numerous times to try and get the game changed. She was declined. Minutes later, the same tv I asked to have changed to the AZ game was changed to the Vikings game. No one is still watching this tv. Jessica T was great and very attentive in making sure we had our beverages and kept us updated on when lunch was going to be served. Keep her around. She is very personable and is an asset to RTOS. We love coming here, just wish there were multiple tvs showing all games."}
{"text":"R.T.'s is a hidden gem of a watering hole right in the heart of \"snowbird land\".  I mention \"snowbird land\" because after going four times I can make a generalization that the bulk of their income comes from people over the age of 65.  The food is very reasonably priced and the service is some of the best in the area."}
{"text":"I went to this place to watch the fight. I normally go to Buffalo Wild Wings however i decided to try something new. Plus the cover charge was only 10.00 BWW increased there's to 15.00. Anyways it wasn't that crowed when I arrived. Normally you have a server there in about a minute to greet you and get your drinks. 10 minutes passed and a waitress looked over from her section and asked have we been helped. We said no. She apologized and walked off. I'm assuming to get our waiter he shows up 5 minutes after that. Got our drinks ordered and to us fast. We still needed a minute to figure out what we wanted to eat. It took the waiter over 35 minutes to come back to us and ask what we would like to eat. This was after the fact that I went to the hostess and said my waiter hasn't came to my table in over 30 minutes but passed by several times and I couldn't get his attention. Well my waiter was right over after that. Of course he would be now. I wasn't happy with the service at all and because of that it seemed like the food wasn't so good either. Once your ticked off. You start judging everything so I won't put a review on my food. The drinks however were another story I had a mud slide and a Malibu with pineapple juice. Can't go wrong there. I have it a 2 star which brought it up from a negative 5 because the drinks were good and the prices were good and the hostess was very friendly and after my complaint came to our table and kept checking on us. I don't think I would return here after seeing the other reviews about the same type of service. I wish I would have read the reviews before hand and would have shelled out the extra 5 to BWW."}
{"text":"Great sports bar.  Great happy hours with cheap drinks and delicious food.  Always show every ppv fight including boxing and ufc."}
{"text":"Me and my wife go here very often since they have great happy hours. The beer is big and cheap in cost not taste! The food on happy hour menu is good and half price. There is plenty of TVs so you can always watch any game that is on at the time. This place does tend to get packed on Sundays and Monday nights but just get there early to claim your table. I also think they have specials for football days college and professional. When ever my wife brings up RTO's I am quick to say ok lets go.  There is plenty of places to sit but if you want a good sit for the games the first room you enter is your best bet. The second room is ok but it is more for eating than anything. The also have outside seating but in Arizona summer I fear anything with the word outside in its name.   The service has never been a problem for me, they always get the food to table in a decent amount of time and always keep my glass full. I am sure they have people on call if its gets to packed since I never see one person trying to cover the place by themselves.   They have a few video games in the second room very typical bar type games such as golf, bowling, and a rifle hunting game.   Never had a bad experience here yet, would get 5 stars if they only updated some of the TVs, maybe in a few years :) I prefer to watch the games at home on my Samsung."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the valley.  Great atmosphere, amazing food and so many TVs."}
{"text":"The food was shockingly bad...an Irish place that can screw up on Corned Beef and Cabbage? It was horrible...very bland, no seasoning, meat was very fatty! My daughter's boneless wings were quite good I must say. The waitress Corinne S was OUTSTANDING! Sweet personality and checked in with us at just the right time to do refills on drinks...she is an asset to this place, whoever cooked the corned beef should be fired!"}
{"text":"Great food. Special today was 6.99 sandwiches. Great deal, great service. To top it all off. Karaoke on Thursday notes......Perfect!"}
{"text":"I went there around 11:30pm on a weekday, had two beers and a pretty large order of chicken strips with fries. When I got my bills, it showed $12.00...I was like 'What just happened, did they forget half of my order?' No, they did not. It's just really good priced. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Service is nothing to get excited about. They have free poker on Tuesday nights which is a lot of fun. It's a nice laid back sports bar."}
{"text":"This place is really friendly with good food, plus good drink specials. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. It's definitely a good place to watch a game or just hang out with friends. Also, for an Irish bar, they make good bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"So disappointed!   We live close by and we were hoping to make it our go to place for dinner, drinks and to watch the game.   We have been there twice and had the same experience both times .   We were seated in the large dining room, which has great TVs and space.  But we had to wait more than 40 minutes for our so-so food with poor service.  This place has great potential, wish they could figure it out.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"Been here several times over the years. Could defiantly use a makeover. Food is good and service is decent as well. Has off track betting for the horses which I kind of like. Good place to do some day drinking."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Highly recommend this Irish pub if you are in the Mesa area. The owner is one of the hardest working people you'll ever meet. You'll see him busting tables, cleaning the floor etc."}
{"text":"Love this place, we come to area each March for many years, we stay close by. And eat here at least 2 or 3 times.  We sit at bar, and have always had great service, ice cold beers and appetizers are great. The mini sliders are fabulous we've tried all of them except the fish ones. Wings are also yummy. My brother had the Shepherds pie, he said it's the best he's ever had. Staff is friendly and efficient. So come stay awhile and enjoy."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food.  Great environment to watch a game and meet new people.  5 STARS!"}
{"text":"One of the best places around for sports.  It reminds me of a good ol Midwest sports bar."}
{"text":"An Irish pub that plays club music.  Interesting.  Fun enough!"}
{"text":"A great bar in East Mesa! Been here a few times with my boyfriend and his family who live in the area. They have really friendly staff, great happy hour specials, and awesome food."}
{"text":"I use to go here once or twice a month with my buddy.  There cheese stick are delicious and there dorky trivia games are fun.  The drinks are alright and I like that it's never crowded.  At least where I've sat it's never been crowded.  They seem pretty good at keeping the noisy crowd away from those who would rather eat, maybe have a drink or two, and just hang out with their friends and talk.  The bathrooms are you typical bar bathroom.  Ya know the kind that even when you scrub it for 2 hours straight it still looks dirty.  You splash a coat of paint and someone will still write on the walls like they are 12 years old and not grown women.  I suggest checking there website to see what events are going on before heading there.  My friend and I made the mistake of going there one night to talk and catch up and it turned out there a live band that night.  The band was so loud that even across the entire room they were able to drown out my conversation with my friend.  We ended up ordering food and waiting them out figuring they couldn't play forever and eventually they'll go away.  Which they did and it got better.  The place is pretty cheap too so I'll always go back here."}
{"text":"R.T. O'Sullivan's has been a go to place of mine for the last couple years. The service has never been anything short of outstanding. The food is good to very good and always consistent. The establishment is clean and inviting. They offer off track betting, which is nice bonus.  I would not hesitate to make a stop here for a drink and/or bite to eat."}
{"text":"The service was ok. The beer choices were pretty dismal being an \"Irish pub.\" The food was mediocre. The ambiance felt ...umm... old. If I was 68 looking to hang out; this would be a happening place. Alas, I'm not.  If you're looking to place some bets and eat basic food though... this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years.  The happy hour is always a good deal.  The loaded potato skins with chicken are the best appetizer.  The restaurant features live trivia on Wednesday nights with Moses at 7 where you can win gift cards.  The fish and chips are excellent.  The service is usually good."}
{"text":"Had I read the reviews on here before I went, I might not have gone at all. My experience was much better than most of these reviews.  Leslie S was my waitress, and she did a wonderful job. Being my first time there, I asked her what she would recommend. She made multiple recommendations, but the one I decided on was the Sligo Burger medium rare with onion rings. The rings were crispy and hot, and my burger was cooked to perfection and delicious. I loved the combination of sweet with heat. The Sligo Burger has BBQ sauce, bacon and jalapenos on it. I really like that every booth has it's own LCD TV, along with larger ones around the room. That way, if you are interested in more than one game, you can tune in to one at your table, and watch another on the larger screens."}
{"text":"We went out tonight and I was SO hoping to just have a good meal and a good time for my wife's birthday, unfortunately that was not the case. They sat us at a dirty table that couldn't accommodate a sling for our daughters car seat, no big deal as we got moved after waiting 5 minutes for them to clean the other table.   I ordered a Killian's bottle from the menu to find out 15 minutes later they no longer carried it, had to settle for an Amstel Light which just doesn't work once you have your taste buds set for a Killian's. Fine, I'll make due, just need food ASAP.   Ordered a Shepherds Pie, the waitress strongly recommended we get cheese melted on top so I said, \"ok, I'll take your word for it\". We asked for an extra plate so my wife and I could split our meals since they wouldn't split them for us (a big pet peeve of mine having been in the restaurant business years ago).   Needless to say my Shepherds Pie came out without the cheese melted on top and I had to wait 10 minutes for the waitress to come back so I could bring it to her attention. By the time I finally got it back everyone in my family was done eating and I'd lost my appetite. The waitress tried to make up for this by not charging us for the cheese, we had to point out to her that the menu showed this as a free upgrade.   Then came dessert. We ordered a mocha mud pie. Save your money, it was pretty lame and nothing like it was explained to be.   I'm not normally a cynical person and don't like to make a big deal but every damn part of my meal sucked tonight and they took a measly $2.50 off the bill and offered a half-ass \"sorry 'bout that\", not at all what I was hoping for on a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Always great service and great food highly recommend and always a great atmosphere and you might even win some money on the off track horse race betting."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is my first review, so bear with me. Last Monday I went in and talked to a manager about having a party there on Thursday to celebrate my birthday as well as the start of football season, she checks the reservation book and.... shocker! No reservations. So I tell her 20 people for 5:30, give my name and phone number and the location where I'd prefer to be sat. No problem she says and even buys me a beer before I head out. So far awesome! Cut to Thursday 5:31 I walked in and the place was packed. No one has any knowledge of our party. So they scramble to get an area for us and it is 4 tables of 4 separated by a partition so you could only communicate with the other 3 people at your table. Whatever, frustrated but went with it cause what could really be done by that point? End of the night comes and between the cocktails and excitement of the Broncos win I accidentally left my presents. It was almost closing time when we left and I was before opening and another manager let me in while he looked for it and it was gone. Totally my fault for leaving it, but would like to be able to trust that if something like that happens you can trust the staff to put it in a safe place for you. Overall a frustrating trip to their establishment and birthday experience."}
{"text":"We had our staff Christmas party here and the place was cool about letting us use the patio and heaters and was great about getting drinks and food for everyone. A lot of places are finicky about large groups but this place held their own and was good."}
{"text":"I wasn't psyched about coming to this place because that salad on its Yelp review page does not look good at all.    The restaurant was dead.  The only people there were in the bar area or sitting on the patio.  I took my seat at the bar and the bartender walked straight over to me, not to take my order but to grab something from the well right in front of me.  As I waited, I looked around and the place looked sad and desperate.  It was like Applebee's and Black Angus had a bastard child that they both neglected.  I noticed that the bartender was chatting up some fugly mofos  - flipping her hair and giggling like a buffoon.  At first it didn't bother me because I knew she has to make tips.  She served two other people at the bar and when she was done I figured I'd get her attention and give her my order, even though we made eye contact and she saw me sit at the bar.  Then a third guy walks into the bar and she serves him ahead of me, it was the last straw.  I said \"f*&$ this\" and left."}
{"text":"Service is VERY slow! We came at 3:30 hoping that we would be in and out but that was not the case. Apparently the managers feel it's okay to only have one cook on during this time. So instead of a reasonable ten to 15 minute ticket time we waited 25 minutes for the appetizer, 2 minutes after that the food came out. We ordered dessert and waited 20 minutes for that. We ended up leaving instead of continuing to wait but the dessert she offered us was pitiful.  The food was okay and we will probably be back but not unless we have a lot of time to wait."}
{"text":"Sad to say, but true.   I came here during St. Patty's day so it was busy at the time.  However, we're not here to make excuses and in the food service industry there shouldn't be.    I can at least say the place was hopping, but our hostess was kind and super awesome to be able to still find us a seating right away (kudos to that!)  However, service didn't make it until much later....much much later.  I not sure if the sea of green shirts just masked us, but wow!  Anyways, once service came things started to flow slowly; first drinks; then second drinks, then water; then ordered appetizers, then more drinks; then entrees; then more water; and finally check.  The sequence of the ordering happened over an extended period of request.  Needless to say, I'm not a fan or chasing down my server.  Nice gal at the end of the day, but I wouldn't be complaining if I haven't been in her shoes before.  I ordered fish and chips due to recommendations; I recommend you not get this if you come here!  Fish was over fried and tasted somewhat burned and the fries were decent.  In the end, RT just didn't work for me and I was super sad to know my green beer was actually Miller Lite!  Like can't Guinness  or Harps make a green beer just for this day! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My family was just in there and waited over 20 min and NOBODY came to our table even once when it was not busy at all and the section we sat in was almost empty. Horrible crappy non existant service."}
{"text":"Great place to have a few drinks.   Good happy hour deals.  We have tried most of the menu and most of the food is very good.   The wings are great.  The service is very good.   Most of the servers are very friendly.  There is off track betting in the back that can be good entertainment.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  In the winter it can be loaded with retirees so on the weekends you might have to get there early."}
{"text":"Horrible! On a Monday night music was horrendous and waitress was no help! Tried to switch music using app but we kept getting skipped, absolutely ridiculous! Never again!"}
{"text":"Wanted to go on a date night and decided to go to R.T.'s ...and that's the good part.  Now to the bad. The whole blueprint of the area is cramped. Sitting there I got nudged quite a few times.  It took 15 minutes just for a waitress to come and greet us and get our drink orders.  We finally had to call over the manager, who tried to get what we wanted. The food was way over priced for the quantity and quality of food. The beer alone was 5.25 for a \"quote\" large draft beer.  Not coming to this place again until some changes have been made."}
{"text":"My salad was enormous and perfectly proportioned with all the toppings. My friend said the Reuben was one of the best he's had!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place for family and friends.  Tasty food, great drinks and good service.  Also my go to spot for all UFC events!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to watch the Pacquiao vs Bradley fight last Saturday and went to Mad Dog Saloon first.  Although they did not have a cover charge, the place was packed and there was no place to sit!  So we decided to go next door to this place and hoped that we got a seat somewhere.  I wasn't too happy with the $10 cover charge, but hey, we got there at 8pm and it was a decent price to pay for a seat.  The workers let us look for a seat first before we paid the cover so that was nice of them. Throughout the fight, the waitress was attentive and made sure we were good.  We ordered the Baked Mac and Cheese - American and the Bacon Swiss Cheeseburger.  I was expecting nothing better than bar food because after all, it IS a bar. Both entrees were pretty good.  Although the night ended with a huge debatable disappointing split judge decision favoring Bradley, we didn't have to worry about trying to find the waitress for our check or pushing people to get out.     Pacquiao, no matter what any judge says, you are the winner and still the man!"}
{"text":"We've been several times and the best I can say is mediocre.  The place is very large and unless you're part of a big party you could wait a bit.  The food is okay, the wings are okay, the service is just okay."}
{"text":"The bartenders here were very attentive but the dj was kind of a dick to my friend and I. He kept skipping around with the line up. He'd let people go ahead of us and it was kind of rude. I wouldn't come here on karaoke night but any other time of the night is fine."}
{"text":"This place is always a go to for a good sandwich and a great drink special. I love the Rueben sandwich and the Turkey Club. They always have a good drink special for the week and brunch specials. The service is always friendly and quick. I could go on about all my favorite food items but try what you think you'll like because I'm sure it will be served hot, consistent, and it'll taste good. The atmosphere is your typical pub style restaurant with a large bar area, it's got character and you'll feel very welcomed."}
{"text":"Always a great time visiting RT O'Sullivans! We've come here for many occasions varying from casual nights out, Kentucky Derby fun, to holiday work parties! Every time we've visited we've had great service, the food has been delicious, and the drinks kept coming!"}
{"text":"Went here recently for the first time in awhile.  Great Irish place.  The Reuben sandwich was amazing and my wife loved the fish n chips.  If you're into OTB this is a great spot. The food was reasonably priced and the service was always very fast and friendly.  We sat out on the huge patio which was nice since the weather was perfect.  They have a really comfortable lounge area on the patio too."}
{"text":"This place was alright, I love the bar area and after they did the updating and took out the wall it really helped with the open space area.  Drinks are ok but honestly they are expensive"}
{"text":"Nice variety of beers on tap. Take some time to review the drink specialty menus. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great. I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Well we frequent this place often for the televised griz games. Today the man was extremely rude and our waitress was so stoned. Needless to say we left after 15 minutes. They told us they are televising our game on a small tv inside. Won't be back for quite some time. Very rude staff today."}
{"text":"Meh...  So I went for a friends birthday, and after being sexually harassed and almost accosted at the other R.T. O'Sullivan's next to Fiesta Mall, I was less than happy.  However, when I saw the bar, I was happy that it was well lit and clean.  I'm surprised that my girly-girl friend chose a sports bar to have her birthday at, so that threw me a bit.  Plus, I was there on a Friday or Saturday night, so all of the 20-30 somethings were a bit gawky.    Oh, I did have a lovely buffalo chicken salad that I scarfed down.  I would go back alone for that.  (They had me at buffalo).  It seems like a place I would definitely go to if I was bored in Gilbert and needed a safe and reliable place to chill; otherwise I'd go in to Phoenix or Tempe.  Also, I could definitely see my boyfriend and myself going there after work one day when we don't want to cook, to have a beer and relax. Weeknights only for me, R.T. O's is a little busy for my tastes on the weekend."}
{"text":"Hey Ray, Went there today, several friends sitting at the `regular table`.  Ordered a drink from my favoritte waitress, then got called out by management, saying MAYBE I could come back in a couple months, but I was not welcomed today, even around ROT regulars who are my friends.  I'm sorry, whatever happened a month or two ago happened, but when one of your managers calls my wife a Bitch,that's when I involved.  I love RT O'Sullivans, I love the waitrers, cooks, Ray, waitresses, most managers, especially the ones that have the first name of Chris!  Lol!  But ill tell you what.  I've been around awhile, frequenting bars in Colorado, Utah, California, Minnesota, Pennysylvania, New Jersey, Sweeden, Denmark, Mexico, and I've always been the guy who try to help out when there is a situation, and here at RTs, i feel like I'm the enemy.  It's bullshit, and I'm exercising my rights to take our business elsewhere, to the tune of 500 to 1000 a week.  Go Ahead and check your records, you'll see that that's what we were spending I there a week.  You know who I'm complaining about, so I won't mention his name. I've been a regular in several active, sometimes violent bars,and I've never been treated like this.  And to finalize, Cody, you should not call women a `Bitch` Really?? You`re a manager of an establishment. Next time you decide to use the word ` Bitch` to somebody, make sure it's to me."}
{"text":"They have all day happy hour on Monday and happy hour is from 11 am to 7 pm WHAT!!!! You can't beat that but did I forget to mention they have Shepard pie. But wait..,,,,they have a burger with corned beef and sauerkraut wtf YESSSSS. FOOD WAS DELISH!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice layout. Plenty of TV's and almost any sport you can think of.  Service is just ok. I usually only go around lunch and happy hour so I don't know what the night time is like. The food is ok. Some items are better than others. The fish and chips can be really good at times and then not so much other times. The pizza was surprisingly good. I'm usually skeptical about pizza on the menu at an Irish bar but it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Been here several occasions. The food and service are always good. Particularly the fish and chips!! Always clean and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our 3rd visit there. Not our choice but neighbors called neighbors that wanted to go there. Party of 6. Only 3 table to seat a party of 6.  So a long wait.  I ordered a wrap, which was good and it came with a side.  I asked the waitress if soup was a side, she said yes, not mentioning that somewhere in the menu it said that soup as a side was an up charge. I confirmed with her what soup was a side.  2 other's ordered  soup as an extra.  All soup came lukewarm but I didn't send mine back as it was French onion. Just decided to go with it.  When we got our bill, there was an ad on for my soup. Mentioned it to waitress who now informed me of the extra cost.  I said no that I had asked about sides.  I have always been told that there was an extra cost.  She send over a guy and asked me what I wanted him to do about it. I explained. His response was I'll take it out of her pay (guilt trip?).  So when she brought back the bill she threw it on the table and walked away.  A very busy restaurant making lots of money not caring now they treat customers or wait staff."}
{"text":"RTO is a great place to hang out - especially on Tuesday nights at 7pm when they have deliciiys BOGO Burger meals and Trivia with Moses.   Sit in MELISSA'S section - she is fun and sometimes gives ya Trivia hints !!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Happy hour is amazing (including a $6 HUGE veggie plate!) and the servers remember your name and drink! Great TVs. Off track betting. Waaaaaay better that House of Brews!"}
{"text":"If hunger was a road, this place would be a Chevy. It's trustworthy, reliable, and always gets you to the destination (being full). We've come here a lot and it's always fast, friendly, and delicious. Last Friday we went for the fish fry. Service was good and food came out quick and hot, which is usual for this place.  However, per usual, the coleslaw looked, and tasted, like it was past its prime. If this was a one time thing I could understand but last time we got the fish and chips the slaw was also wilted. Aside from that everything was delicious per usual. We will come back again. We'll even get the fish and chips again, but hopefully the slaw changes next time."}
{"text":"We should have the option of negative stars!  This was our second visit, and going to be our second Vikings game here.  So we go in and we are about 5 minutes after kickoff, I only know cause of course he was listening to it in the car lol.  The first time was amazing, the food was great the people were nice and very accommodating. These were not the same people clearly.  When we walk in the host was telling her manager we have 4 More up here for the Vikings game. His reply to her right in front of us and the other two customers waiting \"they are a little late to the party\" he wasn't joking, he was rude about it. So while we are trying to explain we can do without the sound, he says I guess you better make some new friends, then gestures to the other tables with Vikings jerseys at them in the main area. I asked is the game playing outside we would be happy to watch without sound.  The host guides us through to the patio, and 4 people were moving their table to be able to see the same game so the host moved our table so we could see it better too.  The server then comes out to the table of 4 and I asked since everyone on this side of the patio is here for Vikings would we be able to change the sound to the Vikings game. She said management is very picky about that so she doubted it. I said can you ask she said she would ask. The whole time she is being very rude to the two couples who moved their table No no you need to move this back this won't work sorry we cannot allow this. WOW 1. Either bolt the table down or put up a sign that says you can't move the patio furniture. Offer another solutions. She clearly was not a problem solver.  Then she tells us we have to move our back too. At this point I was actually on yelp reading the reviews of the rude staff, told my guy about them he says yup time to go. We kindly let her know that her fellow staff moved the table and I think she then got the gist that they can move it back.  I don't care how busy you are, it's called human kindness and respect. The manager and his behavior explained his staffs behavior. You don't treat your patrons that way at all. The host was being as nice as she could and had an apologetic eye, so clearly she knew that we were not the only ones.  The waitress didn't bat an eye when we up and left, she looked grateful that she wouldn't have to wait on another table.  The management showed how much he appreciates customers. It's called let's find out the needs of the customer then see if we can meet those needs and if we cannot then offer a couple solutions. Rude remarks and snooty comments are not necessary.  On another note we went to Beast of Bourbon had breakfast, watched the game without sound, and treated with respect kindness.  I previously liked Sullivan's food, but come on I can get pub food anywhere, and usually we watch the games at home., we go for the experience!  So -5 stars"}
{"text":"Just went there for a beer and to bet on the ponies, for that I give it 5stars not sure about food or service"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend.  As we were walking up we saw a couple sprawled, horizontally across each other, enthusiastically making out (dry humping) on the patio furniture in the almost empty, outdoor smoking area in full view of anyone that walked by.  We should have just left right then and there.  But no, we're hardy souls (and easily amused) so we ventured inside and were offered a seat at a high table that had a padded booth that runs the length of the South wall.  The problem with the booth seat was that it had a slight floor-bound tilt to it, so being in jeans I was in imminent danger of being dumped on my ass the entire time I was there.  I eventually turned sideways to brace myself on the stupid booth so I didn't shoot off the end, like a ski slope, and wind up in a crumpled heap underneath our high-top table.  Ridiculously awkward.  Our waitress was prompt, but our drinks were largely forgettable.  We opted not to order any food, despite the fact that they offered a 'Shannon Burger'.  I wasn't even tempted enough to stay with a burger that featured my name.  Eventually the doxy that was getting it on out on the patio, came sashaying into the bar area for more drinks, and she had that hardened look of a girl with daddy issues that'd been rode hard and hung up wet...sad.  She also had a familiarity in her interactions with the other waitresses and the bartender that made us both think she was somehow employed there or maybe a regular customer; not sure which, but we were sure by then it was time for us to leave.  The one redeeming thing I will mention about this place is that the décor was decent, staying in the Irish theme, and there are a TON of TV's showing different games, bar trivia, and one was even showing a movie so there is a distraction factor if watching drunken floozies isn't your style."}
{"text":"Not vegan friendly at all. Husband got the mozzarella sticks because he was starving. He said they tasted like plastic and the charge almost $9 for them. Ick.  Their beer menu is typical Irish beers (which are good) and a few local beers with the American corn beers in the mix. Decent pricing at least.  We will probably come here for the World Cup games later this year, unless we can find a place playing them with edible food and more craft beers. Otherwise, no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant conveniently located at US 60 & Power Rd.  So excited that this is by my new office and I'll be able to grab lunch here often!  Very friendly atmosphere and great food!  My burger was juicy & cooked perfectly, love the seasoning on the fries!  Happy hour starts at 3!  Will be back for Happy Hour soon!"}
{"text":"My kids and I pass by this place quite a bit but have never stopped in. Last night we decided to do something different and check this place out. We parked and ended up coming in through the back patio.  Duh, we couldn't find the front door, lol! Or we just went where we could smell the food!  The restaurant is definitely a lot bigger than I imagined and was filled with lots of screens hosting everything from the Cardinals game, Basketball, NASCAR, and even Bull riding! We found the hostess stand and we're greeted right away. The hostess was super friendly and very helpful. My kids were so pleased that she gave them gaming tablets to play while we waited for our server. Our server came over and she was also very friendly and helpful in recommending menu items. I ordered the Philly Cheese, which coming from the east coast, it's been difficult to find one as comparable, but it was sooo good!  The kids enjoyed their meals as well! The portion sizes were great too! I think we found a great spot with delicious food where we can come to relax and watch our favorite sports teams! Mommy found her a great spot to come for happy hour without the little people as well!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a spot to grab a bite to eat after checking into our hotel the other night and since this was close by we decided to check it out.   It's kind of a combination of Irish pub, sports bar, and nightclub. More of a place where the locals go and the people staying at the nearby hotels hit up for a drink. Decent selection of beers on tap, bottles, and daily drink specials. $2.50 Harp bottles all the time! Really good happy hour deals too.  Lots of screens to watch the games, and even an outside patio area to hang out on. Then night we went there was a DJ spinning tunes and a wedding party was occupying the small dance floor area. Yeah, this was kind of strange but it looked like they were having a good time.  Tasty selection of bar food here. Chicken fingers and fries were actually pretty decent. Nice and juicy chicken and crispy fries.  Staff here is really friendly and attentive. We might hit it up again before we leave."}
{"text":"Food was ok, waitress was ok... Drink was horrible .. Bloody Mary that seemed like they dumbed a bottle of Tabasco into it .. And the kicker was the hostess who looks like she was 16 who kept sleeping at the hostess stand .. She looked so pathetic and sad it made the atmosphere even more stale . Ps don't sit by bar you will hear all the waitresses complaining about the managers and the tips they don't get and the shifts they hate working ."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Go on Yuesday buy one get one deal. Great service from staff.  Plenty of tvs to watch your favorite sports team."}
{"text":"First time to RT O'Sullivan and I found it to be a nice Irish pub. Plenty of room on the patio with a great mist system. The place seemed pretty clean and the service was great. My wife and I had a good time (except for the golf auction going on, dude turn the mike down!) Anyway she had the Cajun hamburger that was pretty good and I had had a craving for fish & chips and it did not disappoint. Definitely cheek out the specials before you go, they had bottomless mimosas when we were there!"}
{"text":"Really cool hangout.  It looks a bit dingy, but it is great food, fantastic service, and $2.50 bottles of Harp all the time.  Oh, and it's not on the buzz time (NTN) website, but they have it."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere to hang out in.  Horse racing, great food, and excellent service.  Been there many times with no issues.  Always a great experience.  Recommend the fish n chips."}
{"text":"really nice server but the place was full of really really drunk people and kind of dingy.  and it was only 7 pm on a friday.  I didnt see anything special except for the giant patio."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports, cover charges on boxing matches are to high especially with never any drink specials.  Food is mediocre.  Service is decent overall not a bad spot, but there are better options close by."}
{"text":"we visited rt o'sullivan's on saturday night in attempt to to watch the pacquiao vs margarito fight. i called ahead of time to make sure that they were not too full and they responded that they were full but that the crowd watching the nebraska game should be leaving around 700pm-730pm.  we arrived around 715pm..there was no seating available anywhere.   OK we decided that we would walk across the street to red robins to grab a sandwich since there is NO seating available to eat and we figured when we return there should be some seats available...wrong! it was actually full to capacity.  this meant that we would have to stand if we stayed..no bueno.    side note:  i think that they should only charge ten dollars per person if there is some where a customer can comfortably sit.  if all that is left is standing room only then a discount should be given of five dollars off.  anyway they did refund our 20 dollars back and we rushed home and ordered the fight at our home and i am happy we did instead of enduring my feet hurting all night long.  i wish they would of planned better for such a large crowd."}
{"text":"I was invited to this place by some friends from work to watch football on the first day of Sunday Football. There were about 10 or so of us.  We were all ordering drinks having a good time, then one of the girls in my party asked for a menu (which we had to ask the hostess for because our waitress was so slow).  She gave us a menu labeled \"Daily Lunch Specials\".  About 4 of us ordered the Fish and Chips for $8.  The food came out, was good, not great.  Then when one of the couples in the party asked for there bill their order of Fish and Chips was $14.  Definitely not what we were expecting.  We asked the waitress about it and she said the menu we ordered from was only for Mon-Fri.  She got her manager and he said \"yea thats only for weekdays\".  We let him know that was the menu we were given and he said \"oh you really thought a 4 piece fish and chips is only $8, I can't do that\".  So, upset we let it go and they paid their tab.  I honestly don't understand a business that doesn't want to make their customers happy.  We probably ordered a total of $100 or more in drinks alone at our table and he couldn't give us anything as an \"I'm sorry\".    Needless to say we and our friends will never be back."}
{"text":"RTOs is a great local watering hole, has great food, awesome staff, and very receptive management.  My only real complaint is their pub trivia, some people like trivia, that's awesome.  But this guys voice and constant, sonorous questioning at a million decibels turn a few pints after work into my looking for the quickest possible escape route less my brain starts leaking out of my ears."}
{"text":"First time to RT O' Sullivan's and will not be our last. My English husband gave the fish and chips 4 stars. If you know any Brits they are very picky about their F&Cs. A friend with us ordered corned beef and cabbage and after just one bite said, \"delicious!\"  She was not as impressed with cabbage but overall her meal was good. I went for the rueben on a gluten free bun and it was awesome. I imagine on the rye bread it would be even better. Some reviews complained about the noise level, but on a Sunday at around 6 it was very quiet."}
{"text":"Good wings, great happy hour specials, and a chill vibe. The outside area is cool. The only thing keeping this from being a five star experience is the TV placement. It was rather awkward to watch MNF the way the place is set up."}
{"text":"Came in Friday at 5pm, escorted to the patio to enjoy a drink and a few chapters of a book before the crowds picked up. No one every showed up to take my order. The hostess was nice and sat me out there and assured me a waitress would be there to take my order...never happened. That sucked.  The patio is spacious and had big couches, lots of cigar smoke and vulgarity from a group customers, bad mouthing other customers when they leave and what not. And some guy that always yells \"YAHTZEE!\" When he says something clever. That was actually funny to hear but, I'm sure his friends are tired of it.  It's a good bar for horse race gambling, and to catch a game but, as someone whose first time there, it will also be my last.  Understaffed on a Friday at happy hour, no excuse.  Forgetting a customer is there and never serving them, no excuse.  I mean, come on, really?!"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy food and drink. Plenty of Tv's and off track betting.  Accommodated large group with great customer service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband has been going here for years. Great local bar where you get to know the owner and staff.  I just recently was able to get away a times a month, and I really enjoying coming here. We usually go during happy hour and always sit at the bar. Melissa is an awesome bartender who values her customers, while doing her job efficiently and effectively.  From what I'm told, draft beer is always cold. I usually get bottled beer, mixed drinks or wine. Can't beat the prices.  Food is killer, too. Sweet Potato fries and the veggi platter are my go to snack. My hubby enjoys the chili, potato skins (with steak) and meatloaf.  Plus, you can bet on horse races, which can be fun!"}
{"text":"The food here is always yummy and they give really big portions. This is my go-to place when I hang with my stepdad and Melissa, our bartender, always knows what we want before we even say anything.  Melissa is awesome!"}
{"text":"There is nothing amazing about R.T.'s. In fact, in a lot of ways its pretty sub-par. It's kind of dingy, the food is pretty unhealthy (but what would you expect?), I've gotten food poisoning, there is a huge turnover with waitstaff, and at least 50% of the time my order comes out wrong or incomplete.   Why do I return? A quality beer selection and Wednesday night trivia with Moses. My fiance and I are trivia buffs and we think this is one of the best trivia nights in the valley. Moses is funny and the format is really good- much better than Team Trivia that has taken over at most bars.  So, if you're looking for something to do on a Wednesday night definitely check out RT's. Otherwise, keep driving. You can do better."}
{"text":"Typically, this place is pretty low key and Jen is awesome. Stopped in tonight to grade papers on my way home and some drunk A holes sit next to me and continue to lean in on me and eventually falls on me. I ask him to back off a bit and he and his buddies think they are going to \"handle\" things. I asked the bar to call the police, which does not happen. Both identify themselves as police officers, but will not produce credentials. I am asked to move, by the manager WTF."}
{"text":"Always a great time (though pregnant) I enjoy sitting at the bar around an always colorful crowed. The menu is expansive including daily specials which are generally delightful. When I wasnt pregnant I loved the old location for drinks after work, im so glad they've moved to a better location.. LOVE THE NEW BUILDING. . I'll be back rest assured! :-) AND dont forget Happy Hour runs till 6 (I believe) which includeds deals on food.."}
{"text":"Weird little establishment put together with a weird crowd.  Maybe it was just this Friday night but everything about it was pretty obnoxious down to the server, clientele, and DJ blasting music. It seemed like the employees were doing the bare minimum and didn't really wanna help anyone."}
{"text":"I had a meeting locally and had been to their location in Mesa, AZ. I asked to be seated near a TV and was stoked when they gave me a booth with a private TV. The only IPA they had was Ranger, which was ok but there was little selection. The mac & cheese was pretty good and the burger was more than good. It was solid but nothing wildly awesome."}
