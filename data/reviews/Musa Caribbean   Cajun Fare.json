{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The bartender and service was great, the Sangria was phenomenal, and the food was delicious.  We ordered the plantain chips and the fried avocado appetizers just to try them and we were glad that we did.  Both came with fantastic dipping sauces that we great compliments.  My wife ordered the salad with mango vinaigrette dressing and she loved it.  I had the chicken curry which was delicious and just the right amount.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm very excited about Musa! Its tile floor and colorful walls, plus extremely friendly staff almost makes you feel like you're in the Caribbean! Oh yeah, and $5 mojitos! 

We split the fried avocado appetizer (covered in plantain crumbs) ... I could've eaten it all day! The shrimp Po boy and the plantain chips were incredible too! 

If I had any critique, it's that the menu is extremely limited. I would love to see a few more options added once they're open a bit longer. 

I can't wait to get back and sit on that glorious patio!"}
{"text":"A little taste of the Caribbean in Pittsburgh. Plantain chips with tastey dipping sauce, stuffed pork wrapped in bacon, curry chicken, fried avocado, shrimp, Cajun and Jerk wings, beers on tap, deck off the back to chill on. Staff is curious and the atmosphere is relaxed. A surprising find. I think you'll love it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Very good seafood gumbo! Everything was cooked perfect and had a nice amount of heat to it! The strawberry leche cake and coconut ice cream was seriously good and helped get over some of that heat. Waitress was very friendly. I can't wait to come back"}

{"text":"We had heard raves about Musa from a coworker.  Everyone was friendly and attentive, and we were greeted with energy!  I chose to start with the watermelon mojito (fresh melon juice, with a slight taste of rind) which was very refreshing and not too sweet.  For seconds I had a rum runner, also delicious and tastes like yummy rum candy.  We had the Cajun joojoo wings for an appetizer.  I couldn't stop licking up the sauce, and he said they were in his top 10 for doneness and non-sweet, yummy sauce.  He had the bacon wrapped pork, I had the seafood curry.  He was amazed that the pork was so moist and tender.  I sopped every bit of curry sauce up with the roti bread.  All I could have asked for was more sauce, because it was glorious.  We'll definitely be back to try the deck dining.  If there had been some sort of fan on the deck, we would have braved the heat to dine outside."}
{"text":"Today my children and I went to Musa to eat.  We had Seafood curry, chipotle shrimp, and tres leche.  Our server Kenny was attentive and very polite.  The food was excellent and the atmosphere was pleasant as well.  We will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood.  Tasty, friendly, and just good. the plantain chips with chimichurri were good--a nice start.  The gumbo was delicious.  The menu is small but seems to be so well executed.  The service was super friendly.  There is a small outdoor deck but the weather did not cooperate for us to use.  Looking forward to a return trip to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I can't express just how excited to have this restaurant (with bar!) in my hood.  Food was phenomenal.  Plantain chips with chimichurri: amazing, want a bottle of this chimichurri.  Fried avocado: delicious.  Pea Dahl: amazing and healthy with baby spinach, yes!  Tried friend's shrimp po boy: yum!  Another friend got the seafood gumbo and was raving.  PLUS: $3 sangria!!!  Dream come true.  Owner is delightful and staff were all attentive and hustling.  Yay beechview!!  Also I heard plans for a Sunday fun day on the deck with bar and band.  Can't wait!  Support this place!  Don't let it go!"}
