{"text":"On Friday oct 13,2017
After hockey game flames/senators.
I was removed from casino.... reason \"drunk\"
None at my table thought I was rude,obnoxious,loud, out of line in any way.
I pointed and asked all 8 people present.
When I was forcibly taken out even my chips on table were refused.
Please contact me if you were at my table Friday night, I will split my winnings.

Calgary police and casino staff no help.
Only social media left.
Boycott this nasty casino!"}
{"text":"The Cowboys Restaurant had a fantastic server named Pam who helped us in the restaurant a few days ago. She provided extraordinary service, and was very attentive to us. The pizza was also tasty and i think it was half off at the time we went. The casino was nice, but I will return because of the great service."}
{"text":"The new Stampede Casino is one of the best in the city. They have cheap food specials everyday, the card tables are clean and new and they have been booking some great bands lately.
Now I know they're advertising New Years Eve with Glass Tiger, but they really have had good bands perform here. I caught Seven Mary Three in September and missed both Soul Asylum and Blind Melon who also played there in the last month or so. Yeah, they book bands like the Stampeders too, but sometimes, sometimes, they get good acts.
Just a clean, professional casino and their Big Sky Showroom is a great venue for bands because it's not big and offers a real intimate setting. I hope they keep booking good acts. I'll be back if they do. Plus, I want to take advantage of their cheap steak sandwich on Friday afternoons...."}
{"text":"Really busy especially on Saturday nights. They have cowboys nightclub and Melrose bar inside the casino. Lots of blackjack tables bring lots of money it gets expensive quick."}
{"text":"this tries to pass itself off as a metro cool casino and its a DIVE! Some of the most unfriendly miserable staff I've ever met. I really felt bad for them, from the bouncers, to the bartenders to the dealers... they all looked miserable, like someone just kicked their puppy. Forget asking anyone for help, they were all aloof. 
Bathrooms are gross are really need some major renos. Busted doors/locks, leaky sinks, filthy mirrors, think dive bar bathroom. Looks pretty on the outside but super low energy atmosphere especially for a Friday. I was really disappointed because I was excited to go . 

I'd hit up Deerfoot any day over this"}
{"text":"This by far has one of the best experiences for me in Calgary. Not only it is because it's absolutely crowded with fun loving beautiful girls, but overall ambience of a casino with dancing girls and bars and a club inside immediately put you in a happy place. I don't gamble, but this place certainly makes it look classy.

It's a definite place to go for anyone looking for a great experience. You will keep going back, I know I will."}
{"text":"This is a review mainly for the Cowboys poker room.

+Spacious poker room with comfy chairs and relatively new poker tables
+No-frills and friendly dealers
+Free hot and cold drinks for players, waitresses available if you want food/alcohol
+Well-kept bathrooms just a couple steps from your table
+Staff and security were generally laid-back

-A/C turned way too high, takes me about an hour and a lot of warm water to get used to the temperature
-Casino gets quite loud and rowdy on weekends and game nights, especially with the nightclub pretty much right next door
-Underground parkade is not the best for low cars, and fills up quickly on busy nights"}
{"text":"This is Calgary's newest casino but I still think you'll have more fun at Elbow River Casino; it's more festive and lively.

That being said, Stampede Casino is nicely laid out in a giant circular fashion with the bar in the middle and the tables and slots surrounding it. On the outer rim are the various food venues including a cafe and even a mod Asian noodle house! I attended my first ever boxing match(es) there and that was quite the experience and bruhaha. Thereafter, we grabbed some food and headed to the roulette tables which to my pleasant surprise were a $0.50 min bet while Elbow Rivers is $1.00. All in all, a fun time if you're out with friends and making an evening of it.

But wow, whomever chose their decor scheme? The 70's called and they want their pukey colour combos back!"}
{"text":"Worst casino ever ! They are stealing money from customers and letting in minors. A man stole money from me in the casino and they caught the man never called the police at all. This is just the start next of all we were there doing charity work for cancer and they full out know what happened and never did one thing. One employee told me that a group of workers stole my money!"}
{"text":"Pretty sick joint but there was a lemon in the lime bucket which kinda rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"This is a monkey ran operation.  A bunch of wannabe bouncers trying to get a job doing something besides each other. They cater to each other's ego and nothing else. Rude and crude and total imbeciles.  They have no clue about how real people make it in the world. Security at the doors are a bunch of idiots and won't last long. As for the casino staff I hope they don't have to live by the logic of the front door staff.  
What a serious joke of an an operation.  Hope the Stampede can find a better business than this to be representing them so close by."}
{"text":"A B-list casino trying to be A-list, without doing anything to be viewed as A-list. 

My first time here was the other day, and I found that the staff were clueless, and unhelpful. I asked someone where I could find an ATM and he looked me dead in the eyes, shrugged, and walked away. Restrooms were dirty, and needed some serious updating/repairs. Locks on the bathroom doors didn't work, garbage all over the floor, dirty smeared mirrors, and the inside of the stalls were so incredibly dirty and gross I actually gagged. After walking into the facilities and refusing to use them, we promptly left.

I don't know if it was just an off night, or if this casino is always like this, but my first impression wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I like this place even though Im taking a star off because a) its tiny (Im used to Vegas.... in fact this is the only casino Ive been to that isnt Vegas so unfortuantely Im a little biased) and b) it has ONLY ONE CRAPS TABLE ! In the whole place. Craps is hubby's favourite game (its alot of fun and its so sociable. People actually VOTE for other people to win, rather than trying to beat people.)  It was buzzing and so busy last night, on the way to the Bryan Adams concert across the street at the Saddledome. But not so busy it was obnoxious. I like the costumes (cowboy boots and hats) on the staff and the restaurant Zen 8 was AMAZING. And SOOOOO cheap. Ive never eaten in a Calgary restaurant w such reasonable prices and very nice staff. They cooked our meal right in front of us on the tepanyaki table. Our surrounding fellow diners were nice as well and we chatted about various things (I was carrying a Kate Spade purse and my fellow diner was commiserating about her recent suicide.) Overall I really liked it and will be back, as its location is so convenient as we are at the saddledome so often. Thanks Cowboys !"}
{"text":"I like it here. I have not really been to any other casino in Calgary but if I have an hour to kill in the downtown area I may stop in. $2.75 for a glass of wine on a Thurs night 4pm-8pm! WOW! I love deals. But then they say you pay for it in the end right? 
I will play table games in Vegas but not at Stampede. I stick to the slots, love my Keno and I actually do quite well. 
The staff are great, I tip well and the place is kept up -  washrooms always clean. I would not come here if they were a mess. This place has the coin to at least keep itself clean. 
The Security staff all wear black cowboy hats -- for sure a Stampede feel! Kids not allowed of course.
I would not come in here to sit at the bar so cannot comment on TVs or anything like that.
There is free parking in the lower parking garage that says CASINO PARKING.
I do not have really any experience with the food here... so I cannot comment on that.
You can get a players card and swipe each time you come in to accumulate points.
The casino is open until 3am daily, I believe. 
Calgary entertainment at its finest! My husband does not like it here. They do not have draft beer here for him and he loses his shirt every time! Speaking of shirts, dress is casual here, this is for sure NOT Vegas in that regard!"}
{"text":"Here's one for the night club side of things:

Well Cowboys, another Stampede season and somehow you managed to get me through your doors for my obligatory one visit per year. Do I go? Well, this year it was for a Strumbella's concert. Last year was for some gambling before a show at the dome... they always seem to get one of my 365 nights per year.

Cowboys is like the Stampede. No, not the part of Stampede that celebrates western heritage and creates community for Calgarians... It's that part of Stampede where you know full well going into it that you're going to pay far too much money, have an average experience and leave with more than a couple regrets. But as the shame has slowly slipped away over the seasons, next year you'll find yourself counting down the days - getting absolutely pumped for it to happen again.

Multiple ID checks and scans, a prison style mug shot when you enter and even a pat down - Cowboys has got the beef cake TSA working security for them. It's always a fun flashback to those fresh out of Highschool party days, getting dragged out to the meat market scene, waiting in line forever only to have a bouncer let your gal friends in and deny you because they're over their male quota and \"you've got the wrong kind of shoes on.\" Or, if you were looking especially fly (or slipped the door guy a $20,) you'd get the privilege of paying a cover price so you can access a room to wait in a line, no, a crowd, to buy some over priced Budweiser, and scream short sentences at those friends you came with over top of music you don't like.

Why did we ever do this?

Lucky for Cowboys, there's still plenty of people in Calgary who haven't asked themselves this question. Maybe I'm being a little harsh... Like Stampede, it is what you make it. Go in with your expectations in check and it's a good spot for a bachelor/bachelorette party. If you feel like drinking way too much and going \"woooooooo\" out a taxi window on your way home - this is the place you need to be."}
{"text":"I cannòt believe how honest these guys are!!!! I had a number of drinks and instead if letting me bet they sent me home in a taxi. A mistake avoided and friends for life, the employees of cowboys clearly have a mandate to ensure you arrive home with most of your money. What a great casino!!!!!"}
{"text":"B - List. Ok, Las Vegas it is not. This is Calgary and management has done a good job of putting the space together. The circular layout works albeit I was expecting a larger space. The epicenter finds an interesting rotunda bar replete with big screen TVs, live DJ on weekends & hostesses who are short on fabric. From this vantage point you can watch the gamblers and wanna-bees into the early hours. The casino has plenty of slots, card tables and the usual craps and roulette. Drink specials will run you $5.00 for wine and beer. I did not find the food 'cheap' as others have suggested but it is good. There are food 'specials' almost every day of the week. The seafood at $25 per person on Saturdays seemed to be a hit although I could not stomach the aroma. There appears to be a buffet option as well. Again, I did not find it 'cheap.' Some will find the decor hard on the eyes. There is free parking underground but make sure to get underground before 6 pm on weekends and busy weekdays. The general free underground parking is on Level P2. Level P1 is reserved for VIPs and you won't be allowed up. At -40 C, underground parking is a bonus to be sure. If you do not wish to gamble there are a couple of couches and a plasma screen TV for those that want to watch a hockey game or other sporting event (This area is not obvious. There are no blinking lights or neon signs pointing you to sit down and simply watch hockey). No one will bother you and you can enjoy the atmosphere until boredom sets in. Overall, this place is good to chill particularly if you are heading over to the dome. You make your own happiness here, if there is such a thing within a casino atmosphere. Go - Have Fun - But don't make this place a regular or home."}
{"text":"I'm not much for gambling.

I really do not know what I am doing, and I get bored easy. I also won't spend much so my 15$ didn't go too far ! But 
I came because my GF loves the slots!

We were greeted at the door by security in a black cowboy hat. I guess that it must be the theme seeing it's called \"Cowboys\" 

The casino was pretty quiet tonight.

I didn't wander around too much, but saw a variety of staff. Nobody seemed to be too over bearing, it seemed pretty laid back.

Well that is until we went outside where some random guy was yelling obscenities to himself and whoever would listen. 

I guess he didn't hit the jackpot. 
As they say \"Know your limit\""}
{"text":"I've always had a good time here. There is a number of tables and machines, good amenities, and everything is well maintained. There's enough entertainment here to keep everyone busy even if you're not interested in gambling. 

The down side here is that with Cowboys nightclub apart of this building, the crowd can be young and obnoxious. Also, due to its proximity to the Saddledome, it can get quite crowded here before or after an event. Though, with the casino being close to the Dome, you can conveniently make a stop here as part of your plans for the evening like having a place to grab dinner before a Flames game or to have drinks after."}
{"text":"Although this review is listed for the Stampede Casino, it's actually for the Big Sky room located within the Stampede Casino.

I've been here probably 4 times and all for UFC fights. I was there this past Saturday and it was great. The fights were awesome, the waitresses were super cute and fast and the drinks and food were delicious.

Had I reviewed this the last time I was there, I would have given it 2 stars for the quality of service but these 2 waitresses were on top of our orders and made sure we were never thirsty - huge shout out to the blond and brunette waitresses working Big Sky Saturday night :)

If you like UFC and mma, come watch it at the Big Sky room. It's a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I play poker...and by \"poker\", I mean no-limit Texas Hold-em. So my review is tilted exclusively to that.

In short, the dealers seem to be on the ball and no-nonsense. I like that. Keep the players in line, everyone plays by the same rules. Thank you. A little chit chat from the dealer is ok, just so long as it doesn't affect the pace of the game.

Upkeep of the premises was good. Bathroom was clean, and the tables were not worn.

The list for players seems to be ordered well and tables are maintained at a decent ratio in relation to the length of the player list and anticipated demand. Good job.

All in all a good experience. I was able to play without having to wait an hour and my table was never lacking drinks or players.

I'll be back and look forward to it."}
{"text":"I have tried to avoid going to any Casinos in Calgary simply because I love them and I know once I start I will go all the time.  I used to dress up in a black dress and wear lipstick and go to the casino in Montreal till wee hours in the morning pretending I was a big high roller from China, I am afraid I may have to start this obsession again because last night we went to this one.

Wow, this is like 10 blocks from my home and it has free parking; this is an all together huge seduction tactic for me, imagine me getting into my car and leaving it in underground heated parking that is free and sauntering directly to a slot machine at any hour of the given night.

They took my coat last night at the lobby and we were able to circulate the slot area.  Now I like to venture into a casino in intervals, checking out each section.  I obviously haven't been to a Casino for a long time as I was perplexed that the slots did not take your change, you could just slip your bill in and cash out getting a computerized stub which you could reinsert into any other machine of your choice.  

2 cents slot machine, I was absolutely tantalized until I realised you had to play these x 25.  

My honey and friends were Casino green so we decided on the nickel slots and I didn't play much as I was so entertained by their enthusiasm.  There were squeals of delight from winning ten credits, huge total earning of 50 cents and then tormented sounds from losing 5 dollars.  At one point my honey was aimlessly walking around with a 25 cent vouture trying to find that lucky machine.  It was really serious situation and it was all too funny in the end.

This place is really nice, it is only one level but it is spacious enough.   The staff here are really nice but they don't take kindly to photos being taken.  The place is fairly clean and elegant plus I would really love to take in the Asian buffet here.  

Soda pop is free while you play and the seats are fairly comfortable.  We left and everyone had actually won a little something so our green Casino friends had already made plans to return for another evening very very soon.

This idea makes me very happy; I am slowly taking out the lipstick from my makeup kit and setting it aside for these special outings."}
{"text":"Honestly worst place in the city EVER. 
If you like half dressed teeny boopers this is your Paradise Thursday - Sunday. 
The club; good luck on getting served, drinks are shit. 
The restaurants; 
The middle bar, THE WORST SERVICE in my entire life. I've been here 5-6 times before I couldn't believe the shit service I had received EVERYTIME. I can't believe it took me so long. 
You will wait at least an HR for food, good luck every getting another drink because the staff just talk amoungst themselv and don't give a shit to serve. Worst attitudes. 
The games are all.1:4 it's terrible. 

I hate this place, worst service & worst everything.
Don't waste your time or money, the flames are the only reason this establishment is still open."}
{"text":"Darn. Their cheap $2.99 eggs and bacon breakfast at the Grasslands Cafe has been upped to $5.99.  I'm wondering now what would be the new price of the sunday brunch once the 1912 reopens."}
{"text":"Wow. We went there and the dancers in a Wednesday were incredibly homophobic. When we first got there the staff was amazing but afterwords the dancers were disgustingly homophobic. I don't even know what else to say. As someone who has been in the industry that is unacceptable. No homophobia"}
{"text":"Coming up from Whitefish MT for a long weekend getaway gambling was not the focus.  But the Cowboys casino was kitty corner to our condo.  So we stopped in for a short visit Saturday evening after a night on the town.  Figured it would be another giant ashtray with slots surrounding the perimeter.  Like most smaller casinos in the U.S. Outside of Vegas.  Anyway walked in with very low expectations.  

Was pleasantly surprised.  I could not smell any smoke in the air.  Not sure if this was the Calgary populace which simply did not smoke or if the the ventilation was on another level.  Either way I was very pleased and comfortable.  Security staff lined the way in.  No big smiles from them but was not intimidated either.  They just sort of let you know they in place to keep the peace and stayed out of the way.

The Casino was happening.  More of younger hip crowed stopping in for a little fun before or after hitting the town.  Not the half in the bag retirees one will find in many US casinos.  We did not gamble on this trip in.  Instead we headed over for a bite to eat at one of the bars.
This is when things went down hill.  

So plenty of hip people just chilling around.  We found two seats at the end of the bar to relax.  The moment we put our order in the local drunk sits down next to us in the only open seat.  -Just Great-  After a little back and forth, clearly sending the 'don't talk to us and move on' he just won't give up.  Instead stepping it up.  -bad move- The bartending who who should not have served this guy did just that.  He should have called some of the security guys over and hauled this guy away but did not.  So I had to deal with him myself.  After a heated and mildly public confrontation he decided to find something else to do.  Here is where the Casio should have stepped in.  Instead of handing me a 25 Dollar bill for some mediocre quesadillas and two beers.  The bartender should have comped them.  He apologized which was nice but a day late and dollar short since I had to effectively clean up the drunken mess harassing my Wife.  

Anyway, my Wife has not desire to go back but I think this was just a bit of bad luck on our part.  I think the Casino could have done a better but we had been off in a dark corner of a bar.  About as far away from security as we could have been.  I will chalk this up as a one off.  Everything else seemed pretty fun and trendy all things considered.  

I headed back the next day to gamble a few of those cheap Canadian Dollars away.  I was shocked to find the roulette table allowed for .50 Cent inside minimums.  Normally 1 Dollar is as low as it goes if you can even find them.  Twenty Canadian Loonies can go a long way if lady luck is on your side even just a little.  

The tables games don't open until Noon and remain open until I think 3 or 4 AM.  The slots don't turn on until around 10 AM if I recall correctly.  

I do plan on visiting again.  Four stars but I plan on dropping that quickly if we run into any more problems."}
