{"text":"My wife and I, we frequent this cafe / bistro several times a week. Owners are super friendly and from time to time, give out cookies for my son. We frequent this place to get their coffee, which we think is pretty good. Better than the franchise or your office coffee. We have yet to try their sandwiches , which I heard is super delicious. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"i was in the neighborhood last week and saw their sign claiming to have the \"king of sandwiches\" for their special, so I stopped in. Josh, the owner, made the sandwich fresh while I waited. A steak and cheese... it was delicious! And Josh is such a friendly guy. Really enjoyed the chat AND the sandwich. Afterwards he whipped me up an espresso which topped it all off very nicely.  I'll go back again for sure next time I'm in that part of town."}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches, great atmosphere, friendly staff. Recommend the pulled pork and Philly steak sandwich!"}
{"text":"Really cute place in a really cute area of Brampton I didn't even know existed. The owner was super friendly and approachable and really seemed to have a passion for what he does which is always nice.  I had the grilled veggie and hummus wrap which was very flavourful. I wish Brampton had more of this type of place.  Atmosphere was really cool too. They even have some outdoor seating, which is impressive for a small place like this."}
{"text":"I was walking the beautiful neighborhood and walked up on this gem of a place.  This cafe/bistro is run by a wonderful friendly  local family.. With fresh homemade ingredients..  They have different specials everyday, breakfast all day (try their breakfast burrito) and homemade ice cream from scratch  and  yummy lattes..Grilled cheeses are amazing too..  Love local small businesses, get to know who you are by name..  Not many places like that nowadays..  :-)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Went in with a friend today, and we had a great time. The location is beautiful, and the inside of the bistro reflects the homey and welcoming exterior. The food was delicious, and the owner was friendly and warm the entire time. Everything tasted fresh, clean and full of flavour.  I'm definitely going to be stopping by this place again and bringing friends and family with me. If you haven't been yet, you're really missing out."}
