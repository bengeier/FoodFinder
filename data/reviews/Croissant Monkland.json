{"text":"I'm sitting here at Croissant Monkland right now eating a chocolate eclair and it's the best I've ever had. It's painful to interrupt my eating to write this review. Great service and great location."}
{"text":"Comfortable is a good way to describe this place although if you want a table get there by 10:30 am especially in summer.  It is one of those places where people will meet, spread out and stay.  I either go or go get a croissant and coffee almost every Sunday.  I have also had their omelettes and some soups which are good.  My favorite is the mushroom omelette  but they haven't had them in a while.  I have heard that the stuffed crepes and the no sugar added date muffins are also good but I am devoted to the classic croissant.
I especially love the terrasse in summer, large almost always sunny and they have these chairs that rock."}
{"text":"The food tastes ok, but the service specially from the owners it's  dreadful. If you don't want to leave with a bitter taste get your croissants elsewhere."}
{"text":"Before my last visit, this would have been a raving review. The food is cheap, varied, and the service is (was) excellent. 

Until we went there a couple of weeks ago and saw a worker drop a spinach danish on the floor and then put it back for sale. We, of course, took time to notify the manager who just shrugged and didn't even bother telling off the worker. 

Second attempt at reminding the manager just before we left resulted in blatant lying about the danish being removed and we left praying for whomever poor soul would end up having a lunch that was chilling on a dirty floor that day."}
{"text":"It's a comfortable place, when we want to grab a little bite during the day. We randomly stopped by the area because of an appointment at our garage for winter tire change. My husband had a croissant with omelet and ham, with a cup of double espresso allongé. I took a plain croissant, and café latté. The waiter served my husband a croissant warmed up, whereas the croissant that i ordered was served as it is. Croissant still crunchy but not the best one among those I've tried. I would be likely to return if i pass by again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bakery in NDG, and among my top 5 in Montreal. Yes, I know this is a very big claim to make in Montreal! 

I have enjoyed Croissant Monkland's pastries for a couple of years now. This is a friendly neighborhood bakery with seriously good food. The croissants and financiers are on the greasy side, but seriously delicious. The almond croissant is almost a meal by itself, and makes a delightful snack on a cold winter day. The pastries and peas are pretty good too. 

I have spent many working hours here accompanied by a financier along with either an americano or a Kusmi tea. 

The patio chairs are very comfy and you can enjoy the sun in the morning and early afternoon. They also have sandwiches, quiche and crepes, which come with a side salad. I am particularly fond of their crepes. They carry beer too.

Earlier this year they opened a branch on Sherbrooke."}
{"text":"Delicious Croissant shop and cafe. Yohaness welcomed us with a big smile and friendly service. We tried the blueberry croissant and some other pastries and everything was delicious. Their caffe latte is pretty tasty too. If you are in the area and looking for a coffee break this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Located on Sherbrooke in NDG, this is a great local spot. Very reasonably priced food in a pleasant atmosphere. Very clean and simple decor.  They serve sandwiches, quiche, pastries, coffee and have a bakery.  There are several tables to sit at inside. Street parking is available outside. 
Definitely a place that I plan to come back to ..."}
{"text":"Love this place on monk land as their croissants are freshly made and the quality is great! The service is nice and they have a huge variety of other pastries too, not only just croissants. In addition, they have French sandwiches which are all huge and delicious. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place more stars because the food is incredible, but after having gone to both the locations on Sherbrooke and on Monkland, I have to say I really disliked the service. Cold omelette and dirty cutlery, not to mention chaotic ordering, I would only return here when I'm starving or just buy from their bakery to take home."}
{"text":"Croissant Monkland était, il ya à peu près deux ans, la meilleure boulangerie pâtisserie du quartier, devançant même la pâtisserie de Nancy, cette dernière ayant été à un niveau de 
qualité très élevé il y a environ dix ans. Pour Croissant Monkland, depuis les deux dernières années, grande déception.  Il n'y a plus du tout le raffinement ni la variété que l'on connaissait. On espère que cela reviendra... Par contre, leur pain est resté très bon, ainsi que les viennoiseries, plus ou moins. Il n'y a plus de ces délicieuses danoises aux abricots ou autres.  Les éclairs sont désolants, rien à voir avec de vrais éclairs et de très loin, oublier la crème pâtissière.  Leur omelette croissant sont sympas, avec la petite portion de salade.  Cet été 2017, les viennoiseries étaient tellement graisseuses, faisant aussi d'immenses tâches de gras sur une double épaisseur d'emballage de papier, et sans que cela soit corrigé malgré les remarques répétées de plusieurs clients. Service relativement courtois, efficace...Bonne ambiance de détente, patio très agréable l'été."}
{"text":"cozy little bakery of the neighborhood, one of the best places in town to get a financier or an almond croissant. The bread is great too. this is my fav spot to relax and enjoy the sunlight on summer weekends. i only wish they had non dairy milk for the vegan/lactose intolerant."}
{"text":"I've since returned on a few occasions when it wasn't busy. The croissants were exactly what I was craving and the service was very nice."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places on Monkland to grab a bite and have a nice coffee. The service here is always warm &friendly , the prices are reasonable and the food , pastries and everything else is always fresh ! They don't have a ton of seating inside so it might be a bit trickier to find a seat in the Colder seasons BUT they have a nice big terrace available in the summertime and of course you can also take your food or beverage as takeout. I've been here a few times and while I did enjoy everything I've tried , I do have some personal favourites , such as the chocolatine , croissants(full size and mini), almond croissant and any of their mini pies ! They also offer various types of homemade bread, macaroons , danishes (full size and mini) , cakes , cookies ,sandwiches and salads which are pretty great as well :) Everytime I come in here I have to stop myself from asking them for one of everything please ! Lol My one comment is that I think they changed their recipe for the danishes , they're still good now but when this place first opened they were phenomenal, so I guess that would be my one complaint. I mentioned also that they offer mini versions of some of their items like danishes , pies and croissant which is nice for kids and also for any indecisive adults like myself who want to try a few different things :) I'm Definitely coming back here again and again ....and again !"}
{"text":"1 star is not for the pastrys or croissant. 
Croissants are tasty but very greasy will I go back?
Yes I will after all it's a decent pastry shop. 
 There was this Lady behind the counter not the regular employees iam talking about the one might be the owner or the menager ( the one with evil eye necklace) she is extremely unfriendly never similes she has a unhappy unfriendly face , if I hesitate to go here  she will be the only reason ."}
{"text":"Pratique pour placoter tranquile entre amis ou lire son journal. La patisserie que j'ai pris ( gateau au fromage ) n'etait pas vraiment frais mais cela avait l'air tellement bon ..."}
