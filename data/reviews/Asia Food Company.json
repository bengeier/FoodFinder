{"text":"Several items on the shelf are way past their expiration date. It's 04/20/2017 and they are still selling soup bases that expired in 2015. Make sure you check the expiration date on everything that you buy. Storage here is not well-kept and frozen dumplings have previously defrosted and are now broken and stuck together.

Here's an example (see my picture):

Pepero chocolate sticks, expires 05/16/2017 and already has MOLD on every one of the sticks. The sticks in the remaining packages could be felt all stuck together and is likely to be molded too. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD OF HAPPENED IF SOMEONE ACTUALLY ATE THIS STUFF. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME THAT THEY COULD EVEN BE SELLING THIS.

DON'T END UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM and don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"I really like this place, so I'll get to the 3-star rating in a second. In terms of Asian groceries, this place has it all! They have pork belly, beef ribs cut flanken style (Korean BBQ short ribs), Asian produce (including longan), Asian medicinal herbs, teas, different brands of Asian ramen, frozen dim sum, and frozen dumplings. EVERYTHING! It really is a one stop shop for all your Asian grocery needs!

The back of the market has a booth for Asian cooked foods. They have zongzi, char siu, roast pork belly, soy sauce chicken, and roast duck! AWESOME! In terms of taste, their cooked items taste better than Park to Shop. However, I once went shopping and wanted to order roast pork belly. As I approached the hot case where they store the roast items, I noticed there were some flies that had flown into the hot case, and they were flying all over the food. It was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. Just GROSS. Such an unpleasant, unhygienic observation warrants a 2-star deduction. It doesn't take away from the fact that they have a lot of good stuff, but I personally plan on staying away from their roasted meats.  -_-"}
{"text":"If Park-to-Shop offers better prices, this authentic Asian grocery offers better selection.

Housed in the renovated Asian town center, this under-the-radar Chinese grocery store is generally less busy than its counterpart several blocks away, Park-to-Shop. As mentioned above, prices are overall a tad more expensive, but occasionally you find a cheaper deal here. The selection in almost every department (vegetables, meats, seafood, snacks, noodles, Asian marinating/noodle/cooking sauces, etc) is larger than P2S and quality also seems a little better. Need pork mini spareribs for steamed black bean pork? Looking for bamboo leaves to make zongzi (Chinese wrapped rice dumplings)? Longing for douhua (sweet tofu pudding)? This is the place to get them! The only thing I couldn't find here was mugicha (Japanese barley tea) mix, for which I had to go to an even more specialized, and more expensive, Asian grocery store that was farther away.

My usual shopping pattern is to hit P2S first, then come here for what I couldn't find there. If you know what specific Asian ingredients/foods you are looking for, this is the place to go.

They also throw in free snacks/bakery goods at the checkout counter sometimes, which is a nice touch. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I would say the best overall asian grocery store in Cleveland is here.  The facility is large, clean, and have many products I couldn't even imagine.  The staff here is always helpful and friendly so don't hesitate to ask someone if you can't find something or have any questions.  The cooked food section is amazing!  Real, authentic, and delicious asian eats such as roast pork, sesame balls, yau-tiu (fried cruellers), soy milk, and my FAVORITE, their duck!  They have an amazing selection of korean and filipino foods, but a bit short on the chinese products.  Fish dept is a bit smaller than the other places, though they do have the essentials.  Not the busiest market in the area, but definitely the most fun, and happiest atmosphere.  I go to other markets once in awhile and though more people, the staff and customers seem to be drudging their time.  Here, the staff are casually socializing with anyone that has questions and having a good time.  

Although everyone has their own experiences and are free to have their own opinion about places, I find some of the 1-star reviews are a bit mis-directed.  Two people had issues with products (snack and fruit) which no-one could tell had any issues until actually opening it up.  Box is unexpired, or the fruit looks fresh on the outside, how can anyone short of x-ray vision know that the item was bad.  Seems like a supplier issue, not their fault.  Probably should've brought it to their attention and see how they would've handled it.  Though I can say they may have some items past their time but they haven't failed to address them when brought to their attention in my experiences.  

Anyways I digress.  The store always changes a little bit after a few months so I don't know if they're trying new layouts or if they do it to keep people on their toes lol.  Either way I always seem to have to ask where things are when they're moved but they're more than helpful.  They have a small cafeteria/ restaurant in the back which has some decent Pho, though their spicy soup (bun bo hue) is the one to go for.  In short, this place has all the essentials you'll need, great friendly staff, clean big store, some products are lacking, but their hot prepared food is the best bar none!  ...Did i forget to mention they have fidget spinners? Ha!"}
{"text":"I like this place, and more importantly my wife likes this store. It is often a learning experience for me because even though I've traveled in Asia, there is always something new to see or eat. My wife usually ends up spending most of her time buying fruit and junk food that remind her of her time in Japan, while I just wander aimlessly through the store looking at things that hardly seem edible to a Parma bred white guy. For some reason, even after being immersed in many cultures, Asian food is a tough one for me. When it's good, it is great. When it is bad, well, I could tell you some tales. Anyway, store is great, but I still try to dissuade my wife from buying the shrimp in the fish area. Usually she ignores my advice with nary a word."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this is handedly the premier Asian foods market in Cleveland. If you're looking for that ingredient you just can't seem to find at Heinen's or Whole Foods this is the place to stop. That being said this review is focused on Asia Tea House found neatly tucked in the rear of the store, and offering up the most warming of comfort foods cooked to order.

Bún Bò Hue is my favorite noodle soup so when it is on the menu it's a must order. The bowl here came out pipping hot, with lofting aromas that had me salivating. The broth was as spicy and rich as any I've had, though perhaps not quite as complex or deep. I sensed a lack of fermented fish flavor one expects from this broth. The noodles were cooked to perfection and quantity was on point, I was able to slurp down the last noodle before the broth over cooked them. The chunks of beef and pork were juicy and plentiful, and the only thing missing are the congealed pork blood cubes, though I find this to be common practice in attempts to make the dish more appealing to the American palate. 

On this particular sit down I enjoyed an order of shrimp and pork summer rolls that were delightfully fresh, and some of the largest I've seen (pictures attached). 

As you're preparing to depart, stuffed as you are, I recommend their take home options. They offer delicious roast duck and chicken, soy sauce chicken, BBQ pork and roasted pork by the pound.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The prices are not expensive, the cooked food is great, and the selection is decent. It's the best smelling Asian market around."}
{"text":"This is probably the cleanest Asia market in Cleveland. But this might just be making up for other things it lack, like fresh produce!! I've been here countless times, but every time I come, I see some form of rotting vegetable or fruit on the stands. In the past, I've even purchased some bell peppers that looked perfectly fine on the outside but had live bugs crawling on the inside. Eeek!! I'm sticking with Park to Shop forever."}
{"text":"I am prone to exaggeration. When asked how many pieces of cake I'd like, I'm apt to say a million. On a hot, sweltering day, if asked what the temperature is, I'm likely to say a billion degrees. However, understand that this is no exaggeration when I say that there are hundreds of thousands of bottles of soy sauce in this place.

The new Asia Town Center at 38th and St. Clair is impressive on the outside, though it looks more like a trendy, two floor school than it does shopping center. Inside, a majority of the bottom floor is taken up by Asia Food Company, a massive near 115,000 square feet that a Wal*Mart may have a bit of an issue filling. And, no, they don't do a very good job, either. The aisles are wide, and shelves are puzzlingly bare, and puzzlingly and curiously placed

For instance, the soy sauce remark: In each aisle, there is a four foot by eight foot section of soy sauces after you've walked in and shopped a twenty foot expanse of soy sauces. And that's not including the oyster sauces, the fish sauces, the teriyaki sauces, and other fermented delights. 

There are Korean Goods next to Japanese goods. Vietnamese next to Chinese. Dogs and Cats. Apples and Oranges. Things very unlike the other, in other words.

The prepared foods section would make the Giant Eagle Kitchens look like Morton's. There were tables interspersed within a bank of unused freezers that you could sit at and eat. I didn't dare approach. I'd already eaten like, a thousand burritos, and it was a million degress and...

A plus in the favor of this joint is that the smell inside -- which has been somewhat offensive to western noses, traditionally inside these predominantly Asian stores -- was tame and actually pleasant. The fish section looked well taken care of, and had no scent whatsoever. The tilapia swam happily, unaware that they were meant to be on some hipster's taco in just a few hours.

All in all, the products are okay and fairly cheap. I, of course, bought soy sauce."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Asian market. It is huge and clean. The selection of items is surprisingly great. This store is a big plus for Cleveland."}
{"text":"Nice clean place and has a good selection of Asian groceries. The prices are a bit higher compared to the other grocery stores in the neighborhood, but it is very nice and clean."}
{"text":"This is a big Asian grocery store with lots of variety: we saw Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese foods - to name some very broad categories. There's a restaurant in the back, along with prepared food like dim sum for takeaway/takeout. The building itself also houses an art gallery, several restaurants, a massage place, etc. - so plenty to do."}
{"text":"Awesome grocery store with plenty to choose from.  Make sure you walk all the way to the back to enjoy the fine take-out options.  Great location with plenty of private parking."}
{"text":"If you want to phone a plant, why not call a flower?

The cauliflower was going bad at Asia Food Co, but it was devoured by all the hungry fishes in the pool outside the store/mall. 

I remember the Hong Kong milk tea from last time was pretty good, definitely one of the better Asian drinks I've had in CLE. 

But they cannot have a five because of the produce. The girls at the front were nice but did not know what they were doing with pricing. It took awhile for me and my rotting cauliflower to get out of there. But then that's what she said."}
{"text":"I've been going here a while now, this is definitely the best rounded of all the Asian groceries in the area. Not only are the prices pretty comparable but they have a number of higher priced goods that aren't available at the other groceries. Produce is usually good and the prices are good too. Their overall selection is excellent and their customer service is by far the best of the Asian groceries (the only one that almost always has a native English speaker there). And even the ones who don't know English very well are polite - I couldn't find the bay leaves and I asked the cashier. She didn't know what bay leaves are but walked around the store and asked the different employees if they knew and after 3 minutes, we found it. I appreciate the effort. I'm used to them saying \"I don't speak English [and I'm too lazy to help you].

The freshly prepared selection in the back is great - their Vietnamese sandwiches are excellent as are their steamed buns and freshly prepared tofu products. The meat is good priced though my only complaint is their ground pork has way too much fat."}
{"text":"I have gone there numerous times for their bakery alone.  Their baked goods (especially the BBQ pork buns) are delicious, and very reasonably priced.

Get there early in the day, in my experience they have run out!

Oh yeah, they also have a nice selection of asian groceries."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Asian markets.  This place is kind of a mini destination if you ask me. There are art galleries and a Korean restaurant upstairs. The place is still not very well know so it is not hipster-ed out yet.

Moving right a long.  The market.  They have amazingly fresh produce.  It is really economical to buy your veggies and just about anything else from Asia!.  The cafe in the back still serves up a great bowl of Pho amongst many other treats.  They also have prepared foods as well.  The BBQ pork, Squid, ribs are all very good.  They even have piggy heads.  Who does not like a good pig head every now and then!

They have some baked goods that are really tasty.  They have these amazing spring rolls that I absolutely have to devour every time I'm in the area.

This place is very big and very clean. There is one thing this place is lacking, and that is that funky Asian market stench,  kind of like a mix of old fish and poop.  I am not complaining either!

The service is fast and friendly, they even remember your name.

Oh, on a side note they have Kafir Lime leaves, lemon grass, decent seafood, some nice meats, and a few Hispanic products as well.  Most meat at Asian markets have a high freak me out factor. Not here.  

So come here, trip out the art galleries, listen to the Japanese drum group, visit Negative Space upstairs, then hit the market and cure your munchies.  I would even say it is a kind of cool date place my non Asian friends are baffled that this place exists.

{"text":"I'll split this review in two aspects, the eatery and the grocery. The authentic eatery will be the main reason bringing me back in the future.

---The eatery---
in the back of the store, along side the storage area. True hole in the wall. The only menu available is on the cashier counter. The dishes are customizable. They automatically charge 15% service fee, which is fine by me. Saves me the hassle to write another line of tips on the check.

For all of you milk tea fanatics - your search for home made milk tea can stop here.

- milk tea: it's NOT on the menu. When we ordered \"milk tea\", the Cantonese mama reminded us \"it's Hong Kong style huh\". It took her 5 min to make it. I saw she opened a condensed milk can. There was a tea pot on her work station. The tea itself is not overly sweet. Upon finishing the tea, I can see very fine leaves at the bottom of the glass. So I diagnosed this milk tea to be NOT made from powder.

- Hong Kong Roast pork: aka crispy roast pork belly: top layer is crispy and crunchy, middle and bottom layer are fatty and juicy. A tad salty for me. Will order again.

- Hong Kong BBQ pork: aka Char siu: taste fresh, not overnight leftover. Seasoned just right. Will order again.

On the menu they are two separate dishes. In my photo it's one dish. You can ask the Cantonese mama to combine two dishes. Just add one dollar.

All rice dishes come with sweetly pickled carrots and daikon radish. This is the spirit of Cantonese char siu dishes! The pickles are refreshing companions to balance against the fatty animal protein.

- roast duck: crispy skin, sweet, fatty and juicy. Will order again.

- three treasure rice: not what I imagined - I thought it's going to be a combo of the duck, char situ, and roast pork. Instead it's grilled pork chop and fried egg. Not bad, nothing special. Won't order next time, because when you come to a Cantonese place, you order their specialty! I can get pork chop anywhere.

- chicken summer roll: nothing special compared to other Vietnamese and Thai  joints. Like I said, when in Hong Kong diners, order Cantonese specialties!

---The grocery shopping---

- selection: seem to offer more brands per genre than Cam Asia and park to shop

- organic products not an emphasis: cam Asia exceeds in this department 

- live seafood, butcher area: when you walk by, there is no strong door, which means it's probably fresh. My mom nodded her approval. 

- specialty seeds: next to the bags of rice, there is a small shelf of \"Asian vegetable seeds\", $1 /packet. They are hard to find Asian veggies I don't see available at Petiti's. Silk melon, Chinese chives, etc. 
There was no dates, so who know how long they have been on the aisle. I bought 2 packets and planted in my garden. We'll see how they come out.

- very limited I-Mei ?? products: the food safety regulation is a known public concern in the Chinese market. (Recall the poisonous baby formula incident) I-mei is said to be the only brand that's trust-worthy. Again Cam Asia has a lot more selection. Please share with me if you what other brands are ok.

---conclusion---
So this authentic Cantonese eatery is officially on my map. To get HK style grilled dishes, I'd only come here or Li Wah. Here is inexpensive, $7 per dish, and I can mix and match different meat types. As a bonus I can do light Asian grocery shopping here."}
{"text":"Lots of choices in a huge warehouse of food.  There is a restaurant inside for a quick lunch.  Great baked goods too.  This is my favorite Asian grocery store in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I would have given it four or even five starts when it first opened and when I was so excited for a bigger and cleaner alternative to Park to Shop. However, a couple of years into its operation, I just don't feel the supermarket has been attracting enough customer flow to keep the produce fresh enough. About a year ago I saw the vacuum-packaged bamboo shoots in the dairy section all expired and I directly reported it to a store manager. Months after my unpleasant discovery, the same products were still sitting there. 
I've also seen other expired products on shelf, which I understand can be common with Chinese supermarkets, but it still makes me very uncomfortable to shop there especially after reporting the issue and seeing no change. Comparatively speaking, Park to Shop has a stronger customer flow (it is usually the preferred store for Chinese students) and they have less of an issue with expired products. Park to Shop does appear messier though. I was hoping to switch to Asia Food Co but eventually I had to switch back to Park to Shop for its more updated and complete choices.
I do want to point out that the building/complex is pretty interesting - in addition to Asia Food Co, it now has very good Korean and Vietnamese restaurants, art galleries, a beauty supply shop and a massage place (I believe). I have also seen it as a stop of Lolly the Trolley. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"The Skinny: The excellent char siew (bbq pork & duck) at the deli here bumped it up from 3-star to 4.  In comparison to nearby competitor Park to Shop, family-run Asia Food Co. carries fewer varieties of Asian dry goods and snacks but offers meat and produce superior in quality as well as a more relaxed, spacious and better ventilated shopping experience. Customer service is also very friendly, prompt, and helpful.

The long of it:
Decent Asian supermarket with well-kept meat counter and deli--will suffice for any foodie looking to brew up some Asian concoctions at home or looking to grab a quick, delicious meal, cafeteria-style.  Asia Food Co.'s selection of produce, frozen and dry goods is satisfactory, though I must agree with fellow Yelpers: there was something unsettling about the handful of empty shelves interspersed throughout the aisles.  Better display management or stocking practices, and you're up to a five-star review!

I've been to my fair share of Asian grocery stores, and the meat/butcher's counter here stood out for me.  All the meat and seafood looked clean and fresh and best of all, there wasn't even the slightest whiff of raw meat that you'll normally find at the butcher counter of say, a Giant Eagle.  Proper refrigeration, an airy, open layout, and full ventilation throughout the market no doubt lead to this rarest and rather disconcerting phenomenon: an odor-free Asian supermarket.  Sans the usual funky overtones of Asian herbs, spices, and ripening meat stewing at room temperature, Asia Food Co. won the approval of even my bf's non-Asian olfactory preferences.

The hot deli and bakery section at the back of the market is equally outstanding.  We'd actually been initially lured by the fact that the former owner of the market (Mr. Duong) now mans the char siew counter (while his son and daughter manage the daily operations of the market).  We ordered a pound of pork char siew and half a roast duck--the taciturn, cleaver-adept Mr. Duong even threw in extra sauce to go with the duck.  Both our deli orders were succulent and well-seasoned--a real hit. 

While Park to Shop down the street holds a wider selection of Asian household products, snacks, dry goods, and produce--not to mention that it's in the same shopping center as our favorite dim sum hangout Li Wah--and Asia Food Co. evinces the air of a half-renovated, half-stocked work-in-progress, the latter is noteworthy for its excellent onsite Chinese barbecue and well-attended meat and seafood sections.  I'll definitely be returning for my general Asian grocery needs, even if it means traveling a little farther after dim sum runs!"}
{"text":"This place is a foodie dream! The aisles are filled with every conceivable type of sauce, noodle, vegetable, fruit, mushroom and steam bun! Everything is clean, the staff are very friendly if you need a little help. A must for any amateur cook!"}
{"text":"There are 2 parking lots, the one right off of Superior actually takes you to the service loading dock for the grocery (and a sign that says not to enter...but if you go quickly no one will notice). And you'll be right at the restaurant section! Otherwise you have to go out to the sidewalk to enter another parking lot and enter the shopping complex through the main entrance. 

Awesome selection and a had a fun time walking around here for the first time. We found fake beef and chicken (or maybe it was pork? we're not so sure.. its called \"vegan soy chunk\") and some canned vegetarian duck (I have yet to try that!) and a significant fake beef jerky section. The place has an entire aisle dedicated to ramen. Thank god some of the packages have english on them, so we were able to spot at least 1 vegetarian package. (the Maruchan \"oriental\" ramen that is in most grocery stores is not vegetarian), only \"Top Ramen\" brand oriental is vegetarian - which can be hard to find sometimes! They also carry canned and fresh jackfruit, which some vegan recipes call for. 

Some produce is by far cheaper here than even walmart (zuchinnis) but others are not (avocados).

And while the place was packed, it was because we came the weekend of the Chinese New Year celebration, so will have to go again to get a sense of what the checkout lines are like on a normal day."}
{"text":"I can't believe I use to go to Tink Holl when this place was open. Probably the best Asian grocery store in Cleveland with a very cheap vegetables and very well kept meat and fish. They have a small bakery shop in the back too! I still follow the rule of checking the expiration dates but this place is usually on top of that."}
{"text":"The new store is great. It also have a restaurant inside the store. Great food. The fresh baked pastries is one of the best in town. The roast duck is by far my personal favorite. Sometimes on weekend, they have freshly roasted that just came out. The new store is huge. I give only 4 out of 5 because there's certain items I have to get at other stores. Occasionally I will buy bulk cases of product for work. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with Asia Food Co.

Located inside the Asian Town Center, I stumbled upon this grocery store when I first moved to Cleveland. I was desperate for some fresh vegetables and my favorite seasonings. 

It's not super big or anything like that, but it's pretty cheap and the vegetables are quite fresh. I miss the gigantic asian store in Ann Arbor (and all the other Korean/Chinese/other stores), but Asia Food Co keeps me happy. The vegetables are fresh, I can find my sauces, and they have pretty much everything I need for my cooking.

I was hesitant to try the random bakery/bbq joint in the back of the store. I mean... you wouldn't think it would be good in the back of a grocery store, right? My dad spoke to one of the ladies and got them to make my fave loh mai chi....and omg, it was good. It beat the ones I tried in some bakery in NYC. We tried the duck as well.....and it was good! Not amazing, but pretty good for when I have a craving.

Yep, Asia Food Co has all my needs and more. Still wish there was more variety...but for the price and the essentials, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I had some of their roasted pork and lemongrass roasted chicken legs today.  That was astounding.  The pork was amazing in my homemade fried rice-- rich, juicy and perfect!!!"}
{"text":"There are three different Asian groceries that I frequent in the same area: This (the Asia Food Co), the Park and Shop, and then the one further down Payne that may or may not even have a store name in English. 

Each has its strengths and weaknesses. The thing is, if I'm going to one, I'm going to them all. My KM (Korean Mom) insists on going to all three to price compare things like egg roll wrappers, Napa cabbage, rice flour, etc.  

Sometimes, we'll be at the Park and Shop, having already been to the other two stores, when KM learns that the Asia Food Co has the egg roll wrappers she needs for like 4 cents less a package....so guess who's heading back to the Asia Plaza to save the two or three bucks on an insane amount of egg roll wrappers?

Whenever KM buys in bulk (and she always buys in bulk), she \"negotiates\" a 10% discount on her order. The negotiation goes something like: \"Hey! You give me 10% on wrapper for full case!\"  The stockroom worker who brings out the dolly / forklift of product sometimes has to flag somebody down to okay the discount. In that time, KM decides that s(he) must not have understood the language, and s(he) has retreated in shame: \"Should really speakeeee Englishhhhh, working with 'merican!!!! Look at me! I come from Korea, no school, nothing! And I speakeee ENGLISHHHHHH!\"  

But I digress... I love my mom.

Overall, I have to say that, when I'm doing my own shopping, I prefer this store to the other two. It seems to have more of the specific products I like (like the melon ice cream bars - holy yum!) and is well-stocked and organized. Also, one of my favorite restaurants, Miega, is right upstairs."}
